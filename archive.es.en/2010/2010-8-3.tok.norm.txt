but activists say living conditions will only really be improved if people have a say in their future . two years after the devastating earthquake shook the western chinese province of sichuan , the streets are still piled up with wood and rubble .
wang wei * runs a private research institute that is specialized in sustainable development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least 68,000 people were killed when an earthquake hit sichuan may 13 2008 although wang admits that the state has been effective in combating poverty , he says that there has to be more participation from the people .
his idea is to set up microcredit for rural communities so that " we can reach many goals at the same time – starting with the fight against poverty .
the loans and payments support local economic activity .
the government accepts this .
then the community can develop because it has new skills . " wang has a pilot project in a small village where the locals have taken out a loan to plant bamboo .
they have created a small cooperative and taken courses so that they can increase their income by a fifth over the next few years . " we ’ ve come a long way , " mr li , the proud community leader says .
" the cadres are respecting us more and more and giving us more support .
they come from other areas to learn from us .
we ’ re becoming better known .
this has a positive effect .
more and more people who are interested are coming to visit us .
the economy is developing on its own . " villagers not convinced by government plans wang hopes to transpose his ideas to another village a few kilometers away , where the inhabitants are not entirely convinced by government plans to relocate them .
mrs zhu , who lost her home to the earthquake , now lives in a government-built house , which has running water and an inside toilet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new government-built houses to replace those destroyed in 2008 but she is worried about the future : " i don ’ t know what life will be like here later .
we have to pay for everything here .
every month , we have to pay for electricity and water and gas .
it ’ s all going to be unitized later .
who knows what ’ s going to come ? " although the old houses were drafty and not entirely rainproof , at least the inhabitants could keep their animals in them , she adds .
but now the farmers have to walk for over an hour to reach their fields .
the authorities want the relocated young people to work in the local factories , however some refuse to change their lifestyles . taking the future into their own hands although many of the farmers in the village are skeptical of collective organizations , since they remember the forced collectivization of the mao era that triggered a famine , wang manages to convince them that small cooperatives can help them take decisions that are of benefit to the community as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some farmers have put their hopes in new technologies and seeds he promises them that they will have the final say and will not be forced to plant anything they do not want to . the farmers seem happy to give it a try and take the future into their own hands . author : kristin kupfer / act editor : thomas baerthlein * all the names in this report have been changed send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the international community 's efforts to reach binding agreement on tackling climate change have all failed .
when the kyoto protocol ran out in 2010 , it was never replaced .
the demands of the emerging nations were too great , as was the industrialized nations ' refusal to compromise .
the world 's main climate offenders were unwilling to foot the bill for repairing the damage to the planet , nor would they commit to any long-term reduction of carbon emissions . drastic spike in global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many regions will suffer from acute water shortages the results are palpable .
in 2009 , the co2 global average concentration in the earth 's atmosphere was about 0.0387 percent by volume , or 387 parts per million by volume -lrb- ppmv -rrb- .
by 2050 , it has reached 675 ppmv .
global warming has gathered pace even faster than was predicted in the early 21st century .
the average temperature is now four degrees higher than it during the beginning of the industrialization , and researchers expect a further rise of 4 to 5 degrees by the end of the century .
but levels of global warming vary dramatically from region to region : parts of europe have actually witnessed a drop in average temperatures due to the weakening of the gulf stream .
in stark contrast , the arctic and the north pole have experienced a record rise in temperatures of almost 8 degrees .
but increased carbon levels in the atmosphere are not the only reason for the galloping pace of global warming .
while it has triggered some processes which speeded up further warming , other effects have mitigated it .
with the balance between these positive and negative feedbacks serving as a major cause of uncertainty in climate predictions , scientists were unable to forecast these ‘ feedback effects . '
the thawing of permafrost in northern russia and canada , for example , accelerated global warming because methane was released in the process - a relatively potent greenhouse gas with 20 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide .
bildunterschrift : cities will be hard hit by natural disasters such as floods extreme weather the greenhouse effect has not only transformed siberia and northern canada into wastelands ; it has also led to disastrous weather extremes .
by 2050 , the frequency of typhoons and storm floods has increased in tropical countries .
the islands of the philippines are beset by strong coastal storms .
heavy rainfall regularly leads to landslides , which have already claimed entire villages . moreover , despite the heavy rainfall , the country is suffering from an acute shortage of freshwater : seawater had filtered into the country 's subterranean freshwater reserves and made it undrinkable .
another consequence is that it has increased salinity levels in soil . 200 million climate refugees the repercussions are severe .
viable farmland is urgently required to meet the needs of the world 's population , which has now reached 9 billion -lrb- compared to 6,7 billion in 2009 -rrb- .
200 million of them are climate refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : droughts will drastically raise the number of climate refugees in the world a percentage of them come from small atolls in the pacific ocean and the densely populated delta regions along the rivers ganges , mekong , nile and brahmaputra , which flooded as a result of rising sea levels .
but the majority comes from central asia and africa .
these people are not fleeing flooded regions , but the droughts that have led to mass starvation in many parts of the world .
in africa alone , almost one quarter of the continent 's 1.8 billion inhabitants are affected by water shortages .
mass migration present countries with new sets of problems : india in particular has been overwhelmed by waves of refugees from neighboring bangladesh .
india 's population now numbers 1.9 billion and its government is unable to provide sufficient food and medication for the refugees living in camps on the indian border .
despite united nations support , the spread of diseases such as cholera can not be stemmed , and are soon proliferating even outside the refugee camps . but the effects of climate change are not all negative .
by and large , northern europe has been spared extreme weather , and scandinavian countries are enjoying milder climates than they used to .
northern scandinavia in particular is home to large areas of land that can be used for agriculture . the collapse of ecosystems but many ecosystems have collapsed .
vulnerable coral reefs and mangrove woods have been destroyed by rising sea temperatures and levels , and a large part of the amazon rainforest has been reduced to a steppe .
many plant and animal species have died out .
in 2050 , mankind has paid a high price for its own survival - more than it would have cost to curb climate change in the first decades of the 21st century .
today , in 2010 , experts agree that well-off states only need to give up a small fraction of their wealth to prevent the worst .

the police union wants to send police from turkey on patrol in problem neighborhoods in germany .
the goal is higher acceptance of german officers - but the idea is controversial . in front of a bridal store , a man and a woman sit on wooden chairs , drinking black tea from small glasses - an everyday scene in many towns in turkey .
but hatice koek 's bridal shop is located in germany , in the duisburg neighborhood of marxloh .
the 32-year-old koek has been selling wedding dresses here for years .
when she heard about the idea of using turkish police officers in north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is located , she was outraged .
it would be " a massive insult , to allow turkish police officers to patrol here , " koek said , not to mention destroying integration , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in berlin , a program trains young people of turkish origin as police officers the bridal shop is just one of many small businesses on wesel road operated by turkish immigrants .
restaurants , pharmacies , supermarkets , boutiques - all the businesses have turkish names .
visitors from turkey would feel right at home .
the residents , too , feel comfortable in their surroundings .
but do they really need turkish police ?
a turkish barber also rejected the idea .
" i would laugh if i saw a police officer here in a turkish uniform , " said a young man who was having his hair cut .
if someone has no respect for the german police , he wo n't take a turkish policeman seriously either , he said .
lack of respect but the head of the german police union in north rhine-westphalia is hoping for just that : erich rettinghaus wants to send turkish policemen on patrol with their german colleagues .
his goal is to find why young people of turkish origin often , in his opinion , have no respect for the police , and whether they would respond differently to turkish policemen .
according to rettinghaus ' plan , turkish officers would be deployed in immigrant-heavy districts such as marxloh in duisburg and ehrenfeld in cologne and given language support by turkish-speaking policemen and -women or interpreters . rettinghaus does n't see his suggestion as a declaration of helplessness .
rather , it 's more like an exchange , such as the ones with dutch police on the border to the netherlands .
" during peak holiday times , german police are dispatched to places where many german tourists go .
for example , in -lsb- the popular dutch resort town -rsb- renesse , there are german police to break up brawls in nightclubs and pubs , " says rettinghaus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many citizens with turkish background are skeptical of importing police officers but the presumed foreigners who live in marxloh and ehrenfeld are not tourists .
most of them were born in germany and are part of german society .
the lack of acceptance of german police goes both ways , said a group of young people in front of a video arcade .
the boys often feel they are treated badly .
" in fights between migrants , for example , the german police only show up after everything is over , " complained a 19-year-old .
another says : " if a german is caught cycling in the wrong bike lane , the policeman says simply : ' continue on . '
but a turk would be given a ticket right away . " ' guest officers ' with no authority these descriptions go against what rettinghaus says are police officers ' experiences on the beat : young people frequently try to prevent an arrest by attacking the patrol car and attempting to free the arrestee .
in such situations the turkish " guest police " could intervene by arbitrating , rettinghaus says .
however , the turkish police officers would have no legal powers and would not carry weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police sometimes collaborate with foreign police to patrol border areas although many marxloh residents are skeptical of the idea , some do believe that the deployment of turkish police officers would help to bridge the differences in attitude .
an older couple in a supermarket posits that the turkish uniforms would make a great impression on young people .
in one of the many traditional teahouses in marxloh , men are playing cards and backgammon .
a 32-year-old says he finds the idea of turkish police in germany absurd .
the state should educate young immigrants to join the police force instead , he argues .
he himself would be ready to give up his well-paid job , but he does n't have the necessary high school diploma to become an officer .
instead of getting policemen from turkey , who know neither the country nor the language , the state ought to approach people like him and recruit them , the outraged man said .
currently only one in seven of police trainees in north rhine-westphalia comes from an immigrant family .
rettinghaus would like to see more police officers with immigrant background .
working with turkish police , he says , is not an alternative , but a supplementary measure .
so far , however , there have been no talks with the turkish authorities .
whether his idea can be realized at all is still up in the air , admits rettinghaus .
the state interior ministry 's reaction has been " restrained , so far . "
but the state government has is new in office .
and the interior minister has many issues to tend to at the moment .
rettinghaus hopes that his proposal will get its turn soon .

it would be the result of the world 's failure to act on time , despite seeing the writing on the wall . in 2050 , young people with average incomes in germany will grow up listening to their grandparents ' tales of holidays in venice .
they themselves are unlikely ever to go on a more adventurous vacation than a cycle tour along the river elbe - so long as it has n't burst its banks .
with a barrel of oil costing over $ 600 -lrb- 453 euros -rrb- , anything else has become prohibitively expensive .
private cars and non-essential flights are a luxury that few can now afford .
welcome to the future .
the international community 's efforts to reach binding agreement on tackling climate change have all failed .
when the kyoto protocol ran out in 2010 , it was never replaced .
the demands of the emerging nations were too great , as was the industrialized nations ' refusal to compromise .
the world 's main climate offenders were unwilling to foot the bill for repairing the damage to the planet , nor would they commit to any long-term reduction of carbon emissions . drastic spike in global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many regions will suffer from acute water shortages the results are palpable .
in 2009 , the co2 global average concentration in the earth 's atmosphere was about 0.0387 percent by volume , or 387 parts per million by volume -lrb- ppmv -rrb- .
by 2050 , it has reached 675 ppmv .
global warming has gathered pace even faster than was predicted in the early 21st century .
the average temperature is now four degrees higher than it during the beginning of the industrialization , and researchers expect a further rise of 4 to 5 degrees by the end of the century .
but levels of global warming vary dramatically from region to region : parts of europe have actually witnessed a drop in average temperatures due to the weakening of the gulf stream .
in stark contrast , the arctic and the north pole have experienced a record rise in temperatures of almost 8 degrees .
but increased carbon levels in the atmosphere are not the only reason for the galloping pace of global warming .
while it has triggered some processes which speeded up further warming , other effects have mitigated it .
with the balance between these positive and negative feedbacks serving as a major cause of uncertainty in climate predictions , scientists were unable to forecast these ‘ feedback effects . '

but activists say living conditions will only really be improved if people have a say in their future . two years after the devastating earthquake shook the western chinese province of sichuan , the streets are still piled up with wood and rubble .
wang wei * runs a private research institute that is specialized in sustainable development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least 68,000 people were killed when an earthquake hit sichuan may 13 2008 although wang admits that the state has been effective in combating poverty , he says that there has to be more participation from the people .
his idea is to set up microcredit for rural communities so that " we can reach many goals at the same time – starting with the fight against poverty .
the loans and payments support local economic activity .
the government accepts this .
then the community can develop because it has new skills . " wang has a pilot project in a small village where the locals have taken out a loan to plant bamboo .
they have created a small cooperative and taken courses so that they can increase their income by a fifth over the next few years . " we ’ ve come a long way , " mr li , the proud community leader says .
" the cadres are respecting us more and more and giving us more support .
they come from other areas to learn from us .
we ’ re becoming better known .
this has a positive effect .
more and more people who are interested are coming to visit us .
the economy is developing on its own . " villagers not convinced by government plans wang hopes to transpose his ideas to another village a few kilometers away , where the inhabitants are not entirely convinced by government plans to relocate them .
mrs zhu , who lost her home to the earthquake , now lives in a government-built house , which has running water and an inside toilet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new government-built houses to replace those destroyed in 2008 but she is worried about the future : " i don ’ t know what life will be like here later .
we have to pay for everything here .
every month , we have to pay for electricity and water and gas .
it ’ s all going to be unitized later .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 03.08.2010 constitutional court split over role of armed forces in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court is split over the use of the military in germany germany 's constitutional court is reportedly divided over whether to allow the country 's military , the bundeswehr , to use all means at its disposal in the case of a high-level domestic security threat . germany 's constitutional court is reportedly split over the role of the country 's armed forces within german borders .
one half of the court , the first senate , says the bundeswehr should not be allowed to act offensively inside germany .
it says the constitution does n't allow it . but according to reports in the daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung , the second senate is reportedly pushing for an expanded domestic role for the armed forces .
the paper reports the second senate wants the bundeswehr to be able to use its full force in the case of an especially threatening domestic security situation . hesitation over granting the bundeswehr more powers inside germany is linked to memories of the military 's domestic role under the nazis , says heinz schulte , a policy , defense and security analyst in berlin . schulte told deutsche welle that , despite these fears , the bundeswehr would be crucial in protecting germany if it came under terrorist attack . " it seems to me that in the case of a very serious threat , an asymmetrical threat , there will be no alternative but to use the bundeswehr inside germany , " schulte says .
" the current scenario is that the bundeswehr can assist the german civil authorities , particularly the police , in the case of natural emergencies , like floods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr would be called on to intercept hijacked planes " but what we 're talking about is a different scenario .
what happens if there 's a terrorist threat on a major scale in germany ?
will the police be able to guard all the airports and ports and crucial infrastructure points in germany ?
the answer is , no , they will not be able to . " controversial act much of the debate has centered on the 2005 aviation security act , which sought to allow the bundeswehr to pre-emptively shoot down hijacked commercial airliners . it was ruled , however , that shooting down any such plane would be a violation of the basic rights of the passengers and crew onboard .
as it stands , the bundeswehr is only allowed to deploy fighters to try alter the course of any hijacked planes . at the time , the christian democrat deputy parliamentary floor leader , wolfgang bosbach , argued strongly for an amendment to the constitution to grant the bundeswehr more operational maneuverability . " a country 's security must be defined differently today than during the time of the cold war , especially since internal and external security can no longer be so strictly divided , " bosbach told the netzeitung online newspaper at the time . the chairman of the first senate of the constitutional court , ferdinand kirchhof , meanwhile , remains steadfast in his view that without an amendment to the german basic law - the country 's constitution - no " military means of warfare may be used " within the country 's borders under any circumstances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the act was passed following the attack on the world trade center the aviation security act led the constitutional court to ask more fundamentally what the role of the bundeswehr inside germany actually should be .
it ruled that the constitution did not allow the government to order the armed forces to use military weapons inside germany . revised role the second senate is reportedly not pushing for a revision of the ruling on the aviation security act , but rather wants to see a loosening of the restrictions on the bundeswehr 's use of weapons inside germany . the body reportedly wants the bundeswehr to be allowed to use any weapons at its disposal in the case of " particularly severe incidents . " heinz schulte says the bundeswehr would have no choice but to accept such responsibilities , despite already being overburdened by its international responsibilities , " particularly against the background that it is under enormous pressure with regard to ongoing operations like the anti-pirate operation atalanta , and of course afghanistan , and continued operations in the balkans . " if the first and second senates of the constitutional court are unable to find a solution to the legal confrontation , the matter could be put to a vote of both senates meeting together .
this would be only the fourth time in the court 's history that such a plenum would be held . author : darren mara editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for months , the german military establishment justified the attack as self-defence but more and more it seems as if the isaf forces in afghanistan specifically targeted taliban militants in kunduz .
the question , however , is whether german troops would have been justified to act offensively .

one half of the court , the first senate , says the bundeswehr should not be allowed to act offensively inside germany .
it says the constitution does n't allow it . but according to reports in the daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung , the second senate is reportedly pushing for an expanded domestic role for the armed forces .
the paper reports the second senate wants the bundeswehr to be able to use its full force in the case of an especially threatening domestic security situation . hesitation over granting the bundeswehr more powers inside germany is linked to memories of the military 's domestic role under the nazis , says heinz schulte , a policy , defense and security analyst in berlin . schulte told deutsche welle that , despite these fears , the bundeswehr would be crucial in protecting germany if it came under terrorist attack . " it seems to me that in the case of a very serious threat , an asymmetrical threat , there will be no alternative but to use the bundeswehr inside germany , " schulte says .
" the current scenario is that the bundeswehr can assist the german civil authorities , particularly the police , in the case of natural emergencies , like floods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr would be called on to intercept hijacked planes " but what we 're talking about is a different scenario .
what happens if there 's a terrorist threat on a major scale in germany ?
will the police be able to guard all the airports and ports and crucial infrastructure points in germany ?
the answer is , no , they will not be able to . " controversial act much of the debate has centered on the 2005 aviation security act , which sought to allow the bundeswehr to pre-emptively shoot down hijacked commercial airliners . it was ruled , however , that shooting down any such plane would be a violation of the basic rights of the passengers and crew onboard .
as it stands , the bundeswehr is only allowed to deploy fighters to try alter the course of any hijacked planes . at the time , the christian democrat deputy parliamentary floor leader , wolfgang bosbach , argued strongly for an amendment to the constitution to grant the bundeswehr more operational maneuverability . " a country 's security must be defined differently today than during the time of the cold war , especially since internal and external security can no longer be so strictly divided , " bosbach told the netzeitung online newspaper at the time . the chairman of the first senate of the constitutional court , ferdinand kirchhof , meanwhile , remains steadfast in his view that without an amendment to the german basic law - the country 's constitution - no " military means of warfare may be used " within the country 's borders under any circumstances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the act was passed following the attack on the world trade center the aviation security act led the constitutional court to ask more fundamentally what the role of the bundeswehr inside germany actually should be .
it ruled that the constitution did not allow the government to order the armed forces to use military weapons inside germany . revised role the second senate is reportedly not pushing for a revision of the ruling on the aviation security act , but rather wants to see a loosening of the restrictions on the bundeswehr 's use of weapons inside germany . the body reportedly wants the bundeswehr to be allowed to use any weapons at its disposal in the case of " particularly severe incidents . " heinz schulte says the bundeswehr would have no choice but to accept such responsibilities , despite already being overburdened by its international responsibilities , " particularly against the background that it is under enormous pressure with regard to ongoing operations like the anti-pirate operation atalanta , and of course afghanistan , and continued operations in the balkans . " if the first and second senates of the constitutional court are unable to find a solution to the legal confrontation , the matter could be put to a vote of both senates meeting together .
this would be only the fourth time in the court 's history that such a plenum would be held . author : darren mara editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one half of the court , the first senate , says the bundeswehr should not be allowed to act offensively inside germany .
it says the constitution does n't allow it . but according to reports in the daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung , the second senate is reportedly pushing for an expanded domestic role for the armed forces .
the paper reports the second senate wants the bundeswehr to be able to use its full force in the case of an especially threatening domestic security situation . hesitation over granting the bundeswehr more powers inside germany is linked to memories of the military 's domestic role under the nazis , says heinz schulte , a policy , defense and security analyst in berlin . schulte told deutsche welle that , despite these fears , the bundeswehr would be crucial in protecting germany if it came under terrorist attack . " it seems to me that in the case of a very serious threat , an asymmetrical threat , there will be no alternative but to use the bundeswehr inside germany , " schulte says .

the answer is , no , they will not be able to .

as it stands , the bundeswehr is only allowed to deploy fighters to try alter the course of any hijacked planes . at the time , the christian democrat deputy parliamentary floor leader , wolfgang bosbach , argued strongly for an amendment to the constitution to grant the bundeswehr more operational maneuverability .

the police union wants to send police from turkey on patrol in problem neighborhoods in germany .
the goal is higher acceptance of german officers - but the idea is controversial . in front of a bridal store , a man and a woman sit on wooden chairs , drinking black tea from small glasses - an everyday scene in many towns in turkey .
but hatice koek 's bridal shop is located in germany , in the duisburg neighborhood of marxloh .
the 32-year-old koek has been selling wedding dresses here for years .
when she heard about the idea of using turkish police officers in north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is located , she was outraged .
it would be " a massive insult , to allow turkish police officers to patrol here , " koek said , not to mention destroying integration , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in berlin , a program trains young people of turkish origin as police officers the bridal shop is just one of many small businesses on wesel road operated by turkish immigrants .
restaurants , pharmacies , supermarkets , boutiques - all the businesses have turkish names .
visitors from turkey would feel right at home .
the residents , too , feel comfortable in their surroundings .
but do they really need turkish police ?
a turkish barber also rejected the idea .
" i would laugh if i saw a police officer here in a turkish uniform , " said a young man who was having his hair cut .
if someone has no respect for the german police , he wo n't take a turkish policeman seriously either , he said .
lack of respect but the head of the german police union in north rhine-westphalia is hoping for just that : erich rettinghaus wants to send turkish policemen on patrol with their german colleagues .
his goal is to find why young people of turkish origin often , in his opinion , have no respect for the police , and whether they would respond differently to turkish policemen .
according to rettinghaus ' plan , turkish officers would be deployed in immigrant-heavy districts such as marxloh in duisburg and ehrenfeld in cologne and given language support by turkish-speaking policemen and -women or interpreters . rettinghaus does n't see his suggestion as a declaration of helplessness .
rather , it 's more like an exchange , such as the ones with dutch police on the border to the netherlands .
" during peak holiday times , german police are dispatched to places where many german tourists go .
for example , in -lsb- the popular dutch resort town -rsb- renesse , there are german police to break up brawls in nightclubs and pubs , " says rettinghaus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many citizens with turkish background are skeptical of importing police officers but the presumed foreigners who live in marxloh and ehrenfeld are not tourists .
most of them were born in germany and are part of german society .
the lack of acceptance of german police goes both ways , said a group of young people in front of a video arcade .
the boys often feel they are treated badly .
" in fights between migrants , for example , the german police only show up after everything is over , " complained a 19-year-old .
another says : " if a german is caught cycling in the wrong bike lane , the policeman says simply : ' continue on . '
but a turk would be given a ticket right away . " ' guest officers ' with no authority these descriptions go against what rettinghaus says are police officers ' experiences on the beat : young people frequently try to prevent an arrest by attacking the patrol car and attempting to free the arrestee .
in such situations the turkish " guest police " could intervene by arbitrating , rettinghaus says .
however , the turkish police officers would have no legal powers and would not carry weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police sometimes collaborate with foreign police to patrol border areas although many marxloh residents are skeptical of the idea , some do believe that the deployment of turkish police officers would help to bridge the differences in attitude .
an older couple in a supermarket posits that the turkish uniforms would make a great impression on young people .
in one of the many traditional teahouses in marxloh , men are playing cards and backgammon .
a 32-year-old says he finds the idea of turkish police in germany absurd .
the state should educate young immigrants to join the police force instead , he argues .
he himself would be ready to give up his well-paid job , but he does n't have the necessary high school diploma to become an officer .
instead of getting policemen from turkey , who know neither the country nor the language , the state ought to approach people like him and recruit them , the outraged man said .
currently only one in seven of police trainees in north rhine-westphalia comes from an immigrant family .
rettinghaus would like to see more police officers with immigrant background .
working with turkish police , he says , is not an alternative , but a supplementary measure .
so far , however , there have been no talks with the turkish authorities .
whether his idea can be realized at all is still up in the air , admits rettinghaus .
the state interior ministry 's reaction has been " restrained , so far . "
but the state government has is new in office .
and the interior minister has many issues to tend to at the moment .
rettinghaus hopes that his proposal will get its turn soon .

most people will have heard of desertec , the initiative to construct large-scale solar and wind power plants in the north african desert .
not so the mediterranean solar plan , which at the moment is familiar only to industry insiders .
yet both initiatives are ambitiously pursuing similar goals .
the mediterranean solar plan aims to create 20 gigawatts ' worth of new renewable energy sources by 2020 – the equivalent of around 15 coal-fired power plants – whereas desertec has set itself the long-term goal of supplying 15 per cent of europe 's electricity by 2050 from its solar and wind power plants .
mediterranean management stalled early on but desertec making progress in december 2008 efforts to set up the ufm stalled due to the outbreak of the gaza war .
high-level ministerial meetings of member states being postponed and important decisions on the ufm 's structure being put on hold .
only now is the union taking the first steps to set up a secretariat in barcelona : a group of staff and experts from member states who will , among other things , help shape and implement the mediterranean solar plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the desertec industry initiative will provide 15 per cent of europe 's electricity by 2050 the desertec industry initiative -lrb- di -rrb- is developing at a much greater pace .
founded by 13 partners , most of them german , the consortium now has 17 partners from seven countries .
negotiations for tunisian and italian companies to join the consortium are advanced , and up to six further additions to the consortium are expected .
another 22 firms support dii as associated partners .
by expanding to include companies from the mena region , dii is also fulfilling demands that those countries in which power plants are to be built be involved from the outset .
two energy projects , one priority region given that access to energy is a cornerstone of the united nations ' millennium development goals , development of the mena region must take priority in both projects .
enormous population growth and increasing industrialization have left african countries with a great deal of catching up to do when it comes to energy projects .
industrialized nations are facing the challenges posed by climate change , which means prioritizing investment in renewable and efficient energy technologies – and the same must go for developing countries and emerging economies .
against this backdrop , the question arises of why fossil power plants are still being built in both industrialized and developing countries .
there are technical reasons for this : renewable energy sources like wind power and photovoltaics will not be able to serve as base-load energies until ‘ intelligent ' electricity grids and storage capacities become available .
what 's more , the cost of investing in renewables is still higher than that of investing in fossil fuel-fired power plants – although costs for fuels in these plants , like coal or natural gas , recur throughout the plants ' operation .
bildunterschrift : morocco " appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables " in the mena region what renewables and large-scale projects like the dii need are a clear legal , administrative and above all economic frameworks .
only then will the high investment costs pay off later .
the conditions must apply in those countries in which the power plants are to be constructed as well as to legislation in the european union and in eu member states that plan to import electricity from africa .
encouraging use of renewables in eu , germany and beyond the 2009 “ eu directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources ” already set the framework for energy projects with non-eu countries as well as for importing electricity generated .
in germany 's case , this means that the question of whether the renewable energy sources act will be extended to include a feed-in tariff for ‘ desert electricity ' is a critical one .
of all the countries in the mena region , morocco appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables .
the country currently imports 95 per cent of its energy requirements , but wants to increase its reliance on renewables to 40 per cent of total energy use by 2020 .
this is another reason that the dii consortium regards morocco as an ideal partner country and is planning to begin work on installing a first power plant park there – one it hopes will prove that the vision of generating electricity in the desert can be realized .
clear regulatory frameworks needed , not intergovernmental entrepreneurialism so , where do the two initiatives – the mediterranean solar plan and dii – now stand , one and two years respectively after they were founded and what priorities should they set for the future ?
the mediterranean solar plan is a political process and should be regarded as such .
it is not the task of an intergovernmental process to take on entrepreneurial initiatives and install power plants – especially when it takes two years to set up a secretariat .
the plan 's focus should , therefore , be on speeding up the process of creating the regulatory framework that will enable private-sector initiatives and investments in the ufm 's member countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser works with the german development institute the countries in the mena region still do not have enough financial clout to independently shoulder such cost-intensive cross-border infrastructure projects .
but the launch of the dii has already led some mena countries to re-shape their regulatory frameworks and set new goals in regard to expanding their renewables capacities .
this will not only make them more attractive to investors from industrialized countries but also for financial institutions such as , for example , the african development bank , the world bank and the european investment bank .
in that respect desertec and the mediterranean solar plan are parallel processes that should complement and cross-fertilize each other .

it would be the result of the world 's failure to act on time , despite seeing the writing on the wall . in 2050 , young people with average incomes in germany will grow up listening to their grandparents ' tales of holidays in venice .
they themselves are unlikely ever to go on a more adventurous vacation than a cycle tour along the river elbe - so long as it has n't burst its banks .
with a barrel of oil costing over $ 600 -lrb- 453 euros -rrb- , anything else has become prohibitively expensive .
private cars and non-essential flights are a luxury that few can now afford .
welcome to the future .
the international community 's efforts to reach binding agreement on tackling climate change have all failed .
when the kyoto protocol ran out in 2010 , it was never replaced .
the demands of the emerging nations were too great , as was the industrialized nations ' refusal to compromise .
the world 's main climate offenders were unwilling to foot the bill for repairing the damage to the planet , nor would they commit to any long-term reduction of carbon emissions . drastic spike in global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many regions will suffer from acute water shortages the results are palpable .
in 2009 , the co2 global average concentration in the earth 's atmosphere was about 0.0387 percent by volume , or 387 parts per million by volume -lrb- ppmv -rrb- .
by 2050 , it has reached 675 ppmv .
global warming has gathered pace even faster than was predicted in the early 21st century .
the average temperature is now four degrees higher than it during the beginning of the industrialization , and researchers expect a further rise of 4 to 5 degrees by the end of the century .
but levels of global warming vary dramatically from region to region : parts of europe have actually witnessed a drop in average temperatures due to the weakening of the gulf stream .
in stark contrast , the arctic and the north pole have experienced a record rise in temperatures of almost 8 degrees .
but increased carbon levels in the atmosphere are not the only reason for the galloping pace of global warming .
while it has triggered some processes which speeded up further warming , other effects have mitigated it .
with the balance between these positive and negative feedbacks serving as a major cause of uncertainty in climate predictions , scientists were unable to forecast these ‘ feedback effects . '
the thawing of permafrost in northern russia and canada , for example , accelerated global warming because methane was released in the process - a relatively potent greenhouse gas with 20 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide .
bildunterschrift : cities will be hard hit by natural disasters such as floods extreme weather the greenhouse effect has not only transformed siberia and northern canada into wastelands ; it has also led to disastrous weather extremes .
by 2050 , the frequency of typhoons and storm floods has increased in tropical countries .
the islands of the philippines are beset by strong coastal storms .
heavy rainfall regularly leads to landslides , which have already claimed entire villages . moreover , despite the heavy rainfall , the country is suffering from an acute shortage of freshwater : seawater had filtered into the country 's subterranean freshwater reserves and made it undrinkable .
another consequence is that it has increased salinity levels in soil . 200 million climate refugees the repercussions are severe .
viable farmland is urgently required to meet the needs of the world 's population , which has now reached 9 billion -lrb- compared to 6,7 billion in 2009 -rrb- .
200 million of them are climate refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : droughts will drastically raise the number of climate refugees in the world a percentage of them come from small atolls in the pacific ocean and the densely populated delta regions along the rivers ganges , mekong , nile and brahmaputra , which flooded as a result of rising sea levels .
but the majority comes from central asia and africa .
these people are not fleeing flooded regions , but the droughts that have led to mass starvation in many parts of the world .
in africa alone , almost one quarter of the continent 's 1.8 billion inhabitants are affected by water shortages .
mass migration present countries with new sets of problems : india in particular has been overwhelmed by waves of refugees from neighboring bangladesh .
india 's population now numbers 1.9 billion and its government is unable to provide sufficient food and medication for the refugees living in camps on the indian border .
despite united nations support , the spread of diseases such as cholera can not be stemmed , and are soon proliferating even outside the refugee camps . but the effects of climate change are not all negative .
by and large , northern europe has been spared extreme weather , and scandinavian countries are enjoying milder climates than they used to .
northern scandinavia in particular is home to large areas of land that can be used for agriculture . the collapse of ecosystems but many ecosystems have collapsed .
vulnerable coral reefs and mangrove woods have been destroyed by rising sea temperatures and levels , and a large part of the amazon rainforest has been reduced to a steppe .
many plant and animal species have died out .
in 2050 , mankind has paid a high price for its own survival - more than it would have cost to curb climate change in the first decades of the 21st century .
today , in 2010 , experts agree that well-off states only need to give up a small fraction of their wealth to prevent the worst .

despite the slump in europe 's market - and summer coming to an end - analysts predict bmw can keep up the good work . german car exporters have seen a significant rise in overseas sales with munich 's luxury automaker bmw leading the pack , according to figures released tuesday .
the association of german automakers -lrb- vda -rrb- said tuesday that german automakers exported 312,400 cars in july , clinching a 6 percent increase over the same month in 2009 .
for the first seven months of 2010 , total car exports were up 39 percent to nearly 2.5 million automobiles .
bmw placed itself solidly ahead of audi and mercedes , with a sevenfold year-on-year profit increase .
the company posted a second quarter net profit of 834 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- , compared with 121 million euros for the same period in 2009 .
in the united states alone , the group 's july sales hit 21,253 automobiles , increasing bmw 's us sales by 10.1 percent over last july .
bmw 's results shattered the predictions of a dow jones newswires poll , which had forecast profits of 674 million euros .
meanwhile , daimler , which owns mercedes benz , has raised its core earnings predictions to six billion euros for 2010 .
europe 's biggest car maker and audi parent group , volkswagen , plans to sell a record 6.3 million vehicles .
bmw claims improved construction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new 5 series is expected to keep sales rolling meanwhile , friedrich eichiner , bmw 's chief financial officer , credited the company 's success to improved construction .
the introduction of a new modular construction system , bmw ceo norbert reithofer said , would also increase bmw 's profits with every new model to come .
the luxury automaker produced cars in 2010 that were more expensive than any models it had produced since november 2007 , and dz bank 's auto expert , jaski terzic , predicted that the automaker 's new 5 series and its countryman mini-suvs would promise high profits for the second two quarters as well .
a falling euro equals rising sales in recent months , european automakers have benefited from the euro 's fall in value against the dollar , according to automotive professor willi dietz from germany 's ifa automotive economic institute .
the tumbling euro " greatly improves their situation in most of the asian and north american markets , " dietz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 03.08.2010 syria-saudi pact promises peace but lebanon remains on tenterhooks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more than peace at stake for abdullah and assad the visit by syrian president bashar al-assad and saudi king abdullah to lebanon has been hailed as a significant step at easing the simmering tensions in the country .
some experts , however , are far from convinced . with reports of clashes between lebanese and israeli forces , fears of a renewed conflict in lebanon have been growing ever since hassan nasrallah , the leader of the shiite militant group hezbollah , claimed members of his party were on the verge of being indicted by a un tribunal probing the 2005 murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri .
the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- is investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result .
however , relations have been slowly normalizing , as indicated by president assad 's visit to lebanon recently - his first since hariri 's assassination .
while that in itself could be seen as a breakthrough , assad 's accompanying of king abdullah - a close supporter of the sunni muslim hariri family - has been hailed as being even more significant .
syria and saudi arabia have been on opposing sides in many of the complicated feuds in the middle east , including that over influence in lebanon , for decades .
regional rivals the closest of enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah paralyzed beirut with strikes and unrest in 2008 some observers have welcomed the visit as an attempt to defuse a situation which could potentially lead to a conflict similar to that in may 2008 , when 100 people were killed in clashes that erupted when the government announced - and then repealed - a crackdown on hezbollah .
others , however , believe assad and abdullah 's mission could have wider , more damaging implications not only to lebanon 's stability but to the stability of the region as a whole .
" the hariri family and hezbollah , and their supporters , have been enemies for five or six years now which reflects the wider divisions in the middle east , " nadim shehadi , a lebanon expert with the middle east programme at chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" this situation has been akin to the cold war with the repercussions playing out everywhere from palestine to iraq . "
" the most important recent development was seen at last year 's arab league summit in doha where gaza was the main topic , " he added .
" the saudis were there , egypt , jordan … but the whole radical front boycotted the meeting .
there was no hamas , no hezbollah , no iran and no syria . "
" saudi arabia and egypt were forced to look into the abyss and they saw that their power as interlocutors and mediators was under threat .
any deal in the region could be aborted by the radicals .
it meant that more say had to be given to others for any progress to be made . "
saudi arabia seen as giving syria its backing to return to beirut some analysts see king abdullah 's joint visit to lebanon with assad as the next step in a transfer of power and an indication that , instead of opposing a return to syrian domination of lebanon , saudi arabia is giving it its blessing .
the visit is seen by some as a clear message that syria , along with iran - another major backer of hezbollah , still holds sway in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad has met with prime minister saad hariri , rafiq 's son " bringing assad to lebanon on the saudi royal plane is a very big blessing indeed , " paul salem , the director of the carnegie endowment for international peace 's beirut bureau , told deutsche welle . " but saudi arabia brought assad to lebanon to help in a peace process not to give him carte blanche to do what he likes .
he was effectively brought in to stop his friends in hezbollah attacking the government .
this is a clear sign that it wo n't just be syria which is the go-to country for any lebanon crisis , but saudi arabia too .
the saudis need to be involved to protect their friends in the sunni community . " any resurgence of syrian influence in lebanon , however , could further complicate matters in regard to the stl 's findings and any indictment of hezbollah members in hariri 's murder .
both syria and hezbollah have an interest in bringing the tribunal to an end and have a number of devices at hand to potentially force this outcome .
while pressuring saudi arabia to use its relationship with the united states to postpone any indictment of hezbollah members , the saudis can not make the tribunal go away on their own .
syria and hezbollah would have to do their part . " when the lebanese government was preparing to call for a tribunal , hezbollah and the syria-affiliated parties in the government pulled out and closed down the parliament , " shehadi said . " hezbollah then took over the city and paralyzed the institutions , shutting down the government 's power to call its own tribunal .
so the pro-tribunal parties had to call on the un to form the tribunal , which was an unprecedented step .
it effectively forced the tribunal on lebanon and interfered in the running of a sovereign state . " " if the tribunal rules that syria and hezbollah was behind the hariri assassination , then there is a great chance that we will see violence in beirut .
what could precede that is an attempt by syria and hezbollah to either paralyze the lebanese government or change it .
in both cases , a new government under anti-tribunal control can call for the investigation to be called off , saying that the two sides have reconciled and there is no need for it to continue .
the un will have to agree to this unless it can be proved that the country has been hijacked . " hezbollah committed to changing beirut 's position paul salem believes that hezbollah will continue to push for the tribunal to be ended as long as it assumes that there is a political aspect to the tribunal 's process which is aimed at punishing its members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah is prepared to do all it can to influence policy " it 's obvious that syria and hezbollah wants the tribunal to go away and they have been doing their best by discrediting it publically and claiming that it is politicized , " salem said .
" they won ’ t be able to stop the tribunal as such but they could pressure the government to change its position through the threat of violence or by taking over beirut , which could lead to a statement of no-confidence in the tribunal or a withdrawal of support from the government . " " this could lead to a situation where the tribunal has no lebanese support which would mean arrest warrants could not be issued in lebanon or arrests made .
it could pass a guilty verdict on hezbollah and / or syria but little would change . " peace pact appears to hinge on tribunal ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese president sleiman , right , could tow the line for peace in the communique issued after the mini-summit between assad , abdullah and lebanese president michel sleiman , all of lebanon 's political parties were urged to " pursue the path of appeasement and dialogue and to boost national unity in the face of outside threats . "
the leaders stressed " the importance of stability ... the commitment -lrb- of the lebanese -rrb- not to resort to violence and the need to place the country 's interests above all sectarian interests , " the communique read .
avoiding a return to violence between hariri-supporting sunnis and the shiites of hezbollah in lebanon appears to be the main justification for the syrian-saudi agreement .
however , it appears that this pact between two of the main players from the opposing sides can only ensure peace by removing the tribunal problem , given that hezbollah has threatened to take whatever action it deems necessary should its members be indicted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biodiversity -pipe- 03.08.2010 regional ' roll call ' maps diversity of marine life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian and japanese waters are home to 33,000 species known to scientists a new set of geographic inventories released on monday catalogs marine species by region , providing a window into biodiversity in the world ’ s oceans and seas – and the largely man-made threats to rich marine ecosystems . researchers have published a series of papers that illustrate marine biodiversity in 25 key geographic areas around the globe – from the mediterranean sea to the gulf of mexico – providing a comprehensive " roll call " of marine life .
the species inventories released on monday conclude work by 360 scientists to integrate both new and prior knowledge , much of it from diverse , localized sources , as well as nations ' exclusive economic zones .
these efforts resulted in the first comprehensive lists of marine life in diverse regions .
" the most significant thing about them is that we actually have them – and we never did before , " said ron o 'dor , co-senior scientist for the census of marine life , or coml , which commissioned the project .
coml described the collection of biodiversity reports as a " prelude " to the main marine census findings on species distribution and abundance , scheduled for an october release in london .
over the past decade , more than 2,700 scientists have participated in the census of marine life .
according to a statement summarizing the reports , coml researchers expect the project 's estimate of all known marine species to surpass 230,000 specimens .
the final figure will also include species not yet listed in the ocean biogeographic information system , or obis – a permanent database featuring millions of records that aid both researchers and policymakers .
bildunterschrift : asteronyx loveni is one of several thousand species found in japan 's waters biodiversity in focus – and under threat the latest papers estimate that biodiversity levels are highest in the waters around japan and australia , where almost 33,000 species are known to scientists .
more than 22,000 species were reported in chinese waters .
preserving these diverse marine ecosystems , however , requires stringent regulations .
o 'dor said strict environmental protections are in place in australian waters , but policing the thousands of islands that comprise the philippines and indonesia is more challenging .
but the area has other vulnerabilities : " climate change , global warming is going to have a heavy impact in that region because it 's right on the equator , " he told deutsche welle .
though threats to biodiversity varied across regions , the biggest challenges to marine life overall are overfishing , pollution , loss of habitat and invasive species .
" most of the problems are associated with human influences , " o 'dor said , citing as examples the creation of anoxic " dead " zones in the gulf of mexico due to mississippi river runoff and mining and oil exploration .
yet overfishing is at the top of the threat list – with much of the impact concentrated within nations ' exclusive economic zones .
o 'dor recommended an approach to fisheries management based on entire ecosystems , not just individual species .
" you ca n't manage species in isolation , " he said .
but crafting an approach that incorporates tens of thousands of species in waters rich in biodiversity , like those around australia , is not easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea has seen its biodiversity change over time europe 's enclosed seas the mediterranean sea was among those regions with the " most threatened " biodiversity .
it was also the region most threatened by invasive species – with 600 aliens .
most of them originated in the red sea and arrived via the suez canal .
" the problem nowadays is the velocity of this phenomenon – now species are introduced by humans more intensively , " marta coll , lead author of the mediterranean sea regional synthesis , told deutsche welle .
coll nevertheless described the mediterranean as a hotspot of diverse marine life forms – with plenty still left to discover .
" for example , experts still debate how many species of fish inhabit the mediterranean sea , " she said .
meanwhile , the threats facing this region have diversified , with climate change among the main phenomena that stand to influence marine life .
in the baltic , another one of europe 's enclosed seas , biodiversity is also under pressure .
henn ojaveer , lead author of the forthcoming coml paper on the baltic sea , said the region has seen its biodiversity profile change over the past 40 to 50 years , and even today the situation is " completely heterogeneous . "
the number of different species counted in the baltic sea stood at about 6,000 .
" this is very likely an underestimation , but the best count we have currently , " ojaveer said .
all will be revealed on october 4 , the census of marine life plans to present a final count for new species discovered over the course of the decade-long project .
coml researchers would not release the number in advance , but did indicate that several thousand species were " new to science . "
" the sheer number that have been discovered so far , it 's amazing , " said bhavani e. narayanaswamy , project coordinator for the coml european implementation committee .
" but even more so is the fact that there remains even more to be discovered . "
identifying and describing new marine species is a long , arduous process – and coml 's statement on the reports labels current knowledge of biodiversity in all regions studied as " inadequate . "
yet the census marks the most comprehensive look at the world 's marine life so far , and the largest international collaboration ever between scientists in the field .
the european commission 's environment spokesman , joe hennon , said the commission was grateful for coml 's contribution , calling it " an international driving force in promoting a better knowledge of the seas . "
" we can not achieve the aims of the maritime policy – exploiting new resources sustainably or protecting the marine environment – if we do not know what resources are out there to protect , " hennon said . bildunterschrift : census scientists expect to announce the discovery of " several thousand " new species in october open ocean , endless possibilities the census results scheduled for release in october will take a broader view of the world 's marine environment .
this should yield more data on species in the open ocean beyond the continental shelf .
moreover , the data will be organized by " realm , ” from ice oceans to microbes .
coml research has also focused on both species identification and active geology in the deep sea .
maria baker , manager of one of the realm 's field projects known as " chess , " said scientists there have listed about 190 new species since work started in 2002 .
" every time we go down to new areas , you expect to find new species , " she said .
the project also led to the 2005 discovery of the first deep-sea vent south of the equator , as well as the northernmost and southernmost vents ever located .
just this year , researchers found the deepest known undersea volcanic rift in the cayman trough – at a depth of more than 5,000 meters .
but baker said reaching many deepwater regions is hindered by cost and accessibility issues , and more exploration must still be done : " we 're literally scraping the surface in some areas . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biodiversity -pipe- 03.08.2010 regional ' roll call ' maps diversity of marine life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian and japanese waters are home to 33,000 species known to scientists a new set of geographic inventories released on monday catalogs marine species by region , providing a window into biodiversity in the world ’ s oceans and seas – and the largely man-made threats to rich marine ecosystems . researchers have published a series of papers that illustrate marine biodiversity in 25 key geographic areas around the globe – from the mediterranean sea to the gulf of mexico – providing a comprehensive " roll call " of marine life .
the species inventories released on monday conclude work by 360 scientists to integrate both new and prior knowledge , much of it from diverse , localized sources , as well as nations ' exclusive economic zones .
these efforts resulted in the first comprehensive lists of marine life in diverse regions .
" the most significant thing about them is that we actually have them – and we never did before , " said ron o 'dor , co-senior scientist for the census of marine life , or coml , which commissioned the project .
coml described the collection of biodiversity reports as a " prelude " to the main marine census findings on species distribution and abundance , scheduled for an october release in london .
over the past decade , more than 2,700 scientists have participated in the census of marine life .
according to a statement summarizing the reports , coml researchers expect the project 's estimate of all known marine species to surpass 230,000 specimens .
the final figure will also include species not yet listed in the ocean biogeographic information system , or obis – a permanent database featuring millions of records that aid both researchers and policymakers .
bildunterschrift : asteronyx loveni is one of several thousand species found in japan 's waters biodiversity in focus – and under threat the latest papers estimate that biodiversity levels are highest in the waters around japan and australia , where almost 33,000 species are known to scientists .
more than 22,000 species were reported in chinese waters .
preserving these diverse marine ecosystems , however , requires stringent regulations .
o 'dor said strict environmental protections are in place in australian waters , but policing the thousands of islands that comprise the philippines and indonesia is more challenging .
but the area has other vulnerabilities : " climate change , global warming is going to have a heavy impact in that region because it 's right on the equator , " he told deutsche welle .
though threats to biodiversity varied across regions , the biggest challenges to marine life overall are overfishing , pollution , loss of habitat and invasive species .
" most of the problems are associated with human influences , " o 'dor said , citing as examples the creation of anoxic " dead " zones in the gulf of mexico due to mississippi river runoff and mining and oil exploration .
yet overfishing is at the top of the threat list – with much of the impact concentrated within nations ' exclusive economic zones .
o 'dor recommended an approach to fisheries management based on entire ecosystems , not just individual species .
" you ca n't manage species in isolation , " he said .
but crafting an approach that incorporates tens of thousands of species in waters rich in biodiversity , like those around australia , is not easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea has seen its biodiversity change over time europe 's enclosed seas the mediterranean sea was among those regions with the " most threatened " biodiversity .
it was also the region most threatened by invasive species – with 600 aliens .
most of them originated in the red sea and arrived via the suez canal .
" the problem nowadays is the velocity of this phenomenon – now species are introduced by humans more intensively , " marta coll , lead author of the mediterranean sea regional synthesis , told deutsche welle .
coll nevertheless described the mediterranean as a hotspot of diverse marine life forms – with plenty still left to discover .
" for example , experts still debate how many species of fish inhabit the mediterranean sea , " she said .
meanwhile , the threats facing this region have diversified , with climate change among the main phenomena that stand to influence marine life .
in the baltic , another one of europe 's enclosed seas , biodiversity is also under pressure .
henn ojaveer , lead author of the forthcoming coml paper on the baltic sea , said the region has seen its biodiversity profile change over the past 40 to 50 years , and even today the situation is " completely heterogeneous . "
the number of different species counted in the baltic sea stood at about 6,000 .
" this is very likely an underestimation , but the best count we have currently , " ojaveer said .
all will be revealed on october 4 , the census of marine life plans to present a final count for new species discovered over the course of the decade-long project .
coml researchers would not release the number in advance , but did indicate that several thousand species were " new to science . "
" the sheer number that have been discovered so far , it 's amazing , " said bhavani e. narayanaswamy , project coordinator for the coml european implementation committee .
" but even more so is the fact that there remains even more to be discovered . "
identifying and describing new marine species is a long , arduous process – and coml 's statement on the reports labels current knowledge of biodiversity in all regions studied as " inadequate . "
yet the census marks the most comprehensive look at the world 's marine life so far , and the largest international collaboration ever between scientists in the field .
the european commission 's environment spokesman , joe hennon , said the commission was grateful for coml 's contribution , calling it " an international driving force in promoting a better knowledge of the seas . "
" we can not achieve the aims of the maritime policy – exploiting new resources sustainably or protecting the marine environment – if we do not know what resources are out there to protect , " hennon said . bildunterschrift : census scientists expect to announce the discovery of " several thousand " new species in october open ocean , endless possibilities the census results scheduled for release in october will take a broader view of the world 's marine environment .
this should yield more data on species in the open ocean beyond the continental shelf .
moreover , the data will be organized by " realm , ” from ice oceans to microbes .
coml research has also focused on both species identification and active geology in the deep sea .
maria baker , manager of one of the realm 's field projects known as " chess , " said scientists there have listed about 190 new species since work started in 2002 .
" every time we go down to new areas , you expect to find new species , " she said .
the project also led to the 2005 discovery of the first deep-sea vent south of the equator , as well as the northernmost and southernmost vents ever located .
just this year , researchers found the deepest known undersea volcanic rift in the cayman trough – at a depth of more than 5,000 meters .
but baker said reaching many deepwater regions is hindered by cost and accessibility issues , and more exploration must still be done : " we 're literally scraping the surface in some areas . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 03.08.2010 syria-saudi pact promises peace but lebanon remains on tenterhooks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more than peace at stake for abdullah and assad the visit by syrian president bashar al-assad and saudi king abdullah to lebanon has been hailed as a significant step at easing the simmering tensions in the country .
some experts , however , are far from convinced . with reports of clashes between lebanese and israeli forces , fears of a renewed conflict in lebanon have been growing ever since hassan nasrallah , the leader of the shiite militant group hezbollah , claimed members of his party were on the verge of being indicted by a un tribunal probing the 2005 murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri .
the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- is investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result .
however , relations have been slowly normalizing , as indicated by president assad 's visit to lebanon recently - his first since hariri 's assassination .
while that in itself could be seen as a breakthrough , assad 's accompanying of king abdullah - a close supporter of the sunni muslim hariri family - has been hailed as being even more significant .
syria and saudi arabia have been on opposing sides in many of the complicated feuds in the middle east , including that over influence in lebanon , for decades .
regional rivals the closest of enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah paralyzed beirut with strikes and unrest in 2008 some observers have welcomed the visit as an attempt to defuse a situation which could potentially lead to a conflict similar to that in may 2008 , when 100 people were killed in clashes that erupted when the government announced - and then repealed - a crackdown on hezbollah .
others , however , believe assad and abdullah 's mission could have wider , more damaging implications not only to lebanon 's stability but to the stability of the region as a whole .
" the hariri family and hezbollah , and their supporters , have been enemies for five or six years now which reflects the wider divisions in the middle east , " nadim shehadi , a lebanon expert with the middle east programme at chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" this situation has been akin to the cold war with the repercussions playing out everywhere from palestine to iraq . "
" the most important recent development was seen at last year 's arab league summit in doha where gaza was the main topic , " he added .
" the saudis were there , egypt , jordan … but the whole radical front boycotted the meeting .
there was no hamas , no hezbollah , no iran and no syria . "
" saudi arabia and egypt were forced to look into the abyss and they saw that their power as interlocutors and mediators was under threat .
any deal in the region could be aborted by the radicals .
it meant that more say had to be given to others for any progress to be made . "
saudi arabia seen as giving syria its backing to return to beirut some analysts see king abdullah 's joint visit to lebanon with assad as the next step in a transfer of power and an indication that , instead of opposing a return to syrian domination of lebanon , saudi arabia is giving it its blessing .
the visit is seen by some as a clear message that syria , along with iran - another major backer of hezbollah , still holds sway in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad has met with prime minister saad hariri , rafiq 's son " bringing assad to lebanon on the saudi royal plane is a very big blessing indeed , " paul salem , the director of the carnegie endowment for international peace 's beirut bureau , told deutsche welle . " but saudi arabia brought assad to lebanon to help in a peace process not to give him carte blanche to do what he likes .
he was effectively brought in to stop his friends in hezbollah attacking the government .
this is a clear sign that it wo n't just be syria which is the go-to country for any lebanon crisis , but saudi arabia too .
the saudis need to be involved to protect their friends in the sunni community . " any resurgence of syrian influence in lebanon , however , could further complicate matters in regard to the stl 's findings and any indictment of hezbollah members in hariri 's murder .
both syria and hezbollah have an interest in bringing the tribunal to an end and have a number of devices at hand to potentially force this outcome .
while pressuring saudi arabia to use its relationship with the united states to postpone any indictment of hezbollah members , the saudis can not make the tribunal go away on their own .
syria and hezbollah would have to do their part .

"
the leaders stressed " the importance of stability ... the commitment -lrb- of the lebanese -rrb- not to resort to violence and the need to place the country 's interests above all sectarian interests , " the communique read .
avoiding a return to violence between hariri-supporting sunnis and the shiites of hezbollah in lebanon appears to be the main justification for the syrian-saudi agreement .
however , it appears that this pact between two of the main players from the opposing sides can only ensure peace by removing the tribunal problem , given that hezbollah has threatened to take whatever action it deems necessary should its members be indicted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 03.08.2010 syria-saudi pact promises peace but lebanon remains on tenterhooks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more than peace at stake for abdullah and assad the visit by syrian president bashar al-assad and saudi king abdullah to lebanon has been hailed as a significant step at easing the simmering tensions in the country .
some experts , however , are far from convinced . with reports of clashes between lebanese and israeli forces , fears of a renewed conflict in lebanon have been growing ever since hassan nasrallah , the leader of the shiite militant group hezbollah , claimed members of his party were on the verge of being indicted by a un tribunal probing the 2005 murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri .
the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- is investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result .
however , relations have been slowly normalizing , as indicated by president assad 's visit to lebanon recently - his first since hariri 's assassination .
while that in itself could be seen as a breakthrough , assad 's accompanying of king abdullah - a close supporter of the sunni muslim hariri family - has been hailed as being even more significant .
syria and saudi arabia have been on opposing sides in many of the complicated feuds in the middle east , including that over influence in lebanon , for decades .
regional rivals the closest of enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah paralyzed beirut with strikes and unrest in 2008 some observers have welcomed the visit as an attempt to defuse a situation which could potentially lead to a conflict similar to that in may 2008 , when 100 people were killed in clashes that erupted when the government announced - and then repealed - a crackdown on hezbollah .
others , however , believe assad and abdullah 's mission could have wider , more damaging implications not only to lebanon 's stability but to the stability of the region as a whole .
" the hariri family and hezbollah , and their supporters , have been enemies for five or six years now which reflects the wider divisions in the middle east , " nadim shehadi , a lebanon expert with the middle east programme at chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" this situation has been akin to the cold war with the repercussions playing out everywhere from palestine to iraq . "
" the most important recent development was seen at last year 's arab league summit in doha where gaza was the main topic , " he added .
" the saudis were there , egypt , jordan … but the whole radical front boycotted the meeting .
there was no hamas , no hezbollah , no iran and no syria . "
" saudi arabia and egypt were forced to look into the abyss and they saw that their power as interlocutors and mediators was under threat .
any deal in the region could be aborted by the radicals .
it meant that more say had to be given to others for any progress to be made . "
saudi arabia seen as giving syria its backing to return to beirut some analysts see king abdullah 's joint visit to lebanon with assad as the next step in a transfer of power and an indication that , instead of opposing a return to syrian domination of lebanon , saudi arabia is giving it its blessing .
the visit is seen by some as a clear message that syria , along with iran - another major backer of hezbollah , still holds sway in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad has met with prime minister saad hariri , rafiq 's son " bringing assad to lebanon on the saudi royal plane is a very big blessing indeed , " paul salem , the director of the carnegie endowment for international peace 's beirut bureau , told deutsche welle . " but saudi arabia brought assad to lebanon to help in a peace process not to give him carte blanche to do what he likes .
he was effectively brought in to stop his friends in hezbollah attacking the government .
this is a clear sign that it wo n't just be syria which is the go-to country for any lebanon crisis , but saudi arabia too .
the saudis need to be involved to protect their friends in the sunni community . " any resurgence of syrian influence in lebanon , however , could further complicate matters in regard to the stl 's findings and any indictment of hezbollah members in hariri 's murder .
both syria and hezbollah have an interest in bringing the tribunal to an end and have a number of devices at hand to potentially force this outcome .
while pressuring saudi arabia to use its relationship with the united states to postpone any indictment of hezbollah members , the saudis can not make the tribunal go away on their own .
syria and hezbollah would have to do their part . " when the lebanese government was preparing to call for a tribunal , hezbollah and the syria-affiliated parties in the government pulled out and closed down the parliament , " shehadi said . " hezbollah then took over the city and paralyzed the institutions , shutting down the government 's power to call its own tribunal .
so the pro-tribunal parties had to call on the un to form the tribunal , which was an unprecedented step .

the 32-year-old koek has been selling wedding dresses here for years .

it would be " a massive insult , to allow turkish police officers to patrol here , " koek said , not to mention destroying integration , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in berlin , a program trains young people of turkish origin as police officers the bridal shop is just one of many small businesses on wesel road operated by turkish immigrants .

the goal is higher acceptance of german officers - but the idea is controversial . in front of a bridal store , a man and a woman sit on wooden chairs , drinking black tea from small glasses - an everyday scene in many towns in turkey .
but hatice koek 's bridal shop is located in germany , in the duisburg neighborhood of marxloh .
the 32-year-old koek has been selling wedding dresses here for years .
when she heard about the idea of using turkish police officers in north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is located , she was outraged .
it would be " a massive insult , to allow turkish police officers to patrol here , " koek said , not to mention destroying integration , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in berlin , a program trains young people of turkish origin as police officers the bridal shop is just one of many small businesses on wesel road operated by turkish immigrants .

lack of respect but the head of the german police union in north rhine-westphalia is hoping for just that : erich rettinghaus wants to send turkish policemen on patrol with their german colleagues .
his goal is to find why young people of turkish origin often , in his opinion , have no respect for the police , and whether they would respond differently to turkish policemen .
according to rettinghaus ' plan , turkish officers would be deployed in immigrant-heavy districts such as marxloh in duisburg and ehrenfeld in cologne and given language support by turkish-speaking policemen and -women or interpreters . rettinghaus does n't see his suggestion as a declaration of helplessness .
rather , it 's more like an exchange , such as the ones with dutch police on the border to the netherlands .
" during peak holiday times , german police are dispatched to places where many german tourists go .

despite the slump in europe 's market - and summer coming to an end - analysts predict bmw can keep up the good work . german car exporters have seen a significant rise in overseas sales with munich 's luxury automaker bmw leading the pack , according to figures released tuesday .
the association of german automakers -lrb- vda -rrb- said tuesday that german automakers exported 312,400 cars in july , clinching a 6 percent increase over the same month in 2009 .
for the first seven months of 2010 , total car exports were up 39 percent to nearly 2.5 million automobiles .
bmw placed itself solidly ahead of audi and mercedes , with a sevenfold year-on-year profit increase .
the company posted a second quarter net profit of 834 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- , compared with 121 million euros for the same period in 2009 .
in the united states alone , the group 's july sales hit 21,253 automobiles , increasing bmw 's us sales by 10.1 percent over last july .
bmw 's results shattered the predictions of a dow jones newswires poll , which had forecast profits of 674 million euros .
meanwhile , daimler , which owns mercedes benz , has raised its core earnings predictions to six billion euros for 2010 .
europe 's biggest car maker and audi parent group , volkswagen , plans to sell a record 6.3 million vehicles .
bmw claims improved construction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new 5 series is expected to keep sales rolling meanwhile , friedrich eichiner , bmw 's chief financial officer , credited the company 's success to improved construction .
the introduction of a new modular construction system , bmw ceo norbert reithofer said , would also increase bmw 's profits with every new model to come .
the luxury automaker produced cars in 2010 that were more expensive than any models it had produced since november 2007 , and dz bank 's auto expert , jaski terzic , predicted that the automaker 's new 5 series and its countryman mini-suvs would promise high profits for the second two quarters as well .
a falling euro equals rising sales in recent months , european automakers have benefited from the euro 's fall in value against the dollar , according to automotive professor willi dietz from germany 's ifa automotive economic institute .
the tumbling euro " greatly improves their situation in most of the asian and north american markets , " dietz said .
yet , while asian and american markets have boomed , european markets have cooled down .
new car sales in france , italy and spain fell sharply in july , and the us market is expected to slow as summer comes to an end .
" we can not say this will last for the next 12 months , " dietz told the afp news agency .
new car registrations in germany itself have slumped since a government car-scrapping program to boost recession sales came to an end .
they were down 30 percentm , with 237,500 cars sold in july .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 03.08.2010 constitutional court split over role of armed forces in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court is split over the use of the military in germany germany 's constitutional court is reportedly divided over whether to allow the country 's military , the bundeswehr , to use all means at its disposal in the case of a high-level domestic security threat . germany 's constitutional court is reportedly split over the role of the country 's armed forces within german borders .
one half of the court , the first senate , says the bundeswehr should not be allowed to act offensively inside germany .
it says the constitution does n't allow it . but according to reports in the daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung , the second senate is reportedly pushing for an expanded domestic role for the armed forces .
the paper reports the second senate wants the bundeswehr to be able to use its full force in the case of an especially threatening domestic security situation . hesitation over granting the bundeswehr more powers inside germany is linked to memories of the military 's domestic role under the nazis , says heinz schulte , a policy , defense and security analyst in berlin . schulte told deutsche welle that , despite these fears , the bundeswehr would be crucial in protecting germany if it came under terrorist attack . " it seems to me that in the case of a very serious threat , an asymmetrical threat , there will be no alternative but to use the bundeswehr inside germany , " schulte says .
" the current scenario is that the bundeswehr can assist the german civil authorities , particularly the police , in the case of natural emergencies , like floods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr would be called on to intercept hijacked planes " but what we 're talking about is a different scenario .
what happens if there 's a terrorist threat on a major scale in germany ?
will the police be able to guard all the airports and ports and crucial infrastructure points in germany ?
the answer is , no , they will not be able to . " controversial act much of the debate has centered on the 2005 aviation security act , which sought to allow the bundeswehr to pre-emptively shoot down hijacked commercial airliners . it was ruled , however , that shooting down any such plane would be a violation of the basic rights of the passengers and crew onboard .
as it stands , the bundeswehr is only allowed to deploy fighters to try alter the course of any hijacked planes . at the time , the christian democrat deputy parliamentary floor leader , wolfgang bosbach , argued strongly for an amendment to the constitution to grant the bundeswehr more operational maneuverability . " a country 's security must be defined differently today than during the time of the cold war , especially since internal and external security can no longer be so strictly divided , " bosbach told the netzeitung online newspaper at the time . the chairman of the first senate of the constitutional court , ferdinand kirchhof , meanwhile , remains steadfast in his view that without an amendment to the german basic law - the country 's constitution - no " military means of warfare may be used " within the country 's borders under any circumstances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the act was passed following the attack on the world trade center the aviation security act led the constitutional court to ask more fundamentally what the role of the bundeswehr inside germany actually should be .
it ruled that the constitution did not allow the government to order the armed forces to use military weapons inside germany . revised role the second senate is reportedly not pushing for a revision of the ruling on the aviation security act , but rather wants to see a loosening of the restrictions on the bundeswehr 's use of weapons inside germany . the body reportedly wants the bundeswehr to be allowed to use any weapons at its disposal in the case of " particularly severe incidents . " heinz schulte says the bundeswehr would have no choice but to accept such responsibilities , despite already being overburdened by its international responsibilities , " particularly against the background that it is under enormous pressure with regard to ongoing operations like the anti-pirate operation atalanta , and of course afghanistan , and continued operations in the balkans . " if the first and second senates of the constitutional court are unable to find a solution to the legal confrontation , the matter could be put to a vote of both senates meeting together .
this would be only the fourth time in the court 's history that such a plenum would be held . author : darren mara editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 03.08.2010 syria-saudi pact promises peace but lebanon remains on tenterhooks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more than peace at stake for abdullah and assad the visit by syrian president bashar al-assad and saudi king abdullah to lebanon has been hailed as a significant step at easing the simmering tensions in the country .
some experts , however , are far from convinced . with reports of clashes between lebanese and israeli forces , fears of a renewed conflict in lebanon have been growing ever since hassan nasrallah , the leader of the shiite militant group hezbollah , claimed members of his party were on the verge of being indicted by a un tribunal probing the 2005 murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri .
the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- is investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result .
however , relations have been slowly normalizing , as indicated by president assad 's visit to lebanon recently - his first since hariri 's assassination .
while that in itself could be seen as a breakthrough , assad 's accompanying of king abdullah - a close supporter of the sunni muslim hariri family - has been hailed as being even more significant .
syria and saudi arabia have been on opposing sides in many of the complicated feuds in the middle east , including that over influence in lebanon , for decades .
regional rivals the closest of enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah paralyzed beirut with strikes and unrest in 2008 some observers have welcomed the visit as an attempt to defuse a situation which could potentially lead to a conflict similar to that in may 2008 , when 100 people were killed in clashes that erupted when the government announced - and then repealed - a crackdown on hezbollah .
others , however , believe assad and abdullah 's mission could have wider , more damaging implications not only to lebanon 's stability but to the stability of the region as a whole .
" the hariri family and hezbollah , and their supporters , have been enemies for five or six years now which reflects the wider divisions in the middle east , " nadim shehadi , a lebanon expert with the middle east programme at chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" this situation has been akin to the cold war with the repercussions playing out everywhere from palestine to iraq . "
" the most important recent development was seen at last year 's arab league summit in doha where gaza was the main topic , " he added .
" the saudis were there , egypt , jordan … but the whole radical front boycotted the meeting .
there was no hamas , no hezbollah , no iran and no syria . "
" saudi arabia and egypt were forced to look into the abyss and they saw that their power as interlocutors and mediators was under threat .
any deal in the region could be aborted by the radicals .
it meant that more say had to be given to others for any progress to be made . "
saudi arabia seen as giving syria its backing to return to beirut some analysts see king abdullah 's joint visit to lebanon with assad as the next step in a transfer of power and an indication that , instead of opposing a return to syrian domination of lebanon , saudi arabia is giving it its blessing .
the visit is seen by some as a clear message that syria , along with iran - another major backer of hezbollah , still holds sway in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad has met with prime minister saad hariri , rafiq 's son " bringing assad to lebanon on the saudi royal plane is a very big blessing indeed , " paul salem , the director of the carnegie endowment for international peace 's beirut bureau , told deutsche welle . " but saudi arabia brought assad to lebanon to help in a peace process not to give him carte blanche to do what he likes .
he was effectively brought in to stop his friends in hezbollah attacking the government .
this is a clear sign that it wo n't just be syria which is the go-to country for any lebanon crisis , but saudi arabia too .
the saudis need to be involved to protect their friends in the sunni community . " any resurgence of syrian influence in lebanon , however , could further complicate matters in regard to the stl 's findings and any indictment of hezbollah members in hariri 's murder .
both syria and hezbollah have an interest in bringing the tribunal to an end and have a number of devices at hand to potentially force this outcome .
while pressuring saudi arabia to use its relationship with the united states to postpone any indictment of hezbollah members , the saudis can not make the tribunal go away on their own .
syria and hezbollah would have to do their part . " when the lebanese government was preparing to call for a tribunal , hezbollah and the syria-affiliated parties in the government pulled out and closed down the parliament , " shehadi said . " hezbollah then took over the city and paralyzed the institutions , shutting down the government 's power to call its own tribunal .
so the pro-tribunal parties had to call on the un to form the tribunal , which was an unprecedented step .
it effectively forced the tribunal on lebanon and interfered in the running of a sovereign state . " " if the tribunal rules that syria and hezbollah was behind the hariri assassination , then there is a great chance that we will see violence in beirut .
what could precede that is an attempt by syria and hezbollah to either paralyze the lebanese government or change it .
in both cases , a new government under anti-tribunal control can call for the investigation to be called off , saying that the two sides have reconciled and there is no need for it to continue .
the un will have to agree to this unless it can be proved that the country has been hijacked . " hezbollah committed to changing beirut 's position paul salem believes that hezbollah will continue to push for the tribunal to be ended as long as it assumes that there is a political aspect to the tribunal 's process which is aimed at punishing its members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah is prepared to do all it can to influence policy " it 's obvious that syria and hezbollah wants the tribunal to go away and they have been doing their best by discrediting it publically and claiming that it is politicized , " salem said .
" they won ’ t be able to stop the tribunal as such but they could pressure the government to change its position through the threat of violence or by taking over beirut , which could lead to a statement of no-confidence in the tribunal or a withdrawal of support from the government . " " this could lead to a situation where the tribunal has no lebanese support which would mean arrest warrants could not be issued in lebanon or arrests made .
it could pass a guilty verdict on hezbollah and / or syria but little would change . " peace pact appears to hinge on tribunal ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese president sleiman , right , could tow the line for peace in the communique issued after the mini-summit between assad , abdullah and lebanese president michel sleiman , all of lebanon 's political parties were urged to " pursue the path of appeasement and dialogue and to boost national unity in the face of outside threats . "
the leaders stressed " the importance of stability ... the commitment -lrb- of the lebanese -rrb- not to resort to violence and the need to place the country 's interests above all sectarian interests , " the communique read .
avoiding a return to violence between hariri-supporting sunnis and the shiites of hezbollah in lebanon appears to be the main justification for the syrian-saudi agreement .
however , it appears that this pact between two of the main players from the opposing sides can only ensure peace by removing the tribunal problem , given that hezbollah has threatened to take whatever action it deems necessary should its members be indicted .

in 2009 , the co2 global average concentration in the earth 's atmosphere was about 0.0387 percent by volume , or 387 parts per million by volume -lrb- ppmv -rrb- .
by 2050 , it has reached 675 ppmv .
global warming has gathered pace even faster than was predicted in the early 21st century .
the average temperature is now four degrees higher than it during the beginning of the industrialization , and researchers expect a further rise of 4 to 5 degrees by the end of the century .
but levels of global warming vary dramatically from region to region : parts of europe have actually witnessed a drop in average temperatures due to the weakening of the gulf stream .
in stark contrast , the arctic and the north pole have experienced a record rise in temperatures of almost 8 degrees .
but increased carbon levels in the atmosphere are not the only reason for the galloping pace of global warming .
while it has triggered some processes which speeded up further warming , other effects have mitigated it .
with the balance between these positive and negative feedbacks serving as a major cause of uncertainty in climate predictions , scientists were unable to forecast these ‘ feedback effects . '
the thawing of permafrost in northern russia and canada , for example , accelerated global warming because methane was released in the process - a relatively potent greenhouse gas with 20 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide .

the police union wants to send police from turkey on patrol in problem neighborhoods in germany .
the goal is higher acceptance of german officers - but the idea is controversial . in front of a bridal store , a man and a woman sit on wooden chairs , drinking black tea from small glasses - an everyday scene in many towns in turkey .
but hatice koek 's bridal shop is located in germany , in the duisburg neighborhood of marxloh .
the 32-year-old koek has been selling wedding dresses here for years .
when she heard about the idea of using turkish police officers in north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is located , she was outraged .
it would be " a massive insult , to allow turkish police officers to patrol here , " koek said , not to mention destroying integration , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in berlin , a program trains young people of turkish origin as police officers the bridal shop is just one of many small businesses on wesel road operated by turkish immigrants .

the residents , too , feel comfortable in their surroundings .
but do they really need turkish police ?
a turkish barber also rejected the idea .
" i would laugh if i saw a police officer here in a turkish uniform , " said a young man who was having his hair cut .
if someone has no respect for the german police , he wo n't take a turkish policeman seriously either , he said .
lack of respect but the head of the german police union in north rhine-westphalia is hoping for just that : erich rettinghaus wants to send turkish policemen on patrol with their german colleagues .
his goal is to find why young people of turkish origin often , in his opinion , have no respect for the police , and whether they would respond differently to turkish policemen .
according to rettinghaus ' plan , turkish officers would be deployed in immigrant-heavy districts such as marxloh in duisburg and ehrenfeld in cologne and given language support by turkish-speaking policemen and -women or interpreters . rettinghaus does n't see his suggestion as a declaration of helplessness .
rather , it 's more like an exchange , such as the ones with dutch police on the border to the netherlands .
" during peak holiday times , german police are dispatched to places where many german tourists go .
for example , in -lsb- the popular dutch resort town -rsb- renesse , there are german police to break up brawls in nightclubs and pubs , " says rettinghaus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many citizens with turkish background are skeptical of importing police officers but the presumed foreigners who live in marxloh and ehrenfeld are not tourists .
most of them were born in germany and are part of german society .
the lack of acceptance of german police goes both ways , said a group of young people in front of a video arcade .
the boys often feel they are treated badly .
" in fights between migrants , for example , the german police only show up after everything is over , " complained a 19-year-old .
another says : " if a german is caught cycling in the wrong bike lane , the policeman says simply : ' continue on . '
but a turk would be given a ticket right away . " ' guest officers ' with no authority these descriptions go against what rettinghaus says are police officers ' experiences on the beat : young people frequently try to prevent an arrest by attacking the patrol car and attempting to free the arrestee .
in such situations the turkish " guest police " could intervene by arbitrating , rettinghaus says .
however , the turkish police officers would have no legal powers and would not carry weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police sometimes collaborate with foreign police to patrol border areas although many marxloh residents are skeptical of the idea , some do believe that the deployment of turkish police officers would help to bridge the differences in attitude .
an older couple in a supermarket posits that the turkish uniforms would make a great impression on young people .
in one of the many traditional teahouses in marxloh , men are playing cards and backgammon .
a 32-year-old says he finds the idea of turkish police in germany absurd .
the state should educate young immigrants to join the police force instead , he argues .
he himself would be ready to give up his well-paid job , but he does n't have the necessary high school diploma to become an officer .
instead of getting policemen from turkey , who know neither the country nor the language , the state ought to approach people like him and recruit them , the outraged man said .
currently only one in seven of police trainees in north rhine-westphalia comes from an immigrant family .
rettinghaus would like to see more police officers with immigrant background .
working with turkish police , he says , is not an alternative , but a supplementary measure .
so far , however , there have been no talks with the turkish authorities .
whether his idea can be realized at all is still up in the air , admits rettinghaus .
the state interior ministry 's reaction has been " restrained , so far . "
but the state government has is new in office .
and the interior minister has many issues to tend to at the moment .
rettinghaus hopes that his proposal will get its turn soon .

the species inventories released on monday conclude work by 360 scientists to integrate both new and prior knowledge , much of it from diverse , localized sources , as well as nations ' exclusive economic zones .
these efforts resulted in the first comprehensive lists of marine life in diverse regions .
" the most significant thing about them is that we actually have them – and we never did before , " said ron o 'dor , co-senior scientist for the census of marine life , or coml , which commissioned the project .
coml described the collection of biodiversity reports as a " prelude " to the main marine census findings on species distribution and abundance , scheduled for an october release in london .
over the past decade , more than 2,700 scientists have participated in the census of marine life .
according to a statement summarizing the reports , coml researchers expect the project 's estimate of all known marine species to surpass 230,000 specimens .
the final figure will also include species not yet listed in the ocean biogeographic information system , or obis – a permanent database featuring millions of records that aid both researchers and policymakers .
bildunterschrift : asteronyx loveni is one of several thousand species found in japan 's waters biodiversity in focus – and under threat the latest papers estimate that biodiversity levels are highest in the waters around japan and australia , where almost 33,000 species are known to scientists .
more than 22,000 species were reported in chinese waters .
preserving these diverse marine ecosystems , however , requires stringent regulations .
o 'dor said strict environmental protections are in place in australian waters , but policing the thousands of islands that comprise the philippines and indonesia is more challenging .
but the area has other vulnerabilities : " climate change , global warming is going to have a heavy impact in that region because it 's right on the equator , " he told deutsche welle .
though threats to biodiversity varied across regions , the biggest challenges to marine life overall are overfishing , pollution , loss of habitat and invasive species .
" most of the problems are associated with human influences , " o 'dor said , citing as examples the creation of anoxic " dead " zones in the gulf of mexico due to mississippi river runoff and mining and oil exploration .
yet overfishing is at the top of the threat list – with much of the impact concentrated within nations ' exclusive economic zones .
o 'dor recommended an approach to fisheries management based on entire ecosystems , not just individual species .
" you ca n't manage species in isolation , " he said .
but crafting an approach that incorporates tens of thousands of species in waters rich in biodiversity , like those around australia , is not easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea has seen its biodiversity change over time europe 's enclosed seas the mediterranean sea was among those regions with the " most threatened " biodiversity .
it was also the region most threatened by invasive species – with 600 aliens .
most of them originated in the red sea and arrived via the suez canal .
" the problem nowadays is the velocity of this phenomenon – now species are introduced by humans more intensively , " marta coll , lead author of the mediterranean sea regional synthesis , told deutsche welle .
coll nevertheless described the mediterranean as a hotspot of diverse marine life forms – with plenty still left to discover .
" for example , experts still debate how many species of fish inhabit the mediterranean sea , " she said .
meanwhile , the threats facing this region have diversified , with climate change among the main phenomena that stand to influence marine life .
in the baltic , another one of europe 's enclosed seas , biodiversity is also under pressure .
henn ojaveer , lead author of the forthcoming coml paper on the baltic sea , said the region has seen its biodiversity profile change over the past 40 to 50 years , and even today the situation is " completely heterogeneous . "
the number of different species counted in the baltic sea stood at about 6,000 .
" this is very likely an underestimation , but the best count we have currently , " ojaveer said .
all will be revealed on october 4 , the census of marine life plans to present a final count for new species discovered over the course of the decade-long project .
coml researchers would not release the number in advance , but did indicate that several thousand species were " new to science . "
" the sheer number that have been discovered so far , it 's amazing , " said bhavani e. narayanaswamy , project coordinator for the coml european implementation committee .
" but even more so is the fact that there remains even more to be discovered . "
identifying and describing new marine species is a long , arduous process – and coml 's statement on the reports labels current knowledge of biodiversity in all regions studied as " inadequate . "
yet the census marks the most comprehensive look at the world 's marine life so far , and the largest international collaboration ever between scientists in the field .
the european commission 's environment spokesman , joe hennon , said the commission was grateful for coml 's contribution , calling it " an international driving force in promoting a better knowledge of the seas . "
" we can not achieve the aims of the maritime policy – exploiting new resources sustainably or protecting the marine environment – if we do not know what resources are out there to protect , " hennon said . bildunterschrift : census scientists expect to announce the discovery of " several thousand " new species in october open ocean , endless possibilities the census results scheduled for release in october will take a broader view of the world 's marine environment .
this should yield more data on species in the open ocean beyond the continental shelf .
moreover , the data will be organized by " realm , ” from ice oceans to microbes .
coml research has also focused on both species identification and active geology in the deep sea .
maria baker , manager of one of the realm 's field projects known as " chess , " said scientists there have listed about 190 new species since work started in 2002 .
" every time we go down to new areas , you expect to find new species , " she said .
the project also led to the 2005 discovery of the first deep-sea vent south of the equator , as well as the northernmost and southernmost vents ever located .
just this year , researchers found the deepest known undersea volcanic rift in the cayman trough – at a depth of more than 5,000 meters .
but baker said reaching many deepwater regions is hindered by cost and accessibility issues , and more exploration must still be done : " we 're literally scraping the surface in some areas . "

the police union wants to send police from turkey on patrol in problem neighborhoods in germany .
the goal is higher acceptance of german officers - but the idea is controversial . in front of a bridal store , a man and a woman sit on wooden chairs , drinking black tea from small glasses - an everyday scene in many towns in turkey .
but hatice koek 's bridal shop is located in germany , in the duisburg neighborhood of marxloh .
the 32-year-old koek has been selling wedding dresses here for years .
when she heard about the idea of using turkish police officers in north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is located , she was outraged .
it would be " a massive insult , to allow turkish police officers to patrol here , " koek said , not to mention destroying integration , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in berlin , a program trains young people of turkish origin as police officers the bridal shop is just one of many small businesses on wesel road operated by turkish immigrants .
restaurants , pharmacies , supermarkets , boutiques - all the businesses have turkish names .
visitors from turkey would feel right at home .
the residents , too , feel comfortable in their surroundings .
but do they really need turkish police ?
a turkish barber also rejected the idea .
" i would laugh if i saw a police officer here in a turkish uniform , " said a young man who was having his hair cut .
if someone has no respect for the german police , he wo n't take a turkish policeman seriously either , he said .
lack of respect but the head of the german police union in north rhine-westphalia is hoping for just that : erich rettinghaus wants to send turkish policemen on patrol with their german colleagues .
his goal is to find why young people of turkish origin often , in his opinion , have no respect for the police , and whether they would respond differently to turkish policemen .
according to rettinghaus ' plan , turkish officers would be deployed in immigrant-heavy districts such as marxloh in duisburg and ehrenfeld in cologne and given language support by turkish-speaking policemen and -women or interpreters . rettinghaus does n't see his suggestion as a declaration of helplessness .
rather , it 's more like an exchange , such as the ones with dutch police on the border to the netherlands .
" during peak holiday times , german police are dispatched to places where many german tourists go .
for example , in -lsb- the popular dutch resort town -rsb- renesse , there are german police to break up brawls in nightclubs and pubs , " says rettinghaus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many citizens with turkish background are skeptical of importing police officers but the presumed foreigners who live in marxloh and ehrenfeld are not tourists .
most of them were born in germany and are part of german society .
the lack of acceptance of german police goes both ways , said a group of young people in front of a video arcade .
the boys often feel they are treated badly .
" in fights between migrants , for example , the german police only show up after everything is over , " complained a 19-year-old .
another says : " if a german is caught cycling in the wrong bike lane , the policeman says simply : ' continue on . '
but a turk would be given a ticket right away . " ' guest officers ' with no authority these descriptions go against what rettinghaus says are police officers ' experiences on the beat : young people frequently try to prevent an arrest by attacking the patrol car and attempting to free the arrestee .
in such situations the turkish " guest police " could intervene by arbitrating , rettinghaus says .
however , the turkish police officers would have no legal powers and would not carry weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police sometimes collaborate with foreign police to patrol border areas although many marxloh residents are skeptical of the idea , some do believe that the deployment of turkish police officers would help to bridge the differences in attitude .
an older couple in a supermarket posits that the turkish uniforms would make a great impression on young people .
in one of the many traditional teahouses in marxloh , men are playing cards and backgammon .
a 32-year-old says he finds the idea of turkish police in germany absurd .
the state should educate young immigrants to join the police force instead , he argues .
he himself would be ready to give up his well-paid job , but he does n't have the necessary high school diploma to become an officer .
instead of getting policemen from turkey , who know neither the country nor the language , the state ought to approach people like him and recruit them , the outraged man said .
currently only one in seven of police trainees in north rhine-westphalia comes from an immigrant family .
rettinghaus would like to see more police officers with immigrant background .
working with turkish police , he says , is not an alternative , but a supplementary measure .
so far , however , there have been no talks with the turkish authorities .
whether his idea can be realized at all is still up in the air , admits rettinghaus .
the state interior ministry 's reaction has been " restrained , so far . "
but the state government has is new in office .
and the interior minister has many issues to tend to at the moment .
rettinghaus hopes that his proposal will get its turn soon .

one half of the court , the first senate , says the bundeswehr should not be allowed to act offensively inside germany .
it says the constitution does n't allow it . but according to reports in the daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung , the second senate is reportedly pushing for an expanded domestic role for the armed forces .
the paper reports the second senate wants the bundeswehr to be able to use its full force in the case of an especially threatening domestic security situation . hesitation over granting the bundeswehr more powers inside germany is linked to memories of the military 's domestic role under the nazis , says heinz schulte , a policy , defense and security analyst in berlin . schulte told deutsche welle that , despite these fears , the bundeswehr would be crucial in protecting germany if it came under terrorist attack . " it seems to me that in the case of a very serious threat , an asymmetrical threat , there will be no alternative but to use the bundeswehr inside germany , " schulte says .
" the current scenario is that the bundeswehr can assist the german civil authorities , particularly the police , in the case of natural emergencies , like floods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr would be called on to intercept hijacked planes " but what we 're talking about is a different scenario .
what happens if there 's a terrorist threat on a major scale in germany ?
will the police be able to guard all the airports and ports and crucial infrastructure points in germany ?
the answer is , no , they will not be able to . " controversial act much of the debate has centered on the 2005 aviation security act , which sought to allow the bundeswehr to pre-emptively shoot down hijacked commercial airliners . it was ruled , however , that shooting down any such plane would be a violation of the basic rights of the passengers and crew onboard .
as it stands , the bundeswehr is only allowed to deploy fighters to try alter the course of any hijacked planes . at the time , the christian democrat deputy parliamentary floor leader , wolfgang bosbach , argued strongly for an amendment to the constitution to grant the bundeswehr more operational maneuverability . " a country 's security must be defined differently today than during the time of the cold war , especially since internal and external security can no longer be so strictly divided , " bosbach told the netzeitung online newspaper at the time . the chairman of the first senate of the constitutional court , ferdinand kirchhof , meanwhile , remains steadfast in his view that without an amendment to the german basic law - the country 's constitution - no " military means of warfare may be used " within the country 's borders under any circumstances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the act was passed following the attack on the world trade center the aviation security act led the constitutional court to ask more fundamentally what the role of the bundeswehr inside germany actually should be .
it ruled that the constitution did not allow the government to order the armed forces to use military weapons inside germany . revised role the second senate is reportedly not pushing for a revision of the ruling on the aviation security act , but rather wants to see a loosening of the restrictions on the bundeswehr 's use of weapons inside germany . the body reportedly wants the bundeswehr to be allowed to use any weapons at its disposal in the case of " particularly severe incidents . " heinz schulte says the bundeswehr would have no choice but to accept such responsibilities , despite already being overburdened by its international responsibilities , " particularly against the background that it is under enormous pressure with regard to ongoing operations like the anti-pirate operation atalanta , and of course afghanistan , and continued operations in the balkans . " if the first and second senates of the constitutional court are unable to find a solution to the legal confrontation , the matter could be put to a vote of both senates meeting together .
this would be only the fourth time in the court 's history that such a plenum would be held . author : darren mara editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it would be the result of the world 's failure to act on time , despite seeing the writing on the wall . in 2050 , young people with average incomes in germany will grow up listening to their grandparents ' tales of holidays in venice .
they themselves are unlikely ever to go on a more adventurous vacation than a cycle tour along the river elbe - so long as it has n't burst its banks .
with a barrel of oil costing over $ 600 -lrb- 453 euros -rrb- , anything else has become prohibitively expensive .
private cars and non-essential flights are a luxury that few can now afford .
welcome to the future .
the international community 's efforts to reach binding agreement on tackling climate change have all failed .
when the kyoto protocol ran out in 2010 , it was never replaced .
the demands of the emerging nations were too great , as was the industrialized nations ' refusal to compromise .
the world 's main climate offenders were unwilling to foot the bill for repairing the damage to the planet , nor would they commit to any long-term reduction of carbon emissions . drastic spike in global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many regions will suffer from acute water shortages the results are palpable .
in 2009 , the co2 global average concentration in the earth 's atmosphere was about 0.0387 percent by volume , or 387 parts per million by volume -lrb- ppmv -rrb- .
by 2050 , it has reached 675 ppmv .
global warming has gathered pace even faster than was predicted in the early 21st century .
the average temperature is now four degrees higher than it during the beginning of the industrialization , and researchers expect a further rise of 4 to 5 degrees by the end of the century .
but levels of global warming vary dramatically from region to region : parts of europe have actually witnessed a drop in average temperatures due to the weakening of the gulf stream .
in stark contrast , the arctic and the north pole have experienced a record rise in temperatures of almost 8 degrees .
but increased carbon levels in the atmosphere are not the only reason for the galloping pace of global warming .
while it has triggered some processes which speeded up further warming , other effects have mitigated it .
with the balance between these positive and negative feedbacks serving as a major cause of uncertainty in climate predictions , scientists were unable to forecast these ‘ feedback effects . '
the thawing of permafrost in northern russia and canada , for example , accelerated global warming because methane was released in the process - a relatively potent greenhouse gas with 20 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide .
bildunterschrift : cities will be hard hit by natural disasters such as floods extreme weather the greenhouse effect has not only transformed siberia and northern canada into wastelands ; it has also led to disastrous weather extremes .
by 2050 , the frequency of typhoons and storm floods has increased in tropical countries .
the islands of the philippines are beset by strong coastal storms .
heavy rainfall regularly leads to landslides , which have already claimed entire villages . moreover , despite the heavy rainfall , the country is suffering from an acute shortage of freshwater : seawater had filtered into the country 's subterranean freshwater reserves and made it undrinkable .
another consequence is that it has increased salinity levels in soil . 200 million climate refugees the repercussions are severe .
viable farmland is urgently required to meet the needs of the world 's population , which has now reached 9 billion -lrb- compared to 6,7 billion in 2009 -rrb- .
200 million of them are climate refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : droughts will drastically raise the number of climate refugees in the world a percentage of them come from small atolls in the pacific ocean and the densely populated delta regions along the rivers ganges , mekong , nile and brahmaputra , which flooded as a result of rising sea levels .
but the majority comes from central asia and africa .
these people are not fleeing flooded regions , but the droughts that have led to mass starvation in many parts of the world .
in africa alone , almost one quarter of the continent 's 1.8 billion inhabitants are affected by water shortages .
mass migration present countries with new sets of problems : india in particular has been overwhelmed by waves of refugees from neighboring bangladesh .
india 's population now numbers 1.9 billion and its government is unable to provide sufficient food and medication for the refugees living in camps on the indian border .
despite united nations support , the spread of diseases such as cholera can not be stemmed , and are soon proliferating even outside the refugee camps . but the effects of climate change are not all negative .
by and large , northern europe has been spared extreme weather , and scandinavian countries are enjoying milder climates than they used to .
northern scandinavia in particular is home to large areas of land that can be used for agriculture . the collapse of ecosystems but many ecosystems have collapsed .
vulnerable coral reefs and mangrove woods have been destroyed by rising sea temperatures and levels , and a large part of the amazon rainforest has been reduced to a steppe .
many plant and animal species have died out .
in 2050 , mankind has paid a high price for its own survival - more than it would have cost to curb climate change in the first decades of the 21st century .
today , in 2010 , experts agree that well-off states only need to give up a small fraction of their wealth to prevent the worst .

the police union wants to send police from turkey on patrol in problem neighborhoods in germany .
the goal is higher acceptance of german officers - but the idea is controversial . in front of a bridal store , a man and a woman sit on wooden chairs , drinking black tea from small glasses - an everyday scene in many towns in turkey .
but hatice koek 's bridal shop is located in germany , in the duisburg neighborhood of marxloh .
the 32-year-old koek has been selling wedding dresses here for years .
when she heard about the idea of using turkish police officers in north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is located , she was outraged .
it would be " a massive insult , to allow turkish police officers to patrol here , " koek said , not to mention destroying integration , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in berlin , a program trains young people of turkish origin as police officers the bridal shop is just one of many small businesses on wesel road operated by turkish immigrants .
restaurants , pharmacies , supermarkets , boutiques - all the businesses have turkish names .
visitors from turkey would feel right at home .
the residents , too , feel comfortable in their surroundings .
but do they really need turkish police ?
a turkish barber also rejected the idea .
" i would laugh if i saw a police officer here in a turkish uniform , " said a young man who was having his hair cut .
if someone has no respect for the german police , he wo n't take a turkish policeman seriously either , he said .
lack of respect but the head of the german police union in north rhine-westphalia is hoping for just that : erich rettinghaus wants to send turkish policemen on patrol with their german colleagues .
his goal is to find why young people of turkish origin often , in his opinion , have no respect for the police , and whether they would respond differently to turkish policemen .
according to rettinghaus ' plan , turkish officers would be deployed in immigrant-heavy districts such as marxloh in duisburg and ehrenfeld in cologne and given language support by turkish-speaking policemen and -women or interpreters . rettinghaus does n't see his suggestion as a declaration of helplessness .
rather , it 's more like an exchange , such as the ones with dutch police on the border to the netherlands .
" during peak holiday times , german police are dispatched to places where many german tourists go .
for example , in -lsb- the popular dutch resort town -rsb- renesse , there are german police to break up brawls in nightclubs and pubs , " says rettinghaus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many citizens with turkish background are skeptical of importing police officers but the presumed foreigners who live in marxloh and ehrenfeld are not tourists .
most of them were born in germany and are part of german society .
the lack of acceptance of german police goes both ways , said a group of young people in front of a video arcade .
the boys often feel they are treated badly .
" in fights between migrants , for example , the german police only show up after everything is over , " complained a 19-year-old .
another says : " if a german is caught cycling in the wrong bike lane , the policeman says simply : ' continue on . '
but a turk would be given a ticket right away . " ' guest officers ' with no authority these descriptions go against what rettinghaus says are police officers ' experiences on the beat : young people frequently try to prevent an arrest by attacking the patrol car and attempting to free the arrestee .
in such situations the turkish " guest police " could intervene by arbitrating , rettinghaus says .
however , the turkish police officers would have no legal powers and would not carry weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police sometimes collaborate with foreign police to patrol border areas although many marxloh residents are skeptical of the idea , some do believe that the deployment of turkish police officers would help to bridge the differences in attitude .
an older couple in a supermarket posits that the turkish uniforms would make a great impression on young people .
in one of the many traditional teahouses in marxloh , men are playing cards and backgammon .
a 32-year-old says he finds the idea of turkish police in germany absurd .
the state should educate young immigrants to join the police force instead , he argues .
he himself would be ready to give up his well-paid job , but he does n't have the necessary high school diploma to become an officer .
instead of getting policemen from turkey , who know neither the country nor the language , the state ought to approach people like him and recruit them , the outraged man said .
currently only one in seven of police trainees in north rhine-westphalia comes from an immigrant family .
rettinghaus would like to see more police officers with immigrant background .
working with turkish police , he says , is not an alternative , but a supplementary measure .
so far , however , there have been no talks with the turkish authorities .
whether his idea can be realized at all is still up in the air , admits rettinghaus .
the state interior ministry 's reaction has been " restrained , so far . "
but the state government has is new in office .
and the interior minister has many issues to tend to at the moment .
rettinghaus hopes that his proposal will get its turn soon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de renewables -pipe- 03.08.2010 opinion : desertec or mediterranean solar plan – whose sun is shining brighter ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two renewables projects should " should complement and cross-fertilize each other " matthias ruchser takes stock of how much progress two cross-border renewables projects - the desertec industry initiative and the mediterranean solar plan - have made so far . july 13 marked the anniversary of two events that could prove extremely important for future energy supplies in europe and the middle east and north africa region -lrb- mena -rrb- : the establishment of the union for the mediterranean -lrb- ufm -rrb- and its mediterranean solar plan in 2008 , and the founding of the commercial desertec industry initiative last year .
most people will have heard of desertec , the initiative to construct large-scale solar and wind power plants in the north african desert .
not so the mediterranean solar plan , which at the moment is familiar only to industry insiders .
yet both initiatives are ambitiously pursuing similar goals .
the mediterranean solar plan aims to create 20 gigawatts ' worth of new renewable energy sources by 2020 – the equivalent of around 15 coal-fired power plants – whereas desertec has set itself the long-term goal of supplying 15 per cent of europe 's electricity by 2050 from its solar and wind power plants .
mediterranean management stalled early on but desertec making progress in december 2008 efforts to set up the ufm stalled due to the outbreak of the gaza war .
high-level ministerial meetings of member states being postponed and important decisions on the ufm 's structure being put on hold .
only now is the union taking the first steps to set up a secretariat in barcelona : a group of staff and experts from member states who will , among other things , help shape and implement the mediterranean solar plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the desertec industry initiative will provide 15 per cent of europe 's electricity by 2050 the desertec industry initiative -lrb- di -rrb- is developing at a much greater pace .
founded by 13 partners , most of them german , the consortium now has 17 partners from seven countries .
negotiations for tunisian and italian companies to join the consortium are advanced , and up to six further additions to the consortium are expected .
another 22 firms support dii as associated partners .
by expanding to include companies from the mena region , dii is also fulfilling demands that those countries in which power plants are to be built be involved from the outset .
two energy projects , one priority region given that access to energy is a cornerstone of the united nations ' millennium development goals , development of the mena region must take priority in both projects .
enormous population growth and increasing industrialization have left african countries with a great deal of catching up to do when it comes to energy projects .
industrialized nations are facing the challenges posed by climate change , which means prioritizing investment in renewable and efficient energy technologies – and the same must go for developing countries and emerging economies .
against this backdrop , the question arises of why fossil power plants are still being built in both industrialized and developing countries .
there are technical reasons for this : renewable energy sources like wind power and photovoltaics will not be able to serve as base-load energies until ‘ intelligent ' electricity grids and storage capacities become available .
what 's more , the cost of investing in renewables is still higher than that of investing in fossil fuel-fired power plants – although costs for fuels in these plants , like coal or natural gas , recur throughout the plants ' operation .
bildunterschrift : morocco " appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables " in the mena region what renewables and large-scale projects like the dii need are a clear legal , administrative and above all economic frameworks .
only then will the high investment costs pay off later .
the conditions must apply in those countries in which the power plants are to be constructed as well as to legislation in the european union and in eu member states that plan to import electricity from africa .
encouraging use of renewables in eu , germany and beyond the 2009 “ eu directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources ” already set the framework for energy projects with non-eu countries as well as for importing electricity generated .
in germany 's case , this means that the question of whether the renewable energy sources act will be extended to include a feed-in tariff for ‘ desert electricity ' is a critical one .
of all the countries in the mena region , morocco appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables .
the country currently imports 95 per cent of its energy requirements , but wants to increase its reliance on renewables to 40 per cent of total energy use by 2020 .
this is another reason that the dii consortium regards morocco as an ideal partner country and is planning to begin work on installing a first power plant park there – one it hopes will prove that the vision of generating electricity in the desert can be realized .
clear regulatory frameworks needed , not intergovernmental entrepreneurialism so , where do the two initiatives – the mediterranean solar plan and dii – now stand , one and two years respectively after they were founded and what priorities should they set for the future ?
the mediterranean solar plan is a political process and should be regarded as such .
it is not the task of an intergovernmental process to take on entrepreneurial initiatives and install power plants – especially when it takes two years to set up a secretariat .
the plan 's focus should , therefore , be on speeding up the process of creating the regulatory framework that will enable private-sector initiatives and investments in the ufm 's member countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser works with the german development institute the countries in the mena region still do not have enough financial clout to independently shoulder such cost-intensive cross-border infrastructure projects .
but the launch of the dii has already led some mena countries to re-shape their regulatory frameworks and set new goals in regard to expanding their renewables capacities .
this will not only make them more attractive to investors from industrialized countries but also for financial institutions such as , for example , the african development bank , the world bank and the european investment bank .
in that respect desertec and the mediterranean solar plan are parallel processes that should complement and cross-fertilize each other .

the mediterranean solar plan aims to create 20 gigawatts ' worth of new renewable energy sources by 2020 – the equivalent of around 15 coal-fired power plants – whereas desertec has set itself the long-term goal of supplying 15 per cent of europe 's electricity by 2050 from its solar and wind power plants .
mediterranean management stalled early on but desertec making progress in december 2008 efforts to set up the ufm stalled due to the outbreak of the gaza war .
high-level ministerial meetings of member states being postponed and important decisions on the ufm 's structure being put on hold .
only now is the union taking the first steps to set up a secretariat in barcelona : a group of staff and experts from member states who will , among other things , help shape and implement the mediterranean solar plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the desertec industry initiative will provide 15 per cent of europe 's electricity by 2050 the desertec industry initiative -lrb- di -rrb- is developing at a much greater pace .
founded by 13 partners , most of them german , the consortium now has 17 partners from seven countries .
negotiations for tunisian and italian companies to join the consortium are advanced , and up to six further additions to the consortium are expected .
another 22 firms support dii as associated partners .
by expanding to include companies from the mena region , dii is also fulfilling demands that those countries in which power plants are to be built be involved from the outset .
two energy projects , one priority region given that access to energy is a cornerstone of the united nations ' millennium development goals , development of the mena region must take priority in both projects .
enormous population growth and increasing industrialization have left african countries with a great deal of catching up to do when it comes to energy projects .
industrialized nations are facing the challenges posed by climate change , which means prioritizing investment in renewable and efficient energy technologies – and the same must go for developing countries and emerging economies .
against this backdrop , the question arises of why fossil power plants are still being built in both industrialized and developing countries .
there are technical reasons for this : renewable energy sources like wind power and photovoltaics will not be able to serve as base-load energies until ‘ intelligent ' electricity grids and storage capacities become available .
what 's more , the cost of investing in renewables is still higher than that of investing in fossil fuel-fired power plants – although costs for fuels in these plants , like coal or natural gas , recur throughout the plants ' operation .
bildunterschrift : morocco " appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables " in the mena region what renewables and large-scale projects like the dii need are a clear legal , administrative and above all economic frameworks .
only then will the high investment costs pay off later .
the conditions must apply in those countries in which the power plants are to be constructed as well as to legislation in the european union and in eu member states that plan to import electricity from africa .
encouraging use of renewables in eu , germany and beyond the 2009 “ eu directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources ” already set the framework for energy projects with non-eu countries as well as for importing electricity generated .
in germany 's case , this means that the question of whether the renewable energy sources act will be extended to include a feed-in tariff for ‘ desert electricity ' is a critical one .
of all the countries in the mena region , morocco appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables .
the country currently imports 95 per cent of its energy requirements , but wants to increase its reliance on renewables to 40 per cent of total energy use by 2020 .
this is another reason that the dii consortium regards morocco as an ideal partner country and is planning to begin work on installing a first power plant park there – one it hopes will prove that the vision of generating electricity in the desert can be realized .
clear regulatory frameworks needed , not intergovernmental entrepreneurialism so , where do the two initiatives – the mediterranean solar plan and dii – now stand , one and two years respectively after they were founded and what priorities should they set for the future ?
the mediterranean solar plan is a political process and should be regarded as such .
it is not the task of an intergovernmental process to take on entrepreneurial initiatives and install power plants – especially when it takes two years to set up a secretariat .
the plan 's focus should , therefore , be on speeding up the process of creating the regulatory framework that will enable private-sector initiatives and investments in the ufm 's member countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser works with the german development institute the countries in the mena region still do not have enough financial clout to independently shoulder such cost-intensive cross-border infrastructure projects .
but the launch of the dii has already led some mena countries to re-shape their regulatory frameworks and set new goals in regard to expanding their renewables capacities .
this will not only make them more attractive to investors from industrialized countries but also for financial institutions such as , for example , the african development bank , the world bank and the european investment bank .
in that respect desertec and the mediterranean solar plan are parallel processes that should complement and cross-fertilize each other .

despite the slump in europe 's market - and summer coming to an end - analysts predict bmw can keep up the good work . german car exporters have seen a significant rise in overseas sales with munich 's luxury automaker bmw leading the pack , according to figures released tuesday .
the association of german automakers -lrb- vda -rrb- said tuesday that german automakers exported 312,400 cars in july , clinching a 6 percent increase over the same month in 2009 .
for the first seven months of 2010 , total car exports were up 39 percent to nearly 2.5 million automobiles .
bmw placed itself solidly ahead of audi and mercedes , with a sevenfold year-on-year profit increase .
the company posted a second quarter net profit of 834 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- , compared with 121 million euros for the same period in 2009 .
in the united states alone , the group 's july sales hit 21,253 automobiles , increasing bmw 's us sales by 10.1 percent over last july .
bmw 's results shattered the predictions of a dow jones newswires poll , which had forecast profits of 674 million euros .
meanwhile , daimler , which owns mercedes benz , has raised its core earnings predictions to six billion euros for 2010 .
europe 's biggest car maker and audi parent group , volkswagen , plans to sell a record 6.3 million vehicles .
bmw claims improved construction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new 5 series is expected to keep sales rolling meanwhile , friedrich eichiner , bmw 's chief financial officer , credited the company 's success to improved construction .
the introduction of a new modular construction system , bmw ceo norbert reithofer said , would also increase bmw 's profits with every new model to come .
the luxury automaker produced cars in 2010 that were more expensive than any models it had produced since november 2007 , and dz bank 's auto expert , jaski terzic , predicted that the automaker 's new 5 series and its countryman mini-suvs would promise high profits for the second two quarters as well .
a falling euro equals rising sales in recent months , european automakers have benefited from the euro 's fall in value against the dollar , according to automotive professor willi dietz from germany 's ifa automotive economic institute .
the tumbling euro " greatly improves their situation in most of the asian and north american markets , " dietz said .
yet , while asian and american markets have boomed , european markets have cooled down .
new car sales in france , italy and spain fell sharply in july , and the us market is expected to slow as summer comes to an end .
" we can not say this will last for the next 12 months , " dietz told the afp news agency .
new car registrations in germany itself have slumped since a government car-scrapping program to boost recession sales came to an end .
they were down 30 percentm , with 237,500 cars sold in july .

it would be the result of the world 's failure to act on time , despite seeing the writing on the wall . in 2050 , young people with average incomes in germany will grow up listening to their grandparents ' tales of holidays in venice .
they themselves are unlikely ever to go on a more adventurous vacation than a cycle tour along the river elbe - so long as it has n't burst its banks .
with a barrel of oil costing over $ 600 -lrb- 453 euros -rrb- , anything else has become prohibitively expensive .
private cars and non-essential flights are a luxury that few can now afford .
welcome to the future .
the international community 's efforts to reach binding agreement on tackling climate change have all failed .
when the kyoto protocol ran out in 2010 , it was never replaced .
the demands of the emerging nations were too great , as was the industrialized nations ' refusal to compromise .
the world 's main climate offenders were unwilling to foot the bill for repairing the damage to the planet , nor would they commit to any long-term reduction of carbon emissions . drastic spike in global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many regions will suffer from acute water shortages the results are palpable .
in 2009 , the co2 global average concentration in the earth 's atmosphere was about 0.0387 percent by volume , or 387 parts per million by volume -lrb- ppmv -rrb- .
by 2050 , it has reached 675 ppmv .
global warming has gathered pace even faster than was predicted in the early 21st century .
the average temperature is now four degrees higher than it during the beginning of the industrialization , and researchers expect a further rise of 4 to 5 degrees by the end of the century .
but levels of global warming vary dramatically from region to region : parts of europe have actually witnessed a drop in average temperatures due to the weakening of the gulf stream .
in stark contrast , the arctic and the north pole have experienced a record rise in temperatures of almost 8 degrees .
but increased carbon levels in the atmosphere are not the only reason for the galloping pace of global warming .
while it has triggered some processes which speeded up further warming , other effects have mitigated it .
with the balance between these positive and negative feedbacks serving as a major cause of uncertainty in climate predictions , scientists were unable to forecast these ‘ feedback effects . '
the thawing of permafrost in northern russia and canada , for example , accelerated global warming because methane was released in the process - a relatively potent greenhouse gas with 20 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide .
bildunterschrift : cities will be hard hit by natural disasters such as floods extreme weather the greenhouse effect has not only transformed siberia and northern canada into wastelands ; it has also led to disastrous weather extremes .
by 2050 , the frequency of typhoons and storm floods has increased in tropical countries .
the islands of the philippines are beset by strong coastal storms .
heavy rainfall regularly leads to landslides , which have already claimed entire villages . moreover , despite the heavy rainfall , the country is suffering from an acute shortage of freshwater : seawater had filtered into the country 's subterranean freshwater reserves and made it undrinkable .
another consequence is that it has increased salinity levels in soil . 200 million climate refugees the repercussions are severe .
viable farmland is urgently required to meet the needs of the world 's population , which has now reached 9 billion -lrb- compared to 6,7 billion in 2009 -rrb- .
200 million of them are climate refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : droughts will drastically raise the number of climate refugees in the world a percentage of them come from small atolls in the pacific ocean and the densely populated delta regions along the rivers ganges , mekong , nile and brahmaputra , which flooded as a result of rising sea levels .
but the majority comes from central asia and africa .
these people are not fleeing flooded regions , but the droughts that have led to mass starvation in many parts of the world .
in africa alone , almost one quarter of the continent 's 1.8 billion inhabitants are affected by water shortages .
mass migration present countries with new sets of problems : india in particular has been overwhelmed by waves of refugees from neighboring bangladesh .
india 's population now numbers 1.9 billion and its government is unable to provide sufficient food and medication for the refugees living in camps on the indian border .
despite united nations support , the spread of diseases such as cholera can not be stemmed , and are soon proliferating even outside the refugee camps . but the effects of climate change are not all negative .
by and large , northern europe has been spared extreme weather , and scandinavian countries are enjoying milder climates than they used to .
northern scandinavia in particular is home to large areas of land that can be used for agriculture . the collapse of ecosystems but many ecosystems have collapsed .
vulnerable coral reefs and mangrove woods have been destroyed by rising sea temperatures and levels , and a large part of the amazon rainforest has been reduced to a steppe .
many plant and animal species have died out .
in 2050 , mankind has paid a high price for its own survival - more than it would have cost to curb climate change in the first decades of the 21st century .
today , in 2010 , experts agree that well-off states only need to give up a small fraction of their wealth to prevent the worst .

bildunterschrift : cities will be hard hit by natural disasters such as floods extreme weather the greenhouse effect has not only transformed siberia and northern canada into wastelands ; it has also led to disastrous weather extremes .
by 2050 , the frequency of typhoons and storm floods has increased in tropical countries .
the islands of the philippines are beset by strong coastal storms .
heavy rainfall regularly leads to landslides , which have already claimed entire villages . moreover , despite the heavy rainfall , the country is suffering from an acute shortage of freshwater : seawater had filtered into the country 's subterranean freshwater reserves and made it undrinkable .
another consequence is that it has increased salinity levels in soil . 200 million climate refugees the repercussions are severe .
viable farmland is urgently required to meet the needs of the world 's population , which has now reached 9 billion -lrb- compared to 6,7 billion in 2009 -rrb- .
200 million of them are climate refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : droughts will drastically raise the number of climate refugees in the world a percentage of them come from small atolls in the pacific ocean and the densely populated delta regions along the rivers ganges , mekong , nile and brahmaputra , which flooded as a result of rising sea levels .
but the majority comes from central asia and africa .
these people are not fleeing flooded regions , but the droughts that have led to mass starvation in many parts of the world .
in africa alone , almost one quarter of the continent 's 1.8 billion inhabitants are affected by water shortages .
mass migration present countries with new sets of problems : india in particular has been overwhelmed by waves of refugees from neighboring bangladesh .
india 's population now numbers 1.9 billion and its government is unable to provide sufficient food and medication for the refugees living in camps on the indian border .
despite united nations support , the spread of diseases such as cholera can not be stemmed , and are soon proliferating even outside the refugee camps . but the effects of climate change are not all negative .
by and large , northern europe has been spared extreme weather , and scandinavian countries are enjoying milder climates than they used to .
northern scandinavia in particular is home to large areas of land that can be used for agriculture . the collapse of ecosystems but many ecosystems have collapsed .
vulnerable coral reefs and mangrove woods have been destroyed by rising sea temperatures and levels , and a large part of the amazon rainforest has been reduced to a steppe .
many plant and animal species have died out .
in 2050 , mankind has paid a high price for its own survival - more than it would have cost to curb climate change in the first decades of the 21st century .
today , in 2010 , experts agree that well-off states only need to give up a small fraction of their wealth to prevent the worst .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 03.08.2010 germany 's highest court strengthens unmarried fathers ' rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmarried dads will soon be able to sue for joint custody the german constitutional court decided on tuesday to give unmarried fathers the right to sue for joint custody of their children .
the new ruling brings germany in line with the european court of human rights . when relationships end with a messy break-up , a disagreement over child custody is often one of the battlegrounds . on tuesday , the balance in such battles was tipped in favor of unmarried fathers by the german constitutional court in karlsruhe when it decided to overturn the current german law on child custody for unmarried couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strasbourg court said germany 's law must be changed ute granold , parliamentary spokesperson on family law for the governing christian democratic union , says that , until now , the mother has had the final say on whether the father has any rights at all .
" with unmarried parents , the father must first accept his paternity , " she explained .
" the mother must agree , and then the second step is going to the youth welfare office to apply for joint custody .
and here the mother can either accept or reject the claim . "
in future , although the mother will still automatically receive sole custody of the child , the father will have the right to challenge for joint custody in court .
government support this change has the enthusiastic backing of the german government , especially the junior coalition partners , the liberal free democrats .
hartfrid wolff , one of the party 's spokesmen on family policy , said , " we in the governing coalition agree that the issue must be about doing what is best for the child , and about raising the status of unmarried fathers , just as the european court of human rights has called for . "
the european court of human rights provoked tuesday 's decision last december , when it ruled that germany 's custody rules were contrary to both discrimination laws and article 8 of the european human rights convention , which protects the right to family life .
willi schoene belongs to a campaign for father 's rights that has welcomed the ruling as an important victory .
the campaign has long argued that mothers often deny the father joint custody because of a personal conflict , and not because they have the interests of the child at heart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court said the child 's interests were paramount schoene thinks children are too often used as a means to an end in a break-up .
" if i was a law-maker i would try to prevent the child from being seen as an economic factor , or a cash cow , " he said .
" that 's what it 's all about in the end .
in my experience , it 's always about power or money . "
extra stress for single parents the decision effectively means that the legal difference between married and unmarried couples has become smaller once again .
but edith schwab , of the association for single-parent families , has misgivings about the new ruling .
" the custody rights of fathers have been strengthened in that , for the first time , a right to sue has been introduced in germany , " she said .
" we have never had that before .
of course we have a few problems with the right to sue , because we know that every lawsuit about custody always causes a massive strain for the single-parent family . "
but those in favor of the new ruling believe that it will encourage unmarried fathers to take responsibility for their children .
german law-makers are now expected to draft the new law in the autumn .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strasbourg court said germany 's law must be changed ute granold , parliamentary spokesperson on family law for the governing christian democratic union , says that , until now , the mother has had the final say on whether the father has any rights at all .
" with unmarried parents , the father must first accept his paternity , " she explained .
" the mother must agree , and then the second step is going to the youth welfare office to apply for joint custody .
and here the mother can either accept or reject the claim . "
in future , although the mother will still automatically receive sole custody of the child , the father will have the right to challenge for joint custody in court .
government support this change has the enthusiastic backing of the german government , especially the junior coalition partners , the liberal free democrats .
hartfrid wolff , one of the party 's spokesmen on family policy , said , " we in the governing coalition agree that the issue must be about doing what is best for the child , and about raising the status of unmarried fathers , just as the european court of human rights has called for . "
the european court of human rights provoked tuesday 's decision last december , when it ruled that germany 's custody rules were contrary to both discrimination laws and article 8 of the european human rights convention , which protects the right to family life .
willi schoene belongs to a campaign for father 's rights that has welcomed the ruling as an important victory .
the campaign has long argued that mothers often deny the father joint custody because of a personal conflict , and not because they have the interests of the child at heart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court said the child 's interests were paramount schoene thinks children are too often used as a means to an end in a break-up .
" if i was a law-maker i would try to prevent the child from being seen as an economic factor , or a cash cow , " he said .
" that 's what it 's all about in the end .
in my experience , it 's always about power or money . "
extra stress for single parents the decision effectively means that the legal difference between married and unmarried couples has become smaller once again .
but edith schwab , of the association for single-parent families , has misgivings about the new ruling .
" the custody rights of fathers have been strengthened in that , for the first time , a right to sue has been introduced in germany , " she said .
" we have never had that before .
of course we have a few problems with the right to sue , because we know that every lawsuit about custody always causes a massive strain for the single-parent family . "
but those in favor of the new ruling believe that it will encourage unmarried fathers to take responsibility for their children .
german law-makers are now expected to draft the new law in the autumn .

lack of respect but the head of the german police union in north rhine-westphalia is hoping for just that : erich rettinghaus wants to send turkish policemen on patrol with their german colleagues .
his goal is to find why young people of turkish origin often , in his opinion , have no respect for the police , and whether they would respond differently to turkish policemen .
according to rettinghaus ' plan , turkish officers would be deployed in immigrant-heavy districts such as marxloh in duisburg and ehrenfeld in cologne and given language support by turkish-speaking policemen and -women or interpreters . rettinghaus does n't see his suggestion as a declaration of helplessness .
rather , it 's more like an exchange , such as the ones with dutch police on the border to the netherlands .
" during peak holiday times , german police are dispatched to places where many german tourists go .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de renewables -pipe- 03.08.2010 opinion : desertec or mediterranean solar plan – whose sun is shining brighter ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two renewables projects should " should complement and cross-fertilize each other " matthias ruchser takes stock of how much progress two cross-border renewables projects - the desertec industry initiative and the mediterranean solar plan - have made so far . july 13 marked the anniversary of two events that could prove extremely important for future energy supplies in europe and the middle east and north africa region -lrb- mena -rrb- : the establishment of the union for the mediterranean -lrb- ufm -rrb- and its mediterranean solar plan in 2008 , and the founding of the commercial desertec industry initiative last year .
most people will have heard of desertec , the initiative to construct large-scale solar and wind power plants in the north african desert .
not so the mediterranean solar plan , which at the moment is familiar only to industry insiders .
yet both initiatives are ambitiously pursuing similar goals .
the mediterranean solar plan aims to create 20 gigawatts ' worth of new renewable energy sources by 2020 – the equivalent of around 15 coal-fired power plants – whereas desertec has set itself the long-term goal of supplying 15 per cent of europe 's electricity by 2050 from its solar and wind power plants .
mediterranean management stalled early on but desertec making progress in december 2008 efforts to set up the ufm stalled due to the outbreak of the gaza war .
high-level ministerial meetings of member states being postponed and important decisions on the ufm 's structure being put on hold .
only now is the union taking the first steps to set up a secretariat in barcelona : a group of staff and experts from member states who will , among other things , help shape and implement the mediterranean solar plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the desertec industry initiative will provide 15 per cent of europe 's electricity by 2050 the desertec industry initiative -lrb- di -rrb- is developing at a much greater pace .
founded by 13 partners , most of them german , the consortium now has 17 partners from seven countries .
negotiations for tunisian and italian companies to join the consortium are advanced , and up to six further additions to the consortium are expected .
another 22 firms support dii as associated partners .
by expanding to include companies from the mena region , dii is also fulfilling demands that those countries in which power plants are to be built be involved from the outset .
two energy projects , one priority region given that access to energy is a cornerstone of the united nations ' millennium development goals , development of the mena region must take priority in both projects .
enormous population growth and increasing industrialization have left african countries with a great deal of catching up to do when it comes to energy projects .
industrialized nations are facing the challenges posed by climate change , which means prioritizing investment in renewable and efficient energy technologies – and the same must go for developing countries and emerging economies .
against this backdrop , the question arises of why fossil power plants are still being built in both industrialized and developing countries .
there are technical reasons for this : renewable energy sources like wind power and photovoltaics will not be able to serve as base-load energies until ‘ intelligent ' electricity grids and storage capacities become available .
what 's more , the cost of investing in renewables is still higher than that of investing in fossil fuel-fired power plants – although costs for fuels in these plants , like coal or natural gas , recur throughout the plants ' operation .
bildunterschrift : morocco " appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables " in the mena region what renewables and large-scale projects like the dii need are a clear legal , administrative and above all economic frameworks .
only then will the high investment costs pay off later .
the conditions must apply in those countries in which the power plants are to be constructed as well as to legislation in the european union and in eu member states that plan to import electricity from africa .
encouraging use of renewables in eu , germany and beyond the 2009 “ eu directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources ” already set the framework for energy projects with non-eu countries as well as for importing electricity generated .
in germany 's case , this means that the question of whether the renewable energy sources act will be extended to include a feed-in tariff for ‘ desert electricity ' is a critical one .
of all the countries in the mena region , morocco appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables .
the country currently imports 95 per cent of its energy requirements , but wants to increase its reliance on renewables to 40 per cent of total energy use by 2020 .
this is another reason that the dii consortium regards morocco as an ideal partner country and is planning to begin work on installing a first power plant park there – one it hopes will prove that the vision of generating electricity in the desert can be realized .
clear regulatory frameworks needed , not intergovernmental entrepreneurialism so , where do the two initiatives – the mediterranean solar plan and dii – now stand , one and two years respectively after they were founded and what priorities should they set for the future ?
the mediterranean solar plan is a political process and should be regarded as such .
it is not the task of an intergovernmental process to take on entrepreneurial initiatives and install power plants – especially when it takes two years to set up a secretariat .
the plan 's focus should , therefore , be on speeding up the process of creating the regulatory framework that will enable private-sector initiatives and investments in the ufm 's member countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser works with the german development institute the countries in the mena region still do not have enough financial clout to independently shoulder such cost-intensive cross-border infrastructure projects .
but the launch of the dii has already led some mena countries to re-shape their regulatory frameworks and set new goals in regard to expanding their renewables capacities .
this will not only make them more attractive to investors from industrialized countries but also for financial institutions such as , for example , the african development bank , the world bank and the european investment bank .
in that respect desertec and the mediterranean solar plan are parallel processes that should complement and cross-fertilize each other .
the guest column represents the author 's personal opinion .
matthias ruchser works with the german development institute / deutsches institut fuer entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- .
the german development institute / deutsches institut fuer entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- is one of the leading think tanks for development policy world-wide .
die draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

one half of the court , the first senate , says the bundeswehr should not be allowed to act offensively inside germany .

most people will have heard of desertec , the initiative to construct large-scale solar and wind power plants in the north african desert .
not so the mediterranean solar plan , which at the moment is familiar only to industry insiders .
yet both initiatives are ambitiously pursuing similar goals .
the mediterranean solar plan aims to create 20 gigawatts ' worth of new renewable energy sources by 2020 – the equivalent of around 15 coal-fired power plants – whereas desertec has set itself the long-term goal of supplying 15 per cent of europe 's electricity by 2050 from its solar and wind power plants .
mediterranean management stalled early on but desertec making progress in december 2008 efforts to set up the ufm stalled due to the outbreak of the gaza war .
high-level ministerial meetings of member states being postponed and important decisions on the ufm 's structure being put on hold .
only now is the union taking the first steps to set up a secretariat in barcelona : a group of staff and experts from member states who will , among other things , help shape and implement the mediterranean solar plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the desertec industry initiative will provide 15 per cent of europe 's electricity by 2050 the desertec industry initiative -lrb- di -rrb- is developing at a much greater pace .
founded by 13 partners , most of them german , the consortium now has 17 partners from seven countries .
negotiations for tunisian and italian companies to join the consortium are advanced , and up to six further additions to the consortium are expected .
another 22 firms support dii as associated partners .
by expanding to include companies from the mena region , dii is also fulfilling demands that those countries in which power plants are to be built be involved from the outset .
two energy projects , one priority region given that access to energy is a cornerstone of the united nations ' millennium development goals , development of the mena region must take priority in both projects .
enormous population growth and increasing industrialization have left african countries with a great deal of catching up to do when it comes to energy projects .
industrialized nations are facing the challenges posed by climate change , which means prioritizing investment in renewable and efficient energy technologies – and the same must go for developing countries and emerging economies .
against this backdrop , the question arises of why fossil power plants are still being built in both industrialized and developing countries .
there are technical reasons for this : renewable energy sources like wind power and photovoltaics will not be able to serve as base-load energies until ‘ intelligent ' electricity grids and storage capacities become available .
what 's more , the cost of investing in renewables is still higher than that of investing in fossil fuel-fired power plants – although costs for fuels in these plants , like coal or natural gas , recur throughout the plants ' operation .
bildunterschrift : morocco " appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables " in the mena region what renewables and large-scale projects like the dii need are a clear legal , administrative and above all economic frameworks .
only then will the high investment costs pay off later .
the conditions must apply in those countries in which the power plants are to be constructed as well as to legislation in the european union and in eu member states that plan to import electricity from africa .
encouraging use of renewables in eu , germany and beyond the 2009 “ eu directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources ” already set the framework for energy projects with non-eu countries as well as for importing electricity generated .
in germany 's case , this means that the question of whether the renewable energy sources act will be extended to include a feed-in tariff for ‘ desert electricity ' is a critical one .
of all the countries in the mena region , morocco appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables .
the country currently imports 95 per cent of its energy requirements , but wants to increase its reliance on renewables to 40 per cent of total energy use by 2020 .
this is another reason that the dii consortium regards morocco as an ideal partner country and is planning to begin work on installing a first power plant park there – one it hopes will prove that the vision of generating electricity in the desert can be realized .
clear regulatory frameworks needed , not intergovernmental entrepreneurialism so , where do the two initiatives – the mediterranean solar plan and dii – now stand , one and two years respectively after they were founded and what priorities should they set for the future ?
the mediterranean solar plan is a political process and should be regarded as such .
it is not the task of an intergovernmental process to take on entrepreneurial initiatives and install power plants – especially when it takes two years to set up a secretariat .
the plan 's focus should , therefore , be on speeding up the process of creating the regulatory framework that will enable private-sector initiatives and investments in the ufm 's member countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser works with the german development institute the countries in the mena region still do not have enough financial clout to independently shoulder such cost-intensive cross-border infrastructure projects .
but the launch of the dii has already led some mena countries to re-shape their regulatory frameworks and set new goals in regard to expanding their renewables capacities .
this will not only make them more attractive to investors from industrialized countries but also for financial institutions such as , for example , the african development bank , the world bank and the european investment bank .
in that respect desertec and the mediterranean solar plan are parallel processes that should complement and cross-fertilize each other .

the species inventories released on monday conclude work by 360 scientists to integrate both new and prior knowledge , much of it from diverse , localized sources , as well as nations ' exclusive economic zones .
these efforts resulted in the first comprehensive lists of marine life in diverse regions .
" the most significant thing about them is that we actually have them – and we never did before , " said ron o 'dor , co-senior scientist for the census of marine life , or coml , which commissioned the project .
coml described the collection of biodiversity reports as a " prelude " to the main marine census findings on species distribution and abundance , scheduled for an october release in london .
over the past decade , more than 2,700 scientists have participated in the census of marine life .
according to a statement summarizing the reports , coml researchers expect the project 's estimate of all known marine species to surpass 230,000 specimens .
the final figure will also include species not yet listed in the ocean biogeographic information system , or obis – a permanent database featuring millions of records that aid both researchers and policymakers .
bildunterschrift : asteronyx loveni is one of several thousand species found in japan 's waters biodiversity in focus – and under threat the latest papers estimate that biodiversity levels are highest in the waters around japan and australia , where almost 33,000 species are known to scientists .
more than 22,000 species were reported in chinese waters .
preserving these diverse marine ecosystems , however , requires stringent regulations .
o 'dor said strict environmental protections are in place in australian waters , but policing the thousands of islands that comprise the philippines and indonesia is more challenging .
but the area has other vulnerabilities : " climate change , global warming is going to have a heavy impact in that region because it 's right on the equator , " he told deutsche welle .
though threats to biodiversity varied across regions , the biggest challenges to marine life overall are overfishing , pollution , loss of habitat and invasive species .
" most of the problems are associated with human influences , " o 'dor said , citing as examples the creation of anoxic " dead " zones in the gulf of mexico due to mississippi river runoff and mining and oil exploration .
yet overfishing is at the top of the threat list – with much of the impact concentrated within nations ' exclusive economic zones .
o 'dor recommended an approach to fisheries management based on entire ecosystems , not just individual species .
" you ca n't manage species in isolation , " he said .
but crafting an approach that incorporates tens of thousands of species in waters rich in biodiversity , like those around australia , is not easy .

most of them originated in the red sea and arrived via the suez canal .
" the problem nowadays is the velocity of this phenomenon – now species are introduced by humans more intensively , " marta coll , lead author of the mediterranean sea regional synthesis , told deutsche welle .
coll nevertheless described the mediterranean as a hotspot of diverse marine life forms – with plenty still left to discover .
" for example , experts still debate how many species of fish inhabit the mediterranean sea , " she said .
meanwhile , the threats facing this region have diversified , with climate change among the main phenomena that stand to influence marine life .
in the baltic , another one of europe 's enclosed seas , biodiversity is also under pressure .
henn ojaveer , lead author of the forthcoming coml paper on the baltic sea , said the region has seen its biodiversity profile change over the past 40 to 50 years , and even today the situation is " completely heterogeneous . "
the number of different species counted in the baltic sea stood at about 6,000 .
" this is very likely an underestimation , but the best count we have currently , " ojaveer said .
all will be revealed on october 4 , the census of marine life plans to present a final count for new species discovered over the course of the decade-long project .
coml researchers would not release the number in advance , but did indicate that several thousand species were " new to science . "
" the sheer number that have been discovered so far , it 's amazing , " said bhavani e. narayanaswamy , project coordinator for the coml european implementation committee .
" but even more so is the fact that there remains even more to be discovered . "
identifying and describing new marine species is a long , arduous process – and coml 's statement on the reports labels current knowledge of biodiversity in all regions studied as " inadequate . "
yet the census marks the most comprehensive look at the world 's marine life so far , and the largest international collaboration ever between scientists in the field .
the european commission 's environment spokesman , joe hennon , said the commission was grateful for coml 's contribution , calling it " an international driving force in promoting a better knowledge of the seas . "
" we can not achieve the aims of the maritime policy – exploiting new resources sustainably or protecting the marine environment – if we do not know what resources are out there to protect , " hennon said . bildunterschrift : census scientists expect to announce the discovery of " several thousand " new species in october open ocean , endless possibilities the census results scheduled for release in october will take a broader view of the world 's marine environment .
this should yield more data on species in the open ocean beyond the continental shelf .
moreover , the data will be organized by " realm , ” from ice oceans to microbes .
coml research has also focused on both species identification and active geology in the deep sea .
maria baker , manager of one of the realm 's field projects known as " chess , " said scientists there have listed about 190 new species since work started in 2002 .
" every time we go down to new areas , you expect to find new species , " she said .
the project also led to the 2005 discovery of the first deep-sea vent south of the equator , as well as the northernmost and southernmost vents ever located .
just this year , researchers found the deepest known undersea volcanic rift in the cayman trough – at a depth of more than 5,000 meters .
but baker said reaching many deepwater regions is hindered by cost and accessibility issues , and more exploration must still be done : " we 're literally scraping the surface in some areas . "

the species inventories released on monday conclude work by 360 scientists to integrate both new and prior knowledge , much of it from diverse , localized sources , as well as nations ' exclusive economic zones .
these efforts resulted in the first comprehensive lists of marine life in diverse regions .
" the most significant thing about them is that we actually have them – and we never did before , " said ron o 'dor , co-senior scientist for the census of marine life , or coml , which commissioned the project .
coml described the collection of biodiversity reports as a " prelude " to the main marine census findings on species distribution and abundance , scheduled for an october release in london .
over the past decade , more than 2,700 scientists have participated in the census of marine life .
according to a statement summarizing the reports , coml researchers expect the project 's estimate of all known marine species to surpass 230,000 specimens .
the final figure will also include species not yet listed in the ocean biogeographic information system , or obis – a permanent database featuring millions of records that aid both researchers and policymakers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 03.08.2010 syria-saudi pact promises peace but lebanon remains on tenterhooks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more than peace at stake for abdullah and assad the visit by syrian president bashar al-assad and saudi king abdullah to lebanon has been hailed as a significant step at easing the simmering tensions in the country .
some experts , however , are far from convinced . with reports of clashes between lebanese and israeli forces , fears of a renewed conflict in lebanon have been growing ever since hassan nasrallah , the leader of the shiite militant group hezbollah , claimed members of his party were on the verge of being indicted by a un tribunal probing the 2005 murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri .
the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- is investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result .
however , relations have been slowly normalizing , as indicated by president assad 's visit to lebanon recently - his first since hariri 's assassination .
while that in itself could be seen as a breakthrough , assad 's accompanying of king abdullah - a close supporter of the sunni muslim hariri family - has been hailed as being even more significant .
syria and saudi arabia have been on opposing sides in many of the complicated feuds in the middle east , including that over influence in lebanon , for decades .
regional rivals the closest of enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah paralyzed beirut with strikes and unrest in 2008 some observers have welcomed the visit as an attempt to defuse a situation which could potentially lead to a conflict similar to that in may 2008 , when 100 people were killed in clashes that erupted when the government announced - and then repealed - a crackdown on hezbollah .
others , however , believe assad and abdullah 's mission could have wider , more damaging implications not only to lebanon 's stability but to the stability of the region as a whole .
" the hariri family and hezbollah , and their supporters , have been enemies for five or six years now which reflects the wider divisions in the middle east , " nadim shehadi , a lebanon expert with the middle east programme at chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" this situation has been akin to the cold war with the repercussions playing out everywhere from palestine to iraq . "
" the most important recent development was seen at last year 's arab league summit in doha where gaza was the main topic , " he added .
" the saudis were there , egypt , jordan … but the whole radical front boycotted the meeting .
there was no hamas , no hezbollah , no iran and no syria . "
" saudi arabia and egypt were forced to look into the abyss and they saw that their power as interlocutors and mediators was under threat .
any deal in the region could be aborted by the radicals .
it meant that more say had to be given to others for any progress to be made . "
saudi arabia seen as giving syria its backing to return to beirut some analysts see king abdullah 's joint visit to lebanon with assad as the next step in a transfer of power and an indication that , instead of opposing a return to syrian domination of lebanon , saudi arabia is giving it its blessing .
the visit is seen by some as a clear message that syria , along with iran - another major backer of hezbollah , still holds sway in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad has met with prime minister saad hariri , rafiq 's son " bringing assad to lebanon on the saudi royal plane is a very big blessing indeed , " paul salem , the director of the carnegie endowment for international peace 's beirut bureau , told deutsche welle . " but saudi arabia brought assad to lebanon to help in a peace process not to give him carte blanche to do what he likes .
he was effectively brought in to stop his friends in hezbollah attacking the government .
this is a clear sign that it wo n't just be syria which is the go-to country for any lebanon crisis , but saudi arabia too .
the saudis need to be involved to protect their friends in the sunni community . " any resurgence of syrian influence in lebanon , however , could further complicate matters in regard to the stl 's findings and any indictment of hezbollah members in hariri 's murder .
both syria and hezbollah have an interest in bringing the tribunal to an end and have a number of devices at hand to potentially force this outcome .
while pressuring saudi arabia to use its relationship with the united states to postpone any indictment of hezbollah members , the saudis can not make the tribunal go away on their own .
syria and hezbollah would have to do their part . " when the lebanese government was preparing to call for a tribunal , hezbollah and the syria-affiliated parties in the government pulled out and closed down the parliament , " shehadi said . " hezbollah then took over the city and paralyzed the institutions , shutting down the government 's power to call its own tribunal .
so the pro-tribunal parties had to call on the un to form the tribunal , which was an unprecedented step .
it effectively forced the tribunal on lebanon and interfered in the running of a sovereign state . " " if the tribunal rules that syria and hezbollah was behind the hariri assassination , then there is a great chance that we will see violence in beirut .
what could precede that is an attempt by syria and hezbollah to either paralyze the lebanese government or change it .
in both cases , a new government under anti-tribunal control can call for the investigation to be called off , saying that the two sides have reconciled and there is no need for it to continue .
the un will have to agree to this unless it can be proved that the country has been hijacked . " hezbollah committed to changing beirut 's position paul salem believes that hezbollah will continue to push for the tribunal to be ended as long as it assumes that there is a political aspect to the tribunal 's process which is aimed at punishing its members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah is prepared to do all it can to influence policy " it 's obvious that syria and hezbollah wants the tribunal to go away and they have been doing their best by discrediting it publically and claiming that it is politicized , " salem said .
" they won ’ t be able to stop the tribunal as such but they could pressure the government to change its position through the threat of violence or by taking over beirut , which could lead to a statement of no-confidence in the tribunal or a withdrawal of support from the government . " " this could lead to a situation where the tribunal has no lebanese support which would mean arrest warrants could not be issued in lebanon or arrests made .
it could pass a guilty verdict on hezbollah and / or syria but little would change . " peace pact appears to hinge on tribunal ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese president sleiman , right , could tow the line for peace in the communique issued after the mini-summit between assad , abdullah and lebanese president michel sleiman , all of lebanon 's political parties were urged to " pursue the path of appeasement and dialogue and to boost national unity in the face of outside threats . "
the leaders stressed " the importance of stability ... the commitment -lrb- of the lebanese -rrb- not to resort to violence and the need to place the country 's interests above all sectarian interests , " the communique read .
avoiding a return to violence between hariri-supporting sunnis and the shiites of hezbollah in lebanon appears to be the main justification for the syrian-saudi agreement .
however , it appears that this pact between two of the main players from the opposing sides can only ensure peace by removing the tribunal problem , given that hezbollah has threatened to take whatever action it deems necessary should its members be indicted .

the police union wants to send police from turkey on patrol in problem neighborhoods in germany .
the goal is higher acceptance of german officers - but the idea is controversial . in front of a bridal store , a man and a woman sit on wooden chairs , drinking black tea from small glasses - an everyday scene in many towns in turkey .
but hatice koek 's bridal shop is located in germany , in the duisburg neighborhood of marxloh .
the 32-year-old koek has been selling wedding dresses here for years .
when she heard about the idea of using turkish police officers in north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is located , she was outraged .
it would be " a massive insult , to allow turkish police officers to patrol here , " koek said , not to mention destroying integration , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in berlin , a program trains young people of turkish origin as police officers the bridal shop is just one of many small businesses on wesel road operated by turkish immigrants .
restaurants , pharmacies , supermarkets , boutiques - all the businesses have turkish names .
visitors from turkey would feel right at home .
the residents , too , feel comfortable in their surroundings .
but do they really need turkish police ?
a turkish barber also rejected the idea .
" i would laugh if i saw a police officer here in a turkish uniform , " said a young man who was having his hair cut .
if someone has no respect for the german police , he wo n't take a turkish policeman seriously either , he said .
lack of respect but the head of the german police union in north rhine-westphalia is hoping for just that : erich rettinghaus wants to send turkish policemen on patrol with their german colleagues .
his goal is to find why young people of turkish origin often , in his opinion , have no respect for the police , and whether they would respond differently to turkish policemen .
according to rettinghaus ' plan , turkish officers would be deployed in immigrant-heavy districts such as marxloh in duisburg and ehrenfeld in cologne and given language support by turkish-speaking policemen and -women or interpreters . rettinghaus does n't see his suggestion as a declaration of helplessness .
rather , it 's more like an exchange , such as the ones with dutch police on the border to the netherlands .
" during peak holiday times , german police are dispatched to places where many german tourists go .
for example , in -lsb- the popular dutch resort town -rsb- renesse , there are german police to break up brawls in nightclubs and pubs , " says rettinghaus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many citizens with turkish background are skeptical of importing police officers but the presumed foreigners who live in marxloh and ehrenfeld are not tourists .
most of them were born in germany and are part of german society .
the lack of acceptance of german police goes both ways , said a group of young people in front of a video arcade .
the boys often feel they are treated badly .
" in fights between migrants , for example , the german police only show up after everything is over , " complained a 19-year-old .

restaurants , pharmacies , supermarkets , boutiques - all the businesses have turkish names .
visitors from turkey would feel right at home .
the residents , too , feel comfortable in their surroundings .
but do they really need turkish police ?
a turkish barber also rejected the idea .
" i would laugh if i saw a police officer here in a turkish uniform , " said a young man who was having his hair cut .
if someone has no respect for the german police , he wo n't take a turkish policeman seriously either , he said .
lack of respect but the head of the german police union in north rhine-westphalia is hoping for just that : erich rettinghaus wants to send turkish policemen on patrol with their german colleagues .
his goal is to find why young people of turkish origin often , in his opinion , have no respect for the police , and whether they would respond differently to turkish policemen .
according to rettinghaus ' plan , turkish officers would be deployed in immigrant-heavy districts such as marxloh in duisburg and ehrenfeld in cologne and given language support by turkish-speaking policemen and -women or interpreters . rettinghaus does n't see his suggestion as a declaration of helplessness .
rather , it 's more like an exchange , such as the ones with dutch police on the border to the netherlands .
" during peak holiday times , german police are dispatched to places where many german tourists go .
for example , in -lsb- the popular dutch resort town -rsb- renesse , there are german police to break up brawls in nightclubs and pubs , " says rettinghaus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many citizens with turkish background are skeptical of importing police officers but the presumed foreigners who live in marxloh and ehrenfeld are not tourists .
most of them were born in germany and are part of german society .
the lack of acceptance of german police goes both ways , said a group of young people in front of a video arcade .
the boys often feel they are treated badly .
" in fights between migrants , for example , the german police only show up after everything is over , " complained a 19-year-old .
another says : " if a german is caught cycling in the wrong bike lane , the policeman says simply : ' continue on . '
but a turk would be given a ticket right away . " ' guest officers ' with no authority these descriptions go against what rettinghaus says are police officers ' experiences on the beat : young people frequently try to prevent an arrest by attacking the patrol car and attempting to free the arrestee .
in such situations the turkish " guest police " could intervene by arbitrating , rettinghaus says .
however , the turkish police officers would have no legal powers and would not carry weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police sometimes collaborate with foreign police to patrol border areas although many marxloh residents are skeptical of the idea , some do believe that the deployment of turkish police officers would help to bridge the differences in attitude .
an older couple in a supermarket posits that the turkish uniforms would make a great impression on young people .
in one of the many traditional teahouses in marxloh , men are playing cards and backgammon .
a 32-year-old says he finds the idea of turkish police in germany absurd .
the state should educate young immigrants to join the police force instead , he argues .
he himself would be ready to give up his well-paid job , but he does n't have the necessary high school diploma to become an officer .
instead of getting policemen from turkey , who know neither the country nor the language , the state ought to approach people like him and recruit them , the outraged man said .
currently only one in seven of police trainees in north rhine-westphalia comes from an immigrant family .
rettinghaus would like to see more police officers with immigrant background .
working with turkish police , he says , is not an alternative , but a supplementary measure .
so far , however , there have been no talks with the turkish authorities .
whether his idea can be realized at all is still up in the air , admits rettinghaus .
the state interior ministry 's reaction has been " restrained , so far . "
but the state government has is new in office .
and the interior minister has many issues to tend to at the moment .
rettinghaus hopes that his proposal will get its turn soon .

most people will have heard of desertec , the initiative to construct large-scale solar and wind power plants in the north african desert .
not so the mediterranean solar plan , which at the moment is familiar only to industry insiders .
yet both initiatives are ambitiously pursuing similar goals .
the mediterranean solar plan aims to create 20 gigawatts ' worth of new renewable energy sources by 2020 – the equivalent of around 15 coal-fired power plants – whereas desertec has set itself the long-term goal of supplying 15 per cent of europe 's electricity by 2050 from its solar and wind power plants .
mediterranean management stalled early on but desertec making progress in december 2008 efforts to set up the ufm stalled due to the outbreak of the gaza war .
high-level ministerial meetings of member states being postponed and important decisions on the ufm 's structure being put on hold .
only now is the union taking the first steps to set up a secretariat in barcelona : a group of staff and experts from member states who will , among other things , help shape and implement the mediterranean solar plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the desertec industry initiative will provide 15 per cent of europe 's electricity by 2050 the desertec industry initiative -lrb- di -rrb- is developing at a much greater pace .
founded by 13 partners , most of them german , the consortium now has 17 partners from seven countries .
negotiations for tunisian and italian companies to join the consortium are advanced , and up to six further additions to the consortium are expected .
another 22 firms support dii as associated partners .
by expanding to include companies from the mena region , dii is also fulfilling demands that those countries in which power plants are to be built be involved from the outset .
two energy projects , one priority region given that access to energy is a cornerstone of the united nations ' millennium development goals , development of the mena region must take priority in both projects .
enormous population growth and increasing industrialization have left african countries with a great deal of catching up to do when it comes to energy projects .
industrialized nations are facing the challenges posed by climate change , which means prioritizing investment in renewable and efficient energy technologies – and the same must go for developing countries and emerging economies .
against this backdrop , the question arises of why fossil power plants are still being built in both industrialized and developing countries .
there are technical reasons for this : renewable energy sources like wind power and photovoltaics will not be able to serve as base-load energies until ‘ intelligent ' electricity grids and storage capacities become available .
what 's more , the cost of investing in renewables is still higher than that of investing in fossil fuel-fired power plants – although costs for fuels in these plants , like coal or natural gas , recur throughout the plants ' operation .
bildunterschrift : morocco " appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables " in the mena region what renewables and large-scale projects like the dii need are a clear legal , administrative and above all economic frameworks .
only then will the high investment costs pay off later .
the conditions must apply in those countries in which the power plants are to be constructed as well as to legislation in the european union and in eu member states that plan to import electricity from africa .
encouraging use of renewables in eu , germany and beyond the 2009 “ eu directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources ” already set the framework for energy projects with non-eu countries as well as for importing electricity generated .
in germany 's case , this means that the question of whether the renewable energy sources act will be extended to include a feed-in tariff for ‘ desert electricity ' is a critical one .
of all the countries in the mena region , morocco appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables .
the country currently imports 95 per cent of its energy requirements , but wants to increase its reliance on renewables to 40 per cent of total energy use by 2020 .
this is another reason that the dii consortium regards morocco as an ideal partner country and is planning to begin work on installing a first power plant park there – one it hopes will prove that the vision of generating electricity in the desert can be realized .
clear regulatory frameworks needed , not intergovernmental entrepreneurialism so , where do the two initiatives – the mediterranean solar plan and dii – now stand , one and two years respectively after they were founded and what priorities should they set for the future ?
the mediterranean solar plan is a political process and should be regarded as such .
it is not the task of an intergovernmental process to take on entrepreneurial initiatives and install power plants – especially when it takes two years to set up a secretariat .
the plan 's focus should , therefore , be on speeding up the process of creating the regulatory framework that will enable private-sector initiatives and investments in the ufm 's member countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser works with the german development institute the countries in the mena region still do not have enough financial clout to independently shoulder such cost-intensive cross-border infrastructure projects .
but the launch of the dii has already led some mena countries to re-shape their regulatory frameworks and set new goals in regard to expanding their renewables capacities .
this will not only make them more attractive to investors from industrialized countries but also for financial institutions such as , for example , the african development bank , the world bank and the european investment bank .
in that respect desertec and the mediterranean solar plan are parallel processes that should complement and cross-fertilize each other .

industrialized nations are facing the challenges posed by climate change , which means prioritizing investment in renewable and efficient energy technologies – and the same must go for developing countries and emerging economies .
against this backdrop , the question arises of why fossil power plants are still being built in both industrialized and developing countries .
there are technical reasons for this : renewable energy sources like wind power and photovoltaics will not be able to serve as base-load energies until ‘ intelligent ' electricity grids and storage capacities become available .
what 's more , the cost of investing in renewables is still higher than that of investing in fossil fuel-fired power plants – although costs for fuels in these plants , like coal or natural gas , recur throughout the plants ' operation .
bildunterschrift : morocco " appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables " in the mena region what renewables and large-scale projects like the dii need are a clear legal , administrative and above all economic frameworks .
only then will the high investment costs pay off later .
the conditions must apply in those countries in which the power plants are to be constructed as well as to legislation in the european union and in eu member states that plan to import electricity from africa .
encouraging use of renewables in eu , germany and beyond the 2009 “ eu directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources ” already set the framework for energy projects with non-eu countries as well as for importing electricity generated .
in germany 's case , this means that the question of whether the renewable energy sources act will be extended to include a feed-in tariff for ‘ desert electricity ' is a critical one .
of all the countries in the mena region , morocco appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables .
the country currently imports 95 per cent of its energy requirements , but wants to increase its reliance on renewables to 40 per cent of total energy use by 2020 .
this is another reason that the dii consortium regards morocco as an ideal partner country and is planning to begin work on installing a first power plant park there – one it hopes will prove that the vision of generating electricity in the desert can be realized .
clear regulatory frameworks needed , not intergovernmental entrepreneurialism so , where do the two initiatives – the mediterranean solar plan and dii – now stand , one and two years respectively after they were founded and what priorities should they set for the future ?
the mediterranean solar plan is a political process and should be regarded as such .
it is not the task of an intergovernmental process to take on entrepreneurial initiatives and install power plants – especially when it takes two years to set up a secretariat .
the plan 's focus should , therefore , be on speeding up the process of creating the regulatory framework that will enable private-sector initiatives and investments in the ufm 's member countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser works with the german development institute the countries in the mena region still do not have enough financial clout to independently shoulder such cost-intensive cross-border infrastructure projects .
but the launch of the dii has already led some mena countries to re-shape their regulatory frameworks and set new goals in regard to expanding their renewables capacities .
this will not only make them more attractive to investors from industrialized countries but also for financial institutions such as , for example , the african development bank , the world bank and the european investment bank .
in that respect desertec and the mediterranean solar plan are parallel processes that should complement and cross-fertilize each other .
the guest column represents the author 's personal opinion .

some experts , however , are far from convinced . with reports of clashes between lebanese and israeli forces , fears of a renewed conflict in lebanon have been growing ever since hassan nasrallah , the leader of the shiite militant group hezbollah , claimed members of his party were on the verge of being indicted by a un tribunal probing the 2005 murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri .
the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- is investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result .
however , relations have been slowly normalizing , as indicated by president assad 's visit to lebanon recently - his first since hariri 's assassination .
while that in itself could be seen as a breakthrough , assad 's accompanying of king abdullah - a close supporter of the sunni muslim hariri family - has been hailed as being even more significant .
syria and saudi arabia have been on opposing sides in many of the complicated feuds in the middle east , including that over influence in lebanon , for decades .
regional rivals the closest of enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah paralyzed beirut with strikes and unrest in 2008 some observers have welcomed the visit as an attempt to defuse a situation which could potentially lead to a conflict similar to that in may 2008 , when 100 people were killed in clashes that erupted when the government announced - and then repealed - a crackdown on hezbollah .
others , however , believe assad and abdullah 's mission could have wider , more damaging implications not only to lebanon 's stability but to the stability of the region as a whole .
" the hariri family and hezbollah , and their supporters , have been enemies for five or six years now which reflects the wider divisions in the middle east , " nadim shehadi , a lebanon expert with the middle east programme at chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" this situation has been akin to the cold war with the repercussions playing out everywhere from palestine to iraq . "
" the most important recent development was seen at last year 's arab league summit in doha where gaza was the main topic , " he added .
" the saudis were there , egypt , jordan … but the whole radical front boycotted the meeting .
there was no hamas , no hezbollah , no iran and no syria . "
" saudi arabia and egypt were forced to look into the abyss and they saw that their power as interlocutors and mediators was under threat .
any deal in the region could be aborted by the radicals .
it meant that more say had to be given to others for any progress to be made . "
saudi arabia seen as giving syria its backing to return to beirut some analysts see king abdullah 's joint visit to lebanon with assad as the next step in a transfer of power and an indication that , instead of opposing a return to syrian domination of lebanon , saudi arabia is giving it its blessing .
the visit is seen by some as a clear message that syria , along with iran - another major backer of hezbollah , still holds sway in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad has met with prime minister saad hariri , rafiq 's son " bringing assad to lebanon on the saudi royal plane is a very big blessing indeed , " paul salem , the director of the carnegie endowment for international peace 's beirut bureau , told deutsche welle . " but saudi arabia brought assad to lebanon to help in a peace process not to give him carte blanche to do what he likes .
he was effectively brought in to stop his friends in hezbollah attacking the government .
this is a clear sign that it wo n't just be syria which is the go-to country for any lebanon crisis , but saudi arabia too .
the saudis need to be involved to protect their friends in the sunni community . " any resurgence of syrian influence in lebanon , however , could further complicate matters in regard to the stl 's findings and any indictment of hezbollah members in hariri 's murder .
both syria and hezbollah have an interest in bringing the tribunal to an end and have a number of devices at hand to potentially force this outcome .
while pressuring saudi arabia to use its relationship with the united states to postpone any indictment of hezbollah members , the saudis can not make the tribunal go away on their own .
syria and hezbollah would have to do their part . " when the lebanese government was preparing to call for a tribunal , hezbollah and the syria-affiliated parties in the government pulled out and closed down the parliament , " shehadi said . " hezbollah then took over the city and paralyzed the institutions , shutting down the government 's power to call its own tribunal .
so the pro-tribunal parties had to call on the un to form the tribunal , which was an unprecedented step .
it effectively forced the tribunal on lebanon and interfered in the running of a sovereign state . " " if the tribunal rules that syria and hezbollah was behind the hariri assassination , then there is a great chance that we will see violence in beirut .
what could precede that is an attempt by syria and hezbollah to either paralyze the lebanese government or change it .
in both cases , a new government under anti-tribunal control can call for the investigation to be called off , saying that the two sides have reconciled and there is no need for it to continue .
the un will have to agree to this unless it can be proved that the country has been hijacked . " hezbollah committed to changing beirut 's position paul salem believes that hezbollah will continue to push for the tribunal to be ended as long as it assumes that there is a political aspect to the tribunal 's process which is aimed at punishing its members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah is prepared to do all it can to influence policy " it 's obvious that syria and hezbollah wants the tribunal to go away and they have been doing their best by discrediting it publically and claiming that it is politicized , " salem said .
" they won ’ t be able to stop the tribunal as such but they could pressure the government to change its position through the threat of violence or by taking over beirut , which could lead to a statement of no-confidence in the tribunal or a withdrawal of support from the government . " " this could lead to a situation where the tribunal has no lebanese support which would mean arrest warrants could not be issued in lebanon or arrests made .
it could pass a guilty verdict on hezbollah and / or syria but little would change . " peace pact appears to hinge on tribunal ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese president sleiman , right , could tow the line for peace in the communique issued after the mini-summit between assad , abdullah and lebanese president michel sleiman , all of lebanon 's political parties were urged to " pursue the path of appeasement and dialogue and to boost national unity in the face of outside threats . "
the leaders stressed " the importance of stability ... the commitment -lrb- of the lebanese -rrb- not to resort to violence and the need to place the country 's interests above all sectarian interests , " the communique read .
avoiding a return to violence between hariri-supporting sunnis and the shiites of hezbollah in lebanon appears to be the main justification for the syrian-saudi agreement .
however , it appears that this pact between two of the main players from the opposing sides can only ensure peace by removing the tribunal problem , given that hezbollah has threatened to take whatever action it deems necessary should its members be indicted .

" the hariri family and hezbollah , and their supporters , have been enemies for five or six years now which reflects the wider divisions in the middle east , " nadim shehadi , a lebanon expert with the middle east programme at chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" this situation has been akin to the cold war with the repercussions playing out everywhere from palestine to iraq . "
" the most important recent development was seen at last year 's arab league summit in doha where gaza was the main topic , " he added .
" the saudis were there , egypt , jordan … but the whole radical front boycotted the meeting .
there was no hamas , no hezbollah , no iran and no syria . "
" saudi arabia and egypt were forced to look into the abyss and they saw that their power as interlocutors and mediators was under threat .
any deal in the region could be aborted by the radicals .
it meant that more say had to be given to others for any progress to be made . "
saudi arabia seen as giving syria its backing to return to beirut some analysts see king abdullah 's joint visit to lebanon with assad as the next step in a transfer of power and an indication that , instead of opposing a return to syrian domination of lebanon , saudi arabia is giving it its blessing .
the visit is seen by some as a clear message that syria , along with iran - another major backer of hezbollah , still holds sway in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad has met with prime minister saad hariri , rafiq 's son " bringing assad to lebanon on the saudi royal plane is a very big blessing indeed , " paul salem , the director of the carnegie endowment for international peace 's beirut bureau , told deutsche welle . " but saudi arabia brought assad to lebanon to help in a peace process not to give him carte blanche to do what he likes .
he was effectively brought in to stop his friends in hezbollah attacking the government .
this is a clear sign that it wo n't just be syria which is the go-to country for any lebanon crisis , but saudi arabia too .
the saudis need to be involved to protect their friends in the sunni community . " any resurgence of syrian influence in lebanon , however , could further complicate matters in regard to the stl 's findings and any indictment of hezbollah members in hariri 's murder .
both syria and hezbollah have an interest in bringing the tribunal to an end and have a number of devices at hand to potentially force this outcome .
while pressuring saudi arabia to use its relationship with the united states to postpone any indictment of hezbollah members , the saudis can not make the tribunal go away on their own .
syria and hezbollah would have to do their part . " when the lebanese government was preparing to call for a tribunal , hezbollah and the syria-affiliated parties in the government pulled out and closed down the parliament , " shehadi said . " hezbollah then took over the city and paralyzed the institutions , shutting down the government 's power to call its own tribunal .
so the pro-tribunal parties had to call on the un to form the tribunal , which was an unprecedented step .
it effectively forced the tribunal on lebanon and interfered in the running of a sovereign state . " " if the tribunal rules that syria and hezbollah was behind the hariri assassination , then there is a great chance that we will see violence in beirut .
what could precede that is an attempt by syria and hezbollah to either paralyze the lebanese government or change it .
in both cases , a new government under anti-tribunal control can call for the investigation to be called off , saying that the two sides have reconciled and there is no need for it to continue .
the un will have to agree to this unless it can be proved that the country has been hijacked . " hezbollah committed to changing beirut 's position paul salem believes that hezbollah will continue to push for the tribunal to be ended as long as it assumes that there is a political aspect to the tribunal 's process which is aimed at punishing its members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah is prepared to do all it can to influence policy " it 's obvious that syria and hezbollah wants the tribunal to go away and they have been doing their best by discrediting it publically and claiming that it is politicized , " salem said .
" they won ’ t be able to stop the tribunal as such but they could pressure the government to change its position through the threat of violence or by taking over beirut , which could lead to a statement of no-confidence in the tribunal or a withdrawal of support from the government . " " this could lead to a situation where the tribunal has no lebanese support which would mean arrest warrants could not be issued in lebanon or arrests made .
it could pass a guilty verdict on hezbollah and / or syria but little would change . " peace pact appears to hinge on tribunal ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese president sleiman , right , could tow the line for peace in the communique issued after the mini-summit between assad , abdullah and lebanese president michel sleiman , all of lebanon 's political parties were urged to " pursue the path of appeasement and dialogue and to boost national unity in the face of outside threats . "
the leaders stressed " the importance of stability ... the commitment -lrb- of the lebanese -rrb- not to resort to violence and the need to place the country 's interests above all sectarian interests , " the communique read .
avoiding a return to violence between hariri-supporting sunnis and the shiites of hezbollah in lebanon appears to be the main justification for the syrian-saudi agreement .
however , it appears that this pact between two of the main players from the opposing sides can only ensure peace by removing the tribunal problem , given that hezbollah has threatened to take whatever action it deems necessary should its members be indicted .

some experts , however , are far from convinced . with reports of clashes between lebanese and israeli forces , fears of a renewed conflict in lebanon have been growing ever since hassan nasrallah , the leader of the shiite militant group hezbollah , claimed members of his party were on the verge of being indicted by a un tribunal probing the 2005 murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri .
the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- is investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result .
however , relations have been slowly normalizing , as indicated by president assad 's visit to lebanon recently - his first since hariri 's assassination .
while that in itself could be seen as a breakthrough , assad 's accompanying of king abdullah - a close supporter of the sunni muslim hariri family - has been hailed as being even more significant .
syria and saudi arabia have been on opposing sides in many of the complicated feuds in the middle east , including that over influence in lebanon , for decades .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 03.08.2010 syria-saudi pact promises peace but lebanon remains on tenterhooks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more than peace at stake for abdullah and assad the visit by syrian president bashar al-assad and saudi king abdullah to lebanon has been hailed as a significant step at easing the simmering tensions in the country .
some experts , however , are far from convinced . with reports of clashes between lebanese and israeli forces , fears of a renewed conflict in lebanon have been growing ever since hassan nasrallah , the leader of the shiite militant group hezbollah , claimed members of his party were on the verge of being indicted by a un tribunal probing the 2005 murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri .
the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- is investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result .
however , relations have been slowly normalizing , as indicated by president assad 's visit to lebanon recently - his first since hariri 's assassination .
while that in itself could be seen as a breakthrough , assad 's accompanying of king abdullah - a close supporter of the sunni muslim hariri family - has been hailed as being even more significant .
syria and saudi arabia have been on opposing sides in many of the complicated feuds in the middle east , including that over influence in lebanon , for decades .
regional rivals the closest of enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah paralyzed beirut with strikes and unrest in 2008 some observers have welcomed the visit as an attempt to defuse a situation which could potentially lead to a conflict similar to that in may 2008 , when 100 people were killed in clashes that erupted when the government announced - and then repealed - a crackdown on hezbollah .
others , however , believe assad and abdullah 's mission could have wider , more damaging implications not only to lebanon 's stability but to the stability of the region as a whole .
" the hariri family and hezbollah , and their supporters , have been enemies for five or six years now which reflects the wider divisions in the middle east , " nadim shehadi , a lebanon expert with the middle east programme at chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" this situation has been akin to the cold war with the repercussions playing out everywhere from palestine to iraq . "
" the most important recent development was seen at last year 's arab league summit in doha where gaza was the main topic , " he added .
" the saudis were there , egypt , jordan … but the whole radical front boycotted the meeting .
there was no hamas , no hezbollah , no iran and no syria . "
" saudi arabia and egypt were forced to look into the abyss and they saw that their power as interlocutors and mediators was under threat .
any deal in the region could be aborted by the radicals .
it meant that more say had to be given to others for any progress to be made . "
saudi arabia seen as giving syria its backing to return to beirut some analysts see king abdullah 's joint visit to lebanon with assad as the next step in a transfer of power and an indication that , instead of opposing a return to syrian domination of lebanon , saudi arabia is giving it its blessing .
the visit is seen by some as a clear message that syria , along with iran - another major backer of hezbollah , still holds sway in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad has met with prime minister saad hariri , rafiq 's son " bringing assad to lebanon on the saudi royal plane is a very big blessing indeed , " paul salem , the director of the carnegie endowment for international peace 's beirut bureau , told deutsche welle . " but saudi arabia brought assad to lebanon to help in a peace process not to give him carte blanche to do what he likes .
he was effectively brought in to stop his friends in hezbollah attacking the government .
this is a clear sign that it wo n't just be syria which is the go-to country for any lebanon crisis , but saudi arabia too .
the saudis need to be involved to protect their friends in the sunni community . " any resurgence of syrian influence in lebanon , however , could further complicate matters in regard to the stl 's findings and any indictment of hezbollah members in hariri 's murder .
both syria and hezbollah have an interest in bringing the tribunal to an end and have a number of devices at hand to potentially force this outcome .
while pressuring saudi arabia to use its relationship with the united states to postpone any indictment of hezbollah members , the saudis can not make the tribunal go away on their own .
syria and hezbollah would have to do their part . " when the lebanese government was preparing to call for a tribunal , hezbollah and the syria-affiliated parties in the government pulled out and closed down the parliament , " shehadi said . " hezbollah then took over the city and paralyzed the institutions , shutting down the government 's power to call its own tribunal .
so the pro-tribunal parties had to call on the un to form the tribunal , which was an unprecedented step .
it effectively forced the tribunal on lebanon and interfered in the running of a sovereign state . " " if the tribunal rules that syria and hezbollah was behind the hariri assassination , then there is a great chance that we will see violence in beirut .
what could precede that is an attempt by syria and hezbollah to either paralyze the lebanese government or change it .
in both cases , a new government under anti-tribunal control can call for the investigation to be called off , saying that the two sides have reconciled and there is no need for it to continue .
the un will have to agree to this unless it can be proved that the country has been hijacked . " hezbollah committed to changing beirut 's position paul salem believes that hezbollah will continue to push for the tribunal to be ended as long as it assumes that there is a political aspect to the tribunal 's process which is aimed at punishing its members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah is prepared to do all it can to influence policy " it 's obvious that syria and hezbollah wants the tribunal to go away and they have been doing their best by discrediting it publically and claiming that it is politicized , " salem said .
" they won ’ t be able to stop the tribunal as such but they could pressure the government to change its position through the threat of violence or by taking over beirut , which could lead to a statement of no-confidence in the tribunal or a withdrawal of support from the government . " " this could lead to a situation where the tribunal has no lebanese support which would mean arrest warrants could not be issued in lebanon or arrests made .
it could pass a guilty verdict on hezbollah and / or syria but little would change . " peace pact appears to hinge on tribunal ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese president sleiman , right , could tow the line for peace in the communique issued after the mini-summit between assad , abdullah and lebanese president michel sleiman , all of lebanon 's political parties were urged to " pursue the path of appeasement and dialogue and to boost national unity in the face of outside threats . "
the leaders stressed " the importance of stability ... the commitment -lrb- of the lebanese -rrb- not to resort to violence and the need to place the country 's interests above all sectarian interests , " the communique read .
avoiding a return to violence between hariri-supporting sunnis and the shiites of hezbollah in lebanon appears to be the main justification for the syrian-saudi agreement .
however , it appears that this pact between two of the main players from the opposing sides can only ensure peace by removing the tribunal problem , given that hezbollah has threatened to take whatever action it deems necessary should its members be indicted .

the police union wants to send police from turkey on patrol in problem neighborhoods in germany .
the goal is higher acceptance of german officers - but the idea is controversial . in front of a bridal store , a man and a woman sit on wooden chairs , drinking black tea from small glasses - an everyday scene in many towns in turkey .
but hatice koek 's bridal shop is located in germany , in the duisburg neighborhood of marxloh .
the 32-year-old koek has been selling wedding dresses here for years .
when she heard about the idea of using turkish police officers in north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is located , she was outraged .
it would be " a massive insult , to allow turkish police officers to patrol here , " koek said , not to mention destroying integration , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in berlin , a program trains young people of turkish origin as police officers the bridal shop is just one of many small businesses on wesel road operated by turkish immigrants .
restaurants , pharmacies , supermarkets , boutiques - all the businesses have turkish names .
visitors from turkey would feel right at home .
the residents , too , feel comfortable in their surroundings .
but do they really need turkish police ?
a turkish barber also rejected the idea .
" i would laugh if i saw a police officer here in a turkish uniform , " said a young man who was having his hair cut .
if someone has no respect for the german police , he wo n't take a turkish policeman seriously either , he said .
lack of respect but the head of the german police union in north rhine-westphalia is hoping for just that : erich rettinghaus wants to send turkish policemen on patrol with their german colleagues .
his goal is to find why young people of turkish origin often , in his opinion , have no respect for the police , and whether they would respond differently to turkish policemen .
according to rettinghaus ' plan , turkish officers would be deployed in immigrant-heavy districts such as marxloh in duisburg and ehrenfeld in cologne and given language support by turkish-speaking policemen and -women or interpreters . rettinghaus does n't see his suggestion as a declaration of helplessness .
rather , it 's more like an exchange , such as the ones with dutch police on the border to the netherlands .
" during peak holiday times , german police are dispatched to places where many german tourists go .
for example , in -lsb- the popular dutch resort town -rsb- renesse , there are german police to break up brawls in nightclubs and pubs , " says rettinghaus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many citizens with turkish background are skeptical of importing police officers but the presumed foreigners who live in marxloh and ehrenfeld are not tourists .
most of them were born in germany and are part of german society .
the lack of acceptance of german police goes both ways , said a group of young people in front of a video arcade .
the boys often feel they are treated badly .
" in fights between migrants , for example , the german police only show up after everything is over , " complained a 19-year-old .
another says : " if a german is caught cycling in the wrong bike lane , the policeman says simply : ' continue on . '
but a turk would be given a ticket right away . " ' guest officers ' with no authority these descriptions go against what rettinghaus says are police officers ' experiences on the beat : young people frequently try to prevent an arrest by attacking the patrol car and attempting to free the arrestee .
in such situations the turkish " guest police " could intervene by arbitrating , rettinghaus says .
however , the turkish police officers would have no legal powers and would not carry weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police sometimes collaborate with foreign police to patrol border areas although many marxloh residents are skeptical of the idea , some do believe that the deployment of turkish police officers would help to bridge the differences in attitude .
an older couple in a supermarket posits that the turkish uniforms would make a great impression on young people .
in one of the many traditional teahouses in marxloh , men are playing cards and backgammon .
a 32-year-old says he finds the idea of turkish police in germany absurd .
the state should educate young immigrants to join the police force instead , he argues .
he himself would be ready to give up his well-paid job , but he does n't have the necessary high school diploma to become an officer .
instead of getting policemen from turkey , who know neither the country nor the language , the state ought to approach people like him and recruit them , the outraged man said .
currently only one in seven of police trainees in north rhine-westphalia comes from an immigrant family .
rettinghaus would like to see more police officers with immigrant background .
working with turkish police , he says , is not an alternative , but a supplementary measure .
so far , however , there have been no talks with the turkish authorities .
whether his idea can be realized at all is still up in the air , admits rettinghaus .
the state interior ministry 's reaction has been " restrained , so far . "
but the state government has is new in office .
and the interior minister has many issues to tend to at the moment .
rettinghaus hopes that his proposal will get its turn soon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 03.08.2010 syria-saudi pact promises peace but lebanon remains on tenterhooks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more than peace at stake for abdullah and assad the visit by syrian president bashar al-assad and saudi king abdullah to lebanon has been hailed as a significant step at easing the simmering tensions in the country .
some experts , however , are far from convinced . with reports of clashes between lebanese and israeli forces , fears of a renewed conflict in lebanon have been growing ever since hassan nasrallah , the leader of the shiite militant group hezbollah , claimed members of his party were on the verge of being indicted by a un tribunal probing the 2005 murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri .
the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- is investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result .
however , relations have been slowly normalizing , as indicated by president assad 's visit to lebanon recently - his first since hariri 's assassination .
while that in itself could be seen as a breakthrough , assad 's accompanying of king abdullah - a close supporter of the sunni muslim hariri family - has been hailed as being even more significant .
syria and saudi arabia have been on opposing sides in many of the complicated feuds in the middle east , including that over influence in lebanon , for decades .
regional rivals the closest of enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah paralyzed beirut with strikes and unrest in 2008 some observers have welcomed the visit as an attempt to defuse a situation which could potentially lead to a conflict similar to that in may 2008 , when 100 people were killed in clashes that erupted when the government announced - and then repealed - a crackdown on hezbollah .
others , however , believe assad and abdullah 's mission could have wider , more damaging implications not only to lebanon 's stability but to the stability of the region as a whole .
" the hariri family and hezbollah , and their supporters , have been enemies for five or six years now which reflects the wider divisions in the middle east , " nadim shehadi , a lebanon expert with the middle east programme at chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" this situation has been akin to the cold war with the repercussions playing out everywhere from palestine to iraq . "
" the most important recent development was seen at last year 's arab league summit in doha where gaza was the main topic , " he added .
" the saudis were there , egypt , jordan … but the whole radical front boycotted the meeting .
there was no hamas , no hezbollah , no iran and no syria . "
" saudi arabia and egypt were forced to look into the abyss and they saw that their power as interlocutors and mediators was under threat .
any deal in the region could be aborted by the radicals .
it meant that more say had to be given to others for any progress to be made . "
saudi arabia seen as giving syria its backing to return to beirut some analysts see king abdullah 's joint visit to lebanon with assad as the next step in a transfer of power and an indication that , instead of opposing a return to syrian domination of lebanon , saudi arabia is giving it its blessing .
the visit is seen by some as a clear message that syria , along with iran - another major backer of hezbollah , still holds sway in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad has met with prime minister saad hariri , rafiq 's son " bringing assad to lebanon on the saudi royal plane is a very big blessing indeed , " paul salem , the director of the carnegie endowment for international peace 's beirut bureau , told deutsche welle . " but saudi arabia brought assad to lebanon to help in a peace process not to give him carte blanche to do what he likes .
he was effectively brought in to stop his friends in hezbollah attacking the government .
this is a clear sign that it wo n't just be syria which is the go-to country for any lebanon crisis , but saudi arabia too .
the saudis need to be involved to protect their friends in the sunni community . " any resurgence of syrian influence in lebanon , however , could further complicate matters in regard to the stl 's findings and any indictment of hezbollah members in hariri 's murder .
both syria and hezbollah have an interest in bringing the tribunal to an end and have a number of devices at hand to potentially force this outcome .
while pressuring saudi arabia to use its relationship with the united states to postpone any indictment of hezbollah members , the saudis can not make the tribunal go away on their own .
syria and hezbollah would have to do their part . " when the lebanese government was preparing to call for a tribunal , hezbollah and the syria-affiliated parties in the government pulled out and closed down the parliament , " shehadi said . " hezbollah then took over the city and paralyzed the institutions , shutting down the government 's power to call its own tribunal .
so the pro-tribunal parties had to call on the un to form the tribunal , which was an unprecedented step .
it effectively forced the tribunal on lebanon and interfered in the running of a sovereign state . " " if the tribunal rules that syria and hezbollah was behind the hariri assassination , then there is a great chance that we will see violence in beirut .
what could precede that is an attempt by syria and hezbollah to either paralyze the lebanese government or change it .
in both cases , a new government under anti-tribunal control can call for the investigation to be called off , saying that the two sides have reconciled and there is no need for it to continue .
the un will have to agree to this unless it can be proved that the country has been hijacked . " hezbollah committed to changing beirut 's position paul salem believes that hezbollah will continue to push for the tribunal to be ended as long as it assumes that there is a political aspect to the tribunal 's process which is aimed at punishing its members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah is prepared to do all it can to influence policy " it 's obvious that syria and hezbollah wants the tribunal to go away and they have been doing their best by discrediting it publically and claiming that it is politicized , " salem said .
" they won ’ t be able to stop the tribunal as such but they could pressure the government to change its position through the threat of violence or by taking over beirut , which could lead to a statement of no-confidence in the tribunal or a withdrawal of support from the government . " " this could lead to a situation where the tribunal has no lebanese support which would mean arrest warrants could not be issued in lebanon or arrests made .
it could pass a guilty verdict on hezbollah and / or syria but little would change . " peace pact appears to hinge on tribunal ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese president sleiman , right , could tow the line for peace in the communique issued after the mini-summit between assad , abdullah and lebanese president michel sleiman , all of lebanon 's political parties were urged to " pursue the path of appeasement and dialogue and to boost national unity in the face of outside threats . "
the leaders stressed " the importance of stability ... the commitment -lrb- of the lebanese -rrb- not to resort to violence and the need to place the country 's interests above all sectarian interests , " the communique read .
avoiding a return to violence between hariri-supporting sunnis and the shiites of hezbollah in lebanon appears to be the main justification for the syrian-saudi agreement .
however , it appears that this pact between two of the main players from the opposing sides can only ensure peace by removing the tribunal problem , given that hezbollah has threatened to take whatever action it deems necessary should its members be indicted .

avoiding a return to violence between hariri-supporting sunnis and the shiites of hezbollah in lebanon appears to be the main justification for the syrian-saudi agreement .
however , it appears that this pact between two of the main players from the opposing sides can only ensure peace by removing the tribunal problem , given that hezbollah has threatened to take whatever action it deems necessary should its members be indicted .

some experts , however , are far from convinced . with reports of clashes between lebanese and israeli forces , fears of a renewed conflict in lebanon have been growing ever since hassan nasrallah , the leader of the shiite militant group hezbollah , claimed members of his party were on the verge of being indicted by a un tribunal probing the 2005 murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri .
the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- is investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result .
however , relations have been slowly normalizing , as indicated by president assad 's visit to lebanon recently - his first since hariri 's assassination .
while that in itself could be seen as a breakthrough , assad 's accompanying of king abdullah - a close supporter of the sunni muslim hariri family - has been hailed as being even more significant .
syria and saudi arabia have been on opposing sides in many of the complicated feuds in the middle east , including that over influence in lebanon , for decades .
regional rivals the closest of enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah paralyzed beirut with strikes and unrest in 2008 some observers have welcomed the visit as an attempt to defuse a situation which could potentially lead to a conflict similar to that in may 2008 , when 100 people were killed in clashes that erupted when the government announced - and then repealed - a crackdown on hezbollah .
others , however , believe assad and abdullah 's mission could have wider , more damaging implications not only to lebanon 's stability but to the stability of the region as a whole .
" the hariri family and hezbollah , and their supporters , have been enemies for five or six years now which reflects the wider divisions in the middle east , " nadim shehadi , a lebanon expert with the middle east programme at chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" this situation has been akin to the cold war with the repercussions playing out everywhere from palestine to iraq . "
" the most important recent development was seen at last year 's arab league summit in doha where gaza was the main topic , " he added .
" the saudis were there , egypt , jordan … but the whole radical front boycotted the meeting .
there was no hamas , no hezbollah , no iran and no syria . "
" saudi arabia and egypt were forced to look into the abyss and they saw that their power as interlocutors and mediators was under threat .
any deal in the region could be aborted by the radicals .
it meant that more say had to be given to others for any progress to be made . "
saudi arabia seen as giving syria its backing to return to beirut some analysts see king abdullah 's joint visit to lebanon with assad as the next step in a transfer of power and an indication that , instead of opposing a return to syrian domination of lebanon , saudi arabia is giving it its blessing .
the visit is seen by some as a clear message that syria , along with iran - another major backer of hezbollah , still holds sway in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad has met with prime minister saad hariri , rafiq 's son " bringing assad to lebanon on the saudi royal plane is a very big blessing indeed , " paul salem , the director of the carnegie endowment for international peace 's beirut bureau , told deutsche welle . " but saudi arabia brought assad to lebanon to help in a peace process not to give him carte blanche to do what he likes .
he was effectively brought in to stop his friends in hezbollah attacking the government .
this is a clear sign that it wo n't just be syria which is the go-to country for any lebanon crisis , but saudi arabia too .
the saudis need to be involved to protect their friends in the sunni community . " any resurgence of syrian influence in lebanon , however , could further complicate matters in regard to the stl 's findings and any indictment of hezbollah members in hariri 's murder .
both syria and hezbollah have an interest in bringing the tribunal to an end and have a number of devices at hand to potentially force this outcome .
while pressuring saudi arabia to use its relationship with the united states to postpone any indictment of hezbollah members , the saudis can not make the tribunal go away on their own .
syria and hezbollah would have to do their part . " when the lebanese government was preparing to call for a tribunal , hezbollah and the syria-affiliated parties in the government pulled out and closed down the parliament , " shehadi said . " hezbollah then took over the city and paralyzed the institutions , shutting down the government 's power to call its own tribunal .
so the pro-tribunal parties had to call on the un to form the tribunal , which was an unprecedented step .
it effectively forced the tribunal on lebanon and interfered in the running of a sovereign state . " " if the tribunal rules that syria and hezbollah was behind the hariri assassination , then there is a great chance that we will see violence in beirut .
what could precede that is an attempt by syria and hezbollah to either paralyze the lebanese government or change it .
in both cases , a new government under anti-tribunal control can call for the investigation to be called off , saying that the two sides have reconciled and there is no need for it to continue .
the un will have to agree to this unless it can be proved that the country has been hijacked . " hezbollah committed to changing beirut 's position paul salem believes that hezbollah will continue to push for the tribunal to be ended as long as it assumes that there is a political aspect to the tribunal 's process which is aimed at punishing its members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah is prepared to do all it can to influence policy " it 's obvious that syria and hezbollah wants the tribunal to go away and they have been doing their best by discrediting it publically and claiming that it is politicized , " salem said .
" they won ’ t be able to stop the tribunal as such but they could pressure the government to change its position through the threat of violence or by taking over beirut , which could lead to a statement of no-confidence in the tribunal or a withdrawal of support from the government . " " this could lead to a situation where the tribunal has no lebanese support which would mean arrest warrants could not be issued in lebanon or arrests made .
it could pass a guilty verdict on hezbollah and / or syria but little would change . " peace pact appears to hinge on tribunal ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese president sleiman , right , could tow the line for peace in the communique issued after the mini-summit between assad , abdullah and lebanese president michel sleiman , all of lebanon 's political parties were urged to " pursue the path of appeasement and dialogue and to boost national unity in the face of outside threats .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 03.08.2010 bmw leads the pack of booming german auto exporters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's sales shattered expectations bmw has seen a sevenfold increase in second quarter profits due to strong sales in asia and the us .
despite the slump in europe 's market - and summer coming to an end - analysts predict bmw can keep up the good work . german car exporters have seen a significant rise in overseas sales with munich 's luxury automaker bmw leading the pack , according to figures released tuesday .
the association of german automakers -lrb- vda -rrb- said tuesday that german automakers exported 312,400 cars in july , clinching a 6 percent increase over the same month in 2009 .
for the first seven months of 2010 , total car exports were up 39 percent to nearly 2.5 million automobiles .
bmw placed itself solidly ahead of audi and mercedes , with a sevenfold year-on-year profit increase .
the company posted a second quarter net profit of 834 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- , compared with 121 million euros for the same period in 2009 .
in the united states alone , the group 's july sales hit 21,253 automobiles , increasing bmw 's us sales by 10.1 percent over last july .
bmw 's results shattered the predictions of a dow jones newswires poll , which had forecast profits of 674 million euros .
meanwhile , daimler , which owns mercedes benz , has raised its core earnings predictions to six billion euros for 2010 .
europe 's biggest car maker and audi parent group , volkswagen , plans to sell a record 6.3 million vehicles .
bmw claims improved construction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new 5 series is expected to keep sales rolling meanwhile , friedrich eichiner , bmw 's chief financial officer , credited the company 's success to improved construction .
the introduction of a new modular construction system , bmw ceo norbert reithofer said , would also increase bmw 's profits with every new model to come .
the luxury automaker produced cars in 2010 that were more expensive than any models it had produced since november 2007 , and dz bank 's auto expert , jaski terzic , predicted that the automaker 's new 5 series and its countryman mini-suvs would promise high profits for the second two quarters as well .
a falling euro equals rising sales in recent months , european automakers have benefited from the euro 's fall in value against the dollar , according to automotive professor willi dietz from germany 's ifa automotive economic institute .
the tumbling euro " greatly improves their situation in most of the asian and north american markets , " dietz said .
yet , while asian and american markets have boomed , european markets have cooled down .
new car sales in france , italy and spain fell sharply in july , and the us market is expected to slow as summer comes to an end .
" we can not say this will last for the next 12 months , " dietz told the afp news agency .
new car registrations in germany itself have slumped since a government car-scrapping program to boost recession sales came to an end .
they were down 30 percentm , with 237,500 cars sold in july .

his goal is to find why young people of turkish origin often , in his opinion , have no respect for the police , and whether they would respond differently to turkish policemen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de renewables -pipe- 03.08.2010 opinion : desertec or mediterranean solar plan – whose sun is shining brighter ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two renewables projects should " should complement and cross-fertilize each other " matthias ruchser takes stock of how much progress two cross-border renewables projects - the desertec industry initiative and the mediterranean solar plan - have made so far . july 13 marked the anniversary of two events that could prove extremely important for future energy supplies in europe and the middle east and north africa region -lrb- mena -rrb- : the establishment of the union for the mediterranean -lrb- ufm -rrb- and its mediterranean solar plan in 2008 , and the founding of the commercial desertec industry initiative last year .
most people will have heard of desertec , the initiative to construct large-scale solar and wind power plants in the north african desert .
not so the mediterranean solar plan , which at the moment is familiar only to industry insiders .
yet both initiatives are ambitiously pursuing similar goals .
the mediterranean solar plan aims to create 20 gigawatts ' worth of new renewable energy sources by 2020 – the equivalent of around 15 coal-fired power plants – whereas desertec has set itself the long-term goal of supplying 15 per cent of europe 's electricity by 2050 from its solar and wind power plants .
mediterranean management stalled early on but desertec making progress in december 2008 efforts to set up the ufm stalled due to the outbreak of the gaza war .
high-level ministerial meetings of member states being postponed and important decisions on the ufm 's structure being put on hold .
only now is the union taking the first steps to set up a secretariat in barcelona : a group of staff and experts from member states who will , among other things , help shape and implement the mediterranean solar plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the desertec industry initiative will provide 15 per cent of europe 's electricity by 2050 the desertec industry initiative -lrb- di -rrb- is developing at a much greater pace .
founded by 13 partners , most of them german , the consortium now has 17 partners from seven countries .
negotiations for tunisian and italian companies to join the consortium are advanced , and up to six further additions to the consortium are expected .
another 22 firms support dii as associated partners .
by expanding to include companies from the mena region , dii is also fulfilling demands that those countries in which power plants are to be built be involved from the outset .
two energy projects , one priority region given that access to energy is a cornerstone of the united nations ' millennium development goals , development of the mena region must take priority in both projects .
enormous population growth and increasing industrialization have left african countries with a great deal of catching up to do when it comes to energy projects .
industrialized nations are facing the challenges posed by climate change , which means prioritizing investment in renewable and efficient energy technologies – and the same must go for developing countries and emerging economies .
against this backdrop , the question arises of why fossil power plants are still being built in both industrialized and developing countries .
there are technical reasons for this : renewable energy sources like wind power and photovoltaics will not be able to serve as base-load energies until ‘ intelligent ' electricity grids and storage capacities become available .
what 's more , the cost of investing in renewables is still higher than that of investing in fossil fuel-fired power plants – although costs for fuels in these plants , like coal or natural gas , recur throughout the plants ' operation .
bildunterschrift : morocco " appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables " in the mena region what renewables and large-scale projects like the dii need are a clear legal , administrative and above all economic frameworks .
only then will the high investment costs pay off later .
the conditions must apply in those countries in which the power plants are to be constructed as well as to legislation in the european union and in eu member states that plan to import electricity from africa .
encouraging use of renewables in eu , germany and beyond the 2009 “ eu directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources ” already set the framework for energy projects with non-eu countries as well as for importing electricity generated .
in germany 's case , this means that the question of whether the renewable energy sources act will be extended to include a feed-in tariff for ‘ desert electricity ' is a critical one .
of all the countries in the mena region , morocco appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables .
the country currently imports 95 per cent of its energy requirements , but wants to increase its reliance on renewables to 40 per cent of total energy use by 2020 .
this is another reason that the dii consortium regards morocco as an ideal partner country and is planning to begin work on installing a first power plant park there – one it hopes will prove that the vision of generating electricity in the desert can be realized .
clear regulatory frameworks needed , not intergovernmental entrepreneurialism so , where do the two initiatives – the mediterranean solar plan and dii – now stand , one and two years respectively after they were founded and what priorities should they set for the future ?
the mediterranean solar plan is a political process and should be regarded as such .
it is not the task of an intergovernmental process to take on entrepreneurial initiatives and install power plants – especially when it takes two years to set up a secretariat .
the plan 's focus should , therefore , be on speeding up the process of creating the regulatory framework that will enable private-sector initiatives and investments in the ufm 's member countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser works with the german development institute the countries in the mena region still do not have enough financial clout to independently shoulder such cost-intensive cross-border infrastructure projects .
but the launch of the dii has already led some mena countries to re-shape their regulatory frameworks and set new goals in regard to expanding their renewables capacities .
this will not only make them more attractive to investors from industrialized countries but also for financial institutions such as , for example , the african development bank , the world bank and the european investment bank .
in that respect desertec and the mediterranean solar plan are parallel processes that should complement and cross-fertilize each other .

dw-world.de europe searches for a common energy policy experts agree that the farewell to coal , oil , gas and also nuclear power can already be implemented technically .

most people will have heard of desertec , the initiative to construct large-scale solar and wind power plants in the north african desert .
not so the mediterranean solar plan , which at the moment is familiar only to industry insiders .
yet both initiatives are ambitiously pursuing similar goals .
the mediterranean solar plan aims to create 20 gigawatts ' worth of new renewable energy sources by 2020 – the equivalent of around 15 coal-fired power plants – whereas desertec has set itself the long-term goal of supplying 15 per cent of europe 's electricity by 2050 from its solar and wind power plants .
mediterranean management stalled early on but desertec making progress in december 2008 efforts to set up the ufm stalled due to the outbreak of the gaza war .
high-level ministerial meetings of member states being postponed and important decisions on the ufm 's structure being put on hold .
only now is the union taking the first steps to set up a secretariat in barcelona : a group of staff and experts from member states who will , among other things , help shape and implement the mediterranean solar plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the desertec industry initiative will provide 15 per cent of europe 's electricity by 2050 the desertec industry initiative -lrb- di -rrb- is developing at a much greater pace .
founded by 13 partners , most of them german , the consortium now has 17 partners from seven countries .
negotiations for tunisian and italian companies to join the consortium are advanced , and up to six further additions to the consortium are expected .
another 22 firms support dii as associated partners .
by expanding to include companies from the mena region , dii is also fulfilling demands that those countries in which power plants are to be built be involved from the outset .
two energy projects , one priority region given that access to energy is a cornerstone of the united nations ' millennium development goals , development of the mena region must take priority in both projects .
enormous population growth and increasing industrialization have left african countries with a great deal of catching up to do when it comes to energy projects .
industrialized nations are facing the challenges posed by climate change , which means prioritizing investment in renewable and efficient energy technologies – and the same must go for developing countries and emerging economies .
against this backdrop , the question arises of why fossil power plants are still being built in both industrialized and developing countries .
there are technical reasons for this : renewable energy sources like wind power and photovoltaics will not be able to serve as base-load energies until ‘ intelligent ' electricity grids and storage capacities become available .
what 's more , the cost of investing in renewables is still higher than that of investing in fossil fuel-fired power plants – although costs for fuels in these plants , like coal or natural gas , recur throughout the plants ' operation .
bildunterschrift : morocco " appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables " in the mena region what renewables and large-scale projects like the dii need are a clear legal , administrative and above all economic frameworks .
only then will the high investment costs pay off later .
the conditions must apply in those countries in which the power plants are to be constructed as well as to legislation in the european union and in eu member states that plan to import electricity from africa .
encouraging use of renewables in eu , germany and beyond the 2009 “ eu directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources ” already set the framework for energy projects with non-eu countries as well as for importing electricity generated .
in germany 's case , this means that the question of whether the renewable energy sources act will be extended to include a feed-in tariff for ‘ desert electricity ' is a critical one .
of all the countries in the mena region , morocco appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables .
the country currently imports 95 per cent of its energy requirements , but wants to increase its reliance on renewables to 40 per cent of total energy use by 2020 .
this is another reason that the dii consortium regards morocco as an ideal partner country and is planning to begin work on installing a first power plant park there – one it hopes will prove that the vision of generating electricity in the desert can be realized .
clear regulatory frameworks needed , not intergovernmental entrepreneurialism so , where do the two initiatives – the mediterranean solar plan and dii – now stand , one and two years respectively after they were founded and what priorities should they set for the future ?
the mediterranean solar plan is a political process and should be regarded as such .
it is not the task of an intergovernmental process to take on entrepreneurial initiatives and install power plants – especially when it takes two years to set up a secretariat .
the plan 's focus should , therefore , be on speeding up the process of creating the regulatory framework that will enable private-sector initiatives and investments in the ufm 's member countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser works with the german development institute the countries in the mena region still do not have enough financial clout to independently shoulder such cost-intensive cross-border infrastructure projects .
but the launch of the dii has already led some mena countries to re-shape their regulatory frameworks and set new goals in regard to expanding their renewables capacities .
this will not only make them more attractive to investors from industrialized countries but also for financial institutions such as , for example , the african development bank , the world bank and the european investment bank .
in that respect desertec and the mediterranean solar plan are parallel processes that should complement and cross-fertilize each other .

welcome to the future .
the international community 's efforts to reach binding agreement on tackling climate change have all failed .
when the kyoto protocol ran out in 2010 , it was never replaced .
the demands of the emerging nations were too great , as was the industrialized nations ' refusal to compromise .
the world 's main climate offenders were unwilling to foot the bill for repairing the damage to the planet , nor would they commit to any long-term reduction of carbon emissions . drastic spike in global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many regions will suffer from acute water shortages the results are palpable .
in 2009 , the co2 global average concentration in the earth 's atmosphere was about 0.0387 percent by volume , or 387 parts per million by volume -lrb- ppmv -rrb- .
by 2050 , it has reached 675 ppmv .
global warming has gathered pace even faster than was predicted in the early 21st century .
the average temperature is now four degrees higher than it during the beginning of the industrialization , and researchers expect a further rise of 4 to 5 degrees by the end of the century .
but levels of global warming vary dramatically from region to region : parts of europe have actually witnessed a drop in average temperatures due to the weakening of the gulf stream .
in stark contrast , the arctic and the north pole have experienced a record rise in temperatures of almost 8 degrees .
but increased carbon levels in the atmosphere are not the only reason for the galloping pace of global warming .
while it has triggered some processes which speeded up further warming , other effects have mitigated it .
with the balance between these positive and negative feedbacks serving as a major cause of uncertainty in climate predictions , scientists were unable to forecast these ‘ feedback effects . '
the thawing of permafrost in northern russia and canada , for example , accelerated global warming because methane was released in the process - a relatively potent greenhouse gas with 20 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide .
bildunterschrift : cities will be hard hit by natural disasters such as floods extreme weather the greenhouse effect has not only transformed siberia and northern canada into wastelands ; it has also led to disastrous weather extremes .
by 2050 , the frequency of typhoons and storm floods has increased in tropical countries .
the islands of the philippines are beset by strong coastal storms .
heavy rainfall regularly leads to landslides , which have already claimed entire villages . moreover , despite the heavy rainfall , the country is suffering from an acute shortage of freshwater : seawater had filtered into the country 's subterranean freshwater reserves and made it undrinkable .
another consequence is that it has increased salinity levels in soil . 200 million climate refugees the repercussions are severe .
viable farmland is urgently required to meet the needs of the world 's population , which has now reached 9 billion -lrb- compared to 6,7 billion in 2009 -rrb- .
200 million of them are climate refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : droughts will drastically raise the number of climate refugees in the world a percentage of them come from small atolls in the pacific ocean and the densely populated delta regions along the rivers ganges , mekong , nile and brahmaputra , which flooded as a result of rising sea levels .
but the majority comes from central asia and africa .
these people are not fleeing flooded regions , but the droughts that have led to mass starvation in many parts of the world .
in africa alone , almost one quarter of the continent 's 1.8 billion inhabitants are affected by water shortages .
mass migration present countries with new sets of problems : india in particular has been overwhelmed by waves of refugees from neighboring bangladesh .
india 's population now numbers 1.9 billion and its government is unable to provide sufficient food and medication for the refugees living in camps on the indian border .
despite united nations support , the spread of diseases such as cholera can not be stemmed , and are soon proliferating even outside the refugee camps . but the effects of climate change are not all negative .
by and large , northern europe has been spared extreme weather , and scandinavian countries are enjoying milder climates than they used to .
northern scandinavia in particular is home to large areas of land that can be used for agriculture . the collapse of ecosystems but many ecosystems have collapsed .
vulnerable coral reefs and mangrove woods have been destroyed by rising sea temperatures and levels , and a large part of the amazon rainforest has been reduced to a steppe .
many plant and animal species have died out .
in 2050 , mankind has paid a high price for its own survival - more than it would have cost to curb climate change in the first decades of the 21st century .
today , in 2010 , experts agree that well-off states only need to give up a small fraction of their wealth to prevent the worst .

global warming has gathered pace even faster than was predicted in the early 21st century .
the average temperature is now four degrees higher than it during the beginning of the industrialization , and researchers expect a further rise of 4 to 5 degrees by the end of the century .

the new ruling brings germany in line with the european court of human rights . when relationships end with a messy break-up , a disagreement over child custody is often one of the battlegrounds . on tuesday , the balance in such battles was tipped in favor of unmarried fathers by the german constitutional court in karlsruhe when it decided to overturn the current german law on child custody for unmarried couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strasbourg court said germany 's law must be changed ute granold , parliamentary spokesperson on family law for the governing christian democratic union , says that , until now , the mother has had the final say on whether the father has any rights at all .
" with unmarried parents , the father must first accept his paternity , " she explained .
" the mother must agree , and then the second step is going to the youth welfare office to apply for joint custody .
and here the mother can either accept or reject the claim . "
in future , although the mother will still automatically receive sole custody of the child , the father will have the right to challenge for joint custody in court .
government support this change has the enthusiastic backing of the german government , especially the junior coalition partners , the liberal free democrats .
hartfrid wolff , one of the party 's spokesmen on family policy , said , " we in the governing coalition agree that the issue must be about doing what is best for the child , and about raising the status of unmarried fathers , just as the european court of human rights has called for . "
the european court of human rights provoked tuesday 's decision last december , when it ruled that germany 's custody rules were contrary to both discrimination laws and article 8 of the european human rights convention , which protects the right to family life .
willi schoene belongs to a campaign for father 's rights that has welcomed the ruling as an important victory .
the campaign has long argued that mothers often deny the father joint custody because of a personal conflict , and not because they have the interests of the child at heart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court said the child 's interests were paramount schoene thinks children are too often used as a means to an end in a break-up .
" if i was a law-maker i would try to prevent the child from being seen as an economic factor , or a cash cow , " he said .
" that 's what it 's all about in the end .
in my experience , it 's always about power or money . "
extra stress for single parents the decision effectively means that the legal difference between married and unmarried couples has become smaller once again .
but edith schwab , of the association for single-parent families , has misgivings about the new ruling .
" the custody rights of fathers have been strengthened in that , for the first time , a right to sue has been introduced in germany , " she said .
" we have never had that before .
of course we have a few problems with the right to sue , because we know that every lawsuit about custody always causes a massive strain for the single-parent family . "
but those in favor of the new ruling believe that it will encourage unmarried fathers to take responsibility for their children .
german law-makers are now expected to draft the new law in the autumn .

but activists say living conditions will only really be improved if people have a say in their future . two years after the devastating earthquake shook the western chinese province of sichuan , the streets are still piled up with wood and rubble .
wang wei * runs a private research institute that is specialized in sustainable development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least 68,000 people were killed when an earthquake hit sichuan may 13 2008 although wang admits that the state has been effective in combating poverty , he says that there has to be more participation from the people .
his idea is to set up microcredit for rural communities so that " we can reach many goals at the same time – starting with the fight against poverty .
the loans and payments support local economic activity .
the government accepts this .
then the community can develop because it has new skills . " wang has a pilot project in a small village where the locals have taken out a loan to plant bamboo .
they have created a small cooperative and taken courses so that they can increase their income by a fifth over the next few years . " we ’ ve come a long way , " mr li , the proud community leader says .
" the cadres are respecting us more and more and giving us more support .
they come from other areas to learn from us .
we ’ re becoming better known .
this has a positive effect .
more and more people who are interested are coming to visit us .
the economy is developing on its own . " villagers not convinced by government plans wang hopes to transpose his ideas to another village a few kilometers away , where the inhabitants are not entirely convinced by government plans to relocate them .
mrs zhu , who lost her home to the earthquake , now lives in a government-built house , which has running water and an inside toilet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new government-built houses to replace those destroyed in 2008 but she is worried about the future : " i don ’ t know what life will be like here later .
we have to pay for everything here .
every month , we have to pay for electricity and water and gas .
it ’ s all going to be unitized later .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 03.08.2010 constitutional court split over role of armed forces in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court is split over the use of the military in germany germany 's constitutional court is reportedly divided over whether to allow the country 's military , the bundeswehr , to use all means at its disposal in the case of a high-level domestic security threat . germany 's constitutional court is reportedly split over the role of the country 's armed forces within german borders .
one half of the court , the first senate , says the bundeswehr should not be allowed to act offensively inside germany .
it says the constitution does n't allow it . but according to reports in the daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung , the second senate is reportedly pushing for an expanded domestic role for the armed forces .
the paper reports the second senate wants the bundeswehr to be able to use its full force in the case of an especially threatening domestic security situation . hesitation over granting the bundeswehr more powers inside germany is linked to memories of the military 's domestic role under the nazis , says heinz schulte , a policy , defense and security analyst in berlin . schulte told deutsche welle that , despite these fears , the bundeswehr would be crucial in protecting germany if it came under terrorist attack . " it seems to me that in the case of a very serious threat , an asymmetrical threat , there will be no alternative but to use the bundeswehr inside germany , " schulte says .
" the current scenario is that the bundeswehr can assist the german civil authorities , particularly the police , in the case of natural emergencies , like floods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr would be called on to intercept hijacked planes " but what we 're talking about is a different scenario .
what happens if there 's a terrorist threat on a major scale in germany ?
will the police be able to guard all the airports and ports and crucial infrastructure points in germany ?
the answer is , no , they will not be able to . " controversial act much of the debate has centered on the 2005 aviation security act , which sought to allow the bundeswehr to pre-emptively shoot down hijacked commercial airliners . it was ruled , however , that shooting down any such plane would be a violation of the basic rights of the passengers and crew onboard .
as it stands , the bundeswehr is only allowed to deploy fighters to try alter the course of any hijacked planes . at the time , the christian democrat deputy parliamentary floor leader , wolfgang bosbach , argued strongly for an amendment to the constitution to grant the bundeswehr more operational maneuverability . " a country 's security must be defined differently today than during the time of the cold war , especially since internal and external security can no longer be so strictly divided , " bosbach told the netzeitung online newspaper at the time . the chairman of the first senate of the constitutional court , ferdinand kirchhof , meanwhile , remains steadfast in his view that without an amendment to the german basic law - the country 's constitution - no " military means of warfare may be used " within the country 's borders under any circumstances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the act was passed following the attack on the world trade center the aviation security act led the constitutional court to ask more fundamentally what the role of the bundeswehr inside germany actually should be .
it ruled that the constitution did not allow the government to order the armed forces to use military weapons inside germany . revised role the second senate is reportedly not pushing for a revision of the ruling on the aviation security act , but rather wants to see a loosening of the restrictions on the bundeswehr 's use of weapons inside germany . the body reportedly wants the bundeswehr to be allowed to use any weapons at its disposal in the case of " particularly severe incidents . " heinz schulte says the bundeswehr would have no choice but to accept such responsibilities , despite already being overburdened by its international responsibilities , " particularly against the background that it is under enormous pressure with regard to ongoing operations like the anti-pirate operation atalanta , and of course afghanistan , and continued operations in the balkans . " if the first and second senates of the constitutional court are unable to find a solution to the legal confrontation , the matter could be put to a vote of both senates meeting together .
this would be only the fourth time in the court 's history that such a plenum would be held . author : darren mara editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the paper reports the second senate wants the bundeswehr to be able to use its full force in the case of an especially threatening domestic security situation . hesitation over granting the bundeswehr more powers inside germany is linked to memories of the military 's domestic role under the nazis , says heinz schulte , a policy , defense and security analyst in berlin . schulte told deutsche welle that , despite these fears , the bundeswehr would be crucial in protecting germany if it came under terrorist attack . " it seems to me that in the case of a very serious threat , an asymmetrical threat , there will be no alternative but to use the bundeswehr inside germany , " schulte says .

the answer is , no , they will not be able to .

as it stands , the bundeswehr is only allowed to deploy fighters to try alter the course of any hijacked planes . at the time , the christian democrat deputy parliamentary floor leader , wolfgang bosbach , argued strongly for an amendment to the constitution to grant the bundeswehr more operational maneuverability . " a country 's security must be defined differently today than during the time of the cold war , especially since internal and external security can no longer be so strictly divided , " bosbach told the netzeitung online newspaper at the time . the chairman of the first senate of the constitutional court , ferdinand kirchhof , meanwhile , remains steadfast in his view that without an amendment to the german basic law - the country 's constitution - no " military means of warfare may be used " within the country 's borders under any circumstances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the act was passed following the attack on the world trade center the aviation security act led the constitutional court to ask more fundamentally what the role of the bundeswehr inside germany actually should be .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 03.08.2010 syria-saudi pact promises peace but lebanon remains on tenterhooks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more than peace at stake for abdullah and assad the visit by syrian president bashar al-assad and saudi king abdullah to lebanon has been hailed as a significant step at easing the simmering tensions in the country .
some experts , however , are far from convinced . with reports of clashes between lebanese and israeli forces , fears of a renewed conflict in lebanon have been growing ever since hassan nasrallah , the leader of the shiite militant group hezbollah , claimed members of his party were on the verge of being indicted by a un tribunal probing the 2005 murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri .
the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- is investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result .
however , relations have been slowly normalizing , as indicated by president assad 's visit to lebanon recently - his first since hariri 's assassination .
while that in itself could be seen as a breakthrough , assad 's accompanying of king abdullah - a close supporter of the sunni muslim hariri family - has been hailed as being even more significant .
syria and saudi arabia have been on opposing sides in many of the complicated feuds in the middle east , including that over influence in lebanon , for decades .
regional rivals the closest of enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah paralyzed beirut with strikes and unrest in 2008 some observers have welcomed the visit as an attempt to defuse a situation which could potentially lead to a conflict similar to that in may 2008 , when 100 people were killed in clashes that erupted when the government announced - and then repealed - a crackdown on hezbollah .
others , however , believe assad and abdullah 's mission could have wider , more damaging implications not only to lebanon 's stability but to the stability of the region as a whole .
" the hariri family and hezbollah , and their supporters , have been enemies for five or six years now which reflects the wider divisions in the middle east , " nadim shehadi , a lebanon expert with the middle east programme at chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" this situation has been akin to the cold war with the repercussions playing out everywhere from palestine to iraq . "
" the most important recent development was seen at last year 's arab league summit in doha where gaza was the main topic , " he added .
" the saudis were there , egypt , jordan … but the whole radical front boycotted the meeting .
there was no hamas , no hezbollah , no iran and no syria . "
" saudi arabia and egypt were forced to look into the abyss and they saw that their power as interlocutors and mediators was under threat .
any deal in the region could be aborted by the radicals .
it meant that more say had to be given to others for any progress to be made . "
saudi arabia seen as giving syria its backing to return to beirut some analysts see king abdullah 's joint visit to lebanon with assad as the next step in a transfer of power and an indication that , instead of opposing a return to syrian domination of lebanon , saudi arabia is giving it its blessing .
the visit is seen by some as a clear message that syria , along with iran - another major backer of hezbollah , still holds sway in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad has met with prime minister saad hariri , rafiq 's son " bringing assad to lebanon on the saudi royal plane is a very big blessing indeed , " paul salem , the director of the carnegie endowment for international peace 's beirut bureau , told deutsche welle . " but saudi arabia brought assad to lebanon to help in a peace process not to give him carte blanche to do what he likes .
he was effectively brought in to stop his friends in hezbollah attacking the government .
this is a clear sign that it wo n't just be syria which is the go-to country for any lebanon crisis , but saudi arabia too .
the saudis need to be involved to protect their friends in the sunni community . " any resurgence of syrian influence in lebanon , however , could further complicate matters in regard to the stl 's findings and any indictment of hezbollah members in hariri 's murder .
both syria and hezbollah have an interest in bringing the tribunal to an end and have a number of devices at hand to potentially force this outcome .
while pressuring saudi arabia to use its relationship with the united states to postpone any indictment of hezbollah members , the saudis can not make the tribunal go away on their own .
syria and hezbollah would have to do their part . " when the lebanese government was preparing to call for a tribunal , hezbollah and the syria-affiliated parties in the government pulled out and closed down the parliament , " shehadi said . " hezbollah then took over the city and paralyzed the institutions , shutting down the government 's power to call its own tribunal .
so the pro-tribunal parties had to call on the un to form the tribunal , which was an unprecedented step .
it effectively forced the tribunal on lebanon and interfered in the running of a sovereign state . " " if the tribunal rules that syria and hezbollah was behind the hariri assassination , then there is a great chance that we will see violence in beirut .
what could precede that is an attempt by syria and hezbollah to either paralyze the lebanese government or change it .
in both cases , a new government under anti-tribunal control can call for the investigation to be called off , saying that the two sides have reconciled and there is no need for it to continue .
the un will have to agree to this unless it can be proved that the country has been hijacked . " hezbollah committed to changing beirut 's position paul salem believes that hezbollah will continue to push for the tribunal to be ended as long as it assumes that there is a political aspect to the tribunal 's process which is aimed at punishing its members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah is prepared to do all it can to influence policy " it 's obvious that syria and hezbollah wants the tribunal to go away and they have been doing their best by discrediting it publically and claiming that it is politicized , " salem said .
" they won ’ t be able to stop the tribunal as such but they could pressure the government to change its position through the threat of violence or by taking over beirut , which could lead to a statement of no-confidence in the tribunal or a withdrawal of support from the government . " " this could lead to a situation where the tribunal has no lebanese support which would mean arrest warrants could not be issued in lebanon or arrests made .
it could pass a guilty verdict on hezbollah and / or syria but little would change . " peace pact appears to hinge on tribunal ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese president sleiman , right , could tow the line for peace in the communique issued after the mini-summit between assad , abdullah and lebanese president michel sleiman , all of lebanon 's political parties were urged to " pursue the path of appeasement and dialogue and to boost national unity in the face of outside threats . "
the leaders stressed " the importance of stability ... the commitment -lrb- of the lebanese -rrb- not to resort to violence and the need to place the country 's interests above all sectarian interests , " the communique read .
avoiding a return to violence between hariri-supporting sunnis and the shiites of hezbollah in lebanon appears to be the main justification for the syrian-saudi agreement .
however , it appears that this pact between two of the main players from the opposing sides can only ensure peace by removing the tribunal problem , given that hezbollah has threatened to take whatever action it deems necessary should its members be indicted .

some experts , however , are far from convinced . with reports of clashes between lebanese and israeli forces , fears of a renewed conflict in lebanon have been growing ever since hassan nasrallah , the leader of the shiite militant group hezbollah , claimed members of his party were on the verge of being indicted by a un tribunal probing the 2005 murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri .
the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- is investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result .
however , relations have been slowly normalizing , as indicated by president assad 's visit to lebanon recently - his first since hariri 's assassination .
while that in itself could be seen as a breakthrough , assad 's accompanying of king abdullah - a close supporter of the sunni muslim hariri family - has been hailed as being even more significant .
syria and saudi arabia have been on opposing sides in many of the complicated feuds in the middle east , including that over influence in lebanon , for decades .
regional rivals the closest of enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah paralyzed beirut with strikes and unrest in 2008 some observers have welcomed the visit as an attempt to defuse a situation which could potentially lead to a conflict similar to that in may 2008 , when 100 people were killed in clashes that erupted when the government announced - and then repealed - a crackdown on hezbollah .
others , however , believe assad and abdullah 's mission could have wider , more damaging implications not only to lebanon 's stability but to the stability of the region as a whole .
" the hariri family and hezbollah , and their supporters , have been enemies for five or six years now which reflects the wider divisions in the middle east , " nadim shehadi , a lebanon expert with the middle east programme at chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" this situation has been akin to the cold war with the repercussions playing out everywhere from palestine to iraq . "
" the most important recent development was seen at last year 's arab league summit in doha where gaza was the main topic , " he added .
" the saudis were there , egypt , jordan … but the whole radical front boycotted the meeting .
there was no hamas , no hezbollah , no iran and no syria . "
" saudi arabia and egypt were forced to look into the abyss and they saw that their power as interlocutors and mediators was under threat .
any deal in the region could be aborted by the radicals .
it meant that more say had to be given to others for any progress to be made . "
saudi arabia seen as giving syria its backing to return to beirut some analysts see king abdullah 's joint visit to lebanon with assad as the next step in a transfer of power and an indication that , instead of opposing a return to syrian domination of lebanon , saudi arabia is giving it its blessing .
the visit is seen by some as a clear message that syria , along with iran - another major backer of hezbollah , still holds sway in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad has met with prime minister saad hariri , rafiq 's son " bringing assad to lebanon on the saudi royal plane is a very big blessing indeed , " paul salem , the director of the carnegie endowment for international peace 's beirut bureau , told deutsche welle . " but saudi arabia brought assad to lebanon to help in a peace process not to give him carte blanche to do what he likes .
he was effectively brought in to stop his friends in hezbollah attacking the government .
this is a clear sign that it wo n't just be syria which is the go-to country for any lebanon crisis , but saudi arabia too .
the saudis need to be involved to protect their friends in the sunni community . " any resurgence of syrian influence in lebanon , however , could further complicate matters in regard to the stl 's findings and any indictment of hezbollah members in hariri 's murder .
both syria and hezbollah have an interest in bringing the tribunal to an end and have a number of devices at hand to potentially force this outcome .
while pressuring saudi arabia to use its relationship with the united states to postpone any indictment of hezbollah members , the saudis can not make the tribunal go away on their own .
syria and hezbollah would have to do their part . " when the lebanese government was preparing to call for a tribunal , hezbollah and the syria-affiliated parties in the government pulled out and closed down the parliament , " shehadi said . " hezbollah then took over the city and paralyzed the institutions , shutting down the government 's power to call its own tribunal .
so the pro-tribunal parties had to call on the un to form the tribunal , which was an unprecedented step .
it effectively forced the tribunal on lebanon and interfered in the running of a sovereign state . " " if the tribunal rules that syria and hezbollah was behind the hariri assassination , then there is a great chance that we will see violence in beirut .
what could precede that is an attempt by syria and hezbollah to either paralyze the lebanese government or change it .
in both cases , a new government under anti-tribunal control can call for the investigation to be called off , saying that the two sides have reconciled and there is no need for it to continue .
the un will have to agree to this unless it can be proved that the country has been hijacked . " hezbollah committed to changing beirut 's position paul salem believes that hezbollah will continue to push for the tribunal to be ended as long as it assumes that there is a political aspect to the tribunal 's process which is aimed at punishing its members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah is prepared to do all it can to influence policy " it 's obvious that syria and hezbollah wants the tribunal to go away and they have been doing their best by discrediting it publically and claiming that it is politicized , " salem said .
" they won ’ t be able to stop the tribunal as such but they could pressure the government to change its position through the threat of violence or by taking over beirut , which could lead to a statement of no-confidence in the tribunal or a withdrawal of support from the government . " " this could lead to a situation where the tribunal has no lebanese support which would mean arrest warrants could not be issued in lebanon or arrests made .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biodiversity -pipe- 03.08.2010 regional ' roll call ' maps diversity of marine life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian and japanese waters are home to 33,000 species known to scientists a new set of geographic inventories released on monday catalogs marine species by region , providing a window into biodiversity in the world ’ s oceans and seas – and the largely man-made threats to rich marine ecosystems . researchers have published a series of papers that illustrate marine biodiversity in 25 key geographic areas around the globe – from the mediterranean sea to the gulf of mexico – providing a comprehensive " roll call " of marine life .
the species inventories released on monday conclude work by 360 scientists to integrate both new and prior knowledge , much of it from diverse , localized sources , as well as nations ' exclusive economic zones .
these efforts resulted in the first comprehensive lists of marine life in diverse regions .
" the most significant thing about them is that we actually have them – and we never did before , " said ron o 'dor , co-senior scientist for the census of marine life , or coml , which commissioned the project .
coml described the collection of biodiversity reports as a " prelude " to the main marine census findings on species distribution and abundance , scheduled for an october release in london .
over the past decade , more than 2,700 scientists have participated in the census of marine life .
according to a statement summarizing the reports , coml researchers expect the project 's estimate of all known marine species to surpass 230,000 specimens .
the final figure will also include species not yet listed in the ocean biogeographic information system , or obis – a permanent database featuring millions of records that aid both researchers and policymakers .
bildunterschrift : asteronyx loveni is one of several thousand species found in japan 's waters biodiversity in focus – and under threat the latest papers estimate that biodiversity levels are highest in the waters around japan and australia , where almost 33,000 species are known to scientists .
more than 22,000 species were reported in chinese waters .
preserving these diverse marine ecosystems , however , requires stringent regulations .
o 'dor said strict environmental protections are in place in australian waters , but policing the thousands of islands that comprise the philippines and indonesia is more challenging .
but the area has other vulnerabilities : " climate change , global warming is going to have a heavy impact in that region because it 's right on the equator , " he told deutsche welle .
though threats to biodiversity varied across regions , the biggest challenges to marine life overall are overfishing , pollution , loss of habitat and invasive species .
" most of the problems are associated with human influences , " o 'dor said , citing as examples the creation of anoxic " dead " zones in the gulf of mexico due to mississippi river runoff and mining and oil exploration .
yet overfishing is at the top of the threat list – with much of the impact concentrated within nations ' exclusive economic zones .
o 'dor recommended an approach to fisheries management based on entire ecosystems , not just individual species .
" you ca n't manage species in isolation , " he said .
but crafting an approach that incorporates tens of thousands of species in waters rich in biodiversity , like those around australia , is not easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea has seen its biodiversity change over time europe 's enclosed seas the mediterranean sea was among those regions with the " most threatened " biodiversity .
it was also the region most threatened by invasive species – with 600 aliens .
most of them originated in the red sea and arrived via the suez canal .
" the problem nowadays is the velocity of this phenomenon – now species are introduced by humans more intensively , " marta coll , lead author of the mediterranean sea regional synthesis , told deutsche welle .
coll nevertheless described the mediterranean as a hotspot of diverse marine life forms – with plenty still left to discover .
" for example , experts still debate how many species of fish inhabit the mediterranean sea , " she said .
meanwhile , the threats facing this region have diversified , with climate change among the main phenomena that stand to influence marine life .
in the baltic , another one of europe 's enclosed seas , biodiversity is also under pressure .
henn ojaveer , lead author of the forthcoming coml paper on the baltic sea , said the region has seen its biodiversity profile change over the past 40 to 50 years , and even today the situation is " completely heterogeneous . "
the number of different species counted in the baltic sea stood at about 6,000 .
" this is very likely an underestimation , but the best count we have currently , " ojaveer said .
all will be revealed on october 4 , the census of marine life plans to present a final count for new species discovered over the course of the decade-long project .
coml researchers would not release the number in advance , but did indicate that several thousand species were " new to science . "
" the sheer number that have been discovered so far , it 's amazing , " said bhavani e. narayanaswamy , project coordinator for the coml european implementation committee .
" but even more so is the fact that there remains even more to be discovered . "
identifying and describing new marine species is a long , arduous process – and coml 's statement on the reports labels current knowledge of biodiversity in all regions studied as " inadequate . "

the species inventories released on monday conclude work by 360 scientists to integrate both new and prior knowledge , much of it from diverse , localized sources , as well as nations ' exclusive economic zones .
these efforts resulted in the first comprehensive lists of marine life in diverse regions .
" the most significant thing about them is that we actually have them – and we never did before , " said ron o 'dor , co-senior scientist for the census of marine life , or coml , which commissioned the project .
coml described the collection of biodiversity reports as a " prelude " to the main marine census findings on species distribution and abundance , scheduled for an october release in london .
over the past decade , more than 2,700 scientists have participated in the census of marine life .
according to a statement summarizing the reports , coml researchers expect the project 's estimate of all known marine species to surpass 230,000 specimens .
the final figure will also include species not yet listed in the ocean biogeographic information system , or obis – a permanent database featuring millions of records that aid both researchers and policymakers .
bildunterschrift : asteronyx loveni is one of several thousand species found in japan 's waters biodiversity in focus – and under threat the latest papers estimate that biodiversity levels are highest in the waters around japan and australia , where almost 33,000 species are known to scientists .
more than 22,000 species were reported in chinese waters .
preserving these diverse marine ecosystems , however , requires stringent regulations .
o 'dor said strict environmental protections are in place in australian waters , but policing the thousands of islands that comprise the philippines and indonesia is more challenging .
but the area has other vulnerabilities : " climate change , global warming is going to have a heavy impact in that region because it 's right on the equator , " he told deutsche welle .
though threats to biodiversity varied across regions , the biggest challenges to marine life overall are overfishing , pollution , loss of habitat and invasive species .
" most of the problems are associated with human influences , " o 'dor said , citing as examples the creation of anoxic " dead " zones in the gulf of mexico due to mississippi river runoff and mining and oil exploration .
yet overfishing is at the top of the threat list – with much of the impact concentrated within nations ' exclusive economic zones .
o 'dor recommended an approach to fisheries management based on entire ecosystems , not just individual species .
" you ca n't manage species in isolation , " he said .
but crafting an approach that incorporates tens of thousands of species in waters rich in biodiversity , like those around australia , is not easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea has seen its biodiversity change over time europe 's enclosed seas the mediterranean sea was among those regions with the " most threatened " biodiversity .
it was also the region most threatened by invasive species – with 600 aliens .
most of them originated in the red sea and arrived via the suez canal .
" the problem nowadays is the velocity of this phenomenon – now species are introduced by humans more intensively , " marta coll , lead author of the mediterranean sea regional synthesis , told deutsche welle .
coll nevertheless described the mediterranean as a hotspot of diverse marine life forms – with plenty still left to discover .
" for example , experts still debate how many species of fish inhabit the mediterranean sea , " she said .
meanwhile , the threats facing this region have diversified , with climate change among the main phenomena that stand to influence marine life .
in the baltic , another one of europe 's enclosed seas , biodiversity is also under pressure .
henn ojaveer , lead author of the forthcoming coml paper on the baltic sea , said the region has seen its biodiversity profile change over the past 40 to 50 years , and even today the situation is " completely heterogeneous . "
the number of different species counted in the baltic sea stood at about 6,000 .
" this is very likely an underestimation , but the best count we have currently , " ojaveer said .
all will be revealed on october 4 , the census of marine life plans to present a final count for new species discovered over the course of the decade-long project .
coml researchers would not release the number in advance , but did indicate that several thousand species were " new to science . "
" the sheer number that have been discovered so far , it 's amazing , " said bhavani e. narayanaswamy , project coordinator for the coml european implementation committee .
" but even more so is the fact that there remains even more to be discovered . "
identifying and describing new marine species is a long , arduous process – and coml 's statement on the reports labels current knowledge of biodiversity in all regions studied as " inadequate . "
yet the census marks the most comprehensive look at the world 's marine life so far , and the largest international collaboration ever between scientists in the field .

the species inventories released on monday conclude work by 360 scientists to integrate both new and prior knowledge , much of it from diverse , localized sources , as well as nations ' exclusive economic zones .
these efforts resulted in the first comprehensive lists of marine life in diverse regions .
" the most significant thing about them is that we actually have them – and we never did before , " said ron o 'dor , co-senior scientist for the census of marine life , or coml , which commissioned the project .
coml described the collection of biodiversity reports as a " prelude " to the main marine census findings on species distribution and abundance , scheduled for an october release in london .
over the past decade , more than 2,700 scientists have participated in the census of marine life .
according to a statement summarizing the reports , coml researchers expect the project 's estimate of all known marine species to surpass 230,000 specimens .
the final figure will also include species not yet listed in the ocean biogeographic information system , or obis – a permanent database featuring millions of records that aid both researchers and policymakers .

though threats to biodiversity varied across regions , the biggest challenges to marine life overall are overfishing , pollution , loss of habitat and invasive species .
" most of the problems are associated with human influences , " o 'dor said , citing as examples the creation of anoxic " dead " zones in the gulf of mexico due to mississippi river runoff and mining and oil exploration .
yet overfishing is at the top of the threat list – with much of the impact concentrated within nations ' exclusive economic zones .
o 'dor recommended an approach to fisheries management based on entire ecosystems , not just individual species .

the european commission 's environment spokesman , joe hennon , said the commission was grateful for coml 's contribution , calling it " an international driving force in promoting a better knowledge of the seas . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 03.08.2010 syria-saudi pact promises peace but lebanon remains on tenterhooks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more than peace at stake for abdullah and assad the visit by syrian president bashar al-assad and saudi king abdullah to lebanon has been hailed as a significant step at easing the simmering tensions in the country .
some experts , however , are far from convinced . with reports of clashes between lebanese and israeli forces , fears of a renewed conflict in lebanon have been growing ever since hassan nasrallah , the leader of the shiite militant group hezbollah , claimed members of his party were on the verge of being indicted by a un tribunal probing the 2005 murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri .
the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- is investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result .
however , relations have been slowly normalizing , as indicated by president assad 's visit to lebanon recently - his first since hariri 's assassination .
while that in itself could be seen as a breakthrough , assad 's accompanying of king abdullah - a close supporter of the sunni muslim hariri family - has been hailed as being even more significant .
syria and saudi arabia have been on opposing sides in many of the complicated feuds in the middle east , including that over influence in lebanon , for decades .
regional rivals the closest of enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah paralyzed beirut with strikes and unrest in 2008 some observers have welcomed the visit as an attempt to defuse a situation which could potentially lead to a conflict similar to that in may 2008 , when 100 people were killed in clashes that erupted when the government announced - and then repealed - a crackdown on hezbollah .
others , however , believe assad and abdullah 's mission could have wider , more damaging implications not only to lebanon 's stability but to the stability of the region as a whole .
" the hariri family and hezbollah , and their supporters , have been enemies for five or six years now which reflects the wider divisions in the middle east , " nadim shehadi , a lebanon expert with the middle east programme at chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" this situation has been akin to the cold war with the repercussions playing out everywhere from palestine to iraq . "
" the most important recent development was seen at last year 's arab league summit in doha where gaza was the main topic , " he added .
" the saudis were there , egypt , jordan … but the whole radical front boycotted the meeting .
there was no hamas , no hezbollah , no iran and no syria . "
" saudi arabia and egypt were forced to look into the abyss and they saw that their power as interlocutors and mediators was under threat .
any deal in the region could be aborted by the radicals .
it meant that more say had to be given to others for any progress to be made . "
saudi arabia seen as giving syria its backing to return to beirut some analysts see king abdullah 's joint visit to lebanon with assad as the next step in a transfer of power and an indication that , instead of opposing a return to syrian domination of lebanon , saudi arabia is giving it its blessing .
the visit is seen by some as a clear message that syria , along with iran - another major backer of hezbollah , still holds sway in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad has met with prime minister saad hariri , rafiq 's son " bringing assad to lebanon on the saudi royal plane is a very big blessing indeed , " paul salem , the director of the carnegie endowment for international peace 's beirut bureau , told deutsche welle . " but saudi arabia brought assad to lebanon to help in a peace process not to give him carte blanche to do what he likes .
he was effectively brought in to stop his friends in hezbollah attacking the government .
this is a clear sign that it wo n't just be syria which is the go-to country for any lebanon crisis , but saudi arabia too .
the saudis need to be involved to protect their friends in the sunni community . " any resurgence of syrian influence in lebanon , however , could further complicate matters in regard to the stl 's findings and any indictment of hezbollah members in hariri 's murder .
both syria and hezbollah have an interest in bringing the tribunal to an end and have a number of devices at hand to potentially force this outcome .
while pressuring saudi arabia to use its relationship with the united states to postpone any indictment of hezbollah members , the saudis can not make the tribunal go away on their own .
syria and hezbollah would have to do their part . " when the lebanese government was preparing to call for a tribunal , hezbollah and the syria-affiliated parties in the government pulled out and closed down the parliament , " shehadi said . " hezbollah then took over the city and paralyzed the institutions , shutting down the government 's power to call its own tribunal .
so the pro-tribunal parties had to call on the un to form the tribunal , which was an unprecedented step .
it effectively forced the tribunal on lebanon and interfered in the running of a sovereign state . " " if the tribunal rules that syria and hezbollah was behind the hariri assassination , then there is a great chance that we will see violence in beirut .
what could precede that is an attempt by syria and hezbollah to either paralyze the lebanese government or change it .
in both cases , a new government under anti-tribunal control can call for the investigation to be called off , saying that the two sides have reconciled and there is no need for it to continue .
the un will have to agree to this unless it can be proved that the country has been hijacked . " hezbollah committed to changing beirut 's position paul salem believes that hezbollah will continue to push for the tribunal to be ended as long as it assumes that there is a political aspect to the tribunal 's process which is aimed at punishing its members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah is prepared to do all it can to influence policy " it 's obvious that syria and hezbollah wants the tribunal to go away and they have been doing their best by discrediting it publically and claiming that it is politicized , " salem said .
" they won ’ t be able to stop the tribunal as such but they could pressure the government to change its position through the threat of violence or by taking over beirut , which could lead to a statement of no-confidence in the tribunal or a withdrawal of support from the government . " " this could lead to a situation where the tribunal has no lebanese support which would mean arrest warrants could not be issued in lebanon or arrests made .
it could pass a guilty verdict on hezbollah and / or syria but little would change . " peace pact appears to hinge on tribunal ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese president sleiman , right , could tow the line for peace in the communique issued after the mini-summit between assad , abdullah and lebanese president michel sleiman , all of lebanon 's political parties were urged to " pursue the path of appeasement and dialogue and to boost national unity in the face of outside threats . "
the leaders stressed " the importance of stability ... the commitment -lrb- of the lebanese -rrb- not to resort to violence and the need to place the country 's interests above all sectarian interests , " the communique read .
avoiding a return to violence between hariri-supporting sunnis and the shiites of hezbollah in lebanon appears to be the main justification for the syrian-saudi agreement .
however , it appears that this pact between two of the main players from the opposing sides can only ensure peace by removing the tribunal problem , given that hezbollah has threatened to take whatever action it deems necessary should its members be indicted .

some experts , however , are far from convinced . with reports of clashes between lebanese and israeli forces , fears of a renewed conflict in lebanon have been growing ever since hassan nasrallah , the leader of the shiite militant group hezbollah , claimed members of his party were on the verge of being indicted by a un tribunal probing the 2005 murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri .
the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- is investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result .
however , relations have been slowly normalizing , as indicated by president assad 's visit to lebanon recently - his first since hariri 's assassination .
while that in itself could be seen as a breakthrough , assad 's accompanying of king abdullah - a close supporter of the sunni muslim hariri family - has been hailed as being even more significant .
syria and saudi arabia have been on opposing sides in many of the complicated feuds in the middle east , including that over influence in lebanon , for decades .
regional rivals the closest of enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah paralyzed beirut with strikes and unrest in 2008 some observers have welcomed the visit as an attempt to defuse a situation which could potentially lead to a conflict similar to that in may 2008 , when 100 people were killed in clashes that erupted when the government announced - and then repealed - a crackdown on hezbollah .
others , however , believe assad and abdullah 's mission could have wider , more damaging implications not only to lebanon 's stability but to the stability of the region as a whole .
" the hariri family and hezbollah , and their supporters , have been enemies for five or six years now which reflects the wider divisions in the middle east , " nadim shehadi , a lebanon expert with the middle east programme at chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" this situation has been akin to the cold war with the repercussions playing out everywhere from palestine to iraq . "
" the most important recent development was seen at last year 's arab league summit in doha where gaza was the main topic , " he added .
" the saudis were there , egypt , jordan … but the whole radical front boycotted the meeting .
there was no hamas , no hezbollah , no iran and no syria . "
" saudi arabia and egypt were forced to look into the abyss and they saw that their power as interlocutors and mediators was under threat .
any deal in the region could be aborted by the radicals .
it meant that more say had to be given to others for any progress to be made . "
saudi arabia seen as giving syria its backing to return to beirut some analysts see king abdullah 's joint visit to lebanon with assad as the next step in a transfer of power and an indication that , instead of opposing a return to syrian domination of lebanon , saudi arabia is giving it its blessing .
the visit is seen by some as a clear message that syria , along with iran - another major backer of hezbollah , still holds sway in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad has met with prime minister saad hariri , rafiq 's son " bringing assad to lebanon on the saudi royal plane is a very big blessing indeed , " paul salem , the director of the carnegie endowment for international peace 's beirut bureau , told deutsche welle . " but saudi arabia brought assad to lebanon to help in a peace process not to give him carte blanche to do what he likes .
he was effectively brought in to stop his friends in hezbollah attacking the government .
this is a clear sign that it wo n't just be syria which is the go-to country for any lebanon crisis , but saudi arabia too .
the saudis need to be involved to protect their friends in the sunni community . " any resurgence of syrian influence in lebanon , however , could further complicate matters in regard to the stl 's findings and any indictment of hezbollah members in hariri 's murder .
both syria and hezbollah have an interest in bringing the tribunal to an end and have a number of devices at hand to potentially force this outcome .
while pressuring saudi arabia to use its relationship with the united states to postpone any indictment of hezbollah members , the saudis can not make the tribunal go away on their own .
syria and hezbollah would have to do their part . " when the lebanese government was preparing to call for a tribunal , hezbollah and the syria-affiliated parties in the government pulled out and closed down the parliament , " shehadi said . " hezbollah then took over the city and paralyzed the institutions , shutting down the government 's power to call its own tribunal .
so the pro-tribunal parties had to call on the un to form the tribunal , which was an unprecedented step .
it effectively forced the tribunal on lebanon and interfered in the running of a sovereign state . " " if the tribunal rules that syria and hezbollah was behind the hariri assassination , then there is a great chance that we will see violence in beirut .
what could precede that is an attempt by syria and hezbollah to either paralyze the lebanese government or change it .
in both cases , a new government under anti-tribunal control can call for the investigation to be called off , saying that the two sides have reconciled and there is no need for it to continue .
the un will have to agree to this unless it can be proved that the country has been hijacked . " hezbollah committed to changing beirut 's position paul salem believes that hezbollah will continue to push for the tribunal to be ended as long as it assumes that there is a political aspect to the tribunal 's process which is aimed at punishing its members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah is prepared to do all it can to influence policy " it 's obvious that syria and hezbollah wants the tribunal to go away and they have been doing their best by discrediting it publically and claiming that it is politicized , " salem said .
" they won ’ t be able to stop the tribunal as such but they could pressure the government to change its position through the threat of violence or by taking over beirut , which could lead to a statement of no-confidence in the tribunal or a withdrawal of support from the government . " " this could lead to a situation where the tribunal has no lebanese support which would mean arrest warrants could not be issued in lebanon or arrests made .
it could pass a guilty verdict on hezbollah and / or syria but little would change . " peace pact appears to hinge on tribunal ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese president sleiman , right , could tow the line for peace in the communique issued after the mini-summit between assad , abdullah and lebanese president michel sleiman , all of lebanon 's political parties were urged to " pursue the path of appeasement and dialogue and to boost national unity in the face of outside threats . "
the leaders stressed " the importance of stability ... the commitment -lrb- of the lebanese -rrb- not to resort to violence and the need to place the country 's interests above all sectarian interests , " the communique read .
avoiding a return to violence between hariri-supporting sunnis and the shiites of hezbollah in lebanon appears to be the main justification for the syrian-saudi agreement .
however , it appears that this pact between two of the main players from the opposing sides can only ensure peace by removing the tribunal problem , given that hezbollah has threatened to take whatever action it deems necessary should its members be indicted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biodiversity -pipe- 03.08.2010 regional ' roll call ' maps diversity of marine life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian and japanese waters are home to 33,000 species known to scientists a new set of geographic inventories released on monday catalogs marine species by region , providing a window into biodiversity in the world ’ s oceans and seas – and the largely man-made threats to rich marine ecosystems . researchers have published a series of papers that illustrate marine biodiversity in 25 key geographic areas around the globe – from the mediterranean sea to the gulf of mexico – providing a comprehensive " roll call " of marine life .
the species inventories released on monday conclude work by 360 scientists to integrate both new and prior knowledge , much of it from diverse , localized sources , as well as nations ' exclusive economic zones .
these efforts resulted in the first comprehensive lists of marine life in diverse regions .
" the most significant thing about them is that we actually have them – and we never did before , " said ron o 'dor , co-senior scientist for the census of marine life , or coml , which commissioned the project .
coml described the collection of biodiversity reports as a " prelude " to the main marine census findings on species distribution and abundance , scheduled for an october release in london .
over the past decade , more than 2,700 scientists have participated in the census of marine life .
according to a statement summarizing the reports , coml researchers expect the project 's estimate of all known marine species to surpass 230,000 specimens .
the final figure will also include species not yet listed in the ocean biogeographic information system , or obis – a permanent database featuring millions of records that aid both researchers and policymakers .
bildunterschrift : asteronyx loveni is one of several thousand species found in japan 's waters biodiversity in focus – and under threat the latest papers estimate that biodiversity levels are highest in the waters around japan and australia , where almost 33,000 species are known to scientists .
more than 22,000 species were reported in chinese waters .
preserving these diverse marine ecosystems , however , requires stringent regulations .
o 'dor said strict environmental protections are in place in australian waters , but policing the thousands of islands that comprise the philippines and indonesia is more challenging .
but the area has other vulnerabilities : " climate change , global warming is going to have a heavy impact in that region because it 's right on the equator , " he told deutsche welle .
though threats to biodiversity varied across regions , the biggest challenges to marine life overall are overfishing , pollution , loss of habitat and invasive species .
" most of the problems are associated with human influences , " o 'dor said , citing as examples the creation of anoxic " dead " zones in the gulf of mexico due to mississippi river runoff and mining and oil exploration .
yet overfishing is at the top of the threat list – with much of the impact concentrated within nations ' exclusive economic zones .
o 'dor recommended an approach to fisheries management based on entire ecosystems , not just individual species .
" you ca n't manage species in isolation , " he said .
but crafting an approach that incorporates tens of thousands of species in waters rich in biodiversity , like those around australia , is not easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea has seen its biodiversity change over time europe 's enclosed seas the mediterranean sea was among those regions with the " most threatened " biodiversity .
it was also the region most threatened by invasive species – with 600 aliens .
most of them originated in the red sea and arrived via the suez canal .
" the problem nowadays is the velocity of this phenomenon – now species are introduced by humans more intensively , " marta coll , lead author of the mediterranean sea regional synthesis , told deutsche welle .
coll nevertheless described the mediterranean as a hotspot of diverse marine life forms – with plenty still left to discover .
" for example , experts still debate how many species of fish inhabit the mediterranean sea , " she said .
meanwhile , the threats facing this region have diversified , with climate change among the main phenomena that stand to influence marine life .
in the baltic , another one of europe 's enclosed seas , biodiversity is also under pressure .
henn ojaveer , lead author of the forthcoming coml paper on the baltic sea , said the region has seen its biodiversity profile change over the past 40 to 50 years , and even today the situation is " completely heterogeneous . "
the number of different species counted in the baltic sea stood at about 6,000 .
" this is very likely an underestimation , but the best count we have currently , " ojaveer said .
all will be revealed on october 4 , the census of marine life plans to present a final count for new species discovered over the course of the decade-long project .
coml researchers would not release the number in advance , but did indicate that several thousand species were " new to science . "
" the sheer number that have been discovered so far , it 's amazing , " said bhavani e. narayanaswamy , project coordinator for the coml european implementation committee .
" but even more so is the fact that there remains even more to be discovered . "
identifying and describing new marine species is a long , arduous process – and coml 's statement on the reports labels current knowledge of biodiversity in all regions studied as " inadequate . "
yet the census marks the most comprehensive look at the world 's marine life so far , and the largest international collaboration ever between scientists in the field .
the european commission 's environment spokesman , joe hennon , said the commission was grateful for coml 's contribution , calling it " an international driving force in promoting a better knowledge of the seas . "
" we can not achieve the aims of the maritime policy – exploiting new resources sustainably or protecting the marine environment – if we do not know what resources are out there to protect , " hennon said . bildunterschrift : census scientists expect to announce the discovery of " several thousand " new species in october open ocean , endless possibilities the census results scheduled for release in october will take a broader view of the world 's marine environment .
this should yield more data on species in the open ocean beyond the continental shelf .
moreover , the data will be organized by " realm , ” from ice oceans to microbes .
coml research has also focused on both species identification and active geology in the deep sea .
maria baker , manager of one of the realm 's field projects known as " chess , " said scientists there have listed about 190 new species since work started in 2002 .
" every time we go down to new areas , you expect to find new species , " she said .
the project also led to the 2005 discovery of the first deep-sea vent south of the equator , as well as the northernmost and southernmost vents ever located .
just this year , researchers found the deepest known undersea volcanic rift in the cayman trough – at a depth of more than 5,000 meters .
but baker said reaching many deepwater regions is hindered by cost and accessibility issues , and more exploration must still be done : " we 're literally scraping the surface in some areas . "

dw-world.de fishing for trouble among the philippines ’ coral reefs in the past decades , fish has gone from being a food product that could be bought at a regional level to a raw commodity that is traded on the world markets .
modern equipment has made it possible to expand fishing fleets .
european and japanese fleets in particular have started plundering the high seas for luxury fish .
marine biodiversity is at risk from the fishing industry , especially the use of destructive fishing methods such as dynamite fishing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 03.08.2010 syria-saudi pact promises peace but lebanon remains on tenterhooks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more than peace at stake for abdullah and assad the visit by syrian president bashar al-assad and saudi king abdullah to lebanon has been hailed as a significant step at easing the simmering tensions in the country .
some experts , however , are far from convinced . with reports of clashes between lebanese and israeli forces , fears of a renewed conflict in lebanon have been growing ever since hassan nasrallah , the leader of the shiite militant group hezbollah , claimed members of his party were on the verge of being indicted by a un tribunal probing the 2005 murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri .
the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- is investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result .
however , relations have been slowly normalizing , as indicated by president assad 's visit to lebanon recently - his first since hariri 's assassination .
while that in itself could be seen as a breakthrough , assad 's accompanying of king abdullah - a close supporter of the sunni muslim hariri family - has been hailed as being even more significant .
syria and saudi arabia have been on opposing sides in many of the complicated feuds in the middle east , including that over influence in lebanon , for decades .
regional rivals the closest of enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah paralyzed beirut with strikes and unrest in 2008 some observers have welcomed the visit as an attempt to defuse a situation which could potentially lead to a conflict similar to that in may 2008 , when 100 people were killed in clashes that erupted when the government announced - and then repealed - a crackdown on hezbollah .
others , however , believe assad and abdullah 's mission could have wider , more damaging implications not only to lebanon 's stability but to the stability of the region as a whole .
" the hariri family and hezbollah , and their supporters , have been enemies for five or six years now which reflects the wider divisions in the middle east , " nadim shehadi , a lebanon expert with the middle east programme at chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" this situation has been akin to the cold war with the repercussions playing out everywhere from palestine to iraq . "
" the most important recent development was seen at last year 's arab league summit in doha where gaza was the main topic , " he added .
" the saudis were there , egypt , jordan … but the whole radical front boycotted the meeting .
there was no hamas , no hezbollah , no iran and no syria . "
" saudi arabia and egypt were forced to look into the abyss and they saw that their power as interlocutors and mediators was under threat .
any deal in the region could be aborted by the radicals .
it meant that more say had to be given to others for any progress to be made . "
saudi arabia seen as giving syria its backing to return to beirut some analysts see king abdullah 's joint visit to lebanon with assad as the next step in a transfer of power and an indication that , instead of opposing a return to syrian domination of lebanon , saudi arabia is giving it its blessing .
the visit is seen by some as a clear message that syria , along with iran - another major backer of hezbollah , still holds sway in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad has met with prime minister saad hariri , rafiq 's son " bringing assad to lebanon on the saudi royal plane is a very big blessing indeed , " paul salem , the director of the carnegie endowment for international peace 's beirut bureau , told deutsche welle . " but saudi arabia brought assad to lebanon to help in a peace process not to give him carte blanche to do what he likes .
he was effectively brought in to stop his friends in hezbollah attacking the government .
this is a clear sign that it wo n't just be syria which is the go-to country for any lebanon crisis , but saudi arabia too .
the saudis need to be involved to protect their friends in the sunni community . " any resurgence of syrian influence in lebanon , however , could further complicate matters in regard to the stl 's findings and any indictment of hezbollah members in hariri 's murder .
both syria and hezbollah have an interest in bringing the tribunal to an end and have a number of devices at hand to potentially force this outcome .
while pressuring saudi arabia to use its relationship with the united states to postpone any indictment of hezbollah members , the saudis can not make the tribunal go away on their own .
syria and hezbollah would have to do their part . " when the lebanese government was preparing to call for a tribunal , hezbollah and the syria-affiliated parties in the government pulled out and closed down the parliament , " shehadi said . " hezbollah then took over the city and paralyzed the institutions , shutting down the government 's power to call its own tribunal .
so the pro-tribunal parties had to call on the un to form the tribunal , which was an unprecedented step .
it effectively forced the tribunal on lebanon and interfered in the running of a sovereign state . " " if the tribunal rules that syria and hezbollah was behind the hariri assassination , then there is a great chance that we will see violence in beirut .
what could precede that is an attempt by syria and hezbollah to either paralyze the lebanese government or change it .
in both cases , a new government under anti-tribunal control can call for the investigation to be called off , saying that the two sides have reconciled and there is no need for it to continue .
the un will have to agree to this unless it can be proved that the country has been hijacked . " hezbollah committed to changing beirut 's position paul salem believes that hezbollah will continue to push for the tribunal to be ended as long as it assumes that there is a political aspect to the tribunal 's process which is aimed at punishing its members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah is prepared to do all it can to influence policy " it 's obvious that syria and hezbollah wants the tribunal to go away and they have been doing their best by discrediting it publically and claiming that it is politicized , " salem said .
" they won ’ t be able to stop the tribunal as such but they could pressure the government to change its position through the threat of violence or by taking over beirut , which could lead to a statement of no-confidence in the tribunal or a withdrawal of support from the government . " " this could lead to a situation where the tribunal has no lebanese support which would mean arrest warrants could not be issued in lebanon or arrests made .
it could pass a guilty verdict on hezbollah and / or syria but little would change . " peace pact appears to hinge on tribunal ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese president sleiman , right , could tow the line for peace in the communique issued after the mini-summit between assad , abdullah and lebanese president michel sleiman , all of lebanon 's political parties were urged to " pursue the path of appeasement and dialogue and to boost national unity in the face of outside threats . "
the leaders stressed " the importance of stability ... the commitment -lrb- of the lebanese -rrb- not to resort to violence and the need to place the country 's interests above all sectarian interests , " the communique read .
avoiding a return to violence between hariri-supporting sunnis and the shiites of hezbollah in lebanon appears to be the main justification for the syrian-saudi agreement .
however , it appears that this pact between two of the main players from the opposing sides can only ensure peace by removing the tribunal problem , given that hezbollah has threatened to take whatever action it deems necessary should its members be indicted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biodiversity -pipe- 03.08.2010 regional ' roll call ' maps diversity of marine life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian and japanese waters are home to 33,000 species known to scientists a new set of geographic inventories released on monday catalogs marine species by region , providing a window into biodiversity in the world ’ s oceans and seas – and the largely man-made threats to rich marine ecosystems . researchers have published a series of papers that illustrate marine biodiversity in 25 key geographic areas around the globe – from the mediterranean sea to the gulf of mexico – providing a comprehensive " roll call " of marine life .
the species inventories released on monday conclude work by 360 scientists to integrate both new and prior knowledge , much of it from diverse , localized sources , as well as nations ' exclusive economic zones .
these efforts resulted in the first comprehensive lists of marine life in diverse regions .
" the most significant thing about them is that we actually have them – and we never did before , " said ron o 'dor , co-senior scientist for the census of marine life , or coml , which commissioned the project .
coml described the collection of biodiversity reports as a " prelude " to the main marine census findings on species distribution and abundance , scheduled for an october release in london .
over the past decade , more than 2,700 scientists have participated in the census of marine life .
according to a statement summarizing the reports , coml researchers expect the project 's estimate of all known marine species to surpass 230,000 specimens .
the final figure will also include species not yet listed in the ocean biogeographic information system , or obis – a permanent database featuring millions of records that aid both researchers and policymakers .
bildunterschrift : asteronyx loveni is one of several thousand species found in japan 's waters biodiversity in focus – and under threat the latest papers estimate that biodiversity levels are highest in the waters around japan and australia , where almost 33,000 species are known to scientists .
more than 22,000 species were reported in chinese waters .
preserving these diverse marine ecosystems , however , requires stringent regulations .
o 'dor said strict environmental protections are in place in australian waters , but policing the thousands of islands that comprise the philippines and indonesia is more challenging .
but the area has other vulnerabilities : " climate change , global warming is going to have a heavy impact in that region because it 's right on the equator , " he told deutsche welle .
though threats to biodiversity varied across regions , the biggest challenges to marine life overall are overfishing , pollution , loss of habitat and invasive species .
" most of the problems are associated with human influences , " o 'dor said , citing as examples the creation of anoxic " dead " zones in the gulf of mexico due to mississippi river runoff and mining and oil exploration .
yet overfishing is at the top of the threat list – with much of the impact concentrated within nations ' exclusive economic zones .
o 'dor recommended an approach to fisheries management based on entire ecosystems , not just individual species .
" you ca n't manage species in isolation , " he said .
but crafting an approach that incorporates tens of thousands of species in waters rich in biodiversity , like those around australia , is not easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea has seen its biodiversity change over time europe 's enclosed seas the mediterranean sea was among those regions with the " most threatened " biodiversity .
it was also the region most threatened by invasive species – with 600 aliens .
most of them originated in the red sea and arrived via the suez canal .
" the problem nowadays is the velocity of this phenomenon – now species are introduced by humans more intensively , " marta coll , lead author of the mediterranean sea regional synthesis , told deutsche welle .
coll nevertheless described the mediterranean as a hotspot of diverse marine life forms – with plenty still left to discover .
" for example , experts still debate how many species of fish inhabit the mediterranean sea , " she said .
meanwhile , the threats facing this region have diversified , with climate change among the main phenomena that stand to influence marine life .
in the baltic , another one of europe 's enclosed seas , biodiversity is also under pressure .
henn ojaveer , lead author of the forthcoming coml paper on the baltic sea , said the region has seen its biodiversity profile change over the past 40 to 50 years , and even today the situation is " completely heterogeneous . "
the number of different species counted in the baltic sea stood at about 6,000 .
" this is very likely an underestimation , but the best count we have currently , " ojaveer said .
all will be revealed on october 4 , the census of marine life plans to present a final count for new species discovered over the course of the decade-long project .
coml researchers would not release the number in advance , but did indicate that several thousand species were " new to science . "
" the sheer number that have been discovered so far , it 's amazing , " said bhavani e. narayanaswamy , project coordinator for the coml european implementation committee .
" but even more so is the fact that there remains even more to be discovered . "
identifying and describing new marine species is a long , arduous process – and coml 's statement on the reports labels current knowledge of biodiversity in all regions studied as " inadequate . "
yet the census marks the most comprehensive look at the world 's marine life so far , and the largest international collaboration ever between scientists in the field .
the european commission 's environment spokesman , joe hennon , said the commission was grateful for coml 's contribution , calling it " an international driving force in promoting a better knowledge of the seas . "
" we can not achieve the aims of the maritime policy – exploiting new resources sustainably or protecting the marine environment – if we do not know what resources are out there to protect , " hennon said . bildunterschrift : census scientists expect to announce the discovery of " several thousand " new species in october open ocean , endless possibilities the census results scheduled for release in october will take a broader view of the world 's marine environment .
this should yield more data on species in the open ocean beyond the continental shelf .
moreover , the data will be organized by " realm , ” from ice oceans to microbes .
coml research has also focused on both species identification and active geology in the deep sea .
maria baker , manager of one of the realm 's field projects known as " chess , " said scientists there have listed about 190 new species since work started in 2002 .
" every time we go down to new areas , you expect to find new species , " she said .
the project also led to the 2005 discovery of the first deep-sea vent south of the equator , as well as the northernmost and southernmost vents ever located .
just this year , researchers found the deepest known undersea volcanic rift in the cayman trough – at a depth of more than 5,000 meters .
but baker said reaching many deepwater regions is hindered by cost and accessibility issues , and more exploration must still be done : " we 're literally scraping the surface in some areas . "

it would be the result of the world 's failure to act on time , despite seeing the writing on the wall . in 2050 , young people with average incomes in germany will grow up listening to their grandparents ' tales of holidays in venice .
they themselves are unlikely ever to go on a more adventurous vacation than a cycle tour along the river elbe - so long as it has n't burst its banks .
with a barrel of oil costing over $ 600 -lrb- 453 euros -rrb- , anything else has become prohibitively expensive .
private cars and non-essential flights are a luxury that few can now afford .
welcome to the future .
the international community 's efforts to reach binding agreement on tackling climate change have all failed .
when the kyoto protocol ran out in 2010 , it was never replaced .
the demands of the emerging nations were too great , as was the industrialized nations ' refusal to compromise .
the world 's main climate offenders were unwilling to foot the bill for repairing the damage to the planet , nor would they commit to any long-term reduction of carbon emissions . drastic spike in global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many regions will suffer from acute water shortages the results are palpable .
in 2009 , the co2 global average concentration in the earth 's atmosphere was about 0.0387 percent by volume , or 387 parts per million by volume -lrb- ppmv -rrb- .
by 2050 , it has reached 675 ppmv .
global warming has gathered pace even faster than was predicted in the early 21st century .
the average temperature is now four degrees higher than it during the beginning of the industrialization , and researchers expect a further rise of 4 to 5 degrees by the end of the century .
but levels of global warming vary dramatically from region to region : parts of europe have actually witnessed a drop in average temperatures due to the weakening of the gulf stream .
in stark contrast , the arctic and the north pole have experienced a record rise in temperatures of almost 8 degrees .
but increased carbon levels in the atmosphere are not the only reason for the galloping pace of global warming .
while it has triggered some processes which speeded up further warming , other effects have mitigated it .
with the balance between these positive and negative feedbacks serving as a major cause of uncertainty in climate predictions , scientists were unable to forecast these ‘ feedback effects . '
the thawing of permafrost in northern russia and canada , for example , accelerated global warming because methane was released in the process - a relatively potent greenhouse gas with 20 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide .
bildunterschrift : cities will be hard hit by natural disasters such as floods extreme weather the greenhouse effect has not only transformed siberia and northern canada into wastelands ; it has also led to disastrous weather extremes .
by 2050 , the frequency of typhoons and storm floods has increased in tropical countries .
the islands of the philippines are beset by strong coastal storms .
heavy rainfall regularly leads to landslides , which have already claimed entire villages . moreover , despite the heavy rainfall , the country is suffering from an acute shortage of freshwater : seawater had filtered into the country 's subterranean freshwater reserves and made it undrinkable .
another consequence is that it has increased salinity levels in soil . 200 million climate refugees the repercussions are severe .
viable farmland is urgently required to meet the needs of the world 's population , which has now reached 9 billion -lrb- compared to 6,7 billion in 2009 -rrb- .
200 million of them are climate refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : droughts will drastically raise the number of climate refugees in the world a percentage of them come from small atolls in the pacific ocean and the densely populated delta regions along the rivers ganges , mekong , nile and brahmaputra , which flooded as a result of rising sea levels .
but the majority comes from central asia and africa .
these people are not fleeing flooded regions , but the droughts that have led to mass starvation in many parts of the world .
in africa alone , almost one quarter of the continent 's 1.8 billion inhabitants are affected by water shortages .
mass migration present countries with new sets of problems : india in particular has been overwhelmed by waves of refugees from neighboring bangladesh .
india 's population now numbers 1.9 billion and its government is unable to provide sufficient food and medication for the refugees living in camps on the indian border .
despite united nations support , the spread of diseases such as cholera can not be stemmed , and are soon proliferating even outside the refugee camps . but the effects of climate change are not all negative .
by and large , northern europe has been spared extreme weather , and scandinavian countries are enjoying milder climates than they used to .
northern scandinavia in particular is home to large areas of land that can be used for agriculture . the collapse of ecosystems but many ecosystems have collapsed .
vulnerable coral reefs and mangrove woods have been destroyed by rising sea temperatures and levels , and a large part of the amazon rainforest has been reduced to a steppe .
many plant and animal species have died out .
in 2050 , mankind has paid a high price for its own survival - more than it would have cost to curb climate change in the first decades of the 21st century .
today , in 2010 , experts agree that well-off states only need to give up a small fraction of their wealth to prevent the worst .

one half of the court , the first senate , says the bundeswehr should not be allowed to act offensively inside germany .
it says the constitution does n't allow it . but according to reports in the daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung , the second senate is reportedly pushing for an expanded domestic role for the armed forces .
the paper reports the second senate wants the bundeswehr to be able to use its full force in the case of an especially threatening domestic security situation . hesitation over granting the bundeswehr more powers inside germany is linked to memories of the military 's domestic role under the nazis , says heinz schulte , a policy , defense and security analyst in berlin . schulte told deutsche welle that , despite these fears , the bundeswehr would be crucial in protecting germany if it came under terrorist attack . " it seems to me that in the case of a very serious threat , an asymmetrical threat , there will be no alternative but to use the bundeswehr inside germany , " schulte says .
" the current scenario is that the bundeswehr can assist the german civil authorities , particularly the police , in the case of natural emergencies , like floods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr would be called on to intercept hijacked planes " but what we 're talking about is a different scenario .
what happens if there 's a terrorist threat on a major scale in germany ?
will the police be able to guard all the airports and ports and crucial infrastructure points in germany ?
the answer is , no , they will not be able to . " controversial act much of the debate has centered on the 2005 aviation security act , which sought to allow the bundeswehr to pre-emptively shoot down hijacked commercial airliners . it was ruled , however , that shooting down any such plane would be a violation of the basic rights of the passengers and crew onboard .
as it stands , the bundeswehr is only allowed to deploy fighters to try alter the course of any hijacked planes . at the time , the christian democrat deputy parliamentary floor leader , wolfgang bosbach , argued strongly for an amendment to the constitution to grant the bundeswehr more operational maneuverability . " a country 's security must be defined differently today than during the time of the cold war , especially since internal and external security can no longer be so strictly divided , " bosbach told the netzeitung online newspaper at the time . the chairman of the first senate of the constitutional court , ferdinand kirchhof , meanwhile , remains steadfast in his view that without an amendment to the german basic law - the country 's constitution - no " military means of warfare may be used " within the country 's borders under any circumstances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the act was passed following the attack on the world trade center the aviation security act led the constitutional court to ask more fundamentally what the role of the bundeswehr inside germany actually should be .
it ruled that the constitution did not allow the government to order the armed forces to use military weapons inside germany . revised role the second senate is reportedly not pushing for a revision of the ruling on the aviation security act , but rather wants to see a loosening of the restrictions on the bundeswehr 's use of weapons inside germany . the body reportedly wants the bundeswehr to be allowed to use any weapons at its disposal in the case of " particularly severe incidents . " heinz schulte says the bundeswehr would have no choice but to accept such responsibilities , despite already being overburdened by its international responsibilities , " particularly against the background that it is under enormous pressure with regard to ongoing operations like the anti-pirate operation atalanta , and of course afghanistan , and continued operations in the balkans . " if the first and second senates of the constitutional court are unable to find a solution to the legal confrontation , the matter could be put to a vote of both senates meeting together .

one half of the court , the first senate , says the bundeswehr should not be allowed to act offensively inside germany .
it says the constitution does n't allow it . but according to reports in the daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung , the second senate is reportedly pushing for an expanded domestic role for the armed forces .
the paper reports the second senate wants the bundeswehr to be able to use its full force in the case of an especially threatening domestic security situation . hesitation over granting the bundeswehr more powers inside germany is linked to memories of the military 's domestic role under the nazis , says heinz schulte , a policy , defense and security analyst in berlin . schulte told deutsche welle that , despite these fears , the bundeswehr would be crucial in protecting germany if it came under terrorist attack . " it seems to me that in the case of a very serious threat , an asymmetrical threat , there will be no alternative but to use the bundeswehr inside germany , " schulte says .
" the current scenario is that the bundeswehr can assist the german civil authorities , particularly the police , in the case of natural emergencies , like floods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr would be called on to intercept hijacked planes " but what we 're talking about is a different scenario .
what happens if there 's a terrorist threat on a major scale in germany ?
will the police be able to guard all the airports and ports and crucial infrastructure points in germany ?
the answer is , no , they will not be able to . " controversial act much of the debate has centered on the 2005 aviation security act , which sought to allow the bundeswehr to pre-emptively shoot down hijacked commercial airliners . it was ruled , however , that shooting down any such plane would be a violation of the basic rights of the passengers and crew onboard .
as it stands , the bundeswehr is only allowed to deploy fighters to try alter the course of any hijacked planes . at the time , the christian democrat deputy parliamentary floor leader , wolfgang bosbach , argued strongly for an amendment to the constitution to grant the bundeswehr more operational maneuverability . " a country 's security must be defined differently today than during the time of the cold war , especially since internal and external security can no longer be so strictly divided , " bosbach told the netzeitung online newspaper at the time . the chairman of the first senate of the constitutional court , ferdinand kirchhof , meanwhile , remains steadfast in his view that without an amendment to the german basic law - the country 's constitution - no " military means of warfare may be used " within the country 's borders under any circumstances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the act was passed following the attack on the world trade center the aviation security act led the constitutional court to ask more fundamentally what the role of the bundeswehr inside germany actually should be .
it ruled that the constitution did not allow the government to order the armed forces to use military weapons inside germany . revised role the second senate is reportedly not pushing for a revision of the ruling on the aviation security act , but rather wants to see a loosening of the restrictions on the bundeswehr 's use of weapons inside germany . the body reportedly wants the bundeswehr to be allowed to use any weapons at its disposal in the case of " particularly severe incidents . " heinz schulte says the bundeswehr would have no choice but to accept such responsibilities , despite already being overburdened by its international responsibilities , " particularly against the background that it is under enormous pressure with regard to ongoing operations like the anti-pirate operation atalanta , and of course afghanistan , and continued operations in the balkans . " if the first and second senates of the constitutional court are unable to find a solution to the legal confrontation , the matter could be put to a vote of both senates meeting together .
this would be only the fourth time in the court 's history that such a plenum would be held . author : darren mara editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but activists say living conditions will only really be improved if people have a say in their future . two years after the devastating earthquake shook the western chinese province of sichuan , the streets are still piled up with wood and rubble .
wang wei * runs a private research institute that is specialized in sustainable development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least 68,000 people were killed when an earthquake hit sichuan may 13 2008 although wang admits that the state has been effective in combating poverty , he says that there has to be more participation from the people .
his idea is to set up microcredit for rural communities so that " we can reach many goals at the same time – starting with the fight against poverty .
the loans and payments support local economic activity .
the government accepts this .
then the community can develop because it has new skills . " wang has a pilot project in a small village where the locals have taken out a loan to plant bamboo .
they have created a small cooperative and taken courses so that they can increase their income by a fifth over the next few years . " we ’ ve come a long way , " mr li , the proud community leader says .
" the cadres are respecting us more and more and giving us more support .
they come from other areas to learn from us .
we ’ re becoming better known .
this has a positive effect .
more and more people who are interested are coming to visit us .
the economy is developing on its own . " villagers not convinced by government plans wang hopes to transpose his ideas to another village a few kilometers away , where the inhabitants are not entirely convinced by government plans to relocate them .
mrs zhu , who lost her home to the earthquake , now lives in a government-built house , which has running water and an inside toilet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new government-built houses to replace those destroyed in 2008 but she is worried about the future : " i don ’ t know what life will be like here later .
we have to pay for everything here .
every month , we have to pay for electricity and water and gas .
it ’ s all going to be unitized later .
who knows what ’ s going to come ? " although the old houses were drafty and not entirely rainproof , at least the inhabitants could keep their animals in them , she adds .
but now the farmers have to walk for over an hour to reach their fields .
the authorities want the relocated young people to work in the local factories , however some refuse to change their lifestyles . taking the future into their own hands although many of the farmers in the village are skeptical of collective organizations , since they remember the forced collectivization of the mao era that triggered a famine , wang manages to convince them that small cooperatives can help them take decisions that are of benefit to the community as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some farmers have put their hopes in new technologies and seeds he promises them that they will have the final say and will not be forced to plant anything they do not want to . the farmers seem happy to give it a try and take the future into their own hands . author : kristin kupfer / act editor : thomas baerthlein * all the names in this report have been changed send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite the slump in europe 's market - and summer coming to an end - analysts predict bmw can keep up the good work . german car exporters have seen a significant rise in overseas sales with munich 's luxury automaker bmw leading the pack , according to figures released tuesday .
the association of german automakers -lrb- vda -rrb- said tuesday that german automakers exported 312,400 cars in july , clinching a 6 percent increase over the same month in 2009 .
for the first seven months of 2010 , total car exports were up 39 percent to nearly 2.5 million automobiles .
bmw placed itself solidly ahead of audi and mercedes , with a sevenfold year-on-year profit increase .
the company posted a second quarter net profit of 834 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- , compared with 121 million euros for the same period in 2009 .
in the united states alone , the group 's july sales hit 21,253 automobiles , increasing bmw 's us sales by 10.1 percent over last july .
bmw 's results shattered the predictions of a dow jones newswires poll , which had forecast profits of 674 million euros .
meanwhile , daimler , which owns mercedes benz , has raised its core earnings predictions to six billion euros for 2010 .
europe 's biggest car maker and audi parent group , volkswagen , plans to sell a record 6.3 million vehicles .
bmw claims improved construction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new 5 series is expected to keep sales rolling meanwhile , friedrich eichiner , bmw 's chief financial officer , credited the company 's success to improved construction .
the introduction of a new modular construction system , bmw ceo norbert reithofer said , would also increase bmw 's profits with every new model to come .
the luxury automaker produced cars in 2010 that were more expensive than any models it had produced since november 2007 , and dz bank 's auto expert , jaski terzic , predicted that the automaker 's new 5 series and its countryman mini-suvs would promise high profits for the second two quarters as well .
a falling euro equals rising sales in recent months , european automakers have benefited from the euro 's fall in value against the dollar , according to automotive professor willi dietz from germany 's ifa automotive economic institute .
the tumbling euro " greatly improves their situation in most of the asian and north american markets , " dietz said .
yet , while asian and american markets have boomed , european markets have cooled down .
new car sales in france , italy and spain fell sharply in july , and the us market is expected to slow as summer comes to an end .
" we can not say this will last for the next 12 months , " dietz told the afp news agency .
new car registrations in germany itself have slumped since a government car-scrapping program to boost recession sales came to an end .
they were down 30 percentm , with 237,500 cars sold in july .

the international community 's efforts to reach binding agreement on tackling climate change have all failed .
when the kyoto protocol ran out in 2010 , it was never replaced .
the demands of the emerging nations were too great , as was the industrialized nations ' refusal to compromise .
the world 's main climate offenders were unwilling to foot the bill for repairing the damage to the planet , nor would they commit to any long-term reduction of carbon emissions . drastic spike in global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many regions will suffer from acute water shortages the results are palpable .
in 2009 , the co2 global average concentration in the earth 's atmosphere was about 0.0387 percent by volume , or 387 parts per million by volume -lrb- ppmv -rrb- .
by 2050 , it has reached 675 ppmv .
global warming has gathered pace even faster than was predicted in the early 21st century .
the average temperature is now four degrees higher than it during the beginning of the industrialization , and researchers expect a further rise of 4 to 5 degrees by the end of the century .
but levels of global warming vary dramatically from region to region : parts of europe have actually witnessed a drop in average temperatures due to the weakening of the gulf stream .
in stark contrast , the arctic and the north pole have experienced a record rise in temperatures of almost 8 degrees .
but increased carbon levels in the atmosphere are not the only reason for the galloping pace of global warming .
while it has triggered some processes which speeded up further warming , other effects have mitigated it .
with the balance between these positive and negative feedbacks serving as a major cause of uncertainty in climate predictions , scientists were unable to forecast these ‘ feedback effects . '
the thawing of permafrost in northern russia and canada , for example , accelerated global warming because methane was released in the process - a relatively potent greenhouse gas with 20 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide .
bildunterschrift : cities will be hard hit by natural disasters such as floods extreme weather the greenhouse effect has not only transformed siberia and northern canada into wastelands ; it has also led to disastrous weather extremes .
by 2050 , the frequency of typhoons and storm floods has increased in tropical countries .
the islands of the philippines are beset by strong coastal storms .
heavy rainfall regularly leads to landslides , which have already claimed entire villages . moreover , despite the heavy rainfall , the country is suffering from an acute shortage of freshwater : seawater had filtered into the country 's subterranean freshwater reserves and made it undrinkable .
another consequence is that it has increased salinity levels in soil . 200 million climate refugees the repercussions are severe .
viable farmland is urgently required to meet the needs of the world 's population , which has now reached 9 billion -lrb- compared to 6,7 billion in 2009 -rrb- .
200 million of them are climate refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : droughts will drastically raise the number of climate refugees in the world a percentage of them come from small atolls in the pacific ocean and the densely populated delta regions along the rivers ganges , mekong , nile and brahmaputra , which flooded as a result of rising sea levels .
but the majority comes from central asia and africa .
these people are not fleeing flooded regions , but the droughts that have led to mass starvation in many parts of the world .
in africa alone , almost one quarter of the continent 's 1.8 billion inhabitants are affected by water shortages .
mass migration present countries with new sets of problems : india in particular has been overwhelmed by waves of refugees from neighboring bangladesh .
india 's population now numbers 1.9 billion and its government is unable to provide sufficient food and medication for the refugees living in camps on the indian border .
despite united nations support , the spread of diseases such as cholera can not be stemmed , and are soon proliferating even outside the refugee camps . but the effects of climate change are not all negative .

many plant and animal species have died out .
in 2050 , mankind has paid a high price for its own survival - more than it would have cost to curb climate change in the first decades of the 21st century .

it would be the result of the world 's failure to act on time , despite seeing the writing on the wall . in 2050 , young people with average incomes in germany will grow up listening to their grandparents ' tales of holidays in venice .
they themselves are unlikely ever to go on a more adventurous vacation than a cycle tour along the river elbe - so long as it has n't burst its banks .
with a barrel of oil costing over $ 600 -lrb- 453 euros -rrb- , anything else has become prohibitively expensive .
private cars and non-essential flights are a luxury that few can now afford .
welcome to the future .
the international community 's efforts to reach binding agreement on tackling climate change have all failed .
when the kyoto protocol ran out in 2010 , it was never replaced .
the demands of the emerging nations were too great , as was the industrialized nations ' refusal to compromise .
the world 's main climate offenders were unwilling to foot the bill for repairing the damage to the planet , nor would they commit to any long-term reduction of carbon emissions . drastic spike in global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many regions will suffer from acute water shortages the results are palpable .
in 2009 , the co2 global average concentration in the earth 's atmosphere was about 0.0387 percent by volume , or 387 parts per million by volume -lrb- ppmv -rrb- .
by 2050 , it has reached 675 ppmv .
global warming has gathered pace even faster than was predicted in the early 21st century .
the average temperature is now four degrees higher than it during the beginning of the industrialization , and researchers expect a further rise of 4 to 5 degrees by the end of the century .
but levels of global warming vary dramatically from region to region : parts of europe have actually witnessed a drop in average temperatures due to the weakening of the gulf stream .
in stark contrast , the arctic and the north pole have experienced a record rise in temperatures of almost 8 degrees .
but increased carbon levels in the atmosphere are not the only reason for the galloping pace of global warming .
while it has triggered some processes which speeded up further warming , other effects have mitigated it .
with the balance between these positive and negative feedbacks serving as a major cause of uncertainty in climate predictions , scientists were unable to forecast these ‘ feedback effects . '
the thawing of permafrost in northern russia and canada , for example , accelerated global warming because methane was released in the process - a relatively potent greenhouse gas with 20 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide .
bildunterschrift : cities will be hard hit by natural disasters such as floods extreme weather the greenhouse effect has not only transformed siberia and northern canada into wastelands ; it has also led to disastrous weather extremes .
by 2050 , the frequency of typhoons and storm floods has increased in tropical countries .
the islands of the philippines are beset by strong coastal storms .
heavy rainfall regularly leads to landslides , which have already claimed entire villages . moreover , despite the heavy rainfall , the country is suffering from an acute shortage of freshwater : seawater had filtered into the country 's subterranean freshwater reserves and made it undrinkable .
another consequence is that it has increased salinity levels in soil . 200 million climate refugees the repercussions are severe .
viable farmland is urgently required to meet the needs of the world 's population , which has now reached 9 billion -lrb- compared to 6,7 billion in 2009 -rrb- .
200 million of them are climate refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : droughts will drastically raise the number of climate refugees in the world a percentage of them come from small atolls in the pacific ocean and the densely populated delta regions along the rivers ganges , mekong , nile and brahmaputra , which flooded as a result of rising sea levels .
but the majority comes from central asia and africa .
these people are not fleeing flooded regions , but the droughts that have led to mass starvation in many parts of the world .
in africa alone , almost one quarter of the continent 's 1.8 billion inhabitants are affected by water shortages .
mass migration present countries with new sets of problems : india in particular has been overwhelmed by waves of refugees from neighboring bangladesh .
india 's population now numbers 1.9 billion and its government is unable to provide sufficient food and medication for the refugees living in camps on the indian border .
despite united nations support , the spread of diseases such as cholera can not be stemmed , and are soon proliferating even outside the refugee camps . but the effects of climate change are not all negative .
by and large , northern europe has been spared extreme weather , and scandinavian countries are enjoying milder climates than they used to .
northern scandinavia in particular is home to large areas of land that can be used for agriculture . the collapse of ecosystems but many ecosystems have collapsed .
vulnerable coral reefs and mangrove woods have been destroyed by rising sea temperatures and levels , and a large part of the amazon rainforest has been reduced to a steppe .
many plant and animal species have died out .
in 2050 , mankind has paid a high price for its own survival - more than it would have cost to curb climate change in the first decades of the 21st century .
today , in 2010 , experts agree that well-off states only need to give up a small fraction of their wealth to prevent the worst .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 03.08.2010 constitutional court split over role of armed forces in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court is split over the use of the military in germany germany 's constitutional court is reportedly divided over whether to allow the country 's military , the bundeswehr , to use all means at its disposal in the case of a high-level domestic security threat . germany 's constitutional court is reportedly split over the role of the country 's armed forces within german borders .
one half of the court , the first senate , says the bundeswehr should not be allowed to act offensively inside germany .
it says the constitution does n't allow it . but according to reports in the daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung , the second senate is reportedly pushing for an expanded domestic role for the armed forces .
the paper reports the second senate wants the bundeswehr to be able to use its full force in the case of an especially threatening domestic security situation . hesitation over granting the bundeswehr more powers inside germany is linked to memories of the military 's domestic role under the nazis , says heinz schulte , a policy , defense and security analyst in berlin . schulte told deutsche welle that , despite these fears , the bundeswehr would be crucial in protecting germany if it came under terrorist attack . " it seems to me that in the case of a very serious threat , an asymmetrical threat , there will be no alternative but to use the bundeswehr inside germany , " schulte says .
" the current scenario is that the bundeswehr can assist the german civil authorities , particularly the police , in the case of natural emergencies , like floods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr would be called on to intercept hijacked planes " but what we 're talking about is a different scenario .
what happens if there 's a terrorist threat on a major scale in germany ?
will the police be able to guard all the airports and ports and crucial infrastructure points in germany ?
the answer is , no , they will not be able to . " controversial act much of the debate has centered on the 2005 aviation security act , which sought to allow the bundeswehr to pre-emptively shoot down hijacked commercial airliners . it was ruled , however , that shooting down any such plane would be a violation of the basic rights of the passengers and crew onboard .
as it stands , the bundeswehr is only allowed to deploy fighters to try alter the course of any hijacked planes . at the time , the christian democrat deputy parliamentary floor leader , wolfgang bosbach , argued strongly for an amendment to the constitution to grant the bundeswehr more operational maneuverability . " a country 's security must be defined differently today than during the time of the cold war , especially since internal and external security can no longer be so strictly divided , " bosbach told the netzeitung online newspaper at the time . the chairman of the first senate of the constitutional court , ferdinand kirchhof , meanwhile , remains steadfast in his view that without an amendment to the german basic law - the country 's constitution - no " military means of warfare may be used " within the country 's borders under any circumstances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the act was passed following the attack on the world trade center the aviation security act led the constitutional court to ask more fundamentally what the role of the bundeswehr inside germany actually should be .
it ruled that the constitution did not allow the government to order the armed forces to use military weapons inside germany . revised role the second senate is reportedly not pushing for a revision of the ruling on the aviation security act , but rather wants to see a loosening of the restrictions on the bundeswehr 's use of weapons inside germany . the body reportedly wants the bundeswehr to be allowed to use any weapons at its disposal in the case of " particularly severe incidents . " heinz schulte says the bundeswehr would have no choice but to accept such responsibilities , despite already being overburdened by its international responsibilities , " particularly against the background that it is under enormous pressure with regard to ongoing operations like the anti-pirate operation atalanta , and of course afghanistan , and continued operations in the balkans . " if the first and second senates of the constitutional court are unable to find a solution to the legal confrontation , the matter could be put to a vote of both senates meeting together .
this would be only the fourth time in the court 's history that such a plenum would be held . author : darren mara editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de bundeswehr conscription acts as internship for military careers germany has decided to reduce the time of its mandatory military and civilian services .
one expert says the practice continues to exist because it is a primary recruitment tool to find future career soldiers .

for months , the german military establishment justified the attack as self-defence but more and more it seems as if the isaf forces in afghanistan specifically targeted taliban militants in kunduz .
the question , however , is whether german troops would have been justified to act offensively .

the police union wants to send police from turkey on patrol in problem neighborhoods in germany .
the goal is higher acceptance of german officers - but the idea is controversial . in front of a bridal store , a man and a woman sit on wooden chairs , drinking black tea from small glasses - an everyday scene in many towns in turkey .
but hatice koek 's bridal shop is located in germany , in the duisburg neighborhood of marxloh .
the 32-year-old koek has been selling wedding dresses here for years .
when she heard about the idea of using turkish police officers in north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is located , she was outraged .
it would be " a massive insult , to allow turkish police officers to patrol here , " koek said , not to mention destroying integration , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in berlin , a program trains young people of turkish origin as police officers the bridal shop is just one of many small businesses on wesel road operated by turkish immigrants .
restaurants , pharmacies , supermarkets , boutiques - all the businesses have turkish names .
visitors from turkey would feel right at home .
the residents , too , feel comfortable in their surroundings .
but do they really need turkish police ?
a turkish barber also rejected the idea .
" i would laugh if i saw a police officer here in a turkish uniform , " said a young man who was having his hair cut .
if someone has no respect for the german police , he wo n't take a turkish policeman seriously either , he said .
lack of respect but the head of the german police union in north rhine-westphalia is hoping for just that : erich rettinghaus wants to send turkish policemen on patrol with their german colleagues .
his goal is to find why young people of turkish origin often , in his opinion , have no respect for the police , and whether they would respond differently to turkish policemen .
according to rettinghaus ' plan , turkish officers would be deployed in immigrant-heavy districts such as marxloh in duisburg and ehrenfeld in cologne and given language support by turkish-speaking policemen and -women or interpreters . rettinghaus does n't see his suggestion as a declaration of helplessness .
rather , it 's more like an exchange , such as the ones with dutch police on the border to the netherlands .
" during peak holiday times , german police are dispatched to places where many german tourists go .
for example , in -lsb- the popular dutch resort town -rsb- renesse , there are german police to break up brawls in nightclubs and pubs , " says rettinghaus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many citizens with turkish background are skeptical of importing police officers but the presumed foreigners who live in marxloh and ehrenfeld are not tourists .
most of them were born in germany and are part of german society .
the lack of acceptance of german police goes both ways , said a group of young people in front of a video arcade .
the boys often feel they are treated badly .
" in fights between migrants , for example , the german police only show up after everything is over , " complained a 19-year-old .
another says : " if a german is caught cycling in the wrong bike lane , the policeman says simply : ' continue on . '
but a turk would be given a ticket right away . " ' guest officers ' with no authority these descriptions go against what rettinghaus says are police officers ' experiences on the beat : young people frequently try to prevent an arrest by attacking the patrol car and attempting to free the arrestee .
in such situations the turkish " guest police " could intervene by arbitrating , rettinghaus says .
however , the turkish police officers would have no legal powers and would not carry weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police sometimes collaborate with foreign police to patrol border areas although many marxloh residents are skeptical of the idea , some do believe that the deployment of turkish police officers would help to bridge the differences in attitude .
an older couple in a supermarket posits that the turkish uniforms would make a great impression on young people .
in one of the many traditional teahouses in marxloh , men are playing cards and backgammon .
a 32-year-old says he finds the idea of turkish police in germany absurd .
the state should educate young immigrants to join the police force instead , he argues .
he himself would be ready to give up his well-paid job , but he does n't have the necessary high school diploma to become an officer .
instead of getting policemen from turkey , who know neither the country nor the language , the state ought to approach people like him and recruit them , the outraged man said .
currently only one in seven of police trainees in north rhine-westphalia comes from an immigrant family .
rettinghaus would like to see more police officers with immigrant background .
working with turkish police , he says , is not an alternative , but a supplementary measure .
so far , however , there have been no talks with the turkish authorities .
whether his idea can be realized at all is still up in the air , admits rettinghaus .
the state interior ministry 's reaction has been " restrained , so far . "
but the state government has is new in office .
and the interior minister has many issues to tend to at the moment .
rettinghaus hopes that his proposal will get its turn soon .

but activists say living conditions will only really be improved if people have a say in their future . two years after the devastating earthquake shook the western chinese province of sichuan , the streets are still piled up with wood and rubble .
wang wei * runs a private research institute that is specialized in sustainable development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least 68,000 people were killed when an earthquake hit sichuan may 13 2008 although wang admits that the state has been effective in combating poverty , he says that there has to be more participation from the people .
his idea is to set up microcredit for rural communities so that " we can reach many goals at the same time – starting with the fight against poverty .
the loans and payments support local economic activity .
the government accepts this .
then the community can develop because it has new skills . " wang has a pilot project in a small village where the locals have taken out a loan to plant bamboo .
they have created a small cooperative and taken courses so that they can increase their income by a fifth over the next few years . " we ’ ve come a long way , " mr li , the proud community leader says .
" the cadres are respecting us more and more and giving us more support .
they come from other areas to learn from us .
we ’ re becoming better known .
this has a positive effect .
more and more people who are interested are coming to visit us .
the economy is developing on its own . " villagers not convinced by government plans wang hopes to transpose his ideas to another village a few kilometers away , where the inhabitants are not entirely convinced by government plans to relocate them .
mrs zhu , who lost her home to the earthquake , now lives in a government-built house , which has running water and an inside toilet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new government-built houses to replace those destroyed in 2008 but she is worried about the future : " i don ’ t know what life will be like here later .
we have to pay for everything here .
every month , we have to pay for electricity and water and gas .
it ’ s all going to be unitized later .
who knows what ’ s going to come ? " although the old houses were drafty and not entirely rainproof , at least the inhabitants could keep their animals in them , she adds .
but now the farmers have to walk for over an hour to reach their fields .
the authorities want the relocated young people to work in the local factories , however some refuse to change their lifestyles . taking the future into their own hands although many of the farmers in the village are skeptical of collective organizations , since they remember the forced collectivization of the mao era that triggered a famine , wang manages to convince them that small cooperatives can help them take decisions that are of benefit to the community as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some farmers have put their hopes in new technologies and seeds he promises them that they will have the final say and will not be forced to plant anything they do not want to . the farmers seem happy to give it a try and take the future into their own hands . author : kristin kupfer / act editor : thomas baerthlein * all the names in this report have been changed send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the police union wants to send police from turkey on patrol in problem neighborhoods in germany .
the goal is higher acceptance of german officers - but the idea is controversial . in front of a bridal store , a man and a woman sit on wooden chairs , drinking black tea from small glasses - an everyday scene in many towns in turkey .
but hatice koek 's bridal shop is located in germany , in the duisburg neighborhood of marxloh .
the 32-year-old koek has been selling wedding dresses here for years .
when she heard about the idea of using turkish police officers in north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is located , she was outraged .
it would be " a massive insult , to allow turkish police officers to patrol here , " koek said , not to mention destroying integration , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in berlin , a program trains young people of turkish origin as police officers the bridal shop is just one of many small businesses on wesel road operated by turkish immigrants .
restaurants , pharmacies , supermarkets , boutiques - all the businesses have turkish names .
visitors from turkey would feel right at home .
the residents , too , feel comfortable in their surroundings .
but do they really need turkish police ?
a turkish barber also rejected the idea .
" i would laugh if i saw a police officer here in a turkish uniform , " said a young man who was having his hair cut .
if someone has no respect for the german police , he wo n't take a turkish policeman seriously either , he said .
lack of respect but the head of the german police union in north rhine-westphalia is hoping for just that : erich rettinghaus wants to send turkish policemen on patrol with their german colleagues .
his goal is to find why young people of turkish origin often , in his opinion , have no respect for the police , and whether they would respond differently to turkish policemen .
according to rettinghaus ' plan , turkish officers would be deployed in immigrant-heavy districts such as marxloh in duisburg and ehrenfeld in cologne and given language support by turkish-speaking policemen and -women or interpreters . rettinghaus does n't see his suggestion as a declaration of helplessness .
rather , it 's more like an exchange , such as the ones with dutch police on the border to the netherlands .
" during peak holiday times , german police are dispatched to places where many german tourists go .
for example , in -lsb- the popular dutch resort town -rsb- renesse , there are german police to break up brawls in nightclubs and pubs , " says rettinghaus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many citizens with turkish background are skeptical of importing police officers but the presumed foreigners who live in marxloh and ehrenfeld are not tourists .
most of them were born in germany and are part of german society .
the lack of acceptance of german police goes both ways , said a group of young people in front of a video arcade .
the boys often feel they are treated badly .
" in fights between migrants , for example , the german police only show up after everything is over , " complained a 19-year-old .
another says : " if a german is caught cycling in the wrong bike lane , the policeman says simply : ' continue on . '
but a turk would be given a ticket right away . " ' guest officers ' with no authority these descriptions go against what rettinghaus says are police officers ' experiences on the beat : young people frequently try to prevent an arrest by attacking the patrol car and attempting to free the arrestee .
in such situations the turkish " guest police " could intervene by arbitrating , rettinghaus says .
however , the turkish police officers would have no legal powers and would not carry weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police sometimes collaborate with foreign police to patrol border areas although many marxloh residents are skeptical of the idea , some do believe that the deployment of turkish police officers would help to bridge the differences in attitude .
an older couple in a supermarket posits that the turkish uniforms would make a great impression on young people .
in one of the many traditional teahouses in marxloh , men are playing cards and backgammon .
a 32-year-old says he finds the idea of turkish police in germany absurd .
the state should educate young immigrants to join the police force instead , he argues .
he himself would be ready to give up his well-paid job , but he does n't have the necessary high school diploma to become an officer .
instead of getting policemen from turkey , who know neither the country nor the language , the state ought to approach people like him and recruit them , the outraged man said .
currently only one in seven of police trainees in north rhine-westphalia comes from an immigrant family .
rettinghaus would like to see more police officers with immigrant background .
working with turkish police , he says , is not an alternative , but a supplementary measure .
so far , however , there have been no talks with the turkish authorities .
whether his idea can be realized at all is still up in the air , admits rettinghaus .
the state interior ministry 's reaction has been " restrained , so far . "
but the state government has is new in office .
and the interior minister has many issues to tend to at the moment .
rettinghaus hopes that his proposal will get its turn soon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 03.08.2010 germany 's highest court strengthens unmarried fathers ' rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmarried dads will soon be able to sue for joint custody the german constitutional court decided on tuesday to give unmarried fathers the right to sue for joint custody of their children .
the new ruling brings germany in line with the european court of human rights . when relationships end with a messy break-up , a disagreement over child custody is often one of the battlegrounds . on tuesday , the balance in such battles was tipped in favor of unmarried fathers by the german constitutional court in karlsruhe when it decided to overturn the current german law on child custody for unmarried couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strasbourg court said germany 's law must be changed ute granold , parliamentary spokesperson on family law for the governing christian democratic union , says that , until now , the mother has had the final say on whether the father has any rights at all .
" with unmarried parents , the father must first accept his paternity , " she explained .
" the mother must agree , and then the second step is going to the youth welfare office to apply for joint custody .
and here the mother can either accept or reject the claim . "
in future , although the mother will still automatically receive sole custody of the child , the father will have the right to challenge for joint custody in court .
government support this change has the enthusiastic backing of the german government , especially the junior coalition partners , the liberal free democrats .
hartfrid wolff , one of the party 's spokesmen on family policy , said , " we in the governing coalition agree that the issue must be about doing what is best for the child , and about raising the status of unmarried fathers , just as the european court of human rights has called for . "
the european court of human rights provoked tuesday 's decision last december , when it ruled that germany 's custody rules were contrary to both discrimination laws and article 8 of the european human rights convention , which protects the right to family life .
willi schoene belongs to a campaign for father 's rights that has welcomed the ruling as an important victory .
the campaign has long argued that mothers often deny the father joint custody because of a personal conflict , and not because they have the interests of the child at heart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court said the child 's interests were paramount schoene thinks children are too often used as a means to an end in a break-up .
" if i was a law-maker i would try to prevent the child from being seen as an economic factor , or a cash cow , " he said .
" that 's what it 's all about in the end .
in my experience , it 's always about power or money . "
extra stress for single parents the decision effectively means that the legal difference between married and unmarried couples has become smaller once again .
but edith schwab , of the association for single-parent families , has misgivings about the new ruling .
" the custody rights of fathers have been strengthened in that , for the first time , a right to sue has been introduced in germany , " she said .
" we have never had that before .
of course we have a few problems with the right to sue , because we know that every lawsuit about custody always causes a massive strain for the single-parent family . "
but those in favor of the new ruling believe that it will encourage unmarried fathers to take responsibility for their children .
german law-makers are now expected to draft the new law in the autumn .

the species inventories released on monday conclude work by 360 scientists to integrate both new and prior knowledge , much of it from diverse , localized sources , as well as nations ' exclusive economic zones .
these efforts resulted in the first comprehensive lists of marine life in diverse regions .
" the most significant thing about them is that we actually have them – and we never did before , " said ron o 'dor , co-senior scientist for the census of marine life , or coml , which commissioned the project .
coml described the collection of biodiversity reports as a " prelude " to the main marine census findings on species distribution and abundance , scheduled for an october release in london .
over the past decade , more than 2,700 scientists have participated in the census of marine life .
according to a statement summarizing the reports , coml researchers expect the project 's estimate of all known marine species to surpass 230,000 specimens .
the final figure will also include species not yet listed in the ocean biogeographic information system , or obis – a permanent database featuring millions of records that aid both researchers and policymakers .
bildunterschrift : asteronyx loveni is one of several thousand species found in japan 's waters biodiversity in focus – and under threat the latest papers estimate that biodiversity levels are highest in the waters around japan and australia , where almost 33,000 species are known to scientists .
more than 22,000 species were reported in chinese waters .
preserving these diverse marine ecosystems , however , requires stringent regulations .
o 'dor said strict environmental protections are in place in australian waters , but policing the thousands of islands that comprise the philippines and indonesia is more challenging .
but the area has other vulnerabilities : " climate change , global warming is going to have a heavy impact in that region because it 's right on the equator , " he told deutsche welle .
though threats to biodiversity varied across regions , the biggest challenges to marine life overall are overfishing , pollution , loss of habitat and invasive species .
" most of the problems are associated with human influences , " o 'dor said , citing as examples the creation of anoxic " dead " zones in the gulf of mexico due to mississippi river runoff and mining and oil exploration .
yet overfishing is at the top of the threat list – with much of the impact concentrated within nations ' exclusive economic zones .
o 'dor recommended an approach to fisheries management based on entire ecosystems , not just individual species .
" you ca n't manage species in isolation , " he said .
but crafting an approach that incorporates tens of thousands of species in waters rich in biodiversity , like those around australia , is not easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea has seen its biodiversity change over time europe 's enclosed seas the mediterranean sea was among those regions with the " most threatened " biodiversity .
it was also the region most threatened by invasive species – with 600 aliens .
most of them originated in the red sea and arrived via the suez canal .
" the problem nowadays is the velocity of this phenomenon – now species are introduced by humans more intensively , " marta coll , lead author of the mediterranean sea regional synthesis , told deutsche welle .
coll nevertheless described the mediterranean as a hotspot of diverse marine life forms – with plenty still left to discover .
" for example , experts still debate how many species of fish inhabit the mediterranean sea , " she said .
meanwhile , the threats facing this region have diversified , with climate change among the main phenomena that stand to influence marine life .
in the baltic , another one of europe 's enclosed seas , biodiversity is also under pressure .
henn ojaveer , lead author of the forthcoming coml paper on the baltic sea , said the region has seen its biodiversity profile change over the past 40 to 50 years , and even today the situation is " completely heterogeneous . "
the number of different species counted in the baltic sea stood at about 6,000 .
" this is very likely an underestimation , but the best count we have currently , " ojaveer said .
all will be revealed on october 4 , the census of marine life plans to present a final count for new species discovered over the course of the decade-long project .
coml researchers would not release the number in advance , but did indicate that several thousand species were " new to science . "
" the sheer number that have been discovered so far , it 's amazing , " said bhavani e. narayanaswamy , project coordinator for the coml european implementation committee .
" but even more so is the fact that there remains even more to be discovered . "
identifying and describing new marine species is a long , arduous process – and coml 's statement on the reports labels current knowledge of biodiversity in all regions studied as " inadequate . "
yet the census marks the most comprehensive look at the world 's marine life so far , and the largest international collaboration ever between scientists in the field .
the european commission 's environment spokesman , joe hennon , said the commission was grateful for coml 's contribution , calling it " an international driving force in promoting a better knowledge of the seas . "
" we can not achieve the aims of the maritime policy – exploiting new resources sustainably or protecting the marine environment – if we do not know what resources are out there to protect , " hennon said . bildunterschrift : census scientists expect to announce the discovery of " several thousand " new species in october open ocean , endless possibilities the census results scheduled for release in october will take a broader view of the world 's marine environment .
this should yield more data on species in the open ocean beyond the continental shelf .
moreover , the data will be organized by " realm , ” from ice oceans to microbes .
coml research has also focused on both species identification and active geology in the deep sea .
maria baker , manager of one of the realm 's field projects known as " chess , " said scientists there have listed about 190 new species since work started in 2002 .
" every time we go down to new areas , you expect to find new species , " she said .
the project also led to the 2005 discovery of the first deep-sea vent south of the equator , as well as the northernmost and southernmost vents ever located .
just this year , researchers found the deepest known undersea volcanic rift in the cayman trough – at a depth of more than 5,000 meters .
but baker said reaching many deepwater regions is hindered by cost and accessibility issues , and more exploration must still be done : " we 're literally scraping the surface in some areas . "

most people will have heard of desertec , the initiative to construct large-scale solar and wind power plants in the north african desert .
not so the mediterranean solar plan , which at the moment is familiar only to industry insiders .
yet both initiatives are ambitiously pursuing similar goals .
the mediterranean solar plan aims to create 20 gigawatts ' worth of new renewable energy sources by 2020 – the equivalent of around 15 coal-fired power plants – whereas desertec has set itself the long-term goal of supplying 15 per cent of europe 's electricity by 2050 from its solar and wind power plants .
mediterranean management stalled early on but desertec making progress in december 2008 efforts to set up the ufm stalled due to the outbreak of the gaza war .
high-level ministerial meetings of member states being postponed and important decisions on the ufm 's structure being put on hold .
only now is the union taking the first steps to set up a secretariat in barcelona : a group of staff and experts from member states who will , among other things , help shape and implement the mediterranean solar plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the desertec industry initiative will provide 15 per cent of europe 's electricity by 2050 the desertec industry initiative -lrb- di -rrb- is developing at a much greater pace .
founded by 13 partners , most of them german , the consortium now has 17 partners from seven countries .
negotiations for tunisian and italian companies to join the consortium are advanced , and up to six further additions to the consortium are expected .
another 22 firms support dii as associated partners .
by expanding to include companies from the mena region , dii is also fulfilling demands that those countries in which power plants are to be built be involved from the outset .
two energy projects , one priority region given that access to energy is a cornerstone of the united nations ' millennium development goals , development of the mena region must take priority in both projects .
enormous population growth and increasing industrialization have left african countries with a great deal of catching up to do when it comes to energy projects .
industrialized nations are facing the challenges posed by climate change , which means prioritizing investment in renewable and efficient energy technologies – and the same must go for developing countries and emerging economies .
against this backdrop , the question arises of why fossil power plants are still being built in both industrialized and developing countries .
there are technical reasons for this : renewable energy sources like wind power and photovoltaics will not be able to serve as base-load energies until ‘ intelligent ' electricity grids and storage capacities become available .
what 's more , the cost of investing in renewables is still higher than that of investing in fossil fuel-fired power plants – although costs for fuels in these plants , like coal or natural gas , recur throughout the plants ' operation .
bildunterschrift : morocco " appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables " in the mena region what renewables and large-scale projects like the dii need are a clear legal , administrative and above all economic frameworks .
only then will the high investment costs pay off later .
the conditions must apply in those countries in which the power plants are to be constructed as well as to legislation in the european union and in eu member states that plan to import electricity from africa .
encouraging use of renewables in eu , germany and beyond the 2009 “ eu directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources ” already set the framework for energy projects with non-eu countries as well as for importing electricity generated .
in germany 's case , this means that the question of whether the renewable energy sources act will be extended to include a feed-in tariff for ‘ desert electricity ' is a critical one .
of all the countries in the mena region , morocco appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables .
the country currently imports 95 per cent of its energy requirements , but wants to increase its reliance on renewables to 40 per cent of total energy use by 2020 .
this is another reason that the dii consortium regards morocco as an ideal partner country and is planning to begin work on installing a first power plant park there – one it hopes will prove that the vision of generating electricity in the desert can be realized .
clear regulatory frameworks needed , not intergovernmental entrepreneurialism so , where do the two initiatives – the mediterranean solar plan and dii – now stand , one and two years respectively after they were founded and what priorities should they set for the future ?
the mediterranean solar plan is a political process and should be regarded as such .
it is not the task of an intergovernmental process to take on entrepreneurial initiatives and install power plants – especially when it takes two years to set up a secretariat .
the plan 's focus should , therefore , be on speeding up the process of creating the regulatory framework that will enable private-sector initiatives and investments in the ufm 's member countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser works with the german development institute the countries in the mena region still do not have enough financial clout to independently shoulder such cost-intensive cross-border infrastructure projects .
but the launch of the dii has already led some mena countries to re-shape their regulatory frameworks and set new goals in regard to expanding their renewables capacities .
this will not only make them more attractive to investors from industrialized countries but also for financial institutions such as , for example , the african development bank , the world bank and the european investment bank .
in that respect desertec and the mediterranean solar plan are parallel processes that should complement and cross-fertilize each other .

the species inventories released on monday conclude work by 360 scientists to integrate both new and prior knowledge , much of it from diverse , localized sources , as well as nations ' exclusive economic zones .
these efforts resulted in the first comprehensive lists of marine life in diverse regions .
" the most significant thing about them is that we actually have them – and we never did before , " said ron o 'dor , co-senior scientist for the census of marine life , or coml , which commissioned the project .
coml described the collection of biodiversity reports as a " prelude " to the main marine census findings on species distribution and abundance , scheduled for an october release in london .
over the past decade , more than 2,700 scientists have participated in the census of marine life .
according to a statement summarizing the reports , coml researchers expect the project 's estimate of all known marine species to surpass 230,000 specimens .

the police union wants to send police from turkey on patrol in problem neighborhoods in germany .
the goal is higher acceptance of german officers - but the idea is controversial . in front of a bridal store , a man and a woman sit on wooden chairs , drinking black tea from small glasses - an everyday scene in many towns in turkey .
but hatice koek 's bridal shop is located in germany , in the duisburg neighborhood of marxloh .
the 32-year-old koek has been selling wedding dresses here for years .
when she heard about the idea of using turkish police officers in north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is located , she was outraged .
it would be " a massive insult , to allow turkish police officers to patrol here , " koek said , not to mention destroying integration , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in berlin , a program trains young people of turkish origin as police officers the bridal shop is just one of many small businesses on wesel road operated by turkish immigrants .
restaurants , pharmacies , supermarkets , boutiques - all the businesses have turkish names .
visitors from turkey would feel right at home .
the residents , too , feel comfortable in their surroundings .
but do they really need turkish police ?
a turkish barber also rejected the idea .
" i would laugh if i saw a police officer here in a turkish uniform , " said a young man who was having his hair cut .
if someone has no respect for the german police , he wo n't take a turkish policeman seriously either , he said .
lack of respect but the head of the german police union in north rhine-westphalia is hoping for just that : erich rettinghaus wants to send turkish policemen on patrol with their german colleagues .
his goal is to find why young people of turkish origin often , in his opinion , have no respect for the police , and whether they would respond differently to turkish policemen .
according to rettinghaus ' plan , turkish officers would be deployed in immigrant-heavy districts such as marxloh in duisburg and ehrenfeld in cologne and given language support by turkish-speaking policemen and -women or interpreters . rettinghaus does n't see his suggestion as a declaration of helplessness .
rather , it 's more like an exchange , such as the ones with dutch police on the border to the netherlands .
" during peak holiday times , german police are dispatched to places where many german tourists go .
for example , in -lsb- the popular dutch resort town -rsb- renesse , there are german police to break up brawls in nightclubs and pubs , " says rettinghaus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many citizens with turkish background are skeptical of importing police officers but the presumed foreigners who live in marxloh and ehrenfeld are not tourists .
most of them were born in germany and are part of german society .
the lack of acceptance of german police goes both ways , said a group of young people in front of a video arcade .
the boys often feel they are treated badly .
" in fights between migrants , for example , the german police only show up after everything is over , " complained a 19-year-old .
another says : " if a german is caught cycling in the wrong bike lane , the policeman says simply : ' continue on . '
but a turk would be given a ticket right away . " ' guest officers ' with no authority these descriptions go against what rettinghaus says are police officers ' experiences on the beat : young people frequently try to prevent an arrest by attacking the patrol car and attempting to free the arrestee .
in such situations the turkish " guest police " could intervene by arbitrating , rettinghaus says .
however , the turkish police officers would have no legal powers and would not carry weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police sometimes collaborate with foreign police to patrol border areas although many marxloh residents are skeptical of the idea , some do believe that the deployment of turkish police officers would help to bridge the differences in attitude .
an older couple in a supermarket posits that the turkish uniforms would make a great impression on young people .
in one of the many traditional teahouses in marxloh , men are playing cards and backgammon .
a 32-year-old says he finds the idea of turkish police in germany absurd .
the state should educate young immigrants to join the police force instead , he argues .
he himself would be ready to give up his well-paid job , but he does n't have the necessary high school diploma to become an officer .
instead of getting policemen from turkey , who know neither the country nor the language , the state ought to approach people like him and recruit them , the outraged man said .

the police union wants to send police from turkey on patrol in problem neighborhoods in germany .
the goal is higher acceptance of german officers - but the idea is controversial . in front of a bridal store , a man and a woman sit on wooden chairs , drinking black tea from small glasses - an everyday scene in many towns in turkey .
but hatice koek 's bridal shop is located in germany , in the duisburg neighborhood of marxloh .
the 32-year-old koek has been selling wedding dresses here for years .
when she heard about the idea of using turkish police officers in north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is located , she was outraged .
it would be " a massive insult , to allow turkish police officers to patrol here , " koek said , not to mention destroying integration , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in berlin , a program trains young people of turkish origin as police officers the bridal shop is just one of many small businesses on wesel road operated by turkish immigrants .
restaurants , pharmacies , supermarkets , boutiques - all the businesses have turkish names .
visitors from turkey would feel right at home .
the residents , too , feel comfortable in their surroundings .
but do they really need turkish police ?
a turkish barber also rejected the idea .
" i would laugh if i saw a police officer here in a turkish uniform , " said a young man who was having his hair cut .
if someone has no respect for the german police , he wo n't take a turkish policeman seriously either , he said .
lack of respect but the head of the german police union in north rhine-westphalia is hoping for just that : erich rettinghaus wants to send turkish policemen on patrol with their german colleagues .
his goal is to find why young people of turkish origin often , in his opinion , have no respect for the police , and whether they would respond differently to turkish policemen .
according to rettinghaus ' plan , turkish officers would be deployed in immigrant-heavy districts such as marxloh in duisburg and ehrenfeld in cologne and given language support by turkish-speaking policemen and -women or interpreters . rettinghaus does n't see his suggestion as a declaration of helplessness .
rather , it 's more like an exchange , such as the ones with dutch police on the border to the netherlands .
" during peak holiday times , german police are dispatched to places where many german tourists go .
for example , in -lsb- the popular dutch resort town -rsb- renesse , there are german police to break up brawls in nightclubs and pubs , " says rettinghaus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many citizens with turkish background are skeptical of importing police officers but the presumed foreigners who live in marxloh and ehrenfeld are not tourists .
most of them were born in germany and are part of german society .
the lack of acceptance of german police goes both ways , said a group of young people in front of a video arcade .
the boys often feel they are treated badly .
" in fights between migrants , for example , the german police only show up after everything is over , " complained a 19-year-old .
another says : " if a german is caught cycling in the wrong bike lane , the policeman says simply : ' continue on . '
but a turk would be given a ticket right away . " ' guest officers ' with no authority these descriptions go against what rettinghaus says are police officers ' experiences on the beat : young people frequently try to prevent an arrest by attacking the patrol car and attempting to free the arrestee .
in such situations the turkish " guest police " could intervene by arbitrating , rettinghaus says .
however , the turkish police officers would have no legal powers and would not carry weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police sometimes collaborate with foreign police to patrol border areas although many marxloh residents are skeptical of the idea , some do believe that the deployment of turkish police officers would help to bridge the differences in attitude .
an older couple in a supermarket posits that the turkish uniforms would make a great impression on young people .
in one of the many traditional teahouses in marxloh , men are playing cards and backgammon .
a 32-year-old says he finds the idea of turkish police in germany absurd .
the state should educate young immigrants to join the police force instead , he argues .
he himself would be ready to give up his well-paid job , but he does n't have the necessary high school diploma to become an officer .
instead of getting policemen from turkey , who know neither the country nor the language , the state ought to approach people like him and recruit them , the outraged man said .
currently only one in seven of police trainees in north rhine-westphalia comes from an immigrant family .
rettinghaus would like to see more police officers with immigrant background .
working with turkish police , he says , is not an alternative , but a supplementary measure .
so far , however , there have been no talks with the turkish authorities .

in 2009 , the co2 global average concentration in the earth 's atmosphere was about 0.0387 percent by volume , or 387 parts per million by volume -lrb- ppmv -rrb- .
by 2050 , it has reached 675 ppmv .
global warming has gathered pace even faster than was predicted in the early 21st century .
the average temperature is now four degrees higher than it during the beginning of the industrialization , and researchers expect a further rise of 4 to 5 degrees by the end of the century .
but levels of global warming vary dramatically from region to region : parts of europe have actually witnessed a drop in average temperatures due to the weakening of the gulf stream .
in stark contrast , the arctic and the north pole have experienced a record rise in temperatures of almost 8 degrees .
but increased carbon levels in the atmosphere are not the only reason for the galloping pace of global warming .
while it has triggered some processes which speeded up further warming , other effects have mitigated it .
with the balance between these positive and negative feedbacks serving as a major cause of uncertainty in climate predictions , scientists were unable to forecast these ‘ feedback effects . '
the thawing of permafrost in northern russia and canada , for example , accelerated global warming because methane was released in the process - a relatively potent greenhouse gas with 20 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide .

the islands of the philippines are beset by strong coastal storms .
heavy rainfall regularly leads to landslides , which have already claimed entire villages . moreover , despite the heavy rainfall , the country is suffering from an acute shortage of freshwater : seawater had filtered into the country 's subterranean freshwater reserves and made it undrinkable .
another consequence is that it has increased salinity levels in soil . 200 million climate refugees the repercussions are severe .
viable farmland is urgently required to meet the needs of the world 's population , which has now reached 9 billion -lrb- compared to 6,7 billion in 2009 -rrb- .

mass migration present countries with new sets of problems : india in particular has been overwhelmed by waves of refugees from neighboring bangladesh .
india 's population now numbers 1.9 billion and its government is unable to provide sufficient food and medication for the refugees living in camps on the indian border .
despite united nations support , the spread of diseases such as cholera can not be stemmed , and are soon proliferating even outside the refugee camps . but the effects of climate change are not all negative .

most people will have heard of desertec , the initiative to construct large-scale solar and wind power plants in the north african desert .
not so the mediterranean solar plan , which at the moment is familiar only to industry insiders .
yet both initiatives are ambitiously pursuing similar goals .
the mediterranean solar plan aims to create 20 gigawatts ' worth of new renewable energy sources by 2020 – the equivalent of around 15 coal-fired power plants – whereas desertec has set itself the long-term goal of supplying 15 per cent of europe 's electricity by 2050 from its solar and wind power plants .
mediterranean management stalled early on but desertec making progress in december 2008 efforts to set up the ufm stalled due to the outbreak of the gaza war .
high-level ministerial meetings of member states being postponed and important decisions on the ufm 's structure being put on hold .
only now is the union taking the first steps to set up a secretariat in barcelona : a group of staff and experts from member states who will , among other things , help shape and implement the mediterranean solar plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the desertec industry initiative will provide 15 per cent of europe 's electricity by 2050 the desertec industry initiative -lrb- di -rrb- is developing at a much greater pace .
founded by 13 partners , most of them german , the consortium now has 17 partners from seven countries .
negotiations for tunisian and italian companies to join the consortium are advanced , and up to six further additions to the consortium are expected .
another 22 firms support dii as associated partners .
by expanding to include companies from the mena region , dii is also fulfilling demands that those countries in which power plants are to be built be involved from the outset .
two energy projects , one priority region given that access to energy is a cornerstone of the united nations ' millennium development goals , development of the mena region must take priority in both projects .
enormous population growth and increasing industrialization have left african countries with a great deal of catching up to do when it comes to energy projects .
industrialized nations are facing the challenges posed by climate change , which means prioritizing investment in renewable and efficient energy technologies – and the same must go for developing countries and emerging economies .
against this backdrop , the question arises of why fossil power plants are still being built in both industrialized and developing countries .
there are technical reasons for this : renewable energy sources like wind power and photovoltaics will not be able to serve as base-load energies until ‘ intelligent ' electricity grids and storage capacities become available .
what 's more , the cost of investing in renewables is still higher than that of investing in fossil fuel-fired power plants – although costs for fuels in these plants , like coal or natural gas , recur throughout the plants ' operation .
bildunterschrift : morocco " appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables " in the mena region what renewables and large-scale projects like the dii need are a clear legal , administrative and above all economic frameworks .
only then will the high investment costs pay off later .
the conditions must apply in those countries in which the power plants are to be constructed as well as to legislation in the european union and in eu member states that plan to import electricity from africa .
encouraging use of renewables in eu , germany and beyond the 2009 “ eu directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources ” already set the framework for energy projects with non-eu countries as well as for importing electricity generated .
in germany 's case , this means that the question of whether the renewable energy sources act will be extended to include a feed-in tariff for ‘ desert electricity ' is a critical one .
of all the countries in the mena region , morocco appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables .
the country currently imports 95 per cent of its energy requirements , but wants to increase its reliance on renewables to 40 per cent of total energy use by 2020 .
this is another reason that the dii consortium regards morocco as an ideal partner country and is planning to begin work on installing a first power plant park there – one it hopes will prove that the vision of generating electricity in the desert can be realized .
clear regulatory frameworks needed , not intergovernmental entrepreneurialism so , where do the two initiatives – the mediterranean solar plan and dii – now stand , one and two years respectively after they were founded and what priorities should they set for the future ?
the mediterranean solar plan is a political process and should be regarded as such .
it is not the task of an intergovernmental process to take on entrepreneurial initiatives and install power plants – especially when it takes two years to set up a secretariat .
the plan 's focus should , therefore , be on speeding up the process of creating the regulatory framework that will enable private-sector initiatives and investments in the ufm 's member countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser works with the german development institute the countries in the mena region still do not have enough financial clout to independently shoulder such cost-intensive cross-border infrastructure projects .
but the launch of the dii has already led some mena countries to re-shape their regulatory frameworks and set new goals in regard to expanding their renewables capacities .
this will not only make them more attractive to investors from industrialized countries but also for financial institutions such as , for example , the african development bank , the world bank and the european investment bank .
in that respect desertec and the mediterranean solar plan are parallel processes that should complement and cross-fertilize each other .

one half of the court , the first senate , says the bundeswehr should not be allowed to act offensively inside germany .
it says the constitution does n't allow it . but according to reports in the daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung , the second senate is reportedly pushing for an expanded domestic role for the armed forces .
the paper reports the second senate wants the bundeswehr to be able to use its full force in the case of an especially threatening domestic security situation . hesitation over granting the bundeswehr more powers inside germany is linked to memories of the military 's domestic role under the nazis , says heinz schulte , a policy , defense and security analyst in berlin . schulte told deutsche welle that , despite these fears , the bundeswehr would be crucial in protecting germany if it came under terrorist attack . " it seems to me that in the case of a very serious threat , an asymmetrical threat , there will be no alternative but to use the bundeswehr inside germany , " schulte says .
" the current scenario is that the bundeswehr can assist the german civil authorities , particularly the police , in the case of natural emergencies , like floods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr would be called on to intercept hijacked planes " but what we 're talking about is a different scenario .
what happens if there 's a terrorist threat on a major scale in germany ?
will the police be able to guard all the airports and ports and crucial infrastructure points in germany ?
the answer is , no , they will not be able to . " controversial act much of the debate has centered on the 2005 aviation security act , which sought to allow the bundeswehr to pre-emptively shoot down hijacked commercial airliners . it was ruled , however , that shooting down any such plane would be a violation of the basic rights of the passengers and crew onboard .
as it stands , the bundeswehr is only allowed to deploy fighters to try alter the course of any hijacked planes . at the time , the christian democrat deputy parliamentary floor leader , wolfgang bosbach , argued strongly for an amendment to the constitution to grant the bundeswehr more operational maneuverability . " a country 's security must be defined differently today than during the time of the cold war , especially since internal and external security can no longer be so strictly divided , " bosbach told the netzeitung online newspaper at the time . the chairman of the first senate of the constitutional court , ferdinand kirchhof , meanwhile , remains steadfast in his view that without an amendment to the german basic law - the country 's constitution - no " military means of warfare may be used " within the country 's borders under any circumstances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the act was passed following the attack on the world trade center the aviation security act led the constitutional court to ask more fundamentally what the role of the bundeswehr inside germany actually should be .
it ruled that the constitution did not allow the government to order the armed forces to use military weapons inside germany . revised role the second senate is reportedly not pushing for a revision of the ruling on the aviation security act , but rather wants to see a loosening of the restrictions on the bundeswehr 's use of weapons inside germany . the body reportedly wants the bundeswehr to be allowed to use any weapons at its disposal in the case of " particularly severe incidents . " heinz schulte says the bundeswehr would have no choice but to accept such responsibilities , despite already being overburdened by its international responsibilities , " particularly against the background that it is under enormous pressure with regard to ongoing operations like the anti-pirate operation atalanta , and of course afghanistan , and continued operations in the balkans . " if the first and second senates of the constitutional court are unable to find a solution to the legal confrontation , the matter could be put to a vote of both senates meeting together .
this would be only the fourth time in the court 's history that such a plenum would be held . author : darren mara editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

private cars and non-essential flights are a luxury that few can now afford .
welcome to the future .
the international community 's efforts to reach binding agreement on tackling climate change have all failed .
when the kyoto protocol ran out in 2010 , it was never replaced .
the demands of the emerging nations were too great , as was the industrialized nations ' refusal to compromise .
the world 's main climate offenders were unwilling to foot the bill for repairing the damage to the planet , nor would they commit to any long-term reduction of carbon emissions . drastic spike in global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many regions will suffer from acute water shortages the results are palpable .
in 2009 , the co2 global average concentration in the earth 's atmosphere was about 0.0387 percent by volume , or 387 parts per million by volume -lrb- ppmv -rrb- .
by 2050 , it has reached 675 ppmv .
global warming has gathered pace even faster than was predicted in the early 21st century .
the average temperature is now four degrees higher than it during the beginning of the industrialization , and researchers expect a further rise of 4 to 5 degrees by the end of the century .
but levels of global warming vary dramatically from region to region : parts of europe have actually witnessed a drop in average temperatures due to the weakening of the gulf stream .
in stark contrast , the arctic and the north pole have experienced a record rise in temperatures of almost 8 degrees .
but increased carbon levels in the atmosphere are not the only reason for the galloping pace of global warming .
while it has triggered some processes which speeded up further warming , other effects have mitigated it .
with the balance between these positive and negative feedbacks serving as a major cause of uncertainty in climate predictions , scientists were unable to forecast these ‘ feedback effects . '
the thawing of permafrost in northern russia and canada , for example , accelerated global warming because methane was released in the process - a relatively potent greenhouse gas with 20 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide .
bildunterschrift : cities will be hard hit by natural disasters such as floods extreme weather the greenhouse effect has not only transformed siberia and northern canada into wastelands ; it has also led to disastrous weather extremes .
by 2050 , the frequency of typhoons and storm floods has increased in tropical countries .
the islands of the philippines are beset by strong coastal storms .
heavy rainfall regularly leads to landslides , which have already claimed entire villages . moreover , despite the heavy rainfall , the country is suffering from an acute shortage of freshwater : seawater had filtered into the country 's subterranean freshwater reserves and made it undrinkable .
another consequence is that it has increased salinity levels in soil . 200 million climate refugees the repercussions are severe .
viable farmland is urgently required to meet the needs of the world 's population , which has now reached 9 billion -lrb- compared to 6,7 billion in 2009 -rrb- .
200 million of them are climate refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : droughts will drastically raise the number of climate refugees in the world a percentage of them come from small atolls in the pacific ocean and the densely populated delta regions along the rivers ganges , mekong , nile and brahmaputra , which flooded as a result of rising sea levels .
but the majority comes from central asia and africa .
these people are not fleeing flooded regions , but the droughts that have led to mass starvation in many parts of the world .
in africa alone , almost one quarter of the continent 's 1.8 billion inhabitants are affected by water shortages .
mass migration present countries with new sets of problems : india in particular has been overwhelmed by waves of refugees from neighboring bangladesh .
india 's population now numbers 1.9 billion and its government is unable to provide sufficient food and medication for the refugees living in camps on the indian border .
despite united nations support , the spread of diseases such as cholera can not be stemmed , and are soon proliferating even outside the refugee camps . but the effects of climate change are not all negative .
by and large , northern europe has been spared extreme weather , and scandinavian countries are enjoying milder climates than they used to .
northern scandinavia in particular is home to large areas of land that can be used for agriculture . the collapse of ecosystems but many ecosystems have collapsed .
vulnerable coral reefs and mangrove woods have been destroyed by rising sea temperatures and levels , and a large part of the amazon rainforest has been reduced to a steppe .
many plant and animal species have died out .
in 2050 , mankind has paid a high price for its own survival - more than it would have cost to curb climate change in the first decades of the 21st century .
today , in 2010 , experts agree that well-off states only need to give up a small fraction of their wealth to prevent the worst .

the species inventories released on monday conclude work by 360 scientists to integrate both new and prior knowledge , much of it from diverse , localized sources , as well as nations ' exclusive economic zones .
these efforts resulted in the first comprehensive lists of marine life in diverse regions .
" the most significant thing about them is that we actually have them – and we never did before , " said ron o 'dor , co-senior scientist for the census of marine life , or coml , which commissioned the project .
coml described the collection of biodiversity reports as a " prelude " to the main marine census findings on species distribution and abundance , scheduled for an october release in london .
over the past decade , more than 2,700 scientists have participated in the census of marine life .
according to a statement summarizing the reports , coml researchers expect the project 's estimate of all known marine species to surpass 230,000 specimens .
the final figure will also include species not yet listed in the ocean biogeographic information system , or obis – a permanent database featuring millions of records that aid both researchers and policymakers .
bildunterschrift : asteronyx loveni is one of several thousand species found in japan 's waters biodiversity in focus – and under threat the latest papers estimate that biodiversity levels are highest in the waters around japan and australia , where almost 33,000 species are known to scientists .
more than 22,000 species were reported in chinese waters .
preserving these diverse marine ecosystems , however , requires stringent regulations .
o 'dor said strict environmental protections are in place in australian waters , but policing the thousands of islands that comprise the philippines and indonesia is more challenging .
but the area has other vulnerabilities : " climate change , global warming is going to have a heavy impact in that region because it 's right on the equator , " he told deutsche welle .
though threats to biodiversity varied across regions , the biggest challenges to marine life overall are overfishing , pollution , loss of habitat and invasive species .
" most of the problems are associated with human influences , " o 'dor said , citing as examples the creation of anoxic " dead " zones in the gulf of mexico due to mississippi river runoff and mining and oil exploration .
yet overfishing is at the top of the threat list – with much of the impact concentrated within nations ' exclusive economic zones .
o 'dor recommended an approach to fisheries management based on entire ecosystems , not just individual species .
" you ca n't manage species in isolation , " he said .
but crafting an approach that incorporates tens of thousands of species in waters rich in biodiversity , like those around australia , is not easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea has seen its biodiversity change over time europe 's enclosed seas the mediterranean sea was among those regions with the " most threatened " biodiversity .
it was also the region most threatened by invasive species – with 600 aliens .
most of them originated in the red sea and arrived via the suez canal .
" the problem nowadays is the velocity of this phenomenon – now species are introduced by humans more intensively , " marta coll , lead author of the mediterranean sea regional synthesis , told deutsche welle .
coll nevertheless described the mediterranean as a hotspot of diverse marine life forms – with plenty still left to discover .
" for example , experts still debate how many species of fish inhabit the mediterranean sea , " she said .
meanwhile , the threats facing this region have diversified , with climate change among the main phenomena that stand to influence marine life .
in the baltic , another one of europe 's enclosed seas , biodiversity is also under pressure .
henn ojaveer , lead author of the forthcoming coml paper on the baltic sea , said the region has seen its biodiversity profile change over the past 40 to 50 years , and even today the situation is " completely heterogeneous . "
the number of different species counted in the baltic sea stood at about 6,000 .
" this is very likely an underestimation , but the best count we have currently , " ojaveer said .
all will be revealed on october 4 , the census of marine life plans to present a final count for new species discovered over the course of the decade-long project .
coml researchers would not release the number in advance , but did indicate that several thousand species were " new to science . "
" the sheer number that have been discovered so far , it 's amazing , " said bhavani e. narayanaswamy , project coordinator for the coml european implementation committee .
" but even more so is the fact that there remains even more to be discovered . "
identifying and describing new marine species is a long , arduous process – and coml 's statement on the reports labels current knowledge of biodiversity in all regions studied as " inadequate . "
yet the census marks the most comprehensive look at the world 's marine life so far , and the largest international collaboration ever between scientists in the field .
the european commission 's environment spokesman , joe hennon , said the commission was grateful for coml 's contribution , calling it " an international driving force in promoting a better knowledge of the seas . "
" we can not achieve the aims of the maritime policy – exploiting new resources sustainably or protecting the marine environment – if we do not know what resources are out there to protect , " hennon said . bildunterschrift : census scientists expect to announce the discovery of " several thousand " new species in october open ocean , endless possibilities the census results scheduled for release in october will take a broader view of the world 's marine environment .
this should yield more data on species in the open ocean beyond the continental shelf .
moreover , the data will be organized by " realm , ” from ice oceans to microbes .
coml research has also focused on both species identification and active geology in the deep sea .
maria baker , manager of one of the realm 's field projects known as " chess , " said scientists there have listed about 190 new species since work started in 2002 .
" every time we go down to new areas , you expect to find new species , " she said .
the project also led to the 2005 discovery of the first deep-sea vent south of the equator , as well as the northernmost and southernmost vents ever located .
just this year , researchers found the deepest known undersea volcanic rift in the cayman trough – at a depth of more than 5,000 meters .
but baker said reaching many deepwater regions is hindered by cost and accessibility issues , and more exploration must still be done : " we 're literally scraping the surface in some areas . "

dw-world.de fishing for trouble among the philippines ’ coral reefs in the past decades , fish has gone from being a food product that could be bought at a regional level to a raw commodity that is traded on the world markets .
modern equipment has made it possible to expand fishing fleets .

it would be the result of the world 's failure to act on time , despite seeing the writing on the wall . in 2050 , young people with average incomes in germany will grow up listening to their grandparents ' tales of holidays in venice .
they themselves are unlikely ever to go on a more adventurous vacation than a cycle tour along the river elbe - so long as it has n't burst its banks .
with a barrel of oil costing over $ 600 -lrb- 453 euros -rrb- , anything else has become prohibitively expensive .
private cars and non-essential flights are a luxury that few can now afford .
welcome to the future .
the international community 's efforts to reach binding agreement on tackling climate change have all failed .
when the kyoto protocol ran out in 2010 , it was never replaced .
the demands of the emerging nations were too great , as was the industrialized nations ' refusal to compromise .
the world 's main climate offenders were unwilling to foot the bill for repairing the damage to the planet , nor would they commit to any long-term reduction of carbon emissions . drastic spike in global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many regions will suffer from acute water shortages the results are palpable .
in 2009 , the co2 global average concentration in the earth 's atmosphere was about 0.0387 percent by volume , or 387 parts per million by volume -lrb- ppmv -rrb- .
by 2050 , it has reached 675 ppmv .
global warming has gathered pace even faster than was predicted in the early 21st century .
the average temperature is now four degrees higher than it during the beginning of the industrialization , and researchers expect a further rise of 4 to 5 degrees by the end of the century .
but levels of global warming vary dramatically from region to region : parts of europe have actually witnessed a drop in average temperatures due to the weakening of the gulf stream .
in stark contrast , the arctic and the north pole have experienced a record rise in temperatures of almost 8 degrees .
but increased carbon levels in the atmosphere are not the only reason for the galloping pace of global warming .
while it has triggered some processes which speeded up further warming , other effects have mitigated it .
with the balance between these positive and negative feedbacks serving as a major cause of uncertainty in climate predictions , scientists were unable to forecast these ‘ feedback effects . '
the thawing of permafrost in northern russia and canada , for example , accelerated global warming because methane was released in the process - a relatively potent greenhouse gas with 20 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide .
bildunterschrift : cities will be hard hit by natural disasters such as floods extreme weather the greenhouse effect has not only transformed siberia and northern canada into wastelands ; it has also led to disastrous weather extremes .
by 2050 , the frequency of typhoons and storm floods has increased in tropical countries .
the islands of the philippines are beset by strong coastal storms .
heavy rainfall regularly leads to landslides , which have already claimed entire villages . moreover , despite the heavy rainfall , the country is suffering from an acute shortage of freshwater : seawater had filtered into the country 's subterranean freshwater reserves and made it undrinkable .
another consequence is that it has increased salinity levels in soil . 200 million climate refugees the repercussions are severe .
viable farmland is urgently required to meet the needs of the world 's population , which has now reached 9 billion -lrb- compared to 6,7 billion in 2009 -rrb- .
200 million of them are climate refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : droughts will drastically raise the number of climate refugees in the world a percentage of them come from small atolls in the pacific ocean and the densely populated delta regions along the rivers ganges , mekong , nile and brahmaputra , which flooded as a result of rising sea levels .
but the majority comes from central asia and africa .
these people are not fleeing flooded regions , but the droughts that have led to mass starvation in many parts of the world .
in africa alone , almost one quarter of the continent 's 1.8 billion inhabitants are affected by water shortages .
mass migration present countries with new sets of problems : india in particular has been overwhelmed by waves of refugees from neighboring bangladesh .
india 's population now numbers 1.9 billion and its government is unable to provide sufficient food and medication for the refugees living in camps on the indian border .
despite united nations support , the spread of diseases such as cholera can not be stemmed , and are soon proliferating even outside the refugee camps . but the effects of climate change are not all negative .
by and large , northern europe has been spared extreme weather , and scandinavian countries are enjoying milder climates than they used to .
northern scandinavia in particular is home to large areas of land that can be used for agriculture . the collapse of ecosystems but many ecosystems have collapsed .
vulnerable coral reefs and mangrove woods have been destroyed by rising sea temperatures and levels , and a large part of the amazon rainforest has been reduced to a steppe .
many plant and animal species have died out .
in 2050 , mankind has paid a high price for its own survival - more than it would have cost to curb climate change in the first decades of the 21st century .
today , in 2010 , experts agree that well-off states only need to give up a small fraction of their wealth to prevent the worst .

the species inventories released on monday conclude work by 360 scientists to integrate both new and prior knowledge , much of it from diverse , localized sources , as well as nations ' exclusive economic zones .
these efforts resulted in the first comprehensive lists of marine life in diverse regions .
" the most significant thing about them is that we actually have them – and we never did before , " said ron o 'dor , co-senior scientist for the census of marine life , or coml , which commissioned the project .
coml described the collection of biodiversity reports as a " prelude " to the main marine census findings on species distribution and abundance , scheduled for an october release in london .
over the past decade , more than 2,700 scientists have participated in the census of marine life .
according to a statement summarizing the reports , coml researchers expect the project 's estimate of all known marine species to surpass 230,000 specimens .
the final figure will also include species not yet listed in the ocean biogeographic information system , or obis – a permanent database featuring millions of records that aid both researchers and policymakers .
bildunterschrift : asteronyx loveni is one of several thousand species found in japan 's waters biodiversity in focus – and under threat the latest papers estimate that biodiversity levels are highest in the waters around japan and australia , where almost 33,000 species are known to scientists .
more than 22,000 species were reported in chinese waters .
preserving these diverse marine ecosystems , however , requires stringent regulations .
o 'dor said strict environmental protections are in place in australian waters , but policing the thousands of islands that comprise the philippines and indonesia is more challenging .
but the area has other vulnerabilities : " climate change , global warming is going to have a heavy impact in that region because it 's right on the equator , " he told deutsche welle .
though threats to biodiversity varied across regions , the biggest challenges to marine life overall are overfishing , pollution , loss of habitat and invasive species .
" most of the problems are associated with human influences , " o 'dor said , citing as examples the creation of anoxic " dead " zones in the gulf of mexico due to mississippi river runoff and mining and oil exploration .
yet overfishing is at the top of the threat list – with much of the impact concentrated within nations ' exclusive economic zones .
o 'dor recommended an approach to fisheries management based on entire ecosystems , not just individual species .
" you ca n't manage species in isolation , " he said .
but crafting an approach that incorporates tens of thousands of species in waters rich in biodiversity , like those around australia , is not easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea has seen its biodiversity change over time europe 's enclosed seas the mediterranean sea was among those regions with the " most threatened " biodiversity .
it was also the region most threatened by invasive species – with 600 aliens .
most of them originated in the red sea and arrived via the suez canal .
" the problem nowadays is the velocity of this phenomenon – now species are introduced by humans more intensively , " marta coll , lead author of the mediterranean sea regional synthesis , told deutsche welle .
coll nevertheless described the mediterranean as a hotspot of diverse marine life forms – with plenty still left to discover .
" for example , experts still debate how many species of fish inhabit the mediterranean sea , " she said .
meanwhile , the threats facing this region have diversified , with climate change among the main phenomena that stand to influence marine life .
in the baltic , another one of europe 's enclosed seas , biodiversity is also under pressure .
henn ojaveer , lead author of the forthcoming coml paper on the baltic sea , said the region has seen its biodiversity profile change over the past 40 to 50 years , and even today the situation is " completely heterogeneous . "
the number of different species counted in the baltic sea stood at about 6,000 .
" this is very likely an underestimation , but the best count we have currently , " ojaveer said .
all will be revealed on october 4 , the census of marine life plans to present a final count for new species discovered over the course of the decade-long project .
coml researchers would not release the number in advance , but did indicate that several thousand species were " new to science . "
" the sheer number that have been discovered so far , it 's amazing , " said bhavani e. narayanaswamy , project coordinator for the coml european implementation committee .
" but even more so is the fact that there remains even more to be discovered . "
identifying and describing new marine species is a long , arduous process – and coml 's statement on the reports labels current knowledge of biodiversity in all regions studied as " inadequate . "
yet the census marks the most comprehensive look at the world 's marine life so far , and the largest international collaboration ever between scientists in the field .
the european commission 's environment spokesman , joe hennon , said the commission was grateful for coml 's contribution , calling it " an international driving force in promoting a better knowledge of the seas . "
" we can not achieve the aims of the maritime policy – exploiting new resources sustainably or protecting the marine environment – if we do not know what resources are out there to protect , " hennon said . bildunterschrift : census scientists expect to announce the discovery of " several thousand " new species in october open ocean , endless possibilities the census results scheduled for release in october will take a broader view of the world 's marine environment .
this should yield more data on species in the open ocean beyond the continental shelf .
moreover , the data will be organized by " realm , ” from ice oceans to microbes .
coml research has also focused on both species identification and active geology in the deep sea .
maria baker , manager of one of the realm 's field projects known as " chess , " said scientists there have listed about 190 new species since work started in 2002 .
" every time we go down to new areas , you expect to find new species , " she said .
the project also led to the 2005 discovery of the first deep-sea vent south of the equator , as well as the northernmost and southernmost vents ever located .
just this year , researchers found the deepest known undersea volcanic rift in the cayman trough – at a depth of more than 5,000 meters .
but baker said reaching many deepwater regions is hindered by cost and accessibility issues , and more exploration must still be done : " we 're literally scraping the surface in some areas . "

the species inventories released on monday conclude work by 360 scientists to integrate both new and prior knowledge , much of it from diverse , localized sources , as well as nations ' exclusive economic zones .
these efforts resulted in the first comprehensive lists of marine life in diverse regions .
" the most significant thing about them is that we actually have them – and we never did before , " said ron o 'dor , co-senior scientist for the census of marine life , or coml , which commissioned the project .
coml described the collection of biodiversity reports as a " prelude " to the main marine census findings on species distribution and abundance , scheduled for an october release in london .
over the past decade , more than 2,700 scientists have participated in the census of marine life .
according to a statement summarizing the reports , coml researchers expect the project 's estimate of all known marine species to surpass 230,000 specimens .
the final figure will also include species not yet listed in the ocean biogeographic information system , or obis – a permanent database featuring millions of records that aid both researchers and policymakers .
bildunterschrift : asteronyx loveni is one of several thousand species found in japan 's waters biodiversity in focus – and under threat the latest papers estimate that biodiversity levels are highest in the waters around japan and australia , where almost 33,000 species are known to scientists .
more than 22,000 species were reported in chinese waters .
preserving these diverse marine ecosystems , however , requires stringent regulations .
o 'dor said strict environmental protections are in place in australian waters , but policing the thousands of islands that comprise the philippines and indonesia is more challenging .
but the area has other vulnerabilities : " climate change , global warming is going to have a heavy impact in that region because it 's right on the equator , " he told deutsche welle .
though threats to biodiversity varied across regions , the biggest challenges to marine life overall are overfishing , pollution , loss of habitat and invasive species .
" most of the problems are associated with human influences , " o 'dor said , citing as examples the creation of anoxic " dead " zones in the gulf of mexico due to mississippi river runoff and mining and oil exploration .
yet overfishing is at the top of the threat list – with much of the impact concentrated within nations ' exclusive economic zones .
o 'dor recommended an approach to fisheries management based on entire ecosystems , not just individual species .
" you ca n't manage species in isolation , " he said .
but crafting an approach that incorporates tens of thousands of species in waters rich in biodiversity , like those around australia , is not easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea has seen its biodiversity change over time europe 's enclosed seas the mediterranean sea was among those regions with the " most threatened " biodiversity .
it was also the region most threatened by invasive species – with 600 aliens .
most of them originated in the red sea and arrived via the suez canal .
" the problem nowadays is the velocity of this phenomenon – now species are introduced by humans more intensively , " marta coll , lead author of the mediterranean sea regional synthesis , told deutsche welle .
coll nevertheless described the mediterranean as a hotspot of diverse marine life forms – with plenty still left to discover .
" for example , experts still debate how many species of fish inhabit the mediterranean sea , " she said .
meanwhile , the threats facing this region have diversified , with climate change among the main phenomena that stand to influence marine life .
in the baltic , another one of europe 's enclosed seas , biodiversity is also under pressure .
henn ojaveer , lead author of the forthcoming coml paper on the baltic sea , said the region has seen its biodiversity profile change over the past 40 to 50 years , and even today the situation is " completely heterogeneous . "
the number of different species counted in the baltic sea stood at about 6,000 .
" this is very likely an underestimation , but the best count we have currently , " ojaveer said .
all will be revealed on october 4 , the census of marine life plans to present a final count for new species discovered over the course of the decade-long project .
coml researchers would not release the number in advance , but did indicate that several thousand species were " new to science . "
" the sheer number that have been discovered so far , it 's amazing , " said bhavani e. narayanaswamy , project coordinator for the coml european implementation committee .
" but even more so is the fact that there remains even more to be discovered . "
identifying and describing new marine species is a long , arduous process – and coml 's statement on the reports labels current knowledge of biodiversity in all regions studied as " inadequate . "
yet the census marks the most comprehensive look at the world 's marine life so far , and the largest international collaboration ever between scientists in the field .
the european commission 's environment spokesman , joe hennon , said the commission was grateful for coml 's contribution , calling it " an international driving force in promoting a better knowledge of the seas . "
" we can not achieve the aims of the maritime policy – exploiting new resources sustainably or protecting the marine environment – if we do not know what resources are out there to protect , " hennon said . bildunterschrift : census scientists expect to announce the discovery of " several thousand " new species in october open ocean , endless possibilities the census results scheduled for release in october will take a broader view of the world 's marine environment .
this should yield more data on species in the open ocean beyond the continental shelf .
moreover , the data will be organized by " realm , ” from ice oceans to microbes .
coml research has also focused on both species identification and active geology in the deep sea .
maria baker , manager of one of the realm 's field projects known as " chess , " said scientists there have listed about 190 new species since work started in 2002 .
" every time we go down to new areas , you expect to find new species , " she said .
the project also led to the 2005 discovery of the first deep-sea vent south of the equator , as well as the northernmost and southernmost vents ever located .
just this year , researchers found the deepest known undersea volcanic rift in the cayman trough – at a depth of more than 5,000 meters .
but baker said reaching many deepwater regions is hindered by cost and accessibility issues , and more exploration must still be done : " we 're literally scraping the surface in some areas . "

the police union wants to send police from turkey on patrol in problem neighborhoods in germany .
the goal is higher acceptance of german officers - but the idea is controversial . in front of a bridal store , a man and a woman sit on wooden chairs , drinking black tea from small glasses - an everyday scene in many towns in turkey .
but hatice koek 's bridal shop is located in germany , in the duisburg neighborhood of marxloh .
the 32-year-old koek has been selling wedding dresses here for years .
when she heard about the idea of using turkish police officers in north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is located , she was outraged .
it would be " a massive insult , to allow turkish police officers to patrol here , " koek said , not to mention destroying integration , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in berlin , a program trains young people of turkish origin as police officers the bridal shop is just one of many small businesses on wesel road operated by turkish immigrants .
restaurants , pharmacies , supermarkets , boutiques - all the businesses have turkish names .
visitors from turkey would feel right at home .
the residents , too , feel comfortable in their surroundings .
but do they really need turkish police ?
a turkish barber also rejected the idea .
" i would laugh if i saw a police officer here in a turkish uniform , " said a young man who was having his hair cut .
if someone has no respect for the german police , he wo n't take a turkish policeman seriously either , he said .
lack of respect but the head of the german police union in north rhine-westphalia is hoping for just that : erich rettinghaus wants to send turkish policemen on patrol with their german colleagues .
his goal is to find why young people of turkish origin often , in his opinion , have no respect for the police , and whether they would respond differently to turkish policemen .
according to rettinghaus ' plan , turkish officers would be deployed in immigrant-heavy districts such as marxloh in duisburg and ehrenfeld in cologne and given language support by turkish-speaking policemen and -women or interpreters . rettinghaus does n't see his suggestion as a declaration of helplessness .
rather , it 's more like an exchange , such as the ones with dutch police on the border to the netherlands .
" during peak holiday times , german police are dispatched to places where many german tourists go .
for example , in -lsb- the popular dutch resort town -rsb- renesse , there are german police to break up brawls in nightclubs and pubs , " says rettinghaus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many citizens with turkish background are skeptical of importing police officers but the presumed foreigners who live in marxloh and ehrenfeld are not tourists .
most of them were born in germany and are part of german society .
the lack of acceptance of german police goes both ways , said a group of young people in front of a video arcade .
the boys often feel they are treated badly .
" in fights between migrants , for example , the german police only show up after everything is over , " complained a 19-year-old .
another says : " if a german is caught cycling in the wrong bike lane , the policeman says simply : ' continue on . '
but a turk would be given a ticket right away . " ' guest officers ' with no authority these descriptions go against what rettinghaus says are police officers ' experiences on the beat : young people frequently try to prevent an arrest by attacking the patrol car and attempting to free the arrestee .
in such situations the turkish " guest police " could intervene by arbitrating , rettinghaus says .
however , the turkish police officers would have no legal powers and would not carry weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police sometimes collaborate with foreign police to patrol border areas although many marxloh residents are skeptical of the idea , some do believe that the deployment of turkish police officers would help to bridge the differences in attitude .
an older couple in a supermarket posits that the turkish uniforms would make a great impression on young people .
in one of the many traditional teahouses in marxloh , men are playing cards and backgammon .
a 32-year-old says he finds the idea of turkish police in germany absurd .
the state should educate young immigrants to join the police force instead , he argues .
he himself would be ready to give up his well-paid job , but he does n't have the necessary high school diploma to become an officer .
instead of getting policemen from turkey , who know neither the country nor the language , the state ought to approach people like him and recruit them , the outraged man said .
currently only one in seven of police trainees in north rhine-westphalia comes from an immigrant family .
rettinghaus would like to see more police officers with immigrant background .
working with turkish police , he says , is not an alternative , but a supplementary measure .
so far , however , there have been no talks with the turkish authorities .
whether his idea can be realized at all is still up in the air , admits rettinghaus .
the state interior ministry 's reaction has been " restrained , so far . "
but the state government has is new in office .
and the interior minister has many issues to tend to at the moment .
rettinghaus hopes that his proposal will get its turn soon .

one half of the court , the first senate , says the bundeswehr should not be allowed to act offensively inside germany .
it says the constitution does n't allow it . but according to reports in the daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung , the second senate is reportedly pushing for an expanded domestic role for the armed forces .
the paper reports the second senate wants the bundeswehr to be able to use its full force in the case of an especially threatening domestic security situation . hesitation over granting the bundeswehr more powers inside germany is linked to memories of the military 's domestic role under the nazis , says heinz schulte , a policy , defense and security analyst in berlin . schulte told deutsche welle that , despite these fears , the bundeswehr would be crucial in protecting germany if it came under terrorist attack . " it seems to me that in the case of a very serious threat , an asymmetrical threat , there will be no alternative but to use the bundeswehr inside germany , " schulte says .

the answer is , no , they will not be able to . " controversial act much of the debate has centered on the 2005 aviation security act , which sought to allow the bundeswehr to pre-emptively shoot down hijacked commercial airliners . it was ruled , however , that shooting down any such plane would be a violation of the basic rights of the passengers and crew onboard .
as it stands , the bundeswehr is only allowed to deploy fighters to try alter the course of any hijacked planes . at the time , the christian democrat deputy parliamentary floor leader , wolfgang bosbach , argued strongly for an amendment to the constitution to grant the bundeswehr more operational maneuverability . " a country 's security must be defined differently today than during the time of the cold war , especially since internal and external security can no longer be so strictly divided , " bosbach told the netzeitung online newspaper at the time . the chairman of the first senate of the constitutional court , ferdinand kirchhof , meanwhile , remains steadfast in his view that without an amendment to the german basic law - the country 's constitution - no " military means of warfare may be used " within the country 's borders under any circumstances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the act was passed following the attack on the world trade center the aviation security act led the constitutional court to ask more fundamentally what the role of the bundeswehr inside germany actually should be .

" heinz schulte says the bundeswehr would have no choice but to accept such responsibilities , despite already being overburdened by its international responsibilities , " particularly against the background that it is under enormous pressure with regard to ongoing operations like the anti-pirate operation atalanta , and of course afghanistan , and continued operations in the balkans .

the police union wants to send police from turkey on patrol in problem neighborhoods in germany .
the goal is higher acceptance of german officers - but the idea is controversial . in front of a bridal store , a man and a woman sit on wooden chairs , drinking black tea from small glasses - an everyday scene in many towns in turkey .
but hatice koek 's bridal shop is located in germany , in the duisburg neighborhood of marxloh .
the 32-year-old koek has been selling wedding dresses here for years .
when she heard about the idea of using turkish police officers in north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is located , she was outraged .
it would be " a massive insult , to allow turkish police officers to patrol here , " koek said , not to mention destroying integration , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in berlin , a program trains young people of turkish origin as police officers the bridal shop is just one of many small businesses on wesel road operated by turkish immigrants .
restaurants , pharmacies , supermarkets , boutiques - all the businesses have turkish names .
visitors from turkey would feel right at home .
the residents , too , feel comfortable in their surroundings .
but do they really need turkish police ?
a turkish barber also rejected the idea .
" i would laugh if i saw a police officer here in a turkish uniform , " said a young man who was having his hair cut .
if someone has no respect for the german police , he wo n't take a turkish policeman seriously either , he said .
lack of respect but the head of the german police union in north rhine-westphalia is hoping for just that : erich rettinghaus wants to send turkish policemen on patrol with their german colleagues .
his goal is to find why young people of turkish origin often , in his opinion , have no respect for the police , and whether they would respond differently to turkish policemen .
according to rettinghaus ' plan , turkish officers would be deployed in immigrant-heavy districts such as marxloh in duisburg and ehrenfeld in cologne and given language support by turkish-speaking policemen and -women or interpreters . rettinghaus does n't see his suggestion as a declaration of helplessness .
rather , it 's more like an exchange , such as the ones with dutch police on the border to the netherlands .
" during peak holiday times , german police are dispatched to places where many german tourists go .
for example , in -lsb- the popular dutch resort town -rsb- renesse , there are german police to break up brawls in nightclubs and pubs , " says rettinghaus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many citizens with turkish background are skeptical of importing police officers but the presumed foreigners who live in marxloh and ehrenfeld are not tourists .
most of them were born in germany and are part of german society .
the lack of acceptance of german police goes both ways , said a group of young people in front of a video arcade .
the boys often feel they are treated badly .
" in fights between migrants , for example , the german police only show up after everything is over , " complained a 19-year-old .
another says : " if a german is caught cycling in the wrong bike lane , the policeman says simply : ' continue on . '
but a turk would be given a ticket right away . " ' guest officers ' with no authority these descriptions go against what rettinghaus says are police officers ' experiences on the beat : young people frequently try to prevent an arrest by attacking the patrol car and attempting to free the arrestee .
in such situations the turkish " guest police " could intervene by arbitrating , rettinghaus says .
however , the turkish police officers would have no legal powers and would not carry weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police sometimes collaborate with foreign police to patrol border areas although many marxloh residents are skeptical of the idea , some do believe that the deployment of turkish police officers would help to bridge the differences in attitude .
an older couple in a supermarket posits that the turkish uniforms would make a great impression on young people .
in one of the many traditional teahouses in marxloh , men are playing cards and backgammon .
a 32-year-old says he finds the idea of turkish police in germany absurd .
the state should educate young immigrants to join the police force instead , he argues .
he himself would be ready to give up his well-paid job , but he does n't have the necessary high school diploma to become an officer .
instead of getting policemen from turkey , who know neither the country nor the language , the state ought to approach people like him and recruit them , the outraged man said .
currently only one in seven of police trainees in north rhine-westphalia comes from an immigrant family .
rettinghaus would like to see more police officers with immigrant background .
working with turkish police , he says , is not an alternative , but a supplementary measure .
so far , however , there have been no talks with the turkish authorities .
whether his idea can be realized at all is still up in the air , admits rettinghaus .
the state interior ministry 's reaction has been " restrained , so far . "
but the state government has is new in office .
and the interior minister has many issues to tend to at the moment .
rettinghaus hopes that his proposal will get its turn soon .

but activists say living conditions will only really be improved if people have a say in their future . two years after the devastating earthquake shook the western chinese province of sichuan , the streets are still piled up with wood and rubble .

his idea is to set up microcredit for rural communities so that " we can reach many goals at the same time – starting with the fight against poverty .
the loans and payments support local economic activity .
the government accepts this .
then the community can develop because it has new skills . " wang has a pilot project in a small village where the locals have taken out a loan to plant bamboo .
they have created a small cooperative and taken courses so that they can increase their income by a fifth over the next few years . " we ’ ve come a long way , " mr li , the proud community leader says .
" the cadres are respecting us more and more and giving us more support .
they come from other areas to learn from us .
we ’ re becoming better known .
this has a positive effect .

the economy is developing on its own . " villagers not convinced by government plans wang hopes to transpose his ideas to another village a few kilometers away , where the inhabitants are not entirely convinced by government plans to relocate them .

it ’ s all going to be unitized later .
who knows what ’ s going to come ? " although the old houses were drafty and not entirely rainproof , at least the inhabitants could keep their animals in them , she adds .
but now the farmers have to walk for over an hour to reach their fields .
the authorities want the relocated young people to work in the local factories , however some refuse to change their lifestyles . taking the future into their own hands although many of the farmers in the village are skeptical of collective organizations , since they remember the forced collectivization of the mao era that triggered a famine , wang manages to convince them that small cooperatives can help them take decisions that are of benefit to the community as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some farmers have put their hopes in new technologies and seeds he promises them that they will have the final say and will not be forced to plant anything they do not want to . the farmers seem happy to give it a try and take the future into their own hands . author : kristin kupfer / act editor : thomas baerthlein * all the names in this report have been changed send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 2009 , the co2 global average concentration in the earth 's atmosphere was about 0.0387 percent by volume , or 387 parts per million by volume -lrb- ppmv -rrb- .
by 2050 , it has reached 675 ppmv .
global warming has gathered pace even faster than was predicted in the early 21st century .
the average temperature is now four degrees higher than it during the beginning of the industrialization , and researchers expect a further rise of 4 to 5 degrees by the end of the century .
but levels of global warming vary dramatically from region to region : parts of europe have actually witnessed a drop in average temperatures due to the weakening of the gulf stream .
in stark contrast , the arctic and the north pole have experienced a record rise in temperatures of almost 8 degrees .

while it has triggered some processes which speeded up further warming , other effects have mitigated it .
with the balance between these positive and negative feedbacks serving as a major cause of uncertainty in climate predictions , scientists were unable to forecast these ‘ feedback effects . '
the thawing of permafrost in northern russia and canada , for example , accelerated global warming because methane was released in the process - a relatively potent greenhouse gas with 20 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide .

mass migration present countries with new sets of problems : india in particular has been overwhelmed by waves of refugees from neighboring bangladesh .
india 's population now numbers 1.9 billion and its government is unable to provide sufficient food and medication for the refugees living in camps on the indian border .

the international community 's efforts to reach binding agreement on tackling climate change have all failed .
when the kyoto protocol ran out in 2010 , it was never replaced .
the demands of the emerging nations were too great , as was the industrialized nations ' refusal to compromise .
the world 's main climate offenders were unwilling to foot the bill for repairing the damage to the planet , nor would they commit to any long-term reduction of carbon emissions . drastic spike in global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many regions will suffer from acute water shortages the results are palpable .
in 2009 , the co2 global average concentration in the earth 's atmosphere was about 0.0387 percent by volume , or 387 parts per million by volume -lrb- ppmv -rrb- .
by 2050 , it has reached 675 ppmv .
global warming has gathered pace even faster than was predicted in the early 21st century .
the average temperature is now four degrees higher than it during the beginning of the industrialization , and researchers expect a further rise of 4 to 5 degrees by the end of the century .
but levels of global warming vary dramatically from region to region : parts of europe have actually witnessed a drop in average temperatures due to the weakening of the gulf stream .
in stark contrast , the arctic and the north pole have experienced a record rise in temperatures of almost 8 degrees .
but increased carbon levels in the atmosphere are not the only reason for the galloping pace of global warming .
while it has triggered some processes which speeded up further warming , other effects have mitigated it .
with the balance between these positive and negative feedbacks serving as a major cause of uncertainty in climate predictions , scientists were unable to forecast these ‘ feedback effects . '
the thawing of permafrost in northern russia and canada , for example , accelerated global warming because methane was released in the process - a relatively potent greenhouse gas with 20 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide .
bildunterschrift : cities will be hard hit by natural disasters such as floods extreme weather the greenhouse effect has not only transformed siberia and northern canada into wastelands ; it has also led to disastrous weather extremes .
by 2050 , the frequency of typhoons and storm floods has increased in tropical countries .
the islands of the philippines are beset by strong coastal storms .
heavy rainfall regularly leads to landslides , which have already claimed entire villages . moreover , despite the heavy rainfall , the country is suffering from an acute shortage of freshwater : seawater had filtered into the country 's subterranean freshwater reserves and made it undrinkable .
another consequence is that it has increased salinity levels in soil . 200 million climate refugees the repercussions are severe .
viable farmland is urgently required to meet the needs of the world 's population , which has now reached 9 billion -lrb- compared to 6,7 billion in 2009 -rrb- .
200 million of them are climate refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : droughts will drastically raise the number of climate refugees in the world a percentage of them come from small atolls in the pacific ocean and the densely populated delta regions along the rivers ganges , mekong , nile and brahmaputra , which flooded as a result of rising sea levels .
but the majority comes from central asia and africa .
these people are not fleeing flooded regions , but the droughts that have led to mass starvation in many parts of the world .
in africa alone , almost one quarter of the continent 's 1.8 billion inhabitants are affected by water shortages .
mass migration present countries with new sets of problems : india in particular has been overwhelmed by waves of refugees from neighboring bangladesh .
india 's population now numbers 1.9 billion and its government is unable to provide sufficient food and medication for the refugees living in camps on the indian border .
despite united nations support , the spread of diseases such as cholera can not be stemmed , and are soon proliferating even outside the refugee camps . but the effects of climate change are not all negative .
by and large , northern europe has been spared extreme weather , and scandinavian countries are enjoying milder climates than they used to .
northern scandinavia in particular is home to large areas of land that can be used for agriculture . the collapse of ecosystems but many ecosystems have collapsed .
vulnerable coral reefs and mangrove woods have been destroyed by rising sea temperatures and levels , and a large part of the amazon rainforest has been reduced to a steppe .
many plant and animal species have died out .
in 2050 , mankind has paid a high price for its own survival - more than it would have cost to curb climate change in the first decades of the 21st century .
today , in 2010 , experts agree that well-off states only need to give up a small fraction of their wealth to prevent the worst .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de renewables -pipe- 03.08.2010 opinion : desertec or mediterranean solar plan – whose sun is shining brighter ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two renewables projects should " should complement and cross-fertilize each other " matthias ruchser takes stock of how much progress two cross-border renewables projects - the desertec industry initiative and the mediterranean solar plan - have made so far . july 13 marked the anniversary of two events that could prove extremely important for future energy supplies in europe and the middle east and north africa region -lrb- mena -rrb- : the establishment of the union for the mediterranean -lrb- ufm -rrb- and its mediterranean solar plan in 2008 , and the founding of the commercial desertec industry initiative last year .
most people will have heard of desertec , the initiative to construct large-scale solar and wind power plants in the north african desert .
not so the mediterranean solar plan , which at the moment is familiar only to industry insiders .
yet both initiatives are ambitiously pursuing similar goals .
the mediterranean solar plan aims to create 20 gigawatts ' worth of new renewable energy sources by 2020 – the equivalent of around 15 coal-fired power plants – whereas desertec has set itself the long-term goal of supplying 15 per cent of europe 's electricity by 2050 from its solar and wind power plants .
mediterranean management stalled early on but desertec making progress in december 2008 efforts to set up the ufm stalled due to the outbreak of the gaza war .
high-level ministerial meetings of member states being postponed and important decisions on the ufm 's structure being put on hold .
only now is the union taking the first steps to set up a secretariat in barcelona : a group of staff and experts from member states who will , among other things , help shape and implement the mediterranean solar plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the desertec industry initiative will provide 15 per cent of europe 's electricity by 2050 the desertec industry initiative -lrb- di -rrb- is developing at a much greater pace .
founded by 13 partners , most of them german , the consortium now has 17 partners from seven countries .
negotiations for tunisian and italian companies to join the consortium are advanced , and up to six further additions to the consortium are expected .
another 22 firms support dii as associated partners .
by expanding to include companies from the mena region , dii is also fulfilling demands that those countries in which power plants are to be built be involved from the outset .
two energy projects , one priority region given that access to energy is a cornerstone of the united nations ' millennium development goals , development of the mena region must take priority in both projects .
enormous population growth and increasing industrialization have left african countries with a great deal of catching up to do when it comes to energy projects .
industrialized nations are facing the challenges posed by climate change , which means prioritizing investment in renewable and efficient energy technologies – and the same must go for developing countries and emerging economies .
against this backdrop , the question arises of why fossil power plants are still being built in both industrialized and developing countries .
there are technical reasons for this : renewable energy sources like wind power and photovoltaics will not be able to serve as base-load energies until ‘ intelligent ' electricity grids and storage capacities become available .
what 's more , the cost of investing in renewables is still higher than that of investing in fossil fuel-fired power plants – although costs for fuels in these plants , like coal or natural gas , recur throughout the plants ' operation .
bildunterschrift : morocco " appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables " in the mena region what renewables and large-scale projects like the dii need are a clear legal , administrative and above all economic frameworks .
only then will the high investment costs pay off later .
the conditions must apply in those countries in which the power plants are to be constructed as well as to legislation in the european union and in eu member states that plan to import electricity from africa .
encouraging use of renewables in eu , germany and beyond the 2009 “ eu directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources ” already set the framework for energy projects with non-eu countries as well as for importing electricity generated .
in germany 's case , this means that the question of whether the renewable energy sources act will be extended to include a feed-in tariff for ‘ desert electricity ' is a critical one .
of all the countries in the mena region , morocco appears to be making the most progress when it comes to creating conditions conducive to using renewables .
the country currently imports 95 per cent of its energy requirements , but wants to increase its reliance on renewables to 40 per cent of total energy use by 2020 .
this is another reason that the dii consortium regards morocco as an ideal partner country and is planning to begin work on installing a first power plant park there – one it hopes will prove that the vision of generating electricity in the desert can be realized .
clear regulatory frameworks needed , not intergovernmental entrepreneurialism so , where do the two initiatives – the mediterranean solar plan and dii – now stand , one and two years respectively after they were founded and what priorities should they set for the future ?
the mediterranean solar plan is a political process and should be regarded as such .
it is not the task of an intergovernmental process to take on entrepreneurial initiatives and install power plants – especially when it takes two years to set up a secretariat .
the plan 's focus should , therefore , be on speeding up the process of creating the regulatory framework that will enable private-sector initiatives and investments in the ufm 's member countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias ruchser works with the german development institute the countries in the mena region still do not have enough financial clout to independently shoulder such cost-intensive cross-border infrastructure projects .
but the launch of the dii has already led some mena countries to re-shape their regulatory frameworks and set new goals in regard to expanding their renewables capacities .
this will not only make them more attractive to investors from industrialized countries but also for financial institutions such as , for example , the african development bank , the world bank and the european investment bank .
in that respect desertec and the mediterranean solar plan are parallel processes that should complement and cross-fertilize each other .

some experts , however , are far from convinced . with reports of clashes between lebanese and israeli forces , fears of a renewed conflict in lebanon have been growing ever since hassan nasrallah , the leader of the shiite militant group hezbollah , claimed members of his party were on the verge of being indicted by a un tribunal probing the 2005 murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri .
the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- is investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result .
however , relations have been slowly normalizing , as indicated by president assad 's visit to lebanon recently - his first since hariri 's assassination .
while that in itself could be seen as a breakthrough , assad 's accompanying of king abdullah - a close supporter of the sunni muslim hariri family - has been hailed as being even more significant .
syria and saudi arabia have been on opposing sides in many of the complicated feuds in the middle east , including that over influence in lebanon , for decades .
regional rivals the closest of enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah paralyzed beirut with strikes and unrest in 2008 some observers have welcomed the visit as an attempt to defuse a situation which could potentially lead to a conflict similar to that in may 2008 , when 100 people were killed in clashes that erupted when the government announced - and then repealed - a crackdown on hezbollah .
others , however , believe assad and abdullah 's mission could have wider , more damaging implications not only to lebanon 's stability but to the stability of the region as a whole .
" the hariri family and hezbollah , and their supporters , have been enemies for five or six years now which reflects the wider divisions in the middle east , " nadim shehadi , a lebanon expert with the middle east programme at chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" this situation has been akin to the cold war with the repercussions playing out everywhere from palestine to iraq . "
" the most important recent development was seen at last year 's arab league summit in doha where gaza was the main topic , " he added .
" the saudis were there , egypt , jordan … but the whole radical front boycotted the meeting .
there was no hamas , no hezbollah , no iran and no syria . "
" saudi arabia and egypt were forced to look into the abyss and they saw that their power as interlocutors and mediators was under threat .
any deal in the region could be aborted by the radicals .
it meant that more say had to be given to others for any progress to be made . "
saudi arabia seen as giving syria its backing to return to beirut some analysts see king abdullah 's joint visit to lebanon with assad as the next step in a transfer of power and an indication that , instead of opposing a return to syrian domination of lebanon , saudi arabia is giving it its blessing .
the visit is seen by some as a clear message that syria , along with iran - another major backer of hezbollah , still holds sway in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad has met with prime minister saad hariri , rafiq 's son " bringing assad to lebanon on the saudi royal plane is a very big blessing indeed , " paul salem , the director of the carnegie endowment for international peace 's beirut bureau , told deutsche welle . " but saudi arabia brought assad to lebanon to help in a peace process not to give him carte blanche to do what he likes .
he was effectively brought in to stop his friends in hezbollah attacking the government .
this is a clear sign that it wo n't just be syria which is the go-to country for any lebanon crisis , but saudi arabia too .
the saudis need to be involved to protect their friends in the sunni community . " any resurgence of syrian influence in lebanon , however , could further complicate matters in regard to the stl 's findings and any indictment of hezbollah members in hariri 's murder .
both syria and hezbollah have an interest in bringing the tribunal to an end and have a number of devices at hand to potentially force this outcome .
while pressuring saudi arabia to use its relationship with the united states to postpone any indictment of hezbollah members , the saudis can not make the tribunal go away on their own .
syria and hezbollah would have to do their part . " when the lebanese government was preparing to call for a tribunal , hezbollah and the syria-affiliated parties in the government pulled out and closed down the parliament , " shehadi said . " hezbollah then took over the city and paralyzed the institutions , shutting down the government 's power to call its own tribunal .
so the pro-tribunal parties had to call on the un to form the tribunal , which was an unprecedented step .
it effectively forced the tribunal on lebanon and interfered in the running of a sovereign state . " " if the tribunal rules that syria and hezbollah was behind the hariri assassination , then there is a great chance that we will see violence in beirut .
what could precede that is an attempt by syria and hezbollah to either paralyze the lebanese government or change it .
in both cases , a new government under anti-tribunal control can call for the investigation to be called off , saying that the two sides have reconciled and there is no need for it to continue .
the un will have to agree to this unless it can be proved that the country has been hijacked . " hezbollah committed to changing beirut 's position paul salem believes that hezbollah will continue to push for the tribunal to be ended as long as it assumes that there is a political aspect to the tribunal 's process which is aimed at punishing its members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah is prepared to do all it can to influence policy " it 's obvious that syria and hezbollah wants the tribunal to go away and they have been doing their best by discrediting it publically and claiming that it is politicized , " salem said .
" they won ’ t be able to stop the tribunal as such but they could pressure the government to change its position through the threat of violence or by taking over beirut , which could lead to a statement of no-confidence in the tribunal or a withdrawal of support from the government . " " this could lead to a situation where the tribunal has no lebanese support which would mean arrest warrants could not be issued in lebanon or arrests made .
it could pass a guilty verdict on hezbollah and / or syria but little would change . " peace pact appears to hinge on tribunal ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese president sleiman , right , could tow the line for peace in the communique issued after the mini-summit between assad , abdullah and lebanese president michel sleiman , all of lebanon 's political parties were urged to " pursue the path of appeasement and dialogue and to boost national unity in the face of outside threats . "
the leaders stressed " the importance of stability ... the commitment -lrb- of the lebanese -rrb- not to resort to violence and the need to place the country 's interests above all sectarian interests , " the communique read .
avoiding a return to violence between hariri-supporting sunnis and the shiites of hezbollah in lebanon appears to be the main justification for the syrian-saudi agreement .
however , it appears that this pact between two of the main players from the opposing sides can only ensure peace by removing the tribunal problem , given that hezbollah has threatened to take whatever action it deems necessary should its members be indicted .

"
the leaders stressed " the importance of stability ... the commitment -lrb- of the lebanese -rrb- not to resort to violence and the need to place the country 's interests above all sectarian interests , " the communique read .
avoiding a return to violence between hariri-supporting sunnis and the shiites of hezbollah in lebanon appears to be the main justification for the syrian-saudi agreement .
however , it appears that this pact between two of the main players from the opposing sides can only ensure peace by removing the tribunal problem , given that hezbollah has threatened to take whatever action it deems necessary should its members be indicted .

some experts , however , are far from convinced . with reports of clashes between lebanese and israeli forces , fears of a renewed conflict in lebanon have been growing ever since hassan nasrallah , the leader of the shiite militant group hezbollah , claimed members of his party were on the verge of being indicted by a un tribunal probing the 2005 murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri .
the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- is investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result .
however , relations have been slowly normalizing , as indicated by president assad 's visit to lebanon recently - his first since hariri 's assassination .
while that in itself could be seen as a breakthrough , assad 's accompanying of king abdullah - a close supporter of the sunni muslim hariri family - has been hailed as being even more significant .
syria and saudi arabia have been on opposing sides in many of the complicated feuds in the middle east , including that over influence in lebanon , for decades .
regional rivals the closest of enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah paralyzed beirut with strikes and unrest in 2008 some observers have welcomed the visit as an attempt to defuse a situation which could potentially lead to a conflict similar to that in may 2008 , when 100 people were killed in clashes that erupted when the government announced - and then repealed - a crackdown on hezbollah .
others , however , believe assad and abdullah 's mission could have wider , more damaging implications not only to lebanon 's stability but to the stability of the region as a whole .
" the hariri family and hezbollah , and their supporters , have been enemies for five or six years now which reflects the wider divisions in the middle east , " nadim shehadi , a lebanon expert with the middle east programme at chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" this situation has been akin to the cold war with the repercussions playing out everywhere from palestine to iraq . "
" the most important recent development was seen at last year 's arab league summit in doha where gaza was the main topic , " he added .
" the saudis were there , egypt , jordan … but the whole radical front boycotted the meeting .
there was no hamas , no hezbollah , no iran and no syria . "
" saudi arabia and egypt were forced to look into the abyss and they saw that their power as interlocutors and mediators was under threat .
any deal in the region could be aborted by the radicals .
it meant that more say had to be given to others for any progress to be made . "
saudi arabia seen as giving syria its backing to return to beirut some analysts see king abdullah 's joint visit to lebanon with assad as the next step in a transfer of power and an indication that , instead of opposing a return to syrian domination of lebanon , saudi arabia is giving it its blessing .
the visit is seen by some as a clear message that syria , along with iran - another major backer of hezbollah , still holds sway in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad has met with prime minister saad hariri , rafiq 's son " bringing assad to lebanon on the saudi royal plane is a very big blessing indeed , " paul salem , the director of the carnegie endowment for international peace 's beirut bureau , told deutsche welle . " but saudi arabia brought assad to lebanon to help in a peace process not to give him carte blanche to do what he likes .
he was effectively brought in to stop his friends in hezbollah attacking the government .
this is a clear sign that it wo n't just be syria which is the go-to country for any lebanon crisis , but saudi arabia too .
the saudis need to be involved to protect their friends in the sunni community . " any resurgence of syrian influence in lebanon , however , could further complicate matters in regard to the stl 's findings and any indictment of hezbollah members in hariri 's murder .
both syria and hezbollah have an interest in bringing the tribunal to an end and have a number of devices at hand to potentially force this outcome .
while pressuring saudi arabia to use its relationship with the united states to postpone any indictment of hezbollah members , the saudis can not make the tribunal go away on their own .
syria and hezbollah would have to do their part . " when the lebanese government was preparing to call for a tribunal , hezbollah and the syria-affiliated parties in the government pulled out and closed down the parliament , " shehadi said . " hezbollah then took over the city and paralyzed the institutions , shutting down the government 's power to call its own tribunal .

the visit is seen by some as a clear message that syria , along with iran - another major backer of hezbollah , still holds sway in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad has met with prime minister saad hariri , rafiq 's son " bringing assad to lebanon on the saudi royal plane is a very big blessing indeed , " paul salem , the director of the carnegie endowment for international peace 's beirut bureau , told deutsche welle . " but saudi arabia brought assad to lebanon to help in a peace process not to give him carte blanche to do what he likes .
he was effectively brought in to stop his friends in hezbollah attacking the government .
this is a clear sign that it wo n't just be syria which is the go-to country for any lebanon crisis , but saudi arabia too .
the saudis need to be involved to protect their friends in the sunni community . " any resurgence of syrian influence in lebanon , however , could further complicate matters in regard to the stl 's findings and any indictment of hezbollah members in hariri 's murder .
both syria and hezbollah have an interest in bringing the tribunal to an end and have a number of devices at hand to potentially force this outcome .
while pressuring saudi arabia to use its relationship with the united states to postpone any indictment of hezbollah members , the saudis can not make the tribunal go away on their own .
syria and hezbollah would have to do their part . " when the lebanese government was preparing to call for a tribunal , hezbollah and the syria-affiliated parties in the government pulled out and closed down the parliament , " shehadi said . " hezbollah then took over the city and paralyzed the institutions , shutting down the government 's power to call its own tribunal .
so the pro-tribunal parties had to call on the un to form the tribunal , which was an unprecedented step .
it effectively forced the tribunal on lebanon and interfered in the running of a sovereign state . " " if the tribunal rules that syria and hezbollah was behind the hariri assassination , then there is a great chance that we will see violence in beirut .
what could precede that is an attempt by syria and hezbollah to either paralyze the lebanese government or change it .
in both cases , a new government under anti-tribunal control can call for the investigation to be called off , saying that the two sides have reconciled and there is no need for it to continue .
the un will have to agree to this unless it can be proved that the country has been hijacked . " hezbollah committed to changing beirut 's position paul salem believes that hezbollah will continue to push for the tribunal to be ended as long as it assumes that there is a political aspect to the tribunal 's process which is aimed at punishing its members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah is prepared to do all it can to influence policy " it 's obvious that syria and hezbollah wants the tribunal to go away and they have been doing their best by discrediting it publically and claiming that it is politicized , " salem said .
" they won ’ t be able to stop the tribunal as such but they could pressure the government to change its position through the threat of violence or by taking over beirut , which could lead to a statement of no-confidence in the tribunal or a withdrawal of support from the government . " " this could lead to a situation where the tribunal has no lebanese support which would mean arrest warrants could not be issued in lebanon or arrests made .
it could pass a guilty verdict on hezbollah and / or syria but little would change . " peace pact appears to hinge on tribunal ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese president sleiman , right , could tow the line for peace in the communique issued after the mini-summit between assad , abdullah and lebanese president michel sleiman , all of lebanon 's political parties were urged to " pursue the path of appeasement and dialogue and to boost national unity in the face of outside threats . "
the leaders stressed " the importance of stability ... the commitment -lrb- of the lebanese -rrb- not to resort to violence and the need to place the country 's interests above all sectarian interests , " the communique read .
avoiding a return to violence between hariri-supporting sunnis and the shiites of hezbollah in lebanon appears to be the main justification for the syrian-saudi agreement .
however , it appears that this pact between two of the main players from the opposing sides can only ensure peace by removing the tribunal problem , given that hezbollah has threatened to take whatever action it deems necessary should its members be indicted .

some experts , however , are far from convinced . with reports of clashes between lebanese and israeli forces , fears of a renewed conflict in lebanon have been growing ever since hassan nasrallah , the leader of the shiite militant group hezbollah , claimed members of his party were on the verge of being indicted by a un tribunal probing the 2005 murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri .
the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- is investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result .
however , relations have been slowly normalizing , as indicated by president assad 's visit to lebanon recently - his first since hariri 's assassination .
while that in itself could be seen as a breakthrough , assad 's accompanying of king abdullah - a close supporter of the sunni muslim hariri family - has been hailed as being even more significant .
syria and saudi arabia have been on opposing sides in many of the complicated feuds in the middle east , including that over influence in lebanon , for decades .
regional rivals the closest of enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah paralyzed beirut with strikes and unrest in 2008 some observers have welcomed the visit as an attempt to defuse a situation which could potentially lead to a conflict similar to that in may 2008 , when 100 people were killed in clashes that erupted when the government announced - and then repealed - a crackdown on hezbollah .
others , however , believe assad and abdullah 's mission could have wider , more damaging implications not only to lebanon 's stability but to the stability of the region as a whole .
" the hariri family and hezbollah , and their supporters , have been enemies for five or six years now which reflects the wider divisions in the middle east , " nadim shehadi , a lebanon expert with the middle east programme at chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" this situation has been akin to the cold war with the repercussions playing out everywhere from palestine to iraq . "
" the most important recent development was seen at last year 's arab league summit in doha where gaza was the main topic , " he added .
" the saudis were there , egypt , jordan … but the whole radical front boycotted the meeting .
there was no hamas , no hezbollah , no iran and no syria . "
" saudi arabia and egypt were forced to look into the abyss and they saw that their power as interlocutors and mediators was under threat .
any deal in the region could be aborted by the radicals .
it meant that more say had to be given to others for any progress to be made . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 03.08.2010 germany 's highest court strengthens unmarried fathers ' rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unmarried dads will soon be able to sue for joint custody the german constitutional court decided on tuesday to give unmarried fathers the right to sue for joint custody of their children .
the new ruling brings germany in line with the european court of human rights . when relationships end with a messy break-up , a disagreement over child custody is often one of the battlegrounds . on tuesday , the balance in such battles was tipped in favor of unmarried fathers by the german constitutional court in karlsruhe when it decided to overturn the current german law on child custody for unmarried couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strasbourg court said germany 's law must be changed ute granold , parliamentary spokesperson on family law for the governing christian democratic union , says that , until now , the mother has had the final say on whether the father has any rights at all .
" with unmarried parents , the father must first accept his paternity , " she explained .
" the mother must agree , and then the second step is going to the youth welfare office to apply for joint custody .
and here the mother can either accept or reject the claim . "
in future , although the mother will still automatically receive sole custody of the child , the father will have the right to challenge for joint custody in court .
government support this change has the enthusiastic backing of the german government , especially the junior coalition partners , the liberal free democrats .
hartfrid wolff , one of the party 's spokesmen on family policy , said , " we in the governing coalition agree that the issue must be about doing what is best for the child , and about raising the status of unmarried fathers , just as the european court of human rights has called for . "
the european court of human rights provoked tuesday 's decision last december , when it ruled that germany 's custody rules were contrary to both discrimination laws and article 8 of the european human rights convention , which protects the right to family life .
willi schoene belongs to a campaign for father 's rights that has welcomed the ruling as an important victory .
the campaign has long argued that mothers often deny the father joint custody because of a personal conflict , and not because they have the interests of the child at heart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court said the child 's interests were paramount schoene thinks children are too often used as a means to an end in a break-up .
" if i was a law-maker i would try to prevent the child from being seen as an economic factor , or a cash cow , " he said .
" that 's what it 's all about in the end .
in my experience , it 's always about power or money . "
extra stress for single parents the decision effectively means that the legal difference between married and unmarried couples has become smaller once again .
but edith schwab , of the association for single-parent families , has misgivings about the new ruling .
" the custody rights of fathers have been strengthened in that , for the first time , a right to sue has been introduced in germany , " she said .
" we have never had that before .
of course we have a few problems with the right to sue , because we know that every lawsuit about custody always causes a massive strain for the single-parent family . "
but those in favor of the new ruling believe that it will encourage unmarried fathers to take responsibility for their children .
german law-makers are now expected to draft the new law in the autumn .

divide the herbs in two : chop finely one of the halves , and put the other half inside the belly of the fish .
in a bowl , add a bit of water to the salt , and also the chopped herbs , and mix it well .
put a bit of this mix in a flat oven tray , to form a bed for the fish and to prevent it from sticking to the tray .
add the fish and cover it completely with the salt .
if you are unsure about the cooking time , this is the right time to stick a wooden toothpick on the " neck " of the fish - behind the head , in the thicker part of the fish .
the salt cover must be around 3 to 4 cm .
place in the oven and cook for about 30 minutes at 200º celsius .
the time depends on the power of the oven , so you may want to use the " toothpick trick " .
if you can take it out of the fish very easily , it is ready , if not , leave it to cook more .
if you are unsure , leave it in the oven for another five minutes .
serve it with crust .
to catch the eye of your guests , you can sprinkle a bit of cognac or other strong beverage and set it on fire .
serve with sautéed vegetables and potatos .
to remove the crust , use a jagged knife to make an incision all along the fish , then remove the salt .
make another incision along the sides of the fish and peel the skin .
you can add a few home made sauces on the side , if you like .
mayonnaise with garlic works fine , for example .

if you are unsure , leave it in the oven for another five minutes .
serve it with crust .
to catch the eye of your guests , you can sprinkle a bit of cognac or other strong beverage and set it on fire .
serve with sautéed vegetables and potatos .
to remove the crust , use a jagged knife to make an incision all along the fish , then remove the salt .
make another incision along the sides of the fish and peel the skin .
you can add a few home made sauces on the side , if you like .
mayonnaise with garlic works fine , for example .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 03.08.2010 syria-saudi pact promises peace but lebanon remains on tenterhooks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more than peace at stake for abdullah and assad the visit by syrian president bashar al-assad and saudi king abdullah to lebanon has been hailed as a significant step at easing the simmering tensions in the country .
some experts , however , are far from convinced . with reports of clashes between lebanese and israeli forces , fears of a renewed conflict in lebanon have been growing ever since hassan nasrallah , the leader of the shiite militant group hezbollah , claimed members of his party were on the verge of being indicted by a un tribunal probing the 2005 murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri .
the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- is investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result .
however , relations have been slowly normalizing , as indicated by president assad 's visit to lebanon recently - his first since hariri 's assassination .
while that in itself could be seen as a breakthrough , assad 's accompanying of king abdullah - a close supporter of the sunni muslim hariri family - has been hailed as being even more significant .
syria and saudi arabia have been on opposing sides in many of the complicated feuds in the middle east , including that over influence in lebanon , for decades .
regional rivals the closest of enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah paralyzed beirut with strikes and unrest in 2008 some observers have welcomed the visit as an attempt to defuse a situation which could potentially lead to a conflict similar to that in may 2008 , when 100 people were killed in clashes that erupted when the government announced - and then repealed - a crackdown on hezbollah .
others , however , believe assad and abdullah 's mission could have wider , more damaging implications not only to lebanon 's stability but to the stability of the region as a whole .
" the hariri family and hezbollah , and their supporters , have been enemies for five or six years now which reflects the wider divisions in the middle east , " nadim shehadi , a lebanon expert with the middle east programme at chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" this situation has been akin to the cold war with the repercussions playing out everywhere from palestine to iraq . "
" the most important recent development was seen at last year 's arab league summit in doha where gaza was the main topic , " he added .
" the saudis were there , egypt , jordan … but the whole radical front boycotted the meeting .
there was no hamas , no hezbollah , no iran and no syria . "
" saudi arabia and egypt were forced to look into the abyss and they saw that their power as interlocutors and mediators was under threat .
any deal in the region could be aborted by the radicals .
it meant that more say had to be given to others for any progress to be made . "
saudi arabia seen as giving syria its backing to return to beirut some analysts see king abdullah 's joint visit to lebanon with assad as the next step in a transfer of power and an indication that , instead of opposing a return to syrian domination of lebanon , saudi arabia is giving it its blessing .
the visit is seen by some as a clear message that syria , along with iran - another major backer of hezbollah , still holds sway in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad has met with prime minister saad hariri , rafiq 's son " bringing assad to lebanon on the saudi royal plane is a very big blessing indeed , " paul salem , the director of the carnegie endowment for international peace 's beirut bureau , told deutsche welle . " but saudi arabia brought assad to lebanon to help in a peace process not to give him carte blanche to do what he likes .
he was effectively brought in to stop his friends in hezbollah attacking the government .
this is a clear sign that it wo n't just be syria which is the go-to country for any lebanon crisis , but saudi arabia too .
the saudis need to be involved to protect their friends in the sunni community . " any resurgence of syrian influence in lebanon , however , could further complicate matters in regard to the stl 's findings and any indictment of hezbollah members in hariri 's murder .
both syria and hezbollah have an interest in bringing the tribunal to an end and have a number of devices at hand to potentially force this outcome .
while pressuring saudi arabia to use its relationship with the united states to postpone any indictment of hezbollah members , the saudis can not make the tribunal go away on their own .
syria and hezbollah would have to do their part . " when the lebanese government was preparing to call for a tribunal , hezbollah and the syria-affiliated parties in the government pulled out and closed down the parliament , " shehadi said . " hezbollah then took over the city and paralyzed the institutions , shutting down the government 's power to call its own tribunal .
so the pro-tribunal parties had to call on the un to form the tribunal , which was an unprecedented step .
it effectively forced the tribunal on lebanon and interfered in the running of a sovereign state . " " if the tribunal rules that syria and hezbollah was behind the hariri assassination , then there is a great chance that we will see violence in beirut .
what could precede that is an attempt by syria and hezbollah to either paralyze the lebanese government or change it .
in both cases , a new government under anti-tribunal control can call for the investigation to be called off , saying that the two sides have reconciled and there is no need for it to continue .
the un will have to agree to this unless it can be proved that the country has been hijacked . " hezbollah committed to changing beirut 's position paul salem believes that hezbollah will continue to push for the tribunal to be ended as long as it assumes that there is a political aspect to the tribunal 's process which is aimed at punishing its members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah is prepared to do all it can to influence policy " it 's obvious that syria and hezbollah wants the tribunal to go away and they have been doing their best by discrediting it publically and claiming that it is politicized , " salem said .
" they won ’ t be able to stop the tribunal as such but they could pressure the government to change its position through the threat of violence or by taking over beirut , which could lead to a statement of no-confidence in the tribunal or a withdrawal of support from the government . " " this could lead to a situation where the tribunal has no lebanese support which would mean arrest warrants could not be issued in lebanon or arrests made .
it could pass a guilty verdict on hezbollah and / or syria but little would change . " peace pact appears to hinge on tribunal ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese president sleiman , right , could tow the line for peace in the communique issued after the mini-summit between assad , abdullah and lebanese president michel sleiman , all of lebanon 's political parties were urged to " pursue the path of appeasement and dialogue and to boost national unity in the face of outside threats . "
the leaders stressed " the importance of stability ... the commitment -lrb- of the lebanese -rrb- not to resort to violence and the need to place the country 's interests above all sectarian interests , " the communique read .
avoiding a return to violence between hariri-supporting sunnis and the shiites of hezbollah in lebanon appears to be the main justification for the syrian-saudi agreement .
however , it appears that this pact between two of the main players from the opposing sides can only ensure peace by removing the tribunal problem , given that hezbollah has threatened to take whatever action it deems necessary should its members be indicted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 03.08.2010 syria-saudi pact promises peace but lebanon remains on tenterhooks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more than peace at stake for abdullah and assad the visit by syrian president bashar al-assad and saudi king abdullah to lebanon has been hailed as a significant step at easing the simmering tensions in the country .
some experts , however , are far from convinced . with reports of clashes between lebanese and israeli forces , fears of a renewed conflict in lebanon have been growing ever since hassan nasrallah , the leader of the shiite militant group hezbollah , claimed members of his party were on the verge of being indicted by a un tribunal probing the 2005 murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri .
the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- is investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result .
however , relations have been slowly normalizing , as indicated by president assad 's visit to lebanon recently - his first since hariri 's assassination .
while that in itself could be seen as a breakthrough , assad 's accompanying of king abdullah - a close supporter of the sunni muslim hariri family - has been hailed as being even more significant .
syria and saudi arabia have been on opposing sides in many of the complicated feuds in the middle east , including that over influence in lebanon , for decades .
regional rivals the closest of enemies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah paralyzed beirut with strikes and unrest in 2008 some observers have welcomed the visit as an attempt to defuse a situation which could potentially lead to a conflict similar to that in may 2008 , when 100 people were killed in clashes that erupted when the government announced - and then repealed - a crackdown on hezbollah .
others , however , believe assad and abdullah 's mission could have wider , more damaging implications not only to lebanon 's stability but to the stability of the region as a whole .
" the hariri family and hezbollah , and their supporters , have been enemies for five or six years now which reflects the wider divisions in the middle east , " nadim shehadi , a lebanon expert with the middle east programme at chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" this situation has been akin to the cold war with the repercussions playing out everywhere from palestine to iraq . "
" the most important recent development was seen at last year 's arab league summit in doha where gaza was the main topic , " he added .
" the saudis were there , egypt , jordan … but the whole radical front boycotted the meeting .
there was no hamas , no hezbollah , no iran and no syria . "
" saudi arabia and egypt were forced to look into the abyss and they saw that their power as interlocutors and mediators was under threat .
any deal in the region could be aborted by the radicals .
it meant that more say had to be given to others for any progress to be made . "
saudi arabia seen as giving syria its backing to return to beirut some analysts see king abdullah 's joint visit to lebanon with assad as the next step in a transfer of power and an indication that , instead of opposing a return to syrian domination of lebanon , saudi arabia is giving it its blessing .
the visit is seen by some as a clear message that syria , along with iran - another major backer of hezbollah , still holds sway in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad has met with prime minister saad hariri , rafiq 's son " bringing assad to lebanon on the saudi royal plane is a very big blessing indeed , " paul salem , the director of the carnegie endowment for international peace 's beirut bureau , told deutsche welle . " but saudi arabia brought assad to lebanon to help in a peace process not to give him carte blanche to do what he likes .
he was effectively brought in to stop his friends in hezbollah attacking the government .
this is a clear sign that it wo n't just be syria which is the go-to country for any lebanon crisis , but saudi arabia too .
the saudis need to be involved to protect their friends in the sunni community . " any resurgence of syrian influence in lebanon , however , could further complicate matters in regard to the stl 's findings and any indictment of hezbollah members in hariri 's murder .
both syria and hezbollah have an interest in bringing the tribunal to an end and have a number of devices at hand to potentially force this outcome .
while pressuring saudi arabia to use its relationship with the united states to postpone any indictment of hezbollah members , the saudis can not make the tribunal go away on their own .
syria and hezbollah would have to do their part . " when the lebanese government was preparing to call for a tribunal , hezbollah and the syria-affiliated parties in the government pulled out and closed down the parliament , " shehadi said . " hezbollah then took over the city and paralyzed the institutions , shutting down the government 's power to call its own tribunal .
so the pro-tribunal parties had to call on the un to form the tribunal , which was an unprecedented step .
it effectively forced the tribunal on lebanon and interfered in the running of a sovereign state . " " if the tribunal rules that syria and hezbollah was behind the hariri assassination , then there is a great chance that we will see violence in beirut .
what could precede that is an attempt by syria and hezbollah to either paralyze the lebanese government or change it .
in both cases , a new government under anti-tribunal control can call for the investigation to be called off , saying that the two sides have reconciled and there is no need for it to continue .
the un will have to agree to this unless it can be proved that the country has been hijacked . " hezbollah committed to changing beirut 's position paul salem believes that hezbollah will continue to push for the tribunal to be ended as long as it assumes that there is a political aspect to the tribunal 's process which is aimed at punishing its members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah is prepared to do all it can to influence policy " it 's obvious that syria and hezbollah wants the tribunal to go away and they have been doing their best by discrediting it publically and claiming that it is politicized , " salem said .
" they won ’ t be able to stop the tribunal as such but they could pressure the government to change its position through the threat of violence or by taking over beirut , which could lead to a statement of no-confidence in the tribunal or a withdrawal of support from the government . " " this could lead to a situation where the tribunal has no lebanese support which would mean arrest warrants could not be issued in lebanon or arrests made .
it could pass a guilty verdict on hezbollah and / or syria but little would change . " peace pact appears to hinge on tribunal ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese president sleiman , right , could tow the line for peace in the communique issued after the mini-summit between assad , abdullah and lebanese president michel sleiman , all of lebanon 's political parties were urged to " pursue the path of appeasement and dialogue and to boost national unity in the face of outside threats . "
the leaders stressed " the importance of stability ... the commitment -lrb- of the lebanese -rrb- not to resort to violence and the need to place the country 's interests above all sectarian interests , " the communique read .
avoiding a return to violence between hariri-supporting sunnis and the shiites of hezbollah in lebanon appears to be the main justification for the syrian-saudi agreement .
however , it appears that this pact between two of the main players from the opposing sides can only ensure peace by removing the tribunal problem , given that hezbollah has threatened to take whatever action it deems necessary should its members be indicted .

the leaders stressed " the importance of stability ... the commitment -lrb- of the lebanese -rrb- not to resort to violence and the need to place the country 's interests above all sectarian interests , " the communique read .
avoiding a return to violence between hariri-supporting sunnis and the shiites of hezbollah in lebanon appears to be the main justification for the syrian-saudi agreement .
however , it appears that this pact between two of the main players from the opposing sides can only ensure peace by removing the tribunal problem , given that hezbollah has threatened to take whatever action it deems necessary should its members be indicted .

the species inventories released on monday conclude work by 360 scientists to integrate both new and prior knowledge , much of it from diverse , localized sources , as well as nations ' exclusive economic zones .
these efforts resulted in the first comprehensive lists of marine life in diverse regions .
" the most significant thing about them is that we actually have them – and we never did before , " said ron o 'dor , co-senior scientist for the census of marine life , or coml , which commissioned the project .
coml described the collection of biodiversity reports as a " prelude " to the main marine census findings on species distribution and abundance , scheduled for an october release in london .
over the past decade , more than 2,700 scientists have participated in the census of marine life .
according to a statement summarizing the reports , coml researchers expect the project 's estimate of all known marine species to surpass 230,000 specimens .
the final figure will also include species not yet listed in the ocean biogeographic information system , or obis – a permanent database featuring millions of records that aid both researchers and policymakers .

more than 22,000 species were reported in chinese waters .
preserving these diverse marine ecosystems , however , requires stringent regulations .
o 'dor said strict environmental protections are in place in australian waters , but policing the thousands of islands that comprise the philippines and indonesia is more challenging .
but the area has other vulnerabilities : " climate change , global warming is going to have a heavy impact in that region because it 's right on the equator , " he told deutsche welle .
though threats to biodiversity varied across regions , the biggest challenges to marine life overall are overfishing , pollution , loss of habitat and invasive species .
" most of the problems are associated with human influences , " o 'dor said , citing as examples the creation of anoxic " dead " zones in the gulf of mexico due to mississippi river runoff and mining and oil exploration .
yet overfishing is at the top of the threat list – with much of the impact concentrated within nations ' exclusive economic zones .
o 'dor recommended an approach to fisheries management based on entire ecosystems , not just individual species .
" you ca n't manage species in isolation , " he said .
but crafting an approach that incorporates tens of thousands of species in waters rich in biodiversity , like those around australia , is not easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea has seen its biodiversity change over time europe 's enclosed seas the mediterranean sea was among those regions with the " most threatened " biodiversity .
it was also the region most threatened by invasive species – with 600 aliens .
most of them originated in the red sea and arrived via the suez canal .
" the problem nowadays is the velocity of this phenomenon – now species are introduced by humans more intensively , " marta coll , lead author of the mediterranean sea regional synthesis , told deutsche welle .
coll nevertheless described the mediterranean as a hotspot of diverse marine life forms – with plenty still left to discover .
" for example , experts still debate how many species of fish inhabit the mediterranean sea , " she said .
meanwhile , the threats facing this region have diversified , with climate change among the main phenomena that stand to influence marine life .
in the baltic , another one of europe 's enclosed seas , biodiversity is also under pressure .
henn ojaveer , lead author of the forthcoming coml paper on the baltic sea , said the region has seen its biodiversity profile change over the past 40 to 50 years , and even today the situation is " completely heterogeneous . "
the number of different species counted in the baltic sea stood at about 6,000 .
" this is very likely an underestimation , but the best count we have currently , " ojaveer said .
all will be revealed on october 4 , the census of marine life plans to present a final count for new species discovered over the course of the decade-long project .
coml researchers would not release the number in advance , but did indicate that several thousand species were " new to science . "
" the sheer number that have been discovered so far , it 's amazing , " said bhavani e. narayanaswamy , project coordinator for the coml european implementation committee .
" but even more so is the fact that there remains even more to be discovered . "
identifying and describing new marine species is a long , arduous process – and coml 's statement on the reports labels current knowledge of biodiversity in all regions studied as " inadequate . "
yet the census marks the most comprehensive look at the world 's marine life so far , and the largest international collaboration ever between scientists in the field .
the european commission 's environment spokesman , joe hennon , said the commission was grateful for coml 's contribution , calling it " an international driving force in promoting a better knowledge of the seas . "
" we can not achieve the aims of the maritime policy – exploiting new resources sustainably or protecting the marine environment – if we do not know what resources are out there to protect , " hennon said . bildunterschrift : census scientists expect to announce the discovery of " several thousand " new species in october open ocean , endless possibilities the census results scheduled for release in october will take a broader view of the world 's marine environment .
this should yield more data on species in the open ocean beyond the continental shelf .
moreover , the data will be organized by " realm , ” from ice oceans to microbes .
coml research has also focused on both species identification and active geology in the deep sea .
maria baker , manager of one of the realm 's field projects known as " chess , " said scientists there have listed about 190 new species since work started in 2002 .
" every time we go down to new areas , you expect to find new species , " she said .
the project also led to the 2005 discovery of the first deep-sea vent south of the equator , as well as the northernmost and southernmost vents ever located .
just this year , researchers found the deepest known undersea volcanic rift in the cayman trough – at a depth of more than 5,000 meters .
but baker said reaching many deepwater regions is hindered by cost and accessibility issues , and more exploration must still be done : " we 're literally scraping the surface in some areas . "

the police union wants to send police from turkey on patrol in problem neighborhoods in germany .
the goal is higher acceptance of german officers - but the idea is controversial . in front of a bridal store , a man and a woman sit on wooden chairs , drinking black tea from small glasses - an everyday scene in many towns in turkey .
but hatice koek 's bridal shop is located in germany , in the duisburg neighborhood of marxloh .
the 32-year-old koek has been selling wedding dresses here for years .
when she heard about the idea of using turkish police officers in north rhine-westphalia , where duisburg is located , she was outraged .
it would be " a massive insult , to allow turkish police officers to patrol here , " koek said , not to mention destroying integration , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in berlin , a program trains young people of turkish origin as police officers the bridal shop is just one of many small businesses on wesel road operated by turkish immigrants .
restaurants , pharmacies , supermarkets , boutiques - all the businesses have turkish names .
visitors from turkey would feel right at home .
the residents , too , feel comfortable in their surroundings .
but do they really need turkish police ?
a turkish barber also rejected the idea .
" i would laugh if i saw a police officer here in a turkish uniform , " said a young man who was having his hair cut .
if someone has no respect for the german police , he wo n't take a turkish policeman seriously either , he said .
lack of respect but the head of the german police union in north rhine-westphalia is hoping for just that : erich rettinghaus wants to send turkish policemen on patrol with their german colleagues .
his goal is to find why young people of turkish origin often , in his opinion , have no respect for the police , and whether they would respond differently to turkish policemen .
according to rettinghaus ' plan , turkish officers would be deployed in immigrant-heavy districts such as marxloh in duisburg and ehrenfeld in cologne and given language support by turkish-speaking policemen and -women or interpreters . rettinghaus does n't see his suggestion as a declaration of helplessness .
rather , it 's more like an exchange , such as the ones with dutch police on the border to the netherlands .
" during peak holiday times , german police are dispatched to places where many german tourists go .
for example , in -lsb- the popular dutch resort town -rsb- renesse , there are german police to break up brawls in nightclubs and pubs , " says rettinghaus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many citizens with turkish background are skeptical of importing police officers but the presumed foreigners who live in marxloh and ehrenfeld are not tourists .
most of them were born in germany and are part of german society .
the lack of acceptance of german police goes both ways , said a group of young people in front of a video arcade .
the boys often feel they are treated badly .
" in fights between migrants , for example , the german police only show up after everything is over , " complained a 19-year-old .
another says : " if a german is caught cycling in the wrong bike lane , the policeman says simply : ' continue on . '
but a turk would be given a ticket right away . " ' guest officers ' with no authority these descriptions go against what rettinghaus says are police officers ' experiences on the beat : young people frequently try to prevent an arrest by attacking the patrol car and attempting to free the arrestee .
in such situations the turkish " guest police " could intervene by arbitrating , rettinghaus says .
however , the turkish police officers would have no legal powers and would not carry weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police sometimes collaborate with foreign police to patrol border areas although many marxloh residents are skeptical of the idea , some do believe that the deployment of turkish police officers would help to bridge the differences in attitude .
an older couple in a supermarket posits that the turkish uniforms would make a great impression on young people .
in one of the many traditional teahouses in marxloh , men are playing cards and backgammon .
a 32-year-old says he finds the idea of turkish police in germany absurd .
the state should educate young immigrants to join the police force instead , he argues .
he himself would be ready to give up his well-paid job , but he does n't have the necessary high school diploma to become an officer .
instead of getting policemen from turkey , who know neither the country nor the language , the state ought to approach people like him and recruit them , the outraged man said .
currently only one in seven of police trainees in north rhine-westphalia comes from an immigrant family .
rettinghaus would like to see more police officers with immigrant background .
working with turkish police , he says , is not an alternative , but a supplementary measure .
so far , however , there have been no talks with the turkish authorities .
whether his idea can be realized at all is still up in the air , admits rettinghaus .
the state interior ministry 's reaction has been " restrained , so far . "
but the state government has is new in office .
and the interior minister has many issues to tend to at the moment .
rettinghaus hopes that his proposal will get its turn soon .

the species inventories released on monday conclude work by 360 scientists to integrate both new and prior knowledge , much of it from diverse , localized sources , as well as nations ' exclusive economic zones .
these efforts resulted in the first comprehensive lists of marine life in diverse regions .
" the most significant thing about them is that we actually have them – and we never did before , " said ron o 'dor , co-senior scientist for the census of marine life , or coml , which commissioned the project .
coml described the collection of biodiversity reports as a " prelude " to the main marine census findings on species distribution and abundance , scheduled for an october release in london .
over the past decade , more than 2,700 scientists have participated in the census of marine life .
according to a statement summarizing the reports , coml researchers expect the project 's estimate of all known marine species to surpass 230,000 specimens .
the final figure will also include species not yet listed in the ocean biogeographic information system , or obis – a permanent database featuring millions of records that aid both researchers and policymakers .
bildunterschrift : asteronyx loveni is one of several thousand species found in japan 's waters biodiversity in focus – and under threat the latest papers estimate that biodiversity levels are highest in the waters around japan and australia , where almost 33,000 species are known to scientists .
more than 22,000 species were reported in chinese waters .
preserving these diverse marine ecosystems , however , requires stringent regulations .
o 'dor said strict environmental protections are in place in australian waters , but policing the thousands of islands that comprise the philippines and indonesia is more challenging .
but the area has other vulnerabilities : " climate change , global warming is going to have a heavy impact in that region because it 's right on the equator , " he told deutsche welle .
though threats to biodiversity varied across regions , the biggest challenges to marine life overall are overfishing , pollution , loss of habitat and invasive species .
" most of the problems are associated with human influences , " o 'dor said , citing as examples the creation of anoxic " dead " zones in the gulf of mexico due to mississippi river runoff and mining and oil exploration .
yet overfishing is at the top of the threat list – with much of the impact concentrated within nations ' exclusive economic zones .
o 'dor recommended an approach to fisheries management based on entire ecosystems , not just individual species .
" you ca n't manage species in isolation , " he said .
but crafting an approach that incorporates tens of thousands of species in waters rich in biodiversity , like those around australia , is not easy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea has seen its biodiversity change over time europe 's enclosed seas the mediterranean sea was among those regions with the " most threatened " biodiversity .
it was also the region most threatened by invasive species – with 600 aliens .
most of them originated in the red sea and arrived via the suez canal .
" the problem nowadays is the velocity of this phenomenon – now species are introduced by humans more intensively , " marta coll , lead author of the mediterranean sea regional synthesis , told deutsche welle .
coll nevertheless described the mediterranean as a hotspot of diverse marine life forms – with plenty still left to discover .
" for example , experts still debate how many species of fish inhabit the mediterranean sea , " she said .
meanwhile , the threats facing this region have diversified , with climate change among the main phenomena that stand to influence marine life .
in the baltic , another one of europe 's enclosed seas , biodiversity is also under pressure .
henn ojaveer , lead author of the forthcoming coml paper on the baltic sea , said the region has seen its biodiversity profile change over the past 40 to 50 years , and even today the situation is " completely heterogeneous . "
the number of different species counted in the baltic sea stood at about 6,000 .
" this is very likely an underestimation , but the best count we have currently , " ojaveer said .
all will be revealed on october 4 , the census of marine life plans to present a final count for new species discovered over the course of the decade-long project .
coml researchers would not release the number in advance , but did indicate that several thousand species were " new to science . "
" the sheer number that have been discovered so far , it 's amazing , " said bhavani e. narayanaswamy , project coordinator for the coml european implementation committee .
" but even more so is the fact that there remains even more to be discovered . "
identifying and describing new marine species is a long , arduous process – and coml 's statement on the reports labels current knowledge of biodiversity in all regions studied as " inadequate . "
yet the census marks the most comprehensive look at the world 's marine life so far , and the largest international collaboration ever between scientists in the field .
the european commission 's environment spokesman , joe hennon , said the commission was grateful for coml 's contribution , calling it " an international driving force in promoting a better knowledge of the seas . "
" we can not achieve the aims of the maritime policy – exploiting new resources sustainably or protecting the marine environment – if we do not know what resources are out there to protect , " hennon said . bildunterschrift : census scientists expect to announce the discovery of " several thousand " new species in october open ocean , endless possibilities the census results scheduled for release in october will take a broader view of the world 's marine environment .
this should yield more data on species in the open ocean beyond the continental shelf .
moreover , the data will be organized by " realm , ” from ice oceans to microbes .
coml research has also focused on both species identification and active geology in the deep sea .
maria baker , manager of one of the realm 's field projects known as " chess , " said scientists there have listed about 190 new species since work started in 2002 .
" every time we go down to new areas , you expect to find new species , " she said .
the project also led to the 2005 discovery of the first deep-sea vent south of the equator , as well as the northernmost and southernmost vents ever located .
just this year , researchers found the deepest known undersea volcanic rift in the cayman trough – at a depth of more than 5,000 meters .
