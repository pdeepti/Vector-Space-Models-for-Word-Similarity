known as mac , the 39-year-old would be the country 's youngest ever state premier . with christian wulff , the premier of lower saxony , likely to become germany 's next president , the state is in need of a new leader .
it did n't take long for his replacement to step into the spotlight .
on friday , christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- officials said david mcallister , a conservative politician with scottish family roots , had been unanimously nominated to take wulff 's seat once the current premier makes the expected move to the presidential palace in berlin .
wulff was nominated by chancellor angela merkel as the government 's candidate for president on thursday .
" i have confidence in myself for the office of state premier , otherwise i would n't put myself forward for election , " mcallister said after the nomination .
he said he planned to build on wulff 's successful work in the state , adding that wulff 's election as president would be " the culmination of a great political career . "
mcallister has long been seen as a premier-in-waiting in lower saxony , one of germany 's most populous states .
the 39-year-old , who has a scottish father and a german mother , would be the country 's youngest ever state premier .

as an 11-year-old , mcallister moved with his family to bad bederkesa , a small town near cuxhaven in northern germany , a place he and his family consider their " heimat im herzen " - their true home .
it was here in lower saxony that he began his political career , first as district chairman of the cdu youth organization from 1991 to 1994 , and then as mayor of bad bederkesa from 2001 to 2002 .
the election for germany 's next president is due to take place on june 30 , in a special assembly made up of the german parliament and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states . as the ruling coalition 's official choice , wulff stands a good chance of becoming president . until then , the current state premier plans to continue his duties in the state capital of hanover .

known as mac , the 39-year-old would be the country 's youngest ever state premier . with christian wulff , the premier of lower saxony , likely to become germany 's next president , the state is in need of a new leader .
it did n't take long for his replacement to step into the spotlight .
on friday , christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- officials said david mcallister , a conservative politician with scottish family roots , had been unanimously nominated to take wulff 's seat once the current premier makes the expected move to the presidential palace in berlin .
wulff was nominated by chancellor angela merkel as the government 's candidate for president on thursday .
" i have confidence in myself for the office of state premier , otherwise i would n't put myself forward for election , " mcallister said after the nomination .
he said he planned to build on wulff 's successful work in the state , adding that wulff 's election as president would be " the culmination of a great political career . "
mcallister has long been seen as a premier-in-waiting in lower saxony , one of germany 's most populous states .
the 39-year-old , who has a scottish father and a german mother , would be the country 's youngest ever state premier .
known locally as mac , the politician is proud of his ancestry - he wore a kilt to his wedding .

being surrounded by communism , as mcallister writes on his website , left its mark : his personal motto is " future , not socialism . "
as an 11-year-old , mcallister moved with his family to bad bederkesa , a small town near cuxhaven in northern germany , a place he and his family consider their " heimat im herzen " - their true home .
it was here in lower saxony that he began his political career , first as district chairman of the cdu youth organization from 1991 to 1994 , and then as mayor of bad bederkesa from 2001 to 2002 .
the election for germany 's next president is due to take place on june 30 , in a special assembly made up of the german parliament and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states . as the ruling coalition 's official choice , wulff stands a good chance of becoming president . until then , the current state premier plans to continue his duties in the state capital of hanover .

the study says the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught . the willingness to commit violent crimes grows among young muslim immigrants in germany the more religious they become , according to a joint survey by the german interior ministry and the institute for criminology research of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- .
by comparison , the study found that just the opposite was true for christian immigrants .
the willingness to commit violent crimes , such as armed robbery or assault and battery , among young catholics and protestants decreases with religious fervor , the kfn study revealed .
the study said the reason for this difference had to do with the very different image of masculinity .
muslim devotion promotes the acceptance of macho behavior , said christian pfeiffer , the director of the lower saxony research institute and one of the authors of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim devotion breeds macho behavior , says pfeiffer pfeiffer said that in their religion , and in the family at home , young muslim immigrants are frequently exposed to a more conservative world view and lay claim to a variety of male privileges .
the problem with imams in an effort to explain their results , the study 's authors draw on the findings of rauf ceylan , a religious education expert and himself of turkish extraction , who points to the number of non-german imams , or muslim priests , preaching and teaching in germany .
ceylan maintains that these foreign imams are generally only in germany temporarily , speak no german and have little contact with german culture .
most of them , he says , call for a return to a more conservative islam and retreat into the practitioner 's original ethnic culture .
for them , male dominance is normal and their teachings demand the same from muslim youths , ceylan says .
christian pfeiffer , from the kfn , also points out that the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maiziere wants to discuss the study 's results with muslim groups german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for the study 's results to be put on the agenda of the next islam conference .
different levels of integration the kfn study interviewed a total of 45,000 14-16 year-olds in 61 cities across germany between 2007 and 2008 .
of these , 10,000 had an immigrant background .
it found that the best adjusted and most integrated immigrants came from non-religious families .
more than 41 percent of these were looking to get a high school diploma , nearly 63 percent had german friends and 66 percent viewed themselves as german .
the figures among young muslims were strikingly different : only 16 percent were pursuing a high school diploma , 28 percent had german friends and about 22 percent considered themselves german .

the study says the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught . the willingness to commit violent crimes grows among young muslim immigrants in germany the more religious they become , according to a joint survey by the german interior ministry and the institute for criminology research of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- .
by comparison , the study found that just the opposite was true for christian immigrants .
the willingness to commit violent crimes , such as armed robbery or assault and battery , among young catholics and protestants decreases with religious fervor , the kfn study revealed .
the study said the reason for this difference had to do with the very different image of masculinity .
muslim devotion promotes the acceptance of macho behavior , said christian pfeiffer , the director of the lower saxony research institute and one of the authors of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim devotion breeds macho behavior , says pfeiffer pfeiffer said that in their religion , and in the family at home , young muslim immigrants are frequently exposed to a more conservative world view and lay claim to a variety of male privileges .
the problem with imams in an effort to explain their results , the study 's authors draw on the findings of rauf ceylan , a religious education expert and himself of turkish extraction , who points to the number of non-german imams , or muslim priests , preaching and teaching in germany .
ceylan maintains that these foreign imams are generally only in germany temporarily , speak no german and have little contact with german culture .
most of them , he says , call for a return to a more conservative islam and retreat into the practitioner 's original ethnic culture .
for them , male dominance is normal and their teachings demand the same from muslim youths , ceylan says .
christian pfeiffer , from the kfn , also points out that the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maiziere wants to discuss the study 's results with muslim groups german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for the study 's results to be put on the agenda of the next islam conference .
different levels of integration the kfn study interviewed a total of 45,000 14-16 year-olds in 61 cities across germany between 2007 and 2008 .
of these , 10,000 had an immigrant background .
it found that the best adjusted and most integrated immigrants came from non-religious families .
more than 41 percent of these were looking to get a high school diploma , nearly 63 percent had german friends and 66 percent viewed themselves as german .
the figures among young muslims were strikingly different : only 16 percent were pursuing a high school diploma , 28 percent had german friends and about 22 percent considered themselves german .

it 's rekindled the debate over possible legalization . a group of 15 pupils - mostly girls - is gathered in a small room this morning in durban , south africa 's third-largest city .
while it is still early in the morning , it is already hot and muggy on the indian ocean .
the young people are here to talk about the event that millions around the world are looking forward to , but which could also be very dangerous for them - the world cup .
bongiwe mthethwa , director of an organization called concerned young people in south africa , has been campaigning all over the country with her colleagues to raise awareness about human trafficking and forced prostitution .
they have held more than 1,000 talks at schools and other institutions to help pupils protect themselves from falling into the hands of people traffickers and other predators .
" be careful when someone offers you a drink , it could contain drugs , " bongiwe said , speaking in zulu to be sure the young people understand her .
young and vulnerable some abductions of young people have already been reported , bongiwe said , and traffickers have been taking photos of young girls who they want to offer to visitors during the world cup as prostitutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandisa was forced into prostitution but was able to flee her captors girls are particularly vulnerable , because they will not be at school during the matches , but out in the streets , which makes them targets , " she said .
" it 's very , very high risk to have children in south africa during the world cup .
if we had a choice we would transfer them anywhere else but south africa . "
during these discussions about the potential dangers , 24-year-old mandisa is usually sitting in the first row .
she tells the horrific story of what happened to her in the hopes that others can avoid a similar fate .
she was abducted while walking in the street , confined in a house and forced into prostitution . " -lsb- my kidnapper -rsb- gave me drugs and i had no idea what was happening , " she says .
" he locked me up in a room , tied my arms and legs and raped me .
after that he called his clients and i became a sex slave for him . "
mandisa was lucky , she managed to escape .
but south african authorities fear that many more girls like mandisa could be abducted in the next few weeks .
the estimate that up to 40.000 prostitutes will be working during the world cup - many of them against their will . exaggerated fears but lobby groups for prostitutes , like an organization called sweat in cape town , think these estimates are exaggerated .
" there was this prediction that 40,000 women would be trafficked during the world cup in germany , " said vivienne lalu , director of sweat .
" but research found only a handful , less than five actual examples of trafficked women .
i suspect we 'll have similar outcomes in south africa . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of sweat are fighting to legalize prostitution prostitution is still prohibited in south africa , and sex workers can be fined as well as imprisoned .
sweat advocates legalizing the world 's oldest profession , arguing that in addition to deterring potential traffickers , bringing it out of the shadows would make it easier to monitor prostitutes ' health , including their hiv status .
that 's especially important in south africa , home to 20 percent of hiv infections worldwide .
like durban , cape town is a port city and a center of the south african sex industry .
there are an estimated 1,200 prostitutes in cape town , ray is one of them .
she says she is a sex worker by choice , but admits the work is dangerous .
she is looking forward to the world cup because of the influx of potential customers , but she does worry .
" i 'm scared of police harassment that 's going be stepped up , " she says .
" and i 'll be competing with foreign sex workers . "
legalization debate while sex and soccer will quite likely go hand-in-hand during the world cup , the issue of legalization is not at all settled .
the controversial subject has sparked heated debates throughout the country .
" i do n't think we should condone such things , " said one woman in durban .
" i do n't agree with it but if they feel they are doing what they have to do to earn a living , who are we to question that ? " said another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are thrilled with the world cup , but the event holds dangers for them as well legal or not , ray does n't plan on changing her job anytime soon .
in fact , she still hopes the world cup will be her big chance .
" i look forward to the world cup .
i want to make a friend and maybe i 'll go overseas and make even more money , " she said . despite their efforts , lobbyists from sweat fear they wo n't get much support from the government for their campaign to legalize prostitution to help prevent hiv infections .
many non-profit groups have complained that south africa should use this global even to step up its fight against hiv / aids .
but many say they are being blocked along the way .
this week , south african aids organizations accused football 's governing body fifa of blocking access to condoms and hiv education materials at world cup stadiums and fan parks .
" to date fifa has not permitted any civil society organization to distribute hiv or health-related information , " said the aids consortium , the southern african hiv clinicians society and several other organisations in a statement .
they are not encouraged by south african president jacob zuma , who was charged with rape in 2006 .
although he denied the charge , he did admit to having consensual sex with an hiv-positive woman .
then he declared in court that he had taken a shower to prevent hiv infection , angering many aids educators .

sweat advocates legalizing the world 's oldest profession , arguing that in addition to deterring potential traffickers , bringing it out of the shadows would make it easier to monitor prostitutes ' health , including their hiv status .
that 's especially important in south africa , home to 20 percent of hiv infections worldwide .
like durban , cape town is a port city and a center of the south african sex industry .
there are an estimated 1,200 prostitutes in cape town , ray is one of them .
she says she is a sex worker by choice , but admits the work is dangerous .
she is looking forward to the world cup because of the influx of potential customers , but she does worry .
" i 'm scared of police harassment that 's going be stepped up , " she says .
" and i 'll be competing with foreign sex workers . "
legalization debate while sex and soccer will quite likely go hand-in-hand during the world cup , the issue of legalization is not at all settled .
the controversial subject has sparked heated debates throughout the country .
" i do n't think we should condone such things , " said one woman in durban .

many non-profit groups have complained that south africa should use this global even to step up its fight against hiv / aids .
but many say they are being blocked along the way .
this week , south african aids organizations accused football 's governing body fifa of blocking access to condoms and hiv education materials at world cup stadiums and fan parks .
" to date fifa has not permitted any civil society organization to distribute hiv or health-related information , " said the aids consortium , the southern african hiv clinicians society and several other organisations in a statement .
they are not encouraged by south african president jacob zuma , who was charged with rape in 2006 .
although he denied the charge , he did admit to having consensual sex with an hiv-positive woman .
then he declared in court that he had taken a shower to prevent hiv infection , angering many aids educators .

it 's rekindled the debate over possible legalization . a group of 15 pupils - mostly girls - is gathered in a small room this morning in durban , south africa 's third-largest city .
while it is still early in the morning , it is already hot and muggy on the indian ocean .
the young people are here to talk about the event that millions around the world are looking forward to , but which could also be very dangerous for them - the world cup .
bongiwe mthethwa , director of an organization called concerned young people in south africa , has been campaigning all over the country with her colleagues to raise awareness about human trafficking and forced prostitution .
they have held more than 1,000 talks at schools and other institutions to help pupils protect themselves from falling into the hands of people traffickers and other predators .
" be careful when someone offers you a drink , it could contain drugs , " bongiwe said , speaking in zulu to be sure the young people understand her .
young and vulnerable some abductions of young people have already been reported , bongiwe said , and traffickers have been taking photos of young girls who they want to offer to visitors during the world cup as prostitutes .

" it 's very , very high risk to have children in south africa during the world cup .
if we had a choice we would transfer them anywhere else but south africa . "
during these discussions about the potential dangers , 24-year-old mandisa is usually sitting in the first row .
she tells the horrific story of what happened to her in the hopes that others can avoid a similar fate .
she was abducted while walking in the street , confined in a house and forced into prostitution . " -lsb- my kidnapper -rsb- gave me drugs and i had no idea what was happening , " she says .
" he locked me up in a room , tied my arms and legs and raped me .
after that he called his clients and i became a sex slave for him . "
mandisa was lucky , she managed to escape .
but south african authorities fear that many more girls like mandisa could be abducted in the next few weeks .
the estimate that up to 40.000 prostitutes will be working during the world cup - many of them against their will . exaggerated fears but lobby groups for prostitutes , like an organization called sweat in cape town , think these estimates are exaggerated .
" there was this prediction that 40,000 women would be trafficked during the world cup in germany , " said vivienne lalu , director of sweat .

it 's rekindled the debate over possible legalization . a group of 15 pupils - mostly girls - is gathered in a small room this morning in durban , south africa 's third-largest city .
while it is still early in the morning , it is already hot and muggy on the indian ocean .
the young people are here to talk about the event that millions around the world are looking forward to , but which could also be very dangerous for them - the world cup .
bongiwe mthethwa , director of an organization called concerned young people in south africa , has been campaigning all over the country with her colleagues to raise awareness about human trafficking and forced prostitution .
they have held more than 1,000 talks at schools and other institutions to help pupils protect themselves from falling into the hands of people traffickers and other predators .
" be careful when someone offers you a drink , it could contain drugs , " bongiwe said , speaking in zulu to be sure the young people understand her .
young and vulnerable some abductions of young people have already been reported , bongiwe said , and traffickers have been taking photos of young girls who they want to offer to visitors during the world cup as prostitutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandisa was forced into prostitution but was able to flee her captors girls are particularly vulnerable , because they will not be at school during the matches , but out in the streets , which makes them targets , " she said .
" it 's very , very high risk to have children in south africa during the world cup .
if we had a choice we would transfer them anywhere else but south africa . "
during these discussions about the potential dangers , 24-year-old mandisa is usually sitting in the first row .
she tells the horrific story of what happened to her in the hopes that others can avoid a similar fate .
she was abducted while walking in the street , confined in a house and forced into prostitution . " -lsb- my kidnapper -rsb- gave me drugs and i had no idea what was happening , " she says .
" he locked me up in a room , tied my arms and legs and raped me .
after that he called his clients and i became a sex slave for him . "
mandisa was lucky , she managed to escape .
but south african authorities fear that many more girls like mandisa could be abducted in the next few weeks .
the estimate that up to 40.000 prostitutes will be working during the world cup - many of them against their will . exaggerated fears but lobby groups for prostitutes , like an organization called sweat in cape town , think these estimates are exaggerated .
" there was this prediction that 40,000 women would be trafficked during the world cup in germany , " said vivienne lalu , director of sweat .
" but research found only a handful , less than five actual examples of trafficked women .
i suspect we 'll have similar outcomes in south africa . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of sweat are fighting to legalize prostitution prostitution is still prohibited in south africa , and sex workers can be fined as well as imprisoned .
sweat advocates legalizing the world 's oldest profession , arguing that in addition to deterring potential traffickers , bringing it out of the shadows would make it easier to monitor prostitutes ' health , including their hiv status .
that 's especially important in south africa , home to 20 percent of hiv infections worldwide .
like durban , cape town is a port city and a center of the south african sex industry .
there are an estimated 1,200 prostitutes in cape town , ray is one of them .
she says she is a sex worker by choice , but admits the work is dangerous .
she is looking forward to the world cup because of the influx of potential customers , but she does worry .
" i 'm scared of police harassment that 's going be stepped up , " she says .
" and i 'll be competing with foreign sex workers . "
legalization debate while sex and soccer will quite likely go hand-in-hand during the world cup , the issue of legalization is not at all settled .
the controversial subject has sparked heated debates throughout the country .
" i do n't think we should condone such things , " said one woman in durban .
" i do n't agree with it but if they feel they are doing what they have to do to earn a living , who are we to question that ? " said another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are thrilled with the world cup , but the event holds dangers for them as well legal or not , ray does n't plan on changing her job anytime soon .
in fact , she still hopes the world cup will be her big chance .
" i look forward to the world cup .
i want to make a friend and maybe i 'll go overseas and make even more money , " she said . despite their efforts , lobbyists from sweat fear they wo n't get much support from the government for their campaign to legalize prostitution to help prevent hiv infections .
many non-profit groups have complained that south africa should use this global even to step up its fight against hiv / aids .
but many say they are being blocked along the way .
this week , south african aids organizations accused football 's governing body fifa of blocking access to condoms and hiv education materials at world cup stadiums and fan parks .
" to date fifa has not permitted any civil society organization to distribute hiv or health-related information , " said the aids consortium , the southern african hiv clinicians society and several other organisations in a statement .
they are not encouraged by south african president jacob zuma , who was charged with rape in 2006 .
although he denied the charge , he did admit to having consensual sex with an hiv-positive woman .
then he declared in court that he had taken a shower to prevent hiv infection , angering many aids educators .

the pontiff prayed for the success of a synod of middle eastern bishops in rome in october , which is set to grapple with the problems of the region .
calling the latest tensions between israel and palestinians " a grave matter , " benedict said he hoped the meeting would " help focus the attention of the international community " on the conflict in the region and the " plight of christians in the middle east who suffer for their beliefs . "
vatican paper focuses on mideast following the outdoor service , the pope unveiled a working paper for the synod .
called " instrumentum laboris , " it expresses concern about radical islam .
" these extremist currents , clearly a threat to everyone - christians , jews and muslims - require joint action , " the document states .
the working paper laments the dwindling numbers of already minority christians in the middle east .
" their disappearance would impoverish the pluralism which has always characterized the countries of the middle east and those countries would be at a disadvantage without the christian voice , " it said .
the 40-page paper also says that the unresolved israeli-palestinian conflict contributed to the political , economic and religious tensions in the region .
the vatican backs a palestinian homeland alongside israel 's right to exist within internationally recognized borders .

the pontiff prayed for the success of a synod of middle eastern bishops in rome in october , which is set to grapple with the problems of the region .
calling the latest tensions between israel and palestinians " a grave matter , " benedict said he hoped the meeting would " help focus the attention of the international community " on the conflict in the region and the " plight of christians in the middle east who suffer for their beliefs . "
vatican paper focuses on mideast following the outdoor service , the pope unveiled a working paper for the synod .
called " instrumentum laboris , " it expresses concern about radical islam .
" these extremist currents , clearly a threat to everyone - christians , jews and muslims - require joint action , " the document states .
the working paper laments the dwindling numbers of already minority christians in the middle east .
" their disappearance would impoverish the pluralism which has always characterized the countries of the middle east and those countries would be at a disadvantage without the christian voice , " it said .
the 40-page paper also says that the unresolved israeli-palestinian conflict contributed to the political , economic and religious tensions in the region .
the vatican backs a palestinian homeland alongside israel 's right to exist within internationally recognized borders .

it 's rekindled the debate over possible legalization . a group of 15 pupils - mostly girls - is gathered in a small room this morning in durban , south africa 's third-largest city .
while it is still early in the morning , it is already hot and muggy on the indian ocean .
the young people are here to talk about the event that millions around the world are looking forward to , but which could also be very dangerous for them - the world cup .
bongiwe mthethwa , director of an organization called concerned young people in south africa , has been campaigning all over the country with her colleagues to raise awareness about human trafficking and forced prostitution .
they have held more than 1,000 talks at schools and other institutions to help pupils protect themselves from falling into the hands of people traffickers and other predators .
" be careful when someone offers you a drink , it could contain drugs , " bongiwe said , speaking in zulu to be sure the young people understand her .
young and vulnerable some abductions of young people have already been reported , bongiwe said , and traffickers have been taking photos of young girls who they want to offer to visitors during the world cup as prostitutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandisa was forced into prostitution but was able to flee her captors girls are particularly vulnerable , because they will not be at school during the matches , but out in the streets , which makes them targets , " she said .
" it 's very , very high risk to have children in south africa during the world cup .
if we had a choice we would transfer them anywhere else but south africa . "
during these discussions about the potential dangers , 24-year-old mandisa is usually sitting in the first row .
she tells the horrific story of what happened to her in the hopes that others can avoid a similar fate .
she was abducted while walking in the street , confined in a house and forced into prostitution . " -lsb- my kidnapper -rsb- gave me drugs and i had no idea what was happening , " she says .
" he locked me up in a room , tied my arms and legs and raped me .
after that he called his clients and i became a sex slave for him . "
mandisa was lucky , she managed to escape .
but south african authorities fear that many more girls like mandisa could be abducted in the next few weeks .
the estimate that up to 40.000 prostitutes will be working during the world cup - many of them against their will . exaggerated fears but lobby groups for prostitutes , like an organization called sweat in cape town , think these estimates are exaggerated .
" there was this prediction that 40,000 women would be trafficked during the world cup in germany , " said vivienne lalu , director of sweat .
" but research found only a handful , less than five actual examples of trafficked women .
i suspect we 'll have similar outcomes in south africa . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of sweat are fighting to legalize prostitution prostitution is still prohibited in south africa , and sex workers can be fined as well as imprisoned .
sweat advocates legalizing the world 's oldest profession , arguing that in addition to deterring potential traffickers , bringing it out of the shadows would make it easier to monitor prostitutes ' health , including their hiv status .
that 's especially important in south africa , home to 20 percent of hiv infections worldwide .
like durban , cape town is a port city and a center of the south african sex industry .
there are an estimated 1,200 prostitutes in cape town , ray is one of them .
she says she is a sex worker by choice , but admits the work is dangerous .
she is looking forward to the world cup because of the influx of potential customers , but she does worry .
" i 'm scared of police harassment that 's going be stepped up , " she says .
" and i 'll be competing with foreign sex workers . "
legalization debate while sex and soccer will quite likely go hand-in-hand during the world cup , the issue of legalization is not at all settled .
the controversial subject has sparked heated debates throughout the country .
" i do n't think we should condone such things , " said one woman in durban .
" i do n't agree with it but if they feel they are doing what they have to do to earn a living , who are we to question that ? " said another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are thrilled with the world cup , but the event holds dangers for them as well legal or not , ray does n't plan on changing her job anytime soon .
in fact , she still hopes the world cup will be her big chance .
" i look forward to the world cup .
i want to make a friend and maybe i 'll go overseas and make even more money , " she said . despite their efforts , lobbyists from sweat fear they wo n't get much support from the government for their campaign to legalize prostitution to help prevent hiv infections .
many non-profit groups have complained that south africa should use this global even to step up its fight against hiv / aids .
but many say they are being blocked along the way .
this week , south african aids organizations accused football 's governing body fifa of blocking access to condoms and hiv education materials at world cup stadiums and fan parks .
" to date fifa has not permitted any civil society organization to distribute hiv or health-related information , " said the aids consortium , the southern african hiv clinicians society and several other organisations in a statement .
they are not encouraged by south african president jacob zuma , who was charged with rape in 2006 .
although he denied the charge , he did admit to having consensual sex with an hiv-positive woman .
then he declared in court that he had taken a shower to prevent hiv infection , angering many aids educators .

it 's rekindled the debate over possible legalization . a group of 15 pupils - mostly girls - is gathered in a small room this morning in durban , south africa 's third-largest city .
while it is still early in the morning , it is already hot and muggy on the indian ocean .
the young people are here to talk about the event that millions around the world are looking forward to , but which could also be very dangerous for them - the world cup .
bongiwe mthethwa , director of an organization called concerned young people in south africa , has been campaigning all over the country with her colleagues to raise awareness about human trafficking and forced prostitution .
they have held more than 1,000 talks at schools and other institutions to help pupils protect themselves from falling into the hands of people traffickers and other predators .
" be careful when someone offers you a drink , it could contain drugs , " bongiwe said , speaking in zulu to be sure the young people understand her .
young and vulnerable some abductions of young people have already been reported , bongiwe said , and traffickers have been taking photos of young girls who they want to offer to visitors during the world cup as prostitutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandisa was forced into prostitution but was able to flee her captors girls are particularly vulnerable , because they will not be at school during the matches , but out in the streets , which makes them targets , " she said .
" it 's very , very high risk to have children in south africa during the world cup .
if we had a choice we would transfer them anywhere else but south africa . "
during these discussions about the potential dangers , 24-year-old mandisa is usually sitting in the first row .
she tells the horrific story of what happened to her in the hopes that others can avoid a similar fate .
she was abducted while walking in the street , confined in a house and forced into prostitution . " -lsb- my kidnapper -rsb- gave me drugs and i had no idea what was happening , " she says .
" he locked me up in a room , tied my arms and legs and raped me .
after that he called his clients and i became a sex slave for him . "
mandisa was lucky , she managed to escape .
but south african authorities fear that many more girls like mandisa could be abducted in the next few weeks .
the estimate that up to 40.000 prostitutes will be working during the world cup - many of them against their will . exaggerated fears but lobby groups for prostitutes , like an organization called sweat in cape town , think these estimates are exaggerated .
" there was this prediction that 40,000 women would be trafficked during the world cup in germany , " said vivienne lalu , director of sweat .
" but research found only a handful , less than five actual examples of trafficked women .
i suspect we 'll have similar outcomes in south africa . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of sweat are fighting to legalize prostitution prostitution is still prohibited in south africa , and sex workers can be fined as well as imprisoned .
sweat advocates legalizing the world 's oldest profession , arguing that in addition to deterring potential traffickers , bringing it out of the shadows would make it easier to monitor prostitutes ' health , including their hiv status .
that 's especially important in south africa , home to 20 percent of hiv infections worldwide .
like durban , cape town is a port city and a center of the south african sex industry .
there are an estimated 1,200 prostitutes in cape town , ray is one of them .
she says she is a sex worker by choice , but admits the work is dangerous .
she is looking forward to the world cup because of the influx of potential customers , but she does worry .
" i 'm scared of police harassment that 's going be stepped up , " she says .
" and i 'll be competing with foreign sex workers . "
legalization debate while sex and soccer will quite likely go hand-in-hand during the world cup , the issue of legalization is not at all settled .
the controversial subject has sparked heated debates throughout the country .
" i do n't think we should condone such things , " said one woman in durban .
" i do n't agree with it but if they feel they are doing what they have to do to earn a living , who are we to question that ? " said another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are thrilled with the world cup , but the event holds dangers for them as well legal or not , ray does n't plan on changing her job anytime soon .
in fact , she still hopes the world cup will be her big chance .
" i look forward to the world cup .
i want to make a friend and maybe i 'll go overseas and make even more money , " she said . despite their efforts , lobbyists from sweat fear they wo n't get much support from the government for their campaign to legalize prostitution to help prevent hiv infections .
many non-profit groups have complained that south africa should use this global even to step up its fight against hiv / aids .
but many say they are being blocked along the way .
this week , south african aids organizations accused football 's governing body fifa of blocking access to condoms and hiv education materials at world cup stadiums and fan parks .
" to date fifa has not permitted any civil society organization to distribute hiv or health-related information , " said the aids consortium , the southern african hiv clinicians society and several other organisations in a statement .
they are not encouraged by south african president jacob zuma , who was charged with rape in 2006 .
although he denied the charge , he did admit to having consensual sex with an hiv-positive woman .
then he declared in court that he had taken a shower to prevent hiv infection , angering many aids educators .

" it 's very , very high risk to have children in south africa during the world cup .
if we had a choice we would transfer them anywhere else but south africa . "
during these discussions about the potential dangers , 24-year-old mandisa is usually sitting in the first row .
she tells the horrific story of what happened to her in the hopes that others can avoid a similar fate .
she was abducted while walking in the street , confined in a house and forced into prostitution . " -lsb- my kidnapper -rsb- gave me drugs and i had no idea what was happening , " she says .
" he locked me up in a room , tied my arms and legs and raped me .
after that he called his clients and i became a sex slave for him . "
mandisa was lucky , she managed to escape .
but south african authorities fear that many more girls like mandisa could be abducted in the next few weeks .
the estimate that up to 40.000 prostitutes will be working during the world cup - many of them against their will . exaggerated fears but lobby groups for prostitutes , like an organization called sweat in cape town , think these estimates are exaggerated .
" there was this prediction that 40,000 women would be trafficked during the world cup in germany , " said vivienne lalu , director of sweat .
" but research found only a handful , less than five actual examples of trafficked women .
i suspect we 'll have similar outcomes in south africa . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of sweat are fighting to legalize prostitution prostitution is still prohibited in south africa , and sex workers can be fined as well as imprisoned .
sweat advocates legalizing the world 's oldest profession , arguing that in addition to deterring potential traffickers , bringing it out of the shadows would make it easier to monitor prostitutes ' health , including their hiv status .
that 's especially important in south africa , home to 20 percent of hiv infections worldwide .
like durban , cape town is a port city and a center of the south african sex industry .
there are an estimated 1,200 prostitutes in cape town , ray is one of them .
she says she is a sex worker by choice , but admits the work is dangerous .
she is looking forward to the world cup because of the influx of potential customers , but she does worry .
" i 'm scared of police harassment that 's going be stepped up , " she says .
" and i 'll be competing with foreign sex workers . "
legalization debate while sex and soccer will quite likely go hand-in-hand during the world cup , the issue of legalization is not at all settled .
the controversial subject has sparked heated debates throughout the country .
" i do n't think we should condone such things , " said one woman in durban .
" i do n't agree with it but if they feel they are doing what they have to do to earn a living , who are we to question that ? " said another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are thrilled with the world cup , but the event holds dangers for them as well legal or not , ray does n't plan on changing her job anytime soon .
in fact , she still hopes the world cup will be her big chance .
" i look forward to the world cup .
i want to make a friend and maybe i 'll go overseas and make even more money , " she said . despite their efforts , lobbyists from sweat fear they wo n't get much support from the government for their campaign to legalize prostitution to help prevent hiv infections .
many non-profit groups have complained that south africa should use this global even to step up its fight against hiv / aids .
but many say they are being blocked along the way .
this week , south african aids organizations accused football 's governing body fifa of blocking access to condoms and hiv education materials at world cup stadiums and fan parks .
" to date fifa has not permitted any civil society organization to distribute hiv or health-related information , " said the aids consortium , the southern african hiv clinicians society and several other organisations in a statement .
they are not encouraged by south african president jacob zuma , who was charged with rape in 2006 .
although he denied the charge , he did admit to having consensual sex with an hiv-positive woman .
then he declared in court that he had taken a shower to prevent hiv infection , angering many aids educators .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 06.06.2010 study finds young , devout muslims in germany more prone to violence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence is a growing problem among young devout muslims a study conducted by the german authorities has found that the more devout young muslims become , the more prone to violence they get .
the study says the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught . the willingness to commit violent crimes grows among young muslim immigrants in germany the more religious they become , according to a joint survey by the german interior ministry and the institute for criminology research of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- .
by comparison , the study found that just the opposite was true for christian immigrants .
the willingness to commit violent crimes , such as armed robbery or assault and battery , among young catholics and protestants decreases with religious fervor , the kfn study revealed .
the study said the reason for this difference had to do with the very different image of masculinity .
muslim devotion promotes the acceptance of macho behavior , said christian pfeiffer , the director of the lower saxony research institute and one of the authors of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim devotion breeds macho behavior , says pfeiffer pfeiffer said that in their religion , and in the family at home , young muslim immigrants are frequently exposed to a more conservative world view and lay claim to a variety of male privileges .
the problem with imams in an effort to explain their results , the study 's authors draw on the findings of rauf ceylan , a religious education expert and himself of turkish extraction , who points to the number of non-german imams , or muslim priests , preaching and teaching in germany .
ceylan maintains that these foreign imams are generally only in germany temporarily , speak no german and have little contact with german culture .
most of them , he says , call for a return to a more conservative islam and retreat into the practitioner 's original ethnic culture .
for them , male dominance is normal and their teachings demand the same from muslim youths , ceylan says .
christian pfeiffer , from the kfn , also points out that the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maiziere wants to discuss the study 's results with muslim groups german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for the study 's results to be put on the agenda of the next islam conference .
different levels of integration the kfn study interviewed a total of 45,000 14-16 year-olds in 61 cities across germany between 2007 and 2008 .
of these , 10,000 had an immigrant background .
it found that the best adjusted and most integrated immigrants came from non-religious families .

the study says the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught . the willingness to commit violent crimes grows among young muslim immigrants in germany the more religious they become , according to a joint survey by the german interior ministry and the institute for criminology research of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- .
by comparison , the study found that just the opposite was true for christian immigrants .
the willingness to commit violent crimes , such as armed robbery or assault and battery , among young catholics and protestants decreases with religious fervor , the kfn study revealed .
the study said the reason for this difference had to do with the very different image of masculinity .
muslim devotion promotes the acceptance of macho behavior , said christian pfeiffer , the director of the lower saxony research institute and one of the authors of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim devotion breeds macho behavior , says pfeiffer pfeiffer said that in their religion , and in the family at home , young muslim immigrants are frequently exposed to a more conservative world view and lay claim to a variety of male privileges .
the problem with imams in an effort to explain their results , the study 's authors draw on the findings of rauf ceylan , a religious education expert and himself of turkish extraction , who points to the number of non-german imams , or muslim priests , preaching and teaching in germany .
ceylan maintains that these foreign imams are generally only in germany temporarily , speak no german and have little contact with german culture .
most of them , he says , call for a return to a more conservative islam and retreat into the practitioner 's original ethnic culture .
for them , male dominance is normal and their teachings demand the same from muslim youths , ceylan says .
christian pfeiffer , from the kfn , also points out that the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maiziere wants to discuss the study 's results with muslim groups german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for the study 's results to be put on the agenda of the next islam conference .

of these , 10,000 had an immigrant background .
it found that the best adjusted and most integrated immigrants came from non-religious families .

known as mac , the 39-year-old would be the country 's youngest ever state premier . with christian wulff , the premier of lower saxony , likely to become germany 's next president , the state is in need of a new leader .
it did n't take long for his replacement to step into the spotlight .
on friday , christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- officials said david mcallister , a conservative politician with scottish family roots , had been unanimously nominated to take wulff 's seat once the current premier makes the expected move to the presidential palace in berlin .
wulff was nominated by chancellor angela merkel as the government 's candidate for president on thursday .
" i have confidence in myself for the office of state premier , otherwise i would n't put myself forward for election , " mcallister said after the nomination .
he said he planned to build on wulff 's successful work in the state , adding that wulff 's election as president would be " the culmination of a great political career . "
mcallister has long been seen as a premier-in-waiting in lower saxony , one of germany 's most populous states .
the 39-year-old , who has a scottish father and a german mother , would be the country 's youngest ever state premier .
known locally as mac , the politician is proud of his ancestry - he wore a kilt to his wedding .
he 's married with two daughters , jamie and mia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff -lrb- left -rrb- is merkel 's , and the government 's , nominee for the office of president ' future , not socialism ' mcallister and his two sisters spent their early years growing up in west berlin , where his father was stationed with the british army .
being surrounded by communism , as mcallister writes on his website , left its mark : his personal motto is " future , not socialism . "
as an 11-year-old , mcallister moved with his family to bad bederkesa , a small town near cuxhaven in northern germany , a place he and his family consider their " heimat im herzen " - their true home .
it was here in lower saxony that he began his political career , first as district chairman of the cdu youth organization from 1991 to 1994 , and then as mayor of bad bederkesa from 2001 to 2002 .
the election for germany 's next president is due to take place on june 30 , in a special assembly made up of the german parliament and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states . as the ruling coalition 's official choice , wulff stands a good chance of becoming president . until then , the current state premier plans to continue his duties in the state capital of hanover .

known as mac , the 39-year-old would be the country 's youngest ever state premier . with christian wulff , the premier of lower saxony , likely to become germany 's next president , the state is in need of a new leader .
it did n't take long for his replacement to step into the spotlight .
on friday , christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- officials said david mcallister , a conservative politician with scottish family roots , had been unanimously nominated to take wulff 's seat once the current premier makes the expected move to the presidential palace in berlin .
wulff was nominated by chancellor angela merkel as the government 's candidate for president on thursday .
" i have confidence in myself for the office of state premier , otherwise i would n't put myself forward for election , " mcallister said after the nomination .
he said he planned to build on wulff 's successful work in the state , adding that wulff 's election as president would be " the culmination of a great political career . "
mcallister has long been seen as a premier-in-waiting in lower saxony , one of germany 's most populous states .
the 39-year-old , who has a scottish father and a german mother , would be the country 's youngest ever state premier .
known locally as mac , the politician is proud of his ancestry - he wore a kilt to his wedding .

it was here in lower saxony that he began his political career , first as district chairman of the cdu youth organization from 1991 to 1994 , and then as mayor of bad bederkesa from 2001 to 2002 .
the election for germany 's next president is due to take place on june 30 , in a special assembly made up of the german parliament and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states . as the ruling coalition 's official choice , wulff stands a good chance of becoming president . until then , the current state premier plans to continue his duties in the state capital of hanover .

the pontiff prayed for the success of a synod of middle eastern bishops in rome in october , which is set to grapple with the problems of the region .
calling the latest tensions between israel and palestinians " a grave matter , " benedict said he hoped the meeting would " help focus the attention of the international community " on the conflict in the region and the " plight of christians in the middle east who suffer for their beliefs . "
vatican paper focuses on mideast following the outdoor service , the pope unveiled a working paper for the synod .
called " instrumentum laboris , " it expresses concern about radical islam .
" these extremist currents , clearly a threat to everyone - christians , jews and muslims - require joint action , " the document states .
the working paper laments the dwindling numbers of already minority christians in the middle east .
" their disappearance would impoverish the pluralism which has always characterized the countries of the middle east and those countries would be at a disadvantage without the christian voice , " it said .
the 40-page paper also says that the unresolved israeli-palestinian conflict contributed to the political , economic and religious tensions in the region .
the vatican backs a palestinian homeland alongside israel 's right to exist within internationally recognized borders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 06.06.2010 scottish-german politician set to head lower saxony großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david mcallister is lower saxony 's ' premier-in-waiting ' david mcallister , a german with scottish roots , has been nominated to take over as state premier of lower saxony .
known as mac , the 39-year-old would be the country 's youngest ever state premier . with christian wulff , the premier of lower saxony , likely to become germany 's next president , the state is in need of a new leader .
it did n't take long for his replacement to step into the spotlight .
on friday , christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- officials said david mcallister , a conservative politician with scottish family roots , had been unanimously nominated to take wulff 's seat once the current premier makes the expected move to the presidential palace in berlin .
wulff was nominated by chancellor angela merkel as the government 's candidate for president on thursday .
" i have confidence in myself for the office of state premier , otherwise i would n't put myself forward for election , " mcallister said after the nomination .
he said he planned to build on wulff 's successful work in the state , adding that wulff 's election as president would be " the culmination of a great political career . "
mcallister has long been seen as a premier-in-waiting in lower saxony , one of germany 's most populous states .
the 39-year-old , who has a scottish father and a german mother , would be the country 's youngest ever state premier .
known locally as mac , the politician is proud of his ancestry - he wore a kilt to his wedding .
he 's married with two daughters , jamie and mia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff -lrb- left -rrb- is merkel 's , and the government 's , nominee for the office of president ' future , not socialism ' mcallister and his two sisters spent their early years growing up in west berlin , where his father was stationed with the british army .
being surrounded by communism , as mcallister writes on his website , left its mark : his personal motto is " future , not socialism . "
as an 11-year-old , mcallister moved with his family to bad bederkesa , a small town near cuxhaven in northern germany , a place he and his family consider their " heimat im herzen " - their true home .
it was here in lower saxony that he began his political career , first as district chairman of the cdu youth organization from 1991 to 1994 , and then as mayor of bad bederkesa from 2001 to 2002 .
the election for germany 's next president is due to take place on june 30 , in a special assembly made up of the german parliament and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states . as the ruling coalition 's official choice , wulff stands a good chance of becoming president . until then , the current state premier plans to continue his duties in the state capital of hanover .

"
sarkozy also said france was willing to participate in the inquiry . israeli officials said un secretary-general ban ki-moon also spoke with netanyahu to propose setting up a multinational commission to investigate what went wrong . following talks in paris , the foreign ministers of france and britain said an international inquiry was necessary to resolve the dispute .

known as mac , the 39-year-old would be the country 's youngest ever state premier . with christian wulff , the premier of lower saxony , likely to become germany 's next president , the state is in need of a new leader .
it did n't take long for his replacement to step into the spotlight .
on friday , christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- officials said david mcallister , a conservative politician with scottish family roots , had been unanimously nominated to take wulff 's seat once the current premier makes the expected move to the presidential palace in berlin .
wulff was nominated by chancellor angela merkel as the government 's candidate for president on thursday .
" i have confidence in myself for the office of state premier , otherwise i would n't put myself forward for election , " mcallister said after the nomination .
he said he planned to build on wulff 's successful work in the state , adding that wulff 's election as president would be " the culmination of a great political career . "
mcallister has long been seen as a premier-in-waiting in lower saxony , one of germany 's most populous states .
the 39-year-old , who has a scottish father and a german mother , would be the country 's youngest ever state premier .

as an 11-year-old , mcallister moved with his family to bad bederkesa , a small town near cuxhaven in northern germany , a place he and his family consider their " heimat im herzen " - their true home .
it was here in lower saxony that he began his political career , first as district chairman of the cdu youth organization from 1991 to 1994 , and then as mayor of bad bederkesa from 2001 to 2002 .
the election for germany 's next president is due to take place on june 30 , in a special assembly made up of the german parliament and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states . as the ruling coalition 's official choice , wulff stands a good chance of becoming president . until then , the current state premier plans to continue his duties in the state capital of hanover .

the pontiff prayed for the success of a synod of middle eastern bishops in rome in october , which is set to grapple with the problems of the region .

called " instrumentum laboris , " it expresses concern about radical islam .
" these extremist currents , clearly a threat to everyone - christians , jews and muslims - require joint action , " the document states .
the working paper laments the dwindling numbers of already minority christians in the middle east .
" their disappearance would impoverish the pluralism which has always characterized the countries of the middle east and those countries would be at a disadvantage without the christian voice , " it said .
the 40-page paper also says that the unresolved israeli-palestinian conflict contributed to the political , economic and religious tensions in the region .
the vatican backs a palestinian homeland alongside israel 's right to exist within internationally recognized borders .

the study says the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught . the willingness to commit violent crimes grows among young muslim immigrants in germany the more religious they become , according to a joint survey by the german interior ministry and the institute for criminology research of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- .
by comparison , the study found that just the opposite was true for christian immigrants .
the willingness to commit violent crimes , such as armed robbery or assault and battery , among young catholics and protestants decreases with religious fervor , the kfn study revealed .
the study said the reason for this difference had to do with the very different image of masculinity .
muslim devotion promotes the acceptance of macho behavior , said christian pfeiffer , the director of the lower saxony research institute and one of the authors of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim devotion breeds macho behavior , says pfeiffer pfeiffer said that in their religion , and in the family at home , young muslim immigrants are frequently exposed to a more conservative world view and lay claim to a variety of male privileges .
the problem with imams in an effort to explain their results , the study 's authors draw on the findings of rauf ceylan , a religious education expert and himself of turkish extraction , who points to the number of non-german imams , or muslim priests , preaching and teaching in germany .
ceylan maintains that these foreign imams are generally only in germany temporarily , speak no german and have little contact with german culture .
most of them , he says , call for a return to a more conservative islam and retreat into the practitioner 's original ethnic culture .
for them , male dominance is normal and their teachings demand the same from muslim youths , ceylan says .
christian pfeiffer , from the kfn , also points out that the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maiziere wants to discuss the study 's results with muslim groups german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for the study 's results to be put on the agenda of the next islam conference .
different levels of integration the kfn study interviewed a total of 45,000 14-16 year-olds in 61 cities across germany between 2007 and 2008 .
of these , 10,000 had an immigrant background .
it found that the best adjusted and most integrated immigrants came from non-religious families .
more than 41 percent of these were looking to get a high school diploma , nearly 63 percent had german friends and 66 percent viewed themselves as german .
the figures among young muslims were strikingly different : only 16 percent were pursuing a high school diploma , 28 percent had german friends and about 22 percent considered themselves german .

the study says the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught . the willingness to commit violent crimes grows among young muslim immigrants in germany the more religious they become , according to a joint survey by the german interior ministry and the institute for criminology research of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- .
by comparison , the study found that just the opposite was true for christian immigrants .
the willingness to commit violent crimes , such as armed robbery or assault and battery , among young catholics and protestants decreases with religious fervor , the kfn study revealed .
the study said the reason for this difference had to do with the very different image of masculinity .
muslim devotion promotes the acceptance of macho behavior , said christian pfeiffer , the director of the lower saxony research institute and one of the authors of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim devotion breeds macho behavior , says pfeiffer pfeiffer said that in their religion , and in the family at home , young muslim immigrants are frequently exposed to a more conservative world view and lay claim to a variety of male privileges .
the problem with imams in an effort to explain their results , the study 's authors draw on the findings of rauf ceylan , a religious education expert and himself of turkish extraction , who points to the number of non-german imams , or muslim priests , preaching and teaching in germany .
ceylan maintains that these foreign imams are generally only in germany temporarily , speak no german and have little contact with german culture .
most of them , he says , call for a return to a more conservative islam and retreat into the practitioner 's original ethnic culture .
for them , male dominance is normal and their teachings demand the same from muslim youths , ceylan says .
christian pfeiffer , from the kfn , also points out that the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maiziere wants to discuss the study 's results with muslim groups german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for the study 's results to be put on the agenda of the next islam conference .
different levels of integration the kfn study interviewed a total of 45,000 14-16 year-olds in 61 cities across germany between 2007 and 2008 .
of these , 10,000 had an immigrant background .
it found that the best adjusted and most integrated immigrants came from non-religious families .
more than 41 percent of these were looking to get a high school diploma , nearly 63 percent had german friends and 66 percent viewed themselves as german .
the figures among young muslims were strikingly different : only 16 percent were pursuing a high school diploma , 28 percent had german friends and about 22 percent considered themselves german .

known as mac , the 39-year-old would be the country 's youngest ever state premier . with christian wulff , the premier of lower saxony , likely to become germany 's next president , the state is in need of a new leader .
it did n't take long for his replacement to step into the spotlight .
on friday , christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- officials said david mcallister , a conservative politician with scottish family roots , had been unanimously nominated to take wulff 's seat once the current premier makes the expected move to the presidential palace in berlin .
wulff was nominated by chancellor angela merkel as the government 's candidate for president on thursday .
" i have confidence in myself for the office of state premier , otherwise i would n't put myself forward for election , " mcallister said after the nomination .
he said he planned to build on wulff 's successful work in the state , adding that wulff 's election as president would be " the culmination of a great political career . "
mcallister has long been seen as a premier-in-waiting in lower saxony , one of germany 's most populous states .
the 39-year-old , who has a scottish father and a german mother , would be the country 's youngest ever state premier .
known locally as mac , the politician is proud of his ancestry - he wore a kilt to his wedding .
he 's married with two daughters , jamie and mia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff -lrb- left -rrb- is merkel 's , and the government 's , nominee for the office of president ' future , not socialism ' mcallister and his two sisters spent their early years growing up in west berlin , where his father was stationed with the british army .
being surrounded by communism , as mcallister writes on his website , left its mark : his personal motto is " future , not socialism . "
as an 11-year-old , mcallister moved with his family to bad bederkesa , a small town near cuxhaven in northern germany , a place he and his family consider their " heimat im herzen " - their true home .
it was here in lower saxony that he began his political career , first as district chairman of the cdu youth organization from 1991 to 1994 , and then as mayor of bad bederkesa from 2001 to 2002 .
the election for germany 's next president is due to take place on june 30 , in a special assembly made up of the german parliament and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states . as the ruling coalition 's official choice , wulff stands a good chance of becoming president . until then , the current state premier plans to continue his duties in the state capital of hanover .

on friday , christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- officials said david mcallister , a conservative politician with scottish family roots , had been unanimously nominated to take wulff 's seat once the current premier makes the expected move to the presidential palace in berlin .
wulff was nominated by chancellor angela merkel as the government 's candidate for president on thursday .
" i have confidence in myself for the office of state premier , otherwise i would n't put myself forward for election , " mcallister said after the nomination .
he said he planned to build on wulff 's successful work in the state , adding that wulff 's election as president would be " the culmination of a great political career . "

the study says the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught . the willingness to commit violent crimes grows among young muslim immigrants in germany the more religious they become , according to a joint survey by the german interior ministry and the institute for criminology research of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- .
by comparison , the study found that just the opposite was true for christian immigrants .
the willingness to commit violent crimes , such as armed robbery or assault and battery , among young catholics and protestants decreases with religious fervor , the kfn study revealed .
the study said the reason for this difference had to do with the very different image of masculinity .
muslim devotion promotes the acceptance of macho behavior , said christian pfeiffer , the director of the lower saxony research institute and one of the authors of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim devotion breeds macho behavior , says pfeiffer pfeiffer said that in their religion , and in the family at home , young muslim immigrants are frequently exposed to a more conservative world view and lay claim to a variety of male privileges .
the problem with imams in an effort to explain their results , the study 's authors draw on the findings of rauf ceylan , a religious education expert and himself of turkish extraction , who points to the number of non-german imams , or muslim priests , preaching and teaching in germany .
ceylan maintains that these foreign imams are generally only in germany temporarily , speak no german and have little contact with german culture .
most of them , he says , call for a return to a more conservative islam and retreat into the practitioner 's original ethnic culture .
for them , male dominance is normal and their teachings demand the same from muslim youths , ceylan says .
christian pfeiffer , from the kfn , also points out that the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maiziere wants to discuss the study 's results with muslim groups german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for the study 's results to be put on the agenda of the next islam conference .
different levels of integration the kfn study interviewed a total of 45,000 14-16 year-olds in 61 cities across germany between 2007 and 2008 .
of these , 10,000 had an immigrant background .
it found that the best adjusted and most integrated immigrants came from non-religious families .
more than 41 percent of these were looking to get a high school diploma , nearly 63 percent had german friends and 66 percent viewed themselves as german .
the figures among young muslims were strikingly different : only 16 percent were pursuing a high school diploma , 28 percent had german friends and about 22 percent considered themselves german .

the study says the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught . the willingness to commit violent crimes grows among young muslim immigrants in germany the more religious they become , according to a joint survey by the german interior ministry and the institute for criminology research of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- .
by comparison , the study found that just the opposite was true for christian immigrants .
the willingness to commit violent crimes , such as armed robbery or assault and battery , among young catholics and protestants decreases with religious fervor , the kfn study revealed .
the study said the reason for this difference had to do with the very different image of masculinity .
muslim devotion promotes the acceptance of macho behavior , said christian pfeiffer , the director of the lower saxony research institute and one of the authors of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim devotion breeds macho behavior , says pfeiffer pfeiffer said that in their religion , and in the family at home , young muslim immigrants are frequently exposed to a more conservative world view and lay claim to a variety of male privileges .
the problem with imams in an effort to explain their results , the study 's authors draw on the findings of rauf ceylan , a religious education expert and himself of turkish extraction , who points to the number of non-german imams , or muslim priests , preaching and teaching in germany .
ceylan maintains that these foreign imams are generally only in germany temporarily , speak no german and have little contact with german culture .
most of them , he says , call for a return to a more conservative islam and retreat into the practitioner 's original ethnic culture .
for them , male dominance is normal and their teachings demand the same from muslim youths , ceylan says .
christian pfeiffer , from the kfn , also points out that the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maiziere wants to discuss the study 's results with muslim groups german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for the study 's results to be put on the agenda of the next islam conference .
different levels of integration the kfn study interviewed a total of 45,000 14-16 year-olds in 61 cities across germany between 2007 and 2008 .
of these , 10,000 had an immigrant background .
it found that the best adjusted and most integrated immigrants came from non-religious families .
more than 41 percent of these were looking to get a high school diploma , nearly 63 percent had german friends and 66 percent viewed themselves as german .
the figures among young muslims were strikingly different : only 16 percent were pursuing a high school diploma , 28 percent had german friends and about 22 percent considered themselves german .

known as mac , the 39-year-old would be the country 's youngest ever state premier . with christian wulff , the premier of lower saxony , likely to become germany 's next president , the state is in need of a new leader .
it did n't take long for his replacement to step into the spotlight .
on friday , christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- officials said david mcallister , a conservative politician with scottish family roots , had been unanimously nominated to take wulff 's seat once the current premier makes the expected move to the presidential palace in berlin .
wulff was nominated by chancellor angela merkel as the government 's candidate for president on thursday .
" i have confidence in myself for the office of state premier , otherwise i would n't put myself forward for election , " mcallister said after the nomination .
he said he planned to build on wulff 's successful work in the state , adding that wulff 's election as president would be " the culmination of a great political career . "
mcallister has long been seen as a premier-in-waiting in lower saxony , one of germany 's most populous states .
the 39-year-old , who has a scottish father and a german mother , would be the country 's youngest ever state premier .

it was here in lower saxony that he began his political career , first as district chairman of the cdu youth organization from 1991 to 1994 , and then as mayor of bad bederkesa from 2001 to 2002 .
the election for germany 's next president is due to take place on june 30 , in a special assembly made up of the german parliament and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states . as the ruling coalition 's official choice , wulff stands a good chance of becoming president . until then , the current state premier plans to continue his duties in the state capital of hanover .

it 's rekindled the debate over possible legalization . a group of 15 pupils - mostly girls - is gathered in a small room this morning in durban , south africa 's third-largest city .
while it is still early in the morning , it is already hot and muggy on the indian ocean .
the young people are here to talk about the event that millions around the world are looking forward to , but which could also be very dangerous for them - the world cup .
bongiwe mthethwa , director of an organization called concerned young people in south africa , has been campaigning all over the country with her colleagues to raise awareness about human trafficking and forced prostitution .
they have held more than 1,000 talks at schools and other institutions to help pupils protect themselves from falling into the hands of people traffickers and other predators .
" be careful when someone offers you a drink , it could contain drugs , " bongiwe said , speaking in zulu to be sure the young people understand her .
young and vulnerable some abductions of young people have already been reported , bongiwe said , and traffickers have been taking photos of young girls who they want to offer to visitors during the world cup as prostitutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandisa was forced into prostitution but was able to flee her captors girls are particularly vulnerable , because they will not be at school during the matches , but out in the streets , which makes them targets , " she said .
" it 's very , very high risk to have children in south africa during the world cup .
if we had a choice we would transfer them anywhere else but south africa . "
during these discussions about the potential dangers , 24-year-old mandisa is usually sitting in the first row .
she tells the horrific story of what happened to her in the hopes that others can avoid a similar fate .
she was abducted while walking in the street , confined in a house and forced into prostitution . " -lsb- my kidnapper -rsb- gave me drugs and i had no idea what was happening , " she says .
" he locked me up in a room , tied my arms and legs and raped me .
after that he called his clients and i became a sex slave for him . "
mandisa was lucky , she managed to escape .
but south african authorities fear that many more girls like mandisa could be abducted in the next few weeks .
the estimate that up to 40.000 prostitutes will be working during the world cup - many of them against their will . exaggerated fears but lobby groups for prostitutes , like an organization called sweat in cape town , think these estimates are exaggerated .
" there was this prediction that 40,000 women would be trafficked during the world cup in germany , " said vivienne lalu , director of sweat .
" but research found only a handful , less than five actual examples of trafficked women .
i suspect we 'll have similar outcomes in south africa . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of sweat are fighting to legalize prostitution prostitution is still prohibited in south africa , and sex workers can be fined as well as imprisoned .
sweat advocates legalizing the world 's oldest profession , arguing that in addition to deterring potential traffickers , bringing it out of the shadows would make it easier to monitor prostitutes ' health , including their hiv status .
that 's especially important in south africa , home to 20 percent of hiv infections worldwide .
like durban , cape town is a port city and a center of the south african sex industry .
there are an estimated 1,200 prostitutes in cape town , ray is one of them .
she says she is a sex worker by choice , but admits the work is dangerous .
she is looking forward to the world cup because of the influx of potential customers , but she does worry .
" i 'm scared of police harassment that 's going be stepped up , " she says .
" and i 'll be competing with foreign sex workers . "
legalization debate while sex and soccer will quite likely go hand-in-hand during the world cup , the issue of legalization is not at all settled .
the controversial subject has sparked heated debates throughout the country .
" i do n't think we should condone such things , " said one woman in durban .
" i do n't agree with it but if they feel they are doing what they have to do to earn a living , who are we to question that ? " said another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are thrilled with the world cup , but the event holds dangers for them as well legal or not , ray does n't plan on changing her job anytime soon .
in fact , she still hopes the world cup will be her big chance .
" i look forward to the world cup .
i want to make a friend and maybe i 'll go overseas and make even more money , " she said . despite their efforts , lobbyists from sweat fear they wo n't get much support from the government for their campaign to legalize prostitution to help prevent hiv infections .
many non-profit groups have complained that south africa should use this global even to step up its fight against hiv / aids .
but many say they are being blocked along the way .
this week , south african aids organizations accused football 's governing body fifa of blocking access to condoms and hiv education materials at world cup stadiums and fan parks .
" to date fifa has not permitted any civil society organization to distribute hiv or health-related information , " said the aids consortium , the southern african hiv clinicians society and several other organisations in a statement .
they are not encouraged by south african president jacob zuma , who was charged with rape in 2006 .
although he denied the charge , he did admit to having consensual sex with an hiv-positive woman .
then he declared in court that he had taken a shower to prevent hiv infection , angering many aids educators .

it 's rekindled the debate over possible legalization . a group of 15 pupils - mostly girls - is gathered in a small room this morning in durban , south africa 's third-largest city .
while it is still early in the morning , it is already hot and muggy on the indian ocean .
the young people are here to talk about the event that millions around the world are looking forward to , but which could also be very dangerous for them - the world cup .
bongiwe mthethwa , director of an organization called concerned young people in south africa , has been campaigning all over the country with her colleagues to raise awareness about human trafficking and forced prostitution .
they have held more than 1,000 talks at schools and other institutions to help pupils protect themselves from falling into the hands of people traffickers and other predators .

she tells the horrific story of what happened to her in the hopes that others can avoid a similar fate .
she was abducted while walking in the street , confined in a house and forced into prostitution . " -lsb- my kidnapper -rsb- gave me drugs and i had no idea what was happening , " she says .
" he locked me up in a room , tied my arms and legs and raped me .
after that he called his clients and i became a sex slave for him . "
mandisa was lucky , she managed to escape .
but south african authorities fear that many more girls like mandisa could be abducted in the next few weeks .
the estimate that up to 40.000 prostitutes will be working during the world cup - many of them against their will . exaggerated fears but lobby groups for prostitutes , like an organization called sweat in cape town , think these estimates are exaggerated .

it 's rekindled the debate over possible legalization . a group of 15 pupils - mostly girls - is gathered in a small room this morning in durban , south africa 's third-largest city .
while it is still early in the morning , it is already hot and muggy on the indian ocean .
the young people are here to talk about the event that millions around the world are looking forward to , but which could also be very dangerous for them - the world cup .
bongiwe mthethwa , director of an organization called concerned young people in south africa , has been campaigning all over the country with her colleagues to raise awareness about human trafficking and forced prostitution .
they have held more than 1,000 talks at schools and other institutions to help pupils protect themselves from falling into the hands of people traffickers and other predators .
" be careful when someone offers you a drink , it could contain drugs , " bongiwe said , speaking in zulu to be sure the young people understand her .
young and vulnerable some abductions of young people have already been reported , bongiwe said , and traffickers have been taking photos of young girls who they want to offer to visitors during the world cup as prostitutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandisa was forced into prostitution but was able to flee her captors girls are particularly vulnerable , because they will not be at school during the matches , but out in the streets , which makes them targets , " she said .
" it 's very , very high risk to have children in south africa during the world cup .
if we had a choice we would transfer them anywhere else but south africa . "
during these discussions about the potential dangers , 24-year-old mandisa is usually sitting in the first row .
she tells the horrific story of what happened to her in the hopes that others can avoid a similar fate .
she was abducted while walking in the street , confined in a house and forced into prostitution . " -lsb- my kidnapper -rsb- gave me drugs and i had no idea what was happening , " she says .
" he locked me up in a room , tied my arms and legs and raped me .
after that he called his clients and i became a sex slave for him . "
mandisa was lucky , she managed to escape .
but south african authorities fear that many more girls like mandisa could be abducted in the next few weeks .
the estimate that up to 40.000 prostitutes will be working during the world cup - many of them against their will . exaggerated fears but lobby groups for prostitutes , like an organization called sweat in cape town , think these estimates are exaggerated .
" there was this prediction that 40,000 women would be trafficked during the world cup in germany , " said vivienne lalu , director of sweat .
" but research found only a handful , less than five actual examples of trafficked women .
i suspect we 'll have similar outcomes in south africa . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of sweat are fighting to legalize prostitution prostitution is still prohibited in south africa , and sex workers can be fined as well as imprisoned .
sweat advocates legalizing the world 's oldest profession , arguing that in addition to deterring potential traffickers , bringing it out of the shadows would make it easier to monitor prostitutes ' health , including their hiv status .
that 's especially important in south africa , home to 20 percent of hiv infections worldwide .
like durban , cape town is a port city and a center of the south african sex industry .
there are an estimated 1,200 prostitutes in cape town , ray is one of them .
she says she is a sex worker by choice , but admits the work is dangerous .
she is looking forward to the world cup because of the influx of potential customers , but she does worry .
" i 'm scared of police harassment that 's going be stepped up , " she says .
" and i 'll be competing with foreign sex workers . "
legalization debate while sex and soccer will quite likely go hand-in-hand during the world cup , the issue of legalization is not at all settled .
the controversial subject has sparked heated debates throughout the country .
" i do n't think we should condone such things , " said one woman in durban .
" i do n't agree with it but if they feel they are doing what they have to do to earn a living , who are we to question that ? " said another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are thrilled with the world cup , but the event holds dangers for them as well legal or not , ray does n't plan on changing her job anytime soon .
in fact , she still hopes the world cup will be her big chance .
" i look forward to the world cup .
i want to make a friend and maybe i 'll go overseas and make even more money , " she said . despite their efforts , lobbyists from sweat fear they wo n't get much support from the government for their campaign to legalize prostitution to help prevent hiv infections .
many non-profit groups have complained that south africa should use this global even to step up its fight against hiv / aids .
but many say they are being blocked along the way .
this week , south african aids organizations accused football 's governing body fifa of blocking access to condoms and hiv education materials at world cup stadiums and fan parks .
" to date fifa has not permitted any civil society organization to distribute hiv or health-related information , " said the aids consortium , the southern african hiv clinicians society and several other organisations in a statement .
they are not encouraged by south african president jacob zuma , who was charged with rape in 2006 .
although he denied the charge , he did admit to having consensual sex with an hiv-positive woman .
then he declared in court that he had taken a shower to prevent hiv infection , angering many aids educators .

" we believe there should be an international presence at minimum in that inquiry or investigation . "

the ship was carrying hundreds of tons of aid , including wheelchairs , medical supplies and cement . demonstrations across europe last monday 's raid by israel , which killed nine activists - eight of those killed were turkish , and the ninth had joint us-turkish nationality - triggered demonstrations across europe on saturday . protesters took to the streets in france , ireland , turkey , germany and the united kingdom , chanting anti-israeli slogans and demanding that the blockade be lifted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists around the world were outraged by israel 's actions in france , 20,000 people rallied in paris , nice , marseille and several other french cities , waving turkish and palestinian flags .

french president sarkozy on sunday urged israel to accept the inquiry . french president nicolas sarkozy spoke by telephone on sunday to israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu , urging him to accept " a credible and impartial inquiry " into last week 's deadly raid on a turkish-owned aid ship that left nine activists dead . a statement issued by sarkozy 's office said the french leader called on netanyahu " to follow the requests of the united nations security council . "
sarkozy also said france was willing to participate in the inquiry . israeli officials said un secretary-general ban ki-moon also spoke with netanyahu to propose setting up a multinational commission to investigate what went wrong . following talks in paris , the foreign ministers of france and britain said an international inquiry was necessary to resolve the dispute . " we think it is very important that there is a credible and transparent investigation , " said british foreign secretary william hague . " we believe there should be an international presence at minimum in that inquiry or investigation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel insists its commandos were attacked and fired in self-defense his french counterpart bernard kouchner also proposed that the european union help check the cargo on ships bound for the gaza strip and take charge of the rafah border crossing into palestinian territory .
eu monitors helped oversee the rafah land crossing point into gaza until 2007 , when the operation was suspended for security reasons . the jewish state has fiercely defended its boarding of the turkish aid ship last monday , insisting its commandos were attacked with weapons and opened fire in self-defense .
but activists on the ship said troops shot at them without provocation . israeli ambassador rejects international probe israel has faced an international outcry over the incident , which has also strained relations with turkey .
but michael oren , israel 's ambassador to the united states , on sunday dismissed the proposal for an international probe . " we are rejecting an international commission .
we are discussing with the obama administration a way in which our inquiry will take place , " oren said on the fox news sunday television program . he said israel would not apologize for the incident .
" israel is a democratic nation .
israel has the ability and the right to investigate itself , not to be investigated by any international board , " oren said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers from the irish aid ship were deported on sunday israel deports activists meanwhile , israel began deporting a group of 19 activists who were detained on saturday after trying to sail to gaza in defiance of israel 's three-year blockade .
seven of the activists were reportedly released and deported early sunday , while the rest were to be released later in the day . israel said its troops boarded the irish-owned aid ship rachel corrie earlier on saturday without meeting any resistance , forcing the ship to change course for the southern israeli port of ashdod . the passengers of the rachel corrie included irish and malaysian activists , four indonesian crew members and a scottish captain .
the ship was carrying hundreds of tons of aid , including wheelchairs , medical supplies and cement . demonstrations across europe last monday 's raid by israel , which killed nine activists - eight of those killed were turkish , and the ninth had joint us-turkish nationality - triggered demonstrations across europe on saturday . protesters took to the streets in france , ireland , turkey , germany and the united kingdom , chanting anti-israeli slogans and demanding that the blockade be lifted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists around the world were outraged by israel 's actions in france , 20,000 people rallied in paris , nice , marseille and several other french cities , waving turkish and palestinian flags .
in london , thousands gathered outside the prime minister 's official residence at downing street , urging the british government to step up pressure on israel . in the northwestern german city of duisburg , some 5,000 protestors took part in a demonstration organized by milli gorus , an islamist movement with turkish roots .

known as mac , the 39-year-old would be the country 's youngest ever state premier . with christian wulff , the premier of lower saxony , likely to become germany 's next president , the state is in need of a new leader .
it did n't take long for his replacement to step into the spotlight .
on friday , christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- officials said david mcallister , a conservative politician with scottish family roots , had been unanimously nominated to take wulff 's seat once the current premier makes the expected move to the presidential palace in berlin .
wulff was nominated by chancellor angela merkel as the government 's candidate for president on thursday .
" i have confidence in myself for the office of state premier , otherwise i would n't put myself forward for election , " mcallister said after the nomination .
he said he planned to build on wulff 's successful work in the state , adding that wulff 's election as president would be " the culmination of a great political career . "
mcallister has long been seen as a premier-in-waiting in lower saxony , one of germany 's most populous states .
the 39-year-old , who has a scottish father and a german mother , would be the country 's youngest ever state premier .

as an 11-year-old , mcallister moved with his family to bad bederkesa , a small town near cuxhaven in northern germany , a place he and his family consider their " heimat im herzen " - their true home .
it was here in lower saxony that he began his political career , first as district chairman of the cdu youth organization from 1991 to 1994 , and then as mayor of bad bederkesa from 2001 to 2002 .
the election for germany 's next president is due to take place on june 30 , in a special assembly made up of the german parliament and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states . as the ruling coalition 's official choice , wulff stands a good chance of becoming president . until then , the current state premier plans to continue his duties in the state capital of hanover .

known as mac , the 39-year-old would be the country 's youngest ever state premier . with christian wulff , the premier of lower saxony , likely to become germany 's next president , the state is in need of a new leader .
it did n't take long for his replacement to step into the spotlight .
on friday , christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- officials said david mcallister , a conservative politician with scottish family roots , had been unanimously nominated to take wulff 's seat once the current premier makes the expected move to the presidential palace in berlin .
wulff was nominated by chancellor angela merkel as the government 's candidate for president on thursday .
" i have confidence in myself for the office of state premier , otherwise i would n't put myself forward for election , " mcallister said after the nomination .
he said he planned to build on wulff 's successful work in the state , adding that wulff 's election as president would be " the culmination of a great political career . "
mcallister has long been seen as a premier-in-waiting in lower saxony , one of germany 's most populous states .
the 39-year-old , who has a scottish father and a german mother , would be the country 's youngest ever state premier .
known locally as mac , the politician is proud of his ancestry - he wore a kilt to his wedding .
he 's married with two daughters , jamie and mia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff -lrb- left -rrb- is merkel 's , and the government 's , nominee for the office of president ' future , not socialism ' mcallister and his two sisters spent their early years growing up in west berlin , where his father was stationed with the british army .
being surrounded by communism , as mcallister writes on his website , left its mark : his personal motto is " future , not socialism . "
as an 11-year-old , mcallister moved with his family to bad bederkesa , a small town near cuxhaven in northern germany , a place he and his family consider their " heimat im herzen " - their true home .
it was here in lower saxony that he began his political career , first as district chairman of the cdu youth organization from 1991 to 1994 , and then as mayor of bad bederkesa from 2001 to 2002 .
the election for germany 's next president is due to take place on june 30 , in a special assembly made up of the german parliament and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states . as the ruling coalition 's official choice , wulff stands a good chance of becoming president . until then , the current state premier plans to continue his duties in the state capital of hanover .

the pontiff prayed for the success of a synod of middle eastern bishops in rome in october , which is set to grapple with the problems of the region .
calling the latest tensions between israel and palestinians " a grave matter , " benedict said he hoped the meeting would " help focus the attention of the international community " on the conflict in the region and the " plight of christians in the middle east who suffer for their beliefs . "
vatican paper focuses on mideast following the outdoor service , the pope unveiled a working paper for the synod .
called " instrumentum laboris , " it expresses concern about radical islam .
" these extremist currents , clearly a threat to everyone - christians , jews and muslims - require joint action , " the document states .
the working paper laments the dwindling numbers of already minority christians in the middle east .
" their disappearance would impoverish the pluralism which has always characterized the countries of the middle east and those countries would be at a disadvantage without the christian voice , " it said .
the 40-page paper also says that the unresolved israeli-palestinian conflict contributed to the political , economic and religious tensions in the region .
the vatican backs a palestinian homeland alongside israel 's right to exist within internationally recognized borders .

the study says the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught . the willingness to commit violent crimes grows among young muslim immigrants in germany the more religious they become , according to a joint survey by the german interior ministry and the institute for criminology research of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- .
by comparison , the study found that just the opposite was true for christian immigrants .
the willingness to commit violent crimes , such as armed robbery or assault and battery , among young catholics and protestants decreases with religious fervor , the kfn study revealed .
the study said the reason for this difference had to do with the very different image of masculinity .
muslim devotion promotes the acceptance of macho behavior , said christian pfeiffer , the director of the lower saxony research institute and one of the authors of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim devotion breeds macho behavior , says pfeiffer pfeiffer said that in their religion , and in the family at home , young muslim immigrants are frequently exposed to a more conservative world view and lay claim to a variety of male privileges .
the problem with imams in an effort to explain their results , the study 's authors draw on the findings of rauf ceylan , a religious education expert and himself of turkish extraction , who points to the number of non-german imams , or muslim priests , preaching and teaching in germany .
ceylan maintains that these foreign imams are generally only in germany temporarily , speak no german and have little contact with german culture .
most of them , he says , call for a return to a more conservative islam and retreat into the practitioner 's original ethnic culture .
for them , male dominance is normal and their teachings demand the same from muslim youths , ceylan says .
christian pfeiffer , from the kfn , also points out that the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maiziere wants to discuss the study 's results with muslim groups german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for the study 's results to be put on the agenda of the next islam conference .
different levels of integration the kfn study interviewed a total of 45,000 14-16 year-olds in 61 cities across germany between 2007 and 2008 .
of these , 10,000 had an immigrant background .
it found that the best adjusted and most integrated immigrants came from non-religious families .
more than 41 percent of these were looking to get a high school diploma , nearly 63 percent had german friends and 66 percent viewed themselves as german .
the figures among young muslims were strikingly different : only 16 percent were pursuing a high school diploma , 28 percent had german friends and about 22 percent considered themselves german .

the study says the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught . the willingness to commit violent crimes grows among young muslim immigrants in germany the more religious they become , according to a joint survey by the german interior ministry and the institute for criminology research of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- .
by comparison , the study found that just the opposite was true for christian immigrants .
the willingness to commit violent crimes , such as armed robbery or assault and battery , among young catholics and protestants decreases with religious fervor , the kfn study revealed .
the study said the reason for this difference had to do with the very different image of masculinity .
muslim devotion promotes the acceptance of macho behavior , said christian pfeiffer , the director of the lower saxony research institute and one of the authors of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim devotion breeds macho behavior , says pfeiffer pfeiffer said that in their religion , and in the family at home , young muslim immigrants are frequently exposed to a more conservative world view and lay claim to a variety of male privileges .
the problem with imams in an effort to explain their results , the study 's authors draw on the findings of rauf ceylan , a religious education expert and himself of turkish extraction , who points to the number of non-german imams , or muslim priests , preaching and teaching in germany .
ceylan maintains that these foreign imams are generally only in germany temporarily , speak no german and have little contact with german culture .
most of them , he says , call for a return to a more conservative islam and retreat into the practitioner 's original ethnic culture .
for them , male dominance is normal and their teachings demand the same from muslim youths , ceylan says .
christian pfeiffer , from the kfn , also points out that the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maiziere wants to discuss the study 's results with muslim groups german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for the study 's results to be put on the agenda of the next islam conference .
different levels of integration the kfn study interviewed a total of 45,000 14-16 year-olds in 61 cities across germany between 2007 and 2008 .
of these , 10,000 had an immigrant background .
it found that the best adjusted and most integrated immigrants came from non-religious families .
more than 41 percent of these were looking to get a high school diploma , nearly 63 percent had german friends and 66 percent viewed themselves as german .
the figures among young muslims were strikingly different : only 16 percent were pursuing a high school diploma , 28 percent had german friends and about 22 percent considered themselves german .

it 's rekindled the debate over possible legalization . a group of 15 pupils - mostly girls - is gathered in a small room this morning in durban , south africa 's third-largest city .
while it is still early in the morning , it is already hot and muggy on the indian ocean .
the young people are here to talk about the event that millions around the world are looking forward to , but which could also be very dangerous for them - the world cup .
bongiwe mthethwa , director of an organization called concerned young people in south africa , has been campaigning all over the country with her colleagues to raise awareness about human trafficking and forced prostitution .
they have held more than 1,000 talks at schools and other institutions to help pupils protect themselves from falling into the hands of people traffickers and other predators .
" be careful when someone offers you a drink , it could contain drugs , " bongiwe said , speaking in zulu to be sure the young people understand her .
young and vulnerable some abductions of young people have already been reported , bongiwe said , and traffickers have been taking photos of young girls who they want to offer to visitors during the world cup as prostitutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandisa was forced into prostitution but was able to flee her captors girls are particularly vulnerable , because they will not be at school during the matches , but out in the streets , which makes them targets , " she said .
" it 's very , very high risk to have children in south africa during the world cup .
if we had a choice we would transfer them anywhere else but south africa . "
during these discussions about the potential dangers , 24-year-old mandisa is usually sitting in the first row .
she tells the horrific story of what happened to her in the hopes that others can avoid a similar fate .
she was abducted while walking in the street , confined in a house and forced into prostitution . " -lsb- my kidnapper -rsb- gave me drugs and i had no idea what was happening , " she says .
" he locked me up in a room , tied my arms and legs and raped me .
after that he called his clients and i became a sex slave for him . "
mandisa was lucky , she managed to escape .
but south african authorities fear that many more girls like mandisa could be abducted in the next few weeks .
the estimate that up to 40.000 prostitutes will be working during the world cup - many of them against their will . exaggerated fears but lobby groups for prostitutes , like an organization called sweat in cape town , think these estimates are exaggerated .
" there was this prediction that 40,000 women would be trafficked during the world cup in germany , " said vivienne lalu , director of sweat .
" but research found only a handful , less than five actual examples of trafficked women .
i suspect we 'll have similar outcomes in south africa . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of sweat are fighting to legalize prostitution prostitution is still prohibited in south africa , and sex workers can be fined as well as imprisoned .
sweat advocates legalizing the world 's oldest profession , arguing that in addition to deterring potential traffickers , bringing it out of the shadows would make it easier to monitor prostitutes ' health , including their hiv status .
that 's especially important in south africa , home to 20 percent of hiv infections worldwide .
like durban , cape town is a port city and a center of the south african sex industry .
there are an estimated 1,200 prostitutes in cape town , ray is one of them .
she says she is a sex worker by choice , but admits the work is dangerous .
she is looking forward to the world cup because of the influx of potential customers , but she does worry .
" i 'm scared of police harassment that 's going be stepped up , " she says .
" and i 'll be competing with foreign sex workers . "
legalization debate while sex and soccer will quite likely go hand-in-hand during the world cup , the issue of legalization is not at all settled .
the controversial subject has sparked heated debates throughout the country .
" i do n't think we should condone such things , " said one woman in durban .
" i do n't agree with it but if they feel they are doing what they have to do to earn a living , who are we to question that ? " said another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are thrilled with the world cup , but the event holds dangers for them as well legal or not , ray does n't plan on changing her job anytime soon .
in fact , she still hopes the world cup will be her big chance .
" i look forward to the world cup .
i want to make a friend and maybe i 'll go overseas and make even more money , " she said . despite their efforts , lobbyists from sweat fear they wo n't get much support from the government for their campaign to legalize prostitution to help prevent hiv infections .
many non-profit groups have complained that south africa should use this global even to step up its fight against hiv / aids .
but many say they are being blocked along the way .
this week , south african aids organizations accused football 's governing body fifa of blocking access to condoms and hiv education materials at world cup stadiums and fan parks .
" to date fifa has not permitted any civil society organization to distribute hiv or health-related information , " said the aids consortium , the southern african hiv clinicians society and several other organisations in a statement .
they are not encouraged by south african president jacob zuma , who was charged with rape in 2006 .
although he denied the charge , he did admit to having consensual sex with an hiv-positive woman .
then he declared in court that he had taken a shower to prevent hiv infection , angering many aids educators .

it 's rekindled the debate over possible legalization . a group of 15 pupils - mostly girls - is gathered in a small room this morning in durban , south africa 's third-largest city .
while it is still early in the morning , it is already hot and muggy on the indian ocean .
the young people are here to talk about the event that millions around the world are looking forward to , but which could also be very dangerous for them - the world cup .
bongiwe mthethwa , director of an organization called concerned young people in south africa , has been campaigning all over the country with her colleagues to raise awareness about human trafficking and forced prostitution .
they have held more than 1,000 talks at schools and other institutions to help pupils protect themselves from falling into the hands of people traffickers and other predators .
" be careful when someone offers you a drink , it could contain drugs , " bongiwe said , speaking in zulu to be sure the young people understand her .
young and vulnerable some abductions of young people have already been reported , bongiwe said , and traffickers have been taking photos of young girls who they want to offer to visitors during the world cup as prostitutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandisa was forced into prostitution but was able to flee her captors girls are particularly vulnerable , because they will not be at school during the matches , but out in the streets , which makes them targets , " she said .
" it 's very , very high risk to have children in south africa during the world cup .
if we had a choice we would transfer them anywhere else but south africa . "
during these discussions about the potential dangers , 24-year-old mandisa is usually sitting in the first row .
she tells the horrific story of what happened to her in the hopes that others can avoid a similar fate .
she was abducted while walking in the street , confined in a house and forced into prostitution . " -lsb- my kidnapper -rsb- gave me drugs and i had no idea what was happening , " she says .
" he locked me up in a room , tied my arms and legs and raped me .
after that he called his clients and i became a sex slave for him . "
mandisa was lucky , she managed to escape .
but south african authorities fear that many more girls like mandisa could be abducted in the next few weeks .
the estimate that up to 40.000 prostitutes will be working during the world cup - many of them against their will . exaggerated fears but lobby groups for prostitutes , like an organization called sweat in cape town , think these estimates are exaggerated .
" there was this prediction that 40,000 women would be trafficked during the world cup in germany , " said vivienne lalu , director of sweat .
" but research found only a handful , less than five actual examples of trafficked women .
i suspect we 'll have similar outcomes in south africa . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of sweat are fighting to legalize prostitution prostitution is still prohibited in south africa , and sex workers can be fined as well as imprisoned .
sweat advocates legalizing the world 's oldest profession , arguing that in addition to deterring potential traffickers , bringing it out of the shadows would make it easier to monitor prostitutes ' health , including their hiv status .
that 's especially important in south africa , home to 20 percent of hiv infections worldwide .
like durban , cape town is a port city and a center of the south african sex industry .
there are an estimated 1,200 prostitutes in cape town , ray is one of them .
she says she is a sex worker by choice , but admits the work is dangerous .
she is looking forward to the world cup because of the influx of potential customers , but she does worry .
" i 'm scared of police harassment that 's going be stepped up , " she says .
" and i 'll be competing with foreign sex workers . "
legalization debate while sex and soccer will quite likely go hand-in-hand during the world cup , the issue of legalization is not at all settled .
the controversial subject has sparked heated debates throughout the country .
" i do n't think we should condone such things , " said one woman in durban .
" i do n't agree with it but if they feel they are doing what they have to do to earn a living , who are we to question that ? " said another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are thrilled with the world cup , but the event holds dangers for them as well legal or not , ray does n't plan on changing her job anytime soon .
in fact , she still hopes the world cup will be her big chance .
" i look forward to the world cup .
i want to make a friend and maybe i 'll go overseas and make even more money , " she said . despite their efforts , lobbyists from sweat fear they wo n't get much support from the government for their campaign to legalize prostitution to help prevent hiv infections .
many non-profit groups have complained that south africa should use this global even to step up its fight against hiv / aids .
but many say they are being blocked along the way .
this week , south african aids organizations accused football 's governing body fifa of blocking access to condoms and hiv education materials at world cup stadiums and fan parks .
" to date fifa has not permitted any civil society organization to distribute hiv or health-related information , " said the aids consortium , the southern african hiv clinicians society and several other organisations in a statement .
they are not encouraged by south african president jacob zuma , who was charged with rape in 2006 .
although he denied the charge , he did admit to having consensual sex with an hiv-positive woman .
then he declared in court that he had taken a shower to prevent hiv infection , angering many aids educators .

known as mac , the 39-year-old would be the country 's youngest ever state premier . with christian wulff , the premier of lower saxony , likely to become germany 's next president , the state is in need of a new leader .
it did n't take long for his replacement to step into the spotlight .
on friday , christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- officials said david mcallister , a conservative politician with scottish family roots , had been unanimously nominated to take wulff 's seat once the current premier makes the expected move to the presidential palace in berlin .
wulff was nominated by chancellor angela merkel as the government 's candidate for president on thursday .
" i have confidence in myself for the office of state premier , otherwise i would n't put myself forward for election , " mcallister said after the nomination .
he said he planned to build on wulff 's successful work in the state , adding that wulff 's election as president would be " the culmination of a great political career . "
mcallister has long been seen as a premier-in-waiting in lower saxony , one of germany 's most populous states .
the 39-year-old , who has a scottish father and a german mother , would be the country 's youngest ever state premier .
known locally as mac , the politician is proud of his ancestry - he wore a kilt to his wedding .
he 's married with two daughters , jamie and mia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff -lrb- left -rrb- is merkel 's , and the government 's , nominee for the office of president ' future , not socialism ' mcallister and his two sisters spent their early years growing up in west berlin , where his father was stationed with the british army .
being surrounded by communism , as mcallister writes on his website , left its mark : his personal motto is " future , not socialism . "
as an 11-year-old , mcallister moved with his family to bad bederkesa , a small town near cuxhaven in northern germany , a place he and his family consider their " heimat im herzen " - their true home .
it was here in lower saxony that he began his political career , first as district chairman of the cdu youth organization from 1991 to 1994 , and then as mayor of bad bederkesa from 2001 to 2002 .
the election for germany 's next president is due to take place on june 30 , in a special assembly made up of the german parliament and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states . as the ruling coalition 's official choice , wulff stands a good chance of becoming president . until then , the current state premier plans to continue his duties in the state capital of hanover .

the study says the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught . the willingness to commit violent crimes grows among young muslim immigrants in germany the more religious they become , according to a joint survey by the german interior ministry and the institute for criminology research of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- .
by comparison , the study found that just the opposite was true for christian immigrants .
the willingness to commit violent crimes , such as armed robbery or assault and battery , among young catholics and protestants decreases with religious fervor , the kfn study revealed .
the study said the reason for this difference had to do with the very different image of masculinity .
muslim devotion promotes the acceptance of macho behavior , said christian pfeiffer , the director of the lower saxony research institute and one of the authors of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim devotion breeds macho behavior , says pfeiffer pfeiffer said that in their religion , and in the family at home , young muslim immigrants are frequently exposed to a more conservative world view and lay claim to a variety of male privileges .
the problem with imams in an effort to explain their results , the study 's authors draw on the findings of rauf ceylan , a religious education expert and himself of turkish extraction , who points to the number of non-german imams , or muslim priests , preaching and teaching in germany .
ceylan maintains that these foreign imams are generally only in germany temporarily , speak no german and have little contact with german culture .
most of them , he says , call for a return to a more conservative islam and retreat into the practitioner 's original ethnic culture .
for them , male dominance is normal and their teachings demand the same from muslim youths , ceylan says .
christian pfeiffer , from the kfn , also points out that the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught .

of these , 10,000 had an immigrant background .
it found that the best adjusted and most integrated immigrants came from non-religious families .
more than 41 percent of these were looking to get a high school diploma , nearly 63 percent had german friends and 66 percent viewed themselves as german .
the figures among young muslims were strikingly different : only 16 percent were pursuing a high school diploma , 28 percent had german friends and about 22 percent considered themselves german .

he said he planned to build on wulff 's successful work in the state , adding that wulff 's election as president would be " the culmination of a great political career . "
mcallister has long been seen as a premier-in-waiting in lower saxony , one of germany 's most populous states .
the 39-year-old , who has a scottish father and a german mother , would be the country 's youngest ever state premier .
known locally as mac , the politician is proud of his ancestry - he wore a kilt to his wedding .
he 's married with two daughters , jamie and mia .

being surrounded by communism , as mcallister writes on his website , left its mark : his personal motto is " future , not socialism . "
as an 11-year-old , mcallister moved with his family to bad bederkesa , a small town near cuxhaven in northern germany , a place he and his family consider their " heimat im herzen " - their true home .
it was here in lower saxony that he began his political career , first as district chairman of the cdu youth organization from 1991 to 1994 , and then as mayor of bad bederkesa from 2001 to 2002 .
the election for germany 's next president is due to take place on june 30 , in a special assembly made up of the german parliament and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states . as the ruling coalition 's official choice , wulff stands a good chance of becoming president . until then , the current state premier plans to continue his duties in the state capital of hanover .

the pontiff prayed for the success of a synod of middle eastern bishops in rome in october , which is set to grapple with the problems of the region .
calling the latest tensions between israel and palestinians " a grave matter , " benedict said he hoped the meeting would " help focus the attention of the international community " on the conflict in the region and the " plight of christians in the middle east who suffer for their beliefs . "
vatican paper focuses on mideast following the outdoor service , the pope unveiled a working paper for the synod .
called " instrumentum laboris , " it expresses concern about radical islam .
" these extremist currents , clearly a threat to everyone - christians , jews and muslims - require joint action , " the document states .
the working paper laments the dwindling numbers of already minority christians in the middle east .
" their disappearance would impoverish the pluralism which has always characterized the countries of the middle east and those countries would be at a disadvantage without the christian voice , " it said .
the 40-page paper also says that the unresolved israeli-palestinian conflict contributed to the political , economic and religious tensions in the region .
the vatican backs a palestinian homeland alongside israel 's right to exist within internationally recognized borders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 06.06.2010 study finds young , devout muslims in germany more prone to violence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence is a growing problem among young devout muslims a study conducted by the german authorities has found that the more devout young muslims become , the more prone to violence they get .
the study says the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught . the willingness to commit violent crimes grows among young muslim immigrants in germany the more religious they become , according to a joint survey by the german interior ministry and the institute for criminology research of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- .
by comparison , the study found that just the opposite was true for christian immigrants .
the willingness to commit violent crimes , such as armed robbery or assault and battery , among young catholics and protestants decreases with religious fervor , the kfn study revealed .
the study said the reason for this difference had to do with the very different image of masculinity .
muslim devotion promotes the acceptance of macho behavior , said christian pfeiffer , the director of the lower saxony research institute and one of the authors of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim devotion breeds macho behavior , says pfeiffer pfeiffer said that in their religion , and in the family at home , young muslim immigrants are frequently exposed to a more conservative world view and lay claim to a variety of male privileges .
the problem with imams in an effort to explain their results , the study 's authors draw on the findings of rauf ceylan , a religious education expert and himself of turkish extraction , who points to the number of non-german imams , or muslim priests , preaching and teaching in germany .
ceylan maintains that these foreign imams are generally only in germany temporarily , speak no german and have little contact with german culture .
most of them , he says , call for a return to a more conservative islam and retreat into the practitioner 's original ethnic culture .
for them , male dominance is normal and their teachings demand the same from muslim youths , ceylan says .
christian pfeiffer , from the kfn , also points out that the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maiziere wants to discuss the study 's results with muslim groups german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for the study 's results to be put on the agenda of the next islam conference .
different levels of integration the kfn study interviewed a total of 45,000 14-16 year-olds in 61 cities across germany between 2007 and 2008 .
of these , 10,000 had an immigrant background .
it found that the best adjusted and most integrated immigrants came from non-religious families .
more than 41 percent of these were looking to get a high school diploma , nearly 63 percent had german friends and 66 percent viewed themselves as german .
the figures among young muslims were strikingly different : only 16 percent were pursuing a high school diploma , 28 percent had german friends and about 22 percent considered themselves german .

it 's rekindled the debate over possible legalization . a group of 15 pupils - mostly girls - is gathered in a small room this morning in durban , south africa 's third-largest city .
while it is still early in the morning , it is already hot and muggy on the indian ocean .
the young people are here to talk about the event that millions around the world are looking forward to , but which could also be very dangerous for them - the world cup .
bongiwe mthethwa , director of an organization called concerned young people in south africa , has been campaigning all over the country with her colleagues to raise awareness about human trafficking and forced prostitution .
they have held more than 1,000 talks at schools and other institutions to help pupils protect themselves from falling into the hands of people traffickers and other predators .
" be careful when someone offers you a drink , it could contain drugs , " bongiwe said , speaking in zulu to be sure the young people understand her .
young and vulnerable some abductions of young people have already been reported , bongiwe said , and traffickers have been taking photos of young girls who they want to offer to visitors during the world cup as prostitutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandisa was forced into prostitution but was able to flee her captors girls are particularly vulnerable , because they will not be at school during the matches , but out in the streets , which makes them targets , " she said .
" it 's very , very high risk to have children in south africa during the world cup .
if we had a choice we would transfer them anywhere else but south africa . "
during these discussions about the potential dangers , 24-year-old mandisa is usually sitting in the first row .
she tells the horrific story of what happened to her in the hopes that others can avoid a similar fate .
she was abducted while walking in the street , confined in a house and forced into prostitution . " -lsb- my kidnapper -rsb- gave me drugs and i had no idea what was happening , " she says .
" he locked me up in a room , tied my arms and legs and raped me .
after that he called his clients and i became a sex slave for him . "
mandisa was lucky , she managed to escape .
but south african authorities fear that many more girls like mandisa could be abducted in the next few weeks .
the estimate that up to 40.000 prostitutes will be working during the world cup - many of them against their will . exaggerated fears but lobby groups for prostitutes , like an organization called sweat in cape town , think these estimates are exaggerated .
" there was this prediction that 40,000 women would be trafficked during the world cup in germany , " said vivienne lalu , director of sweat .
" but research found only a handful , less than five actual examples of trafficked women .
i suspect we 'll have similar outcomes in south africa . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of sweat are fighting to legalize prostitution prostitution is still prohibited in south africa , and sex workers can be fined as well as imprisoned .
sweat advocates legalizing the world 's oldest profession , arguing that in addition to deterring potential traffickers , bringing it out of the shadows would make it easier to monitor prostitutes ' health , including their hiv status .
that 's especially important in south africa , home to 20 percent of hiv infections worldwide .
like durban , cape town is a port city and a center of the south african sex industry .
there are an estimated 1,200 prostitutes in cape town , ray is one of them .
she says she is a sex worker by choice , but admits the work is dangerous .
she is looking forward to the world cup because of the influx of potential customers , but she does worry .
" i 'm scared of police harassment that 's going be stepped up , " she says .
" and i 'll be competing with foreign sex workers . "
legalization debate while sex and soccer will quite likely go hand-in-hand during the world cup , the issue of legalization is not at all settled .
the controversial subject has sparked heated debates throughout the country .
" i do n't think we should condone such things , " said one woman in durban .
" i do n't agree with it but if they feel they are doing what they have to do to earn a living , who are we to question that ? " said another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are thrilled with the world cup , but the event holds dangers for them as well legal or not , ray does n't plan on changing her job anytime soon .
in fact , she still hopes the world cup will be her big chance .
" i look forward to the world cup .
i want to make a friend and maybe i 'll go overseas and make even more money , " she said . despite their efforts , lobbyists from sweat fear they wo n't get much support from the government for their campaign to legalize prostitution to help prevent hiv infections .
many non-profit groups have complained that south africa should use this global even to step up its fight against hiv / aids .
but many say they are being blocked along the way .
this week , south african aids organizations accused football 's governing body fifa of blocking access to condoms and hiv education materials at world cup stadiums and fan parks .
" to date fifa has not permitted any civil society organization to distribute hiv or health-related information , " said the aids consortium , the southern african hiv clinicians society and several other organisations in a statement .
they are not encouraged by south african president jacob zuma , who was charged with rape in 2006 .
although he denied the charge , he did admit to having consensual sex with an hiv-positive woman .
then he declared in court that he had taken a shower to prevent hiv infection , angering many aids educators .

it 's rekindled the debate over possible legalization . a group of 15 pupils - mostly girls - is gathered in a small room this morning in durban , south africa 's third-largest city .
while it is still early in the morning , it is already hot and muggy on the indian ocean .
the young people are here to talk about the event that millions around the world are looking forward to , but which could also be very dangerous for them - the world cup .
bongiwe mthethwa , director of an organization called concerned young people in south africa , has been campaigning all over the country with her colleagues to raise awareness about human trafficking and forced prostitution .
they have held more than 1,000 talks at schools and other institutions to help pupils protect themselves from falling into the hands of people traffickers and other predators .
" be careful when someone offers you a drink , it could contain drugs , " bongiwe said , speaking in zulu to be sure the young people understand her .
young and vulnerable some abductions of young people have already been reported , bongiwe said , and traffickers have been taking photos of young girls who they want to offer to visitors during the world cup as prostitutes .

" it 's very , very high risk to have children in south africa during the world cup .
if we had a choice we would transfer them anywhere else but south africa . "
during these discussions about the potential dangers , 24-year-old mandisa is usually sitting in the first row .
she tells the horrific story of what happened to her in the hopes that others can avoid a similar fate .
she was abducted while walking in the street , confined in a house and forced into prostitution . " -lsb- my kidnapper -rsb- gave me drugs and i had no idea what was happening , " she says .
" he locked me up in a room , tied my arms and legs and raped me .
after that he called his clients and i became a sex slave for him . "
mandisa was lucky , she managed to escape .
but south african authorities fear that many more girls like mandisa could be abducted in the next few weeks .
the estimate that up to 40.000 prostitutes will be working during the world cup - many of them against their will . exaggerated fears but lobby groups for prostitutes , like an organization called sweat in cape town , think these estimates are exaggerated .
" there was this prediction that 40,000 women would be trafficked during the world cup in germany , " said vivienne lalu , director of sweat .
" but research found only a handful , less than five actual examples of trafficked women .
i suspect we 'll have similar outcomes in south africa . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of sweat are fighting to legalize prostitution prostitution is still prohibited in south africa , and sex workers can be fined as well as imprisoned .
sweat advocates legalizing the world 's oldest profession , arguing that in addition to deterring potential traffickers , bringing it out of the shadows would make it easier to monitor prostitutes ' health , including their hiv status .
that 's especially important in south africa , home to 20 percent of hiv infections worldwide .
like durban , cape town is a port city and a center of the south african sex industry .
there are an estimated 1,200 prostitutes in cape town , ray is one of them .
she says she is a sex worker by choice , but admits the work is dangerous .
she is looking forward to the world cup because of the influx of potential customers , but she does worry .
" i 'm scared of police harassment that 's going be stepped up , " she says .
" and i 'll be competing with foreign sex workers . "
legalization debate while sex and soccer will quite likely go hand-in-hand during the world cup , the issue of legalization is not at all settled .
the controversial subject has sparked heated debates throughout the country .
" i do n't think we should condone such things , " said one woman in durban .
" i do n't agree with it but if they feel they are doing what they have to do to earn a living , who are we to question that ? " said another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are thrilled with the world cup , but the event holds dangers for them as well legal or not , ray does n't plan on changing her job anytime soon .

many non-profit groups have complained that south africa should use this global even to step up its fight against hiv / aids .

this week , south african aids organizations accused football 's governing body fifa of blocking access to condoms and hiv education materials at world cup stadiums and fan parks .

although he denied the charge , he did admit to having consensual sex with an hiv-positive woman .
then he declared in court that he had taken a shower to prevent hiv infection , angering many aids educators .

it 's rekindled the debate over possible legalization . a group of 15 pupils - mostly girls - is gathered in a small room this morning in durban , south africa 's third-largest city .
while it is still early in the morning , it is already hot and muggy on the indian ocean .
the young people are here to talk about the event that millions around the world are looking forward to , but which could also be very dangerous for them - the world cup .
bongiwe mthethwa , director of an organization called concerned young people in south africa , has been campaigning all over the country with her colleagues to raise awareness about human trafficking and forced prostitution .
they have held more than 1,000 talks at schools and other institutions to help pupils protect themselves from falling into the hands of people traffickers and other predators .
" be careful when someone offers you a drink , it could contain drugs , " bongiwe said , speaking in zulu to be sure the young people understand her .
young and vulnerable some abductions of young people have already been reported , bongiwe said , and traffickers have been taking photos of young girls who they want to offer to visitors during the world cup as prostitutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandisa was forced into prostitution but was able to flee her captors girls are particularly vulnerable , because they will not be at school during the matches , but out in the streets , which makes them targets , " she said .
" it 's very , very high risk to have children in south africa during the world cup .
if we had a choice we would transfer them anywhere else but south africa . "
during these discussions about the potential dangers , 24-year-old mandisa is usually sitting in the first row .
she tells the horrific story of what happened to her in the hopes that others can avoid a similar fate .
she was abducted while walking in the street , confined in a house and forced into prostitution . " -lsb- my kidnapper -rsb- gave me drugs and i had no idea what was happening , " she says .
" he locked me up in a room , tied my arms and legs and raped me .
after that he called his clients and i became a sex slave for him . "
mandisa was lucky , she managed to escape .
but south african authorities fear that many more girls like mandisa could be abducted in the next few weeks .
the estimate that up to 40.000 prostitutes will be working during the world cup - many of them against their will . exaggerated fears but lobby groups for prostitutes , like an organization called sweat in cape town , think these estimates are exaggerated .
" there was this prediction that 40,000 women would be trafficked during the world cup in germany , " said vivienne lalu , director of sweat .
" but research found only a handful , less than five actual examples of trafficked women .
i suspect we 'll have similar outcomes in south africa . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of sweat are fighting to legalize prostitution prostitution is still prohibited in south africa , and sex workers can be fined as well as imprisoned .
sweat advocates legalizing the world 's oldest profession , arguing that in addition to deterring potential traffickers , bringing it out of the shadows would make it easier to monitor prostitutes ' health , including their hiv status .
that 's especially important in south africa , home to 20 percent of hiv infections worldwide .
like durban , cape town is a port city and a center of the south african sex industry .
there are an estimated 1,200 prostitutes in cape town , ray is one of them .
she says she is a sex worker by choice , but admits the work is dangerous .
she is looking forward to the world cup because of the influx of potential customers , but she does worry .
" i 'm scared of police harassment that 's going be stepped up , " she says .
" and i 'll be competing with foreign sex workers . "
legalization debate while sex and soccer will quite likely go hand-in-hand during the world cup , the issue of legalization is not at all settled .
the controversial subject has sparked heated debates throughout the country .
" i do n't think we should condone such things , " said one woman in durban .
" i do n't agree with it but if they feel they are doing what they have to do to earn a living , who are we to question that ? " said another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are thrilled with the world cup , but the event holds dangers for them as well legal or not , ray does n't plan on changing her job anytime soon .
in fact , she still hopes the world cup will be her big chance .
" i look forward to the world cup .
i want to make a friend and maybe i 'll go overseas and make even more money , " she said . despite their efforts , lobbyists from sweat fear they wo n't get much support from the government for their campaign to legalize prostitution to help prevent hiv infections .
many non-profit groups have complained that south africa should use this global even to step up its fight against hiv / aids .
but many say they are being blocked along the way .
this week , south african aids organizations accused football 's governing body fifa of blocking access to condoms and hiv education materials at world cup stadiums and fan parks .
" to date fifa has not permitted any civil society organization to distribute hiv or health-related information , " said the aids consortium , the southern african hiv clinicians society and several other organisations in a statement .
they are not encouraged by south african president jacob zuma , who was charged with rape in 2006 .
although he denied the charge , he did admit to having consensual sex with an hiv-positive woman .
then he declared in court that he had taken a shower to prevent hiv infection , angering many aids educators .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 06.06.2010 study finds young , devout muslims in germany more prone to violence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence is a growing problem among young devout muslims a study conducted by the german authorities has found that the more devout young muslims become , the more prone to violence they get .
the study says the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught . the willingness to commit violent crimes grows among young muslim immigrants in germany the more religious they become , according to a joint survey by the german interior ministry and the institute for criminology research of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- .
by comparison , the study found that just the opposite was true for christian immigrants .
the willingness to commit violent crimes , such as armed robbery or assault and battery , among young catholics and protestants decreases with religious fervor , the kfn study revealed .
the study said the reason for this difference had to do with the very different image of masculinity .
muslim devotion promotes the acceptance of macho behavior , said christian pfeiffer , the director of the lower saxony research institute and one of the authors of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim devotion breeds macho behavior , says pfeiffer pfeiffer said that in their religion , and in the family at home , young muslim immigrants are frequently exposed to a more conservative world view and lay claim to a variety of male privileges .
the problem with imams in an effort to explain their results , the study 's authors draw on the findings of rauf ceylan , a religious education expert and himself of turkish extraction , who points to the number of non-german imams , or muslim priests , preaching and teaching in germany .
ceylan maintains that these foreign imams are generally only in germany temporarily , speak no german and have little contact with german culture .
most of them , he says , call for a return to a more conservative islam and retreat into the practitioner 's original ethnic culture .
for them , male dominance is normal and their teachings demand the same from muslim youths , ceylan says .
christian pfeiffer , from the kfn , also points out that the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maiziere wants to discuss the study 's results with muslim groups german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for the study 's results to be put on the agenda of the next islam conference .
different levels of integration the kfn study interviewed a total of 45,000 14-16 year-olds in 61 cities across germany between 2007 and 2008 .
of these , 10,000 had an immigrant background .
it found that the best adjusted and most integrated immigrants came from non-religious families .
more than 41 percent of these were looking to get a high school diploma , nearly 63 percent had german friends and 66 percent viewed themselves as german .
the figures among young muslims were strikingly different : only 16 percent were pursuing a high school diploma , 28 percent had german friends and about 22 percent considered themselves german .

known as mac , the 39-year-old would be the country 's youngest ever state premier . with christian wulff , the premier of lower saxony , likely to become germany 's next president , the state is in need of a new leader .
it did n't take long for his replacement to step into the spotlight .
on friday , christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- officials said david mcallister , a conservative politician with scottish family roots , had been unanimously nominated to take wulff 's seat once the current premier makes the expected move to the presidential palace in berlin .
wulff was nominated by chancellor angela merkel as the government 's candidate for president on thursday .
" i have confidence in myself for the office of state premier , otherwise i would n't put myself forward for election , " mcallister said after the nomination .
he said he planned to build on wulff 's successful work in the state , adding that wulff 's election as president would be " the culmination of a great political career . "
mcallister has long been seen as a premier-in-waiting in lower saxony , one of germany 's most populous states .
the 39-year-old , who has a scottish father and a german mother , would be the country 's youngest ever state premier .
known locally as mac , the politician is proud of his ancestry - he wore a kilt to his wedding .
he 's married with two daughters , jamie and mia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff -lrb- left -rrb- is merkel 's , and the government 's , nominee for the office of president ' future , not socialism ' mcallister and his two sisters spent their early years growing up in west berlin , where his father was stationed with the british army .
being surrounded by communism , as mcallister writes on his website , left its mark : his personal motto is " future , not socialism . "
as an 11-year-old , mcallister moved with his family to bad bederkesa , a small town near cuxhaven in northern germany , a place he and his family consider their " heimat im herzen " - their true home .
it was here in lower saxony that he began his political career , first as district chairman of the cdu youth organization from 1991 to 1994 , and then as mayor of bad bederkesa from 2001 to 2002 .
the election for germany 's next president is due to take place on june 30 , in a special assembly made up of the german parliament and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states . as the ruling coalition 's official choice , wulff stands a good chance of becoming president . until then , the current state premier plans to continue his duties in the state capital of hanover .

known as mac , the 39-year-old would be the country 's youngest ever state premier . with christian wulff , the premier of lower saxony , likely to become germany 's next president , the state is in need of a new leader .
it did n't take long for his replacement to step into the spotlight .
on friday , christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- officials said david mcallister , a conservative politician with scottish family roots , had been unanimously nominated to take wulff 's seat once the current premier makes the expected move to the presidential palace in berlin .
wulff was nominated by chancellor angela merkel as the government 's candidate for president on thursday .
" i have confidence in myself for the office of state premier , otherwise i would n't put myself forward for election , " mcallister said after the nomination .
he said he planned to build on wulff 's successful work in the state , adding that wulff 's election as president would be " the culmination of a great political career . "
mcallister has long been seen as a premier-in-waiting in lower saxony , one of germany 's most populous states .
the 39-year-old , who has a scottish father and a german mother , would be the country 's youngest ever state premier .
known locally as mac , the politician is proud of his ancestry - he wore a kilt to his wedding .
he 's married with two daughters , jamie and mia .

being surrounded by communism , as mcallister writes on his website , left its mark : his personal motto is " future , not socialism . "
as an 11-year-old , mcallister moved with his family to bad bederkesa , a small town near cuxhaven in northern germany , a place he and his family consider their " heimat im herzen " - their true home .
it was here in lower saxony that he began his political career , first as district chairman of the cdu youth organization from 1991 to 1994 , and then as mayor of bad bederkesa from 2001 to 2002 .
the election for germany 's next president is due to take place on june 30 , in a special assembly made up of the german parliament and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states . as the ruling coalition 's official choice , wulff stands a good chance of becoming president . until then , the current state premier plans to continue his duties in the state capital of hanover .

the study says the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught . the willingness to commit violent crimes grows among young muslim immigrants in germany the more religious they become , according to a joint survey by the german interior ministry and the institute for criminology research of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- .
by comparison , the study found that just the opposite was true for christian immigrants .
the willingness to commit violent crimes , such as armed robbery or assault and battery , among young catholics and protestants decreases with religious fervor , the kfn study revealed .
the study said the reason for this difference had to do with the very different image of masculinity .
muslim devotion promotes the acceptance of macho behavior , said christian pfeiffer , the director of the lower saxony research institute and one of the authors of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim devotion breeds macho behavior , says pfeiffer pfeiffer said that in their religion , and in the family at home , young muslim immigrants are frequently exposed to a more conservative world view and lay claim to a variety of male privileges .
the problem with imams in an effort to explain their results , the study 's authors draw on the findings of rauf ceylan , a religious education expert and himself of turkish extraction , who points to the number of non-german imams , or muslim priests , preaching and teaching in germany .
ceylan maintains that these foreign imams are generally only in germany temporarily , speak no german and have little contact with german culture .
most of them , he says , call for a return to a more conservative islam and retreat into the practitioner 's original ethnic culture .
for them , male dominance is normal and their teachings demand the same from muslim youths , ceylan says .
christian pfeiffer , from the kfn , also points out that the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maiziere wants to discuss the study 's results with muslim groups german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for the study 's results to be put on the agenda of the next islam conference .
different levels of integration the kfn study interviewed a total of 45,000 14-16 year-olds in 61 cities across germany between 2007 and 2008 .
of these , 10,000 had an immigrant background .
it found that the best adjusted and most integrated immigrants came from non-religious families .
more than 41 percent of these were looking to get a high school diploma , nearly 63 percent had german friends and 66 percent viewed themselves as german .
the figures among young muslims were strikingly different : only 16 percent were pursuing a high school diploma , 28 percent had german friends and about 22 percent considered themselves german .

"
sarkozy also said france was willing to participate in the inquiry . israeli officials said un secretary-general ban ki-moon also spoke with netanyahu to propose setting up a multinational commission to investigate what went wrong . following talks in paris , the foreign ministers of france and britain said an international inquiry was necessary to resolve the dispute .

eu monitors helped oversee the rafah land crossing point into gaza until 2007 , when the operation was suspended for security reasons . the jewish state has fiercely defended its boarding of the turkish aid ship last monday , insisting its commandos were attacked with weapons and opened fire in self-defense .

" israel is a democratic nation .
israel has the ability and the right to investigate itself , not to be investigated by any international board , " oren said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers from the irish aid ship were deported on sunday israel deports activists meanwhile , israel began deporting a group of 19 activists who were detained on saturday after trying to sail to gaza in defiance of israel 's three-year blockade .

the ship was carrying hundreds of tons of aid , including wheelchairs , medical supplies and cement . demonstrations across europe last monday 's raid by israel , which killed nine activists - eight of those killed were turkish , and the ninth had joint us-turkish nationality - triggered demonstrations across europe on saturday . protesters took to the streets in france , ireland , turkey , germany and the united kingdom , chanting anti-israeli slogans and demanding that the blockade be lifted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists around the world were outraged by israel 's actions in france , 20,000 people rallied in paris , nice , marseille and several other french cities , waving turkish and palestinian flags .

while it is still early in the morning , it is already hot and muggy on the indian ocean .
the young people are here to talk about the event that millions around the world are looking forward to , but which could also be very dangerous for them - the world cup .
bongiwe mthethwa , director of an organization called concerned young people in south africa , has been campaigning all over the country with her colleagues to raise awareness about human trafficking and forced prostitution .
they have held more than 1,000 talks at schools and other institutions to help pupils protect themselves from falling into the hands of people traffickers and other predators .
" be careful when someone offers you a drink , it could contain drugs , " bongiwe said , speaking in zulu to be sure the young people understand her .
young and vulnerable some abductions of young people have already been reported , bongiwe said , and traffickers have been taking photos of young girls who they want to offer to visitors during the world cup as prostitutes .

" it 's very , very high risk to have children in south africa during the world cup .
if we had a choice we would transfer them anywhere else but south africa . "
during these discussions about the potential dangers , 24-year-old mandisa is usually sitting in the first row .
she tells the horrific story of what happened to her in the hopes that others can avoid a similar fate .
she was abducted while walking in the street , confined in a house and forced into prostitution . " -lsb- my kidnapper -rsb- gave me drugs and i had no idea what was happening , " she says .

it 's rekindled the debate over possible legalization . a group of 15 pupils - mostly girls - is gathered in a small room this morning in durban , south africa 's third-largest city .
while it is still early in the morning , it is already hot and muggy on the indian ocean .
the young people are here to talk about the event that millions around the world are looking forward to , but which could also be very dangerous for them - the world cup .
bongiwe mthethwa , director of an organization called concerned young people in south africa , has been campaigning all over the country with her colleagues to raise awareness about human trafficking and forced prostitution .
they have held more than 1,000 talks at schools and other institutions to help pupils protect themselves from falling into the hands of people traffickers and other predators .
" be careful when someone offers you a drink , it could contain drugs , " bongiwe said , speaking in zulu to be sure the young people understand her .
young and vulnerable some abductions of young people have already been reported , bongiwe said , and traffickers have been taking photos of young girls who they want to offer to visitors during the world cup as prostitutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandisa was forced into prostitution but was able to flee her captors girls are particularly vulnerable , because they will not be at school during the matches , but out in the streets , which makes them targets , " she said .
" it 's very , very high risk to have children in south africa during the world cup .
if we had a choice we would transfer them anywhere else but south africa . "
during these discussions about the potential dangers , 24-year-old mandisa is usually sitting in the first row .
she tells the horrific story of what happened to her in the hopes that others can avoid a similar fate .
she was abducted while walking in the street , confined in a house and forced into prostitution . " -lsb- my kidnapper -rsb- gave me drugs and i had no idea what was happening , " she says .
" he locked me up in a room , tied my arms and legs and raped me .
after that he called his clients and i became a sex slave for him . "
mandisa was lucky , she managed to escape .
but south african authorities fear that many more girls like mandisa could be abducted in the next few weeks .
the estimate that up to 40.000 prostitutes will be working during the world cup - many of them against their will . exaggerated fears but lobby groups for prostitutes , like an organization called sweat in cape town , think these estimates are exaggerated .
" there was this prediction that 40,000 women would be trafficked during the world cup in germany , " said vivienne lalu , director of sweat .
" but research found only a handful , less than five actual examples of trafficked women .
i suspect we 'll have similar outcomes in south africa . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of sweat are fighting to legalize prostitution prostitution is still prohibited in south africa , and sex workers can be fined as well as imprisoned .
sweat advocates legalizing the world 's oldest profession , arguing that in addition to deterring potential traffickers , bringing it out of the shadows would make it easier to monitor prostitutes ' health , including their hiv status .
that 's especially important in south africa , home to 20 percent of hiv infections worldwide .
like durban , cape town is a port city and a center of the south african sex industry .
there are an estimated 1,200 prostitutes in cape town , ray is one of them .
she says she is a sex worker by choice , but admits the work is dangerous .
she is looking forward to the world cup because of the influx of potential customers , but she does worry .
" i 'm scared of police harassment that 's going be stepped up , " she says .
" and i 'll be competing with foreign sex workers . "
legalization debate while sex and soccer will quite likely go hand-in-hand during the world cup , the issue of legalization is not at all settled .
the controversial subject has sparked heated debates throughout the country .
" i do n't think we should condone such things , " said one woman in durban .
" i do n't agree with it but if they feel they are doing what they have to do to earn a living , who are we to question that ? " said another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are thrilled with the world cup , but the event holds dangers for them as well legal or not , ray does n't plan on changing her job anytime soon .
in fact , she still hopes the world cup will be her big chance .
" i look forward to the world cup .
i want to make a friend and maybe i 'll go overseas and make even more money , " she said . despite their efforts , lobbyists from sweat fear they wo n't get much support from the government for their campaign to legalize prostitution to help prevent hiv infections .
many non-profit groups have complained that south africa should use this global even to step up its fight against hiv / aids .
but many say they are being blocked along the way .
this week , south african aids organizations accused football 's governing body fifa of blocking access to condoms and hiv education materials at world cup stadiums and fan parks .
" to date fifa has not permitted any civil society organization to distribute hiv or health-related information , " said the aids consortium , the southern african hiv clinicians society and several other organisations in a statement .
they are not encouraged by south african president jacob zuma , who was charged with rape in 2006 .
although he denied the charge , he did admit to having consensual sex with an hiv-positive woman .
then he declared in court that he had taken a shower to prevent hiv infection , angering many aids educators .

young and vulnerable some abductions of young people have already been reported , bongiwe said , and traffickers have been taking photos of young girls who they want to offer to visitors during the world cup as prostitutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandisa was forced into prostitution but was able to flee her captors girls are particularly vulnerable , because they will not be at school during the matches , but out in the streets , which makes them targets , " she said .
" it 's very , very high risk to have children in south africa during the world cup .
if we had a choice we would transfer them anywhere else but south africa . "
during these discussions about the potential dangers , 24-year-old mandisa is usually sitting in the first row .
she tells the horrific story of what happened to her in the hopes that others can avoid a similar fate .
she was abducted while walking in the street , confined in a house and forced into prostitution . " -lsb- my kidnapper -rsb- gave me drugs and i had no idea what was happening , " she says .
" he locked me up in a room , tied my arms and legs and raped me .
after that he called his clients and i became a sex slave for him . "
mandisa was lucky , she managed to escape .
but south african authorities fear that many more girls like mandisa could be abducted in the next few weeks .
the estimate that up to 40.000 prostitutes will be working during the world cup - many of them against their will . exaggerated fears but lobby groups for prostitutes , like an organization called sweat in cape town , think these estimates are exaggerated .
" there was this prediction that 40,000 women would be trafficked during the world cup in germany , " said vivienne lalu , director of sweat .
" but research found only a handful , less than five actual examples of trafficked women .
i suspect we 'll have similar outcomes in south africa . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of sweat are fighting to legalize prostitution prostitution is still prohibited in south africa , and sex workers can be fined as well as imprisoned .
sweat advocates legalizing the world 's oldest profession , arguing that in addition to deterring potential traffickers , bringing it out of the shadows would make it easier to monitor prostitutes ' health , including their hiv status .
that 's especially important in south africa , home to 20 percent of hiv infections worldwide .
like durban , cape town is a port city and a center of the south african sex industry .
there are an estimated 1,200 prostitutes in cape town , ray is one of them .
she says she is a sex worker by choice , but admits the work is dangerous .
she is looking forward to the world cup because of the influx of potential customers , but she does worry .
" i 'm scared of police harassment that 's going be stepped up , " she says .
" and i 'll be competing with foreign sex workers . "
legalization debate while sex and soccer will quite likely go hand-in-hand during the world cup , the issue of legalization is not at all settled .
the controversial subject has sparked heated debates throughout the country .
" i do n't think we should condone such things , " said one woman in durban .
" i do n't agree with it but if they feel they are doing what they have to do to earn a living , who are we to question that ? " said another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are thrilled with the world cup , but the event holds dangers for them as well legal or not , ray does n't plan on changing her job anytime soon .
in fact , she still hopes the world cup will be her big chance .
" i look forward to the world cup .
i want to make a friend and maybe i 'll go overseas and make even more money , " she said . despite their efforts , lobbyists from sweat fear they wo n't get much support from the government for their campaign to legalize prostitution to help prevent hiv infections .
many non-profit groups have complained that south africa should use this global even to step up its fight against hiv / aids .
but many say they are being blocked along the way .
this week , south african aids organizations accused football 's governing body fifa of blocking access to condoms and hiv education materials at world cup stadiums and fan parks .
" to date fifa has not permitted any civil society organization to distribute hiv or health-related information , " said the aids consortium , the southern african hiv clinicians society and several other organisations in a statement .
they are not encouraged by south african president jacob zuma , who was charged with rape in 2006 .
although he denied the charge , he did admit to having consensual sex with an hiv-positive woman .
then he declared in court that he had taken a shower to prevent hiv infection , angering many aids educators .

"
sarkozy also said france was willing to participate in the inquiry . israeli officials said un secretary-general ban ki-moon also spoke with netanyahu to propose setting up a multinational commission to investigate what went wrong . following talks in paris , the foreign ministers of france and britain said an international inquiry was necessary to resolve the dispute .

wulff was nominated by chancellor angela merkel as the government 's candidate for president on thursday .
" i have confidence in myself for the office of state premier , otherwise i would n't put myself forward for election , " mcallister said after the nomination .
he said he planned to build on wulff 's successful work in the state , adding that wulff 's election as president would be " the culmination of a great political career . "

he said he planned to build on wulff 's successful work in the state , adding that wulff 's election as president would be " the culmination of a great political career . "
mcallister has long been seen as a premier-in-waiting in lower saxony , one of germany 's most populous states .
the 39-year-old , who has a scottish father and a german mother , would be the country 's youngest ever state premier .
known locally as mac , the politician is proud of his ancestry - he wore a kilt to his wedding .
he 's married with two daughters , jamie and mia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff -lrb- left -rrb- is merkel 's , and the government 's , nominee for the office of president ' future , not socialism ' mcallister and his two sisters spent their early years growing up in west berlin , where his father was stationed with the british army .
being surrounded by communism , as mcallister writes on his website , left its mark : his personal motto is " future , not socialism . "
as an 11-year-old , mcallister moved with his family to bad bederkesa , a small town near cuxhaven in northern germany , a place he and his family consider their " heimat im herzen " - their true home .
it was here in lower saxony that he began his political career , first as district chairman of the cdu youth organization from 1991 to 1994 , and then as mayor of bad bederkesa from 2001 to 2002 .
the election for germany 's next president is due to take place on june 30 , in a special assembly made up of the german parliament and an equal number of representatives from the 16 federal states . as the ruling coalition 's official choice , wulff stands a good chance of becoming president . until then , the current state premier plans to continue his duties in the state capital of hanover .

the study says the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught . the willingness to commit violent crimes grows among young muslim immigrants in germany the more religious they become , according to a joint survey by the german interior ministry and the institute for criminology research of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- .
by comparison , the study found that just the opposite was true for christian immigrants .
the willingness to commit violent crimes , such as armed robbery or assault and battery , among young catholics and protestants decreases with religious fervor , the kfn study revealed .
the study said the reason for this difference had to do with the very different image of masculinity .
muslim devotion promotes the acceptance of macho behavior , said christian pfeiffer , the director of the lower saxony research institute and one of the authors of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim devotion breeds macho behavior , says pfeiffer pfeiffer said that in their religion , and in the family at home , young muslim immigrants are frequently exposed to a more conservative world view and lay claim to a variety of male privileges .
the problem with imams in an effort to explain their results , the study 's authors draw on the findings of rauf ceylan , a religious education expert and himself of turkish extraction , who points to the number of non-german imams , or muslim priests , preaching and teaching in germany .
ceylan maintains that these foreign imams are generally only in germany temporarily , speak no german and have little contact with german culture .
most of them , he says , call for a return to a more conservative islam and retreat into the practitioner 's original ethnic culture .
for them , male dominance is normal and their teachings demand the same from muslim youths , ceylan says .
christian pfeiffer , from the kfn , also points out that the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maiziere wants to discuss the study 's results with muslim groups german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for the study 's results to be put on the agenda of the next islam conference .
different levels of integration the kfn study interviewed a total of 45,000 14-16 year-olds in 61 cities across germany between 2007 and 2008 .
of these , 10,000 had an immigrant background .
it found that the best adjusted and most integrated immigrants came from non-religious families .
more than 41 percent of these were looking to get a high school diploma , nearly 63 percent had german friends and 66 percent viewed themselves as german .
the figures among young muslims were strikingly different : only 16 percent were pursuing a high school diploma , 28 percent had german friends and about 22 percent considered themselves german .

the study says the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught . the willingness to commit violent crimes grows among young muslim immigrants in germany the more religious they become , according to a joint survey by the german interior ministry and the institute for criminology research of lower saxony -lrb- kfn -rrb- .
by comparison , the study found that just the opposite was true for christian immigrants .
the willingness to commit violent crimes , such as armed robbery or assault and battery , among young catholics and protestants decreases with religious fervor , the kfn study revealed .
the study said the reason for this difference had to do with the very different image of masculinity .
muslim devotion promotes the acceptance of macho behavior , said christian pfeiffer , the director of the lower saxony research institute and one of the authors of the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim devotion breeds macho behavior , says pfeiffer pfeiffer said that in their religion , and in the family at home , young muslim immigrants are frequently exposed to a more conservative world view and lay claim to a variety of male privileges .
the problem with imams in an effort to explain their results , the study 's authors draw on the findings of rauf ceylan , a religious education expert and himself of turkish extraction , who points to the number of non-german imams , or muslim priests , preaching and teaching in germany .
ceylan maintains that these foreign imams are generally only in germany temporarily , speak no german and have little contact with german culture .
most of them , he says , call for a return to a more conservative islam and retreat into the practitioner 's original ethnic culture .
for them , male dominance is normal and their teachings demand the same from muslim youths , ceylan says .
christian pfeiffer , from the kfn , also points out that the phenomenon is not due to islam itself , but to the way it is taught .

the pontiff prayed for the success of a synod of middle eastern bishops in rome in october , which is set to grapple with the problems of the region .
calling the latest tensions between israel and palestinians " a grave matter , " benedict said he hoped the meeting would " help focus the attention of the international community " on the conflict in the region and the " plight of christians in the middle east who suffer for their beliefs . "
vatican paper focuses on mideast following the outdoor service , the pope unveiled a working paper for the synod .
called " instrumentum laboris , " it expresses concern about radical islam .
" these extremist currents , clearly a threat to everyone - christians , jews and muslims - require joint action , " the document states .
the working paper laments the dwindling numbers of already minority christians in the middle east .
" their disappearance would impoverish the pluralism which has always characterized the countries of the middle east and those countries would be at a disadvantage without the christian voice , " it said .
the 40-page paper also says that the unresolved israeli-palestinian conflict contributed to the political , economic and religious tensions in the region .
the vatican backs a palestinian homeland alongside israel 's right to exist within internationally recognized borders .

it 's rekindled the debate over possible legalization . a group of 15 pupils - mostly girls - is gathered in a small room this morning in durban , south africa 's third-largest city .
while it is still early in the morning , it is already hot and muggy on the indian ocean .
the young people are here to talk about the event that millions around the world are looking forward to , but which could also be very dangerous for them - the world cup .
bongiwe mthethwa , director of an organization called concerned young people in south africa , has been campaigning all over the country with her colleagues to raise awareness about human trafficking and forced prostitution .
they have held more than 1,000 talks at schools and other institutions to help pupils protect themselves from falling into the hands of people traffickers and other predators .
" be careful when someone offers you a drink , it could contain drugs , " bongiwe said , speaking in zulu to be sure the young people understand her .
young and vulnerable some abductions of young people have already been reported , bongiwe said , and traffickers have been taking photos of young girls who they want to offer to visitors during the world cup as prostitutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandisa was forced into prostitution but was able to flee her captors girls are particularly vulnerable , because they will not be at school during the matches , but out in the streets , which makes them targets , " she said .
" it 's very , very high risk to have children in south africa during the world cup .
if we had a choice we would transfer them anywhere else but south africa . "
during these discussions about the potential dangers , 24-year-old mandisa is usually sitting in the first row .
she tells the horrific story of what happened to her in the hopes that others can avoid a similar fate .
she was abducted while walking in the street , confined in a house and forced into prostitution . " -lsb- my kidnapper -rsb- gave me drugs and i had no idea what was happening , " she says .
" he locked me up in a room , tied my arms and legs and raped me .
after that he called his clients and i became a sex slave for him . "
mandisa was lucky , she managed to escape .
but south african authorities fear that many more girls like mandisa could be abducted in the next few weeks .
the estimate that up to 40.000 prostitutes will be working during the world cup - many of them against their will . exaggerated fears but lobby groups for prostitutes , like an organization called sweat in cape town , think these estimates are exaggerated .
" there was this prediction that 40,000 women would be trafficked during the world cup in germany , " said vivienne lalu , director of sweat .
" but research found only a handful , less than five actual examples of trafficked women .
i suspect we 'll have similar outcomes in south africa . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of sweat are fighting to legalize prostitution prostitution is still prohibited in south africa , and sex workers can be fined as well as imprisoned .
sweat advocates legalizing the world 's oldest profession , arguing that in addition to deterring potential traffickers , bringing it out of the shadows would make it easier to monitor prostitutes ' health , including their hiv status .
that 's especially important in south africa , home to 20 percent of hiv infections worldwide .
like durban , cape town is a port city and a center of the south african sex industry .
there are an estimated 1,200 prostitutes in cape town , ray is one of them .
she says she is a sex worker by choice , but admits the work is dangerous .
she is looking forward to the world cup because of the influx of potential customers , but she does worry .
" i 'm scared of police harassment that 's going be stepped up , " she says .
" and i 'll be competing with foreign sex workers . "
legalization debate while sex and soccer will quite likely go hand-in-hand during the world cup , the issue of legalization is not at all settled .
the controversial subject has sparked heated debates throughout the country .
" i do n't think we should condone such things , " said one woman in durban .
" i do n't agree with it but if they feel they are doing what they have to do to earn a living , who are we to question that ? " said another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are thrilled with the world cup , but the event holds dangers for them as well legal or not , ray does n't plan on changing her job anytime soon .
in fact , she still hopes the world cup will be her big chance .
" i look forward to the world cup .
i want to make a friend and maybe i 'll go overseas and make even more money , " she said . despite their efforts , lobbyists from sweat fear they wo n't get much support from the government for their campaign to legalize prostitution to help prevent hiv infections .
many non-profit groups have complained that south africa should use this global even to step up its fight against hiv / aids .
but many say they are being blocked along the way .
this week , south african aids organizations accused football 's governing body fifa of blocking access to condoms and hiv education materials at world cup stadiums and fan parks .
" to date fifa has not permitted any civil society organization to distribute hiv or health-related information , " said the aids consortium , the southern african hiv clinicians society and several other organisations in a statement .
they are not encouraged by south african president jacob zuma , who was charged with rape in 2006 .
although he denied the charge , he did admit to having consensual sex with an hiv-positive woman .
then he declared in court that he had taken a shower to prevent hiv infection , angering many aids educators .

it 's rekindled the debate over possible legalization . a group of 15 pupils - mostly girls - is gathered in a small room this morning in durban , south africa 's third-largest city .
while it is still early in the morning , it is already hot and muggy on the indian ocean .
the young people are here to talk about the event that millions around the world are looking forward to , but which could also be very dangerous for them - the world cup .
bongiwe mthethwa , director of an organization called concerned young people in south africa , has been campaigning all over the country with her colleagues to raise awareness about human trafficking and forced prostitution .
they have held more than 1,000 talks at schools and other institutions to help pupils protect themselves from falling into the hands of people traffickers and other predators .
" be careful when someone offers you a drink , it could contain drugs , " bongiwe said , speaking in zulu to be sure the young people understand her .
young and vulnerable some abductions of young people have already been reported , bongiwe said , and traffickers have been taking photos of young girls who they want to offer to visitors during the world cup as prostitutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandisa was forced into prostitution but was able to flee her captors girls are particularly vulnerable , because they will not be at school during the matches , but out in the streets , which makes them targets , " she said .
" it 's very , very high risk to have children in south africa during the world cup .
if we had a choice we would transfer them anywhere else but south africa . "
during these discussions about the potential dangers , 24-year-old mandisa is usually sitting in the first row .
she tells the horrific story of what happened to her in the hopes that others can avoid a similar fate .
she was abducted while walking in the street , confined in a house and forced into prostitution . " -lsb- my kidnapper -rsb- gave me drugs and i had no idea what was happening , " she says .
" he locked me up in a room , tied my arms and legs and raped me .
after that he called his clients and i became a sex slave for him . "
mandisa was lucky , she managed to escape .
but south african authorities fear that many more girls like mandisa could be abducted in the next few weeks .
the estimate that up to 40.000 prostitutes will be working during the world cup - many of them against their will . exaggerated fears but lobby groups for prostitutes , like an organization called sweat in cape town , think these estimates are exaggerated .
" there was this prediction that 40,000 women would be trafficked during the world cup in germany , " said vivienne lalu , director of sweat .
" but research found only a handful , less than five actual examples of trafficked women .
i suspect we 'll have similar outcomes in south africa . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of sweat are fighting to legalize prostitution prostitution is still prohibited in south africa , and sex workers can be fined as well as imprisoned .
sweat advocates legalizing the world 's oldest profession , arguing that in addition to deterring potential traffickers , bringing it out of the shadows would make it easier to monitor prostitutes ' health , including their hiv status .
that 's especially important in south africa , home to 20 percent of hiv infections worldwide .
like durban , cape town is a port city and a center of the south african sex industry .
there are an estimated 1,200 prostitutes in cape town , ray is one of them .
she says she is a sex worker by choice , but admits the work is dangerous .
she is looking forward to the world cup because of the influx of potential customers , but she does worry .
" i 'm scared of police harassment that 's going be stepped up , " she says .
" and i 'll be competing with foreign sex workers . "
legalization debate while sex and soccer will quite likely go hand-in-hand during the world cup , the issue of legalization is not at all settled .
the controversial subject has sparked heated debates throughout the country .
" i do n't think we should condone such things , " said one woman in durban .
" i do n't agree with it but if they feel they are doing what they have to do to earn a living , who are we to question that ? " said another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are thrilled with the world cup , but the event holds dangers for them as well legal or not , ray does n't plan on changing her job anytime soon .
in fact , she still hopes the world cup will be her big chance .
" i look forward to the world cup .
i want to make a friend and maybe i 'll go overseas and make even more money , " she said . despite their efforts , lobbyists from sweat fear they wo n't get much support from the government for their campaign to legalize prostitution to help prevent hiv infections .
many non-profit groups have complained that south africa should use this global even to step up its fight against hiv / aids .
but many say they are being blocked along the way .
this week , south african aids organizations accused football 's governing body fifa of blocking access to condoms and hiv education materials at world cup stadiums and fan parks .
" to date fifa has not permitted any civil society organization to distribute hiv or health-related information , " said the aids consortium , the southern african hiv clinicians society and several other organisations in a statement .
they are not encouraged by south african president jacob zuma , who was charged with rape in 2006 .
although he denied the charge , he did admit to having consensual sex with an hiv-positive woman .
then he declared in court that he had taken a shower to prevent hiv infection , angering many aids educators .

"
sarkozy also said france was willing to participate in the inquiry . israeli officials said un secretary-general ban ki-moon also spoke with netanyahu to propose setting up a multinational commission to investigate what went wrong . following talks in paris , the foreign ministers of france and britain said an international inquiry was necessary to resolve the dispute . " we think it is very important that there is a credible and transparent investigation , " said british foreign secretary william hague . " we believe there should be an international presence at minimum in that inquiry or investigation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel insists its commandos were attacked and fired in self-defense his french counterpart bernard kouchner also proposed that the european union help check the cargo on ships bound for the gaza strip and take charge of the rafah border crossing into palestinian territory .
eu monitors helped oversee the rafah land crossing point into gaza until 2007 , when the operation was suspended for security reasons . the jewish state has fiercely defended its boarding of the turkish aid ship last monday , insisting its commandos were attacked with weapons and opened fire in self-defense .
but activists on the ship said troops shot at them without provocation . israeli ambassador rejects international probe israel has faced an international outcry over the incident , which has also strained relations with turkey .
but michael oren , israel 's ambassador to the united states , on sunday dismissed the proposal for an international probe . " we are rejecting an international commission .
we are discussing with the obama administration a way in which our inquiry will take place , " oren said on the fox news sunday television program . he said israel would not apologize for the incident .
" israel is a democratic nation .
israel has the ability and the right to investigate itself , not to be investigated by any international board , " oren said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers from the irish aid ship were deported on sunday israel deports activists meanwhile , israel began deporting a group of 19 activists who were detained on saturday after trying to sail to gaza in defiance of israel 's three-year blockade .

it 's rekindled the debate over possible legalization . a group of 15 pupils - mostly girls - is gathered in a small room this morning in durban , south africa 's third-largest city .
while it is still early in the morning , it is already hot and muggy on the indian ocean .
the young people are here to talk about the event that millions around the world are looking forward to , but which could also be very dangerous for them - the world cup .
bongiwe mthethwa , director of an organization called concerned young people in south africa , has been campaigning all over the country with her colleagues to raise awareness about human trafficking and forced prostitution .
they have held more than 1,000 talks at schools and other institutions to help pupils protect themselves from falling into the hands of people traffickers and other predators .
" be careful when someone offers you a drink , it could contain drugs , " bongiwe said , speaking in zulu to be sure the young people understand her .
young and vulnerable some abductions of young people have already been reported , bongiwe said , and traffickers have been taking photos of young girls who they want to offer to visitors during the world cup as prostitutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandisa was forced into prostitution but was able to flee her captors girls are particularly vulnerable , because they will not be at school during the matches , but out in the streets , which makes them targets , " she said .
" it 's very , very high risk to have children in south africa during the world cup .
if we had a choice we would transfer them anywhere else but south africa . "
during these discussions about the potential dangers , 24-year-old mandisa is usually sitting in the first row .
she tells the horrific story of what happened to her in the hopes that others can avoid a similar fate .
she was abducted while walking in the street , confined in a house and forced into prostitution . " -lsb- my kidnapper -rsb- gave me drugs and i had no idea what was happening , " she says .
" he locked me up in a room , tied my arms and legs and raped me .
after that he called his clients and i became a sex slave for him . "
mandisa was lucky , she managed to escape .
but south african authorities fear that many more girls like mandisa could be abducted in the next few weeks .
the estimate that up to 40.000 prostitutes will be working during the world cup - many of them against their will . exaggerated fears but lobby groups for prostitutes , like an organization called sweat in cape town , think these estimates are exaggerated .
" there was this prediction that 40,000 women would be trafficked during the world cup in germany , " said vivienne lalu , director of sweat .
" but research found only a handful , less than five actual examples of trafficked women .
i suspect we 'll have similar outcomes in south africa . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of sweat are fighting to legalize prostitution prostitution is still prohibited in south africa , and sex workers can be fined as well as imprisoned .
sweat advocates legalizing the world 's oldest profession , arguing that in addition to deterring potential traffickers , bringing it out of the shadows would make it easier to monitor prostitutes ' health , including their hiv status .
that 's especially important in south africa , home to 20 percent of hiv infections worldwide .
like durban , cape town is a port city and a center of the south african sex industry .
there are an estimated 1,200 prostitutes in cape town , ray is one of them .
she says she is a sex worker by choice , but admits the work is dangerous .
she is looking forward to the world cup because of the influx of potential customers , but she does worry .
" i 'm scared of police harassment that 's going be stepped up , " she says .
" and i 'll be competing with foreign sex workers . "
legalization debate while sex and soccer will quite likely go hand-in-hand during the world cup , the issue of legalization is not at all settled .
the controversial subject has sparked heated debates throughout the country .
" i do n't think we should condone such things , " said one woman in durban .
" i do n't agree with it but if they feel they are doing what they have to do to earn a living , who are we to question that ? " said another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are thrilled with the world cup , but the event holds dangers for them as well legal or not , ray does n't plan on changing her job anytime soon .
in fact , she still hopes the world cup will be her big chance .
" i look forward to the world cup .
i want to make a friend and maybe i 'll go overseas and make even more money , " she said . despite their efforts , lobbyists from sweat fear they wo n't get much support from the government for their campaign to legalize prostitution to help prevent hiv infections .
many non-profit groups have complained that south africa should use this global even to step up its fight against hiv / aids .
but many say they are being blocked along the way .
this week , south african aids organizations accused football 's governing body fifa of blocking access to condoms and hiv education materials at world cup stadiums and fan parks .
" to date fifa has not permitted any civil society organization to distribute hiv or health-related information , " said the aids consortium , the southern african hiv clinicians society and several other organisations in a statement .
they are not encouraged by south african president jacob zuma , who was charged with rape in 2006 .
although he denied the charge , he did admit to having consensual sex with an hiv-positive woman .
then he declared in court that he had taken a shower to prevent hiv infection , angering many aids educators .
