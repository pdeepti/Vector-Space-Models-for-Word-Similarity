the win takes hamburg to 48 points , just three behind fifth placed werder bremen and a place in next season 's europa league .
hamburg could also guarantee themselves a spot in the tournament next year if they win it this time around .
they play london club fulham in the semi-finals on april 22 and 29 .
hamburg , without striker paolo guerrero who began a five-match suspension for throwing a plastic bottle at a fan after last week 's goalless draw with hanover , went ahead in the 18th minute when midfielder robert tesche headed in from a corner for his first league goal of the season .
bochum equalized just after the half hour mark , when joel epalle headed into the path of slovenian international forward zlatko dedic , who volleyed in from 20 meters .
the visitors sealed the victory in the 88th minute when bochum substitute andreas johansson turned the ball into his own net under pressure from ruud van nistelrooy .
bochum , who extended their winless run to eight league games , are 15th with 28 points , one point and one place above hanover who are in the relegation playoff spot .

dzeko became the bundesliga 's top scorer with 19 goals .
twelve minutes later , makoto hasebe was given too much space on the right and delivered a pinpoint pass for grafite to head in at the far post for his 10th goal of the season. nrt / reuters / dpa editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as the debate over the issue heats up in germany . members of the opposition social democrats and the green party in germany have urged chancellor angela merkel to agree to accommodate some prisoners due for release from the controversial us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba , during her upcoming visit to the united states .
her visit comes at a time when her cabinet has been debating whether germany should accept released guantanamo inmates .
the topic is expected to figure during the chancellor 's meeting with president obama . the deputy parliamentary floor leader of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that " germany should not leave the american president alone " in this matter .
" if chancellor angela merkel goes to washington empty-handed , it would be a personal affront to the us president , " greens leader claudia roth told the newspaper .
the federal government " should not bow to the wishes of the hard-liners ” in merkel 's christian democratic union and leave obama out on a limb where the guantanamo prisoners issue is concerned , she said . the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , are divided over the issue .
cdu interior minister thomas de maizière has called for a serious examination of the matter while states headed by the cdu and the csu have said they will not accept any prisoners .
growing debate the debate over the guantanamo prisoner issue intensified in recent weeks after it emerged that berlin resumed talks with washington over the possibility of accommodating released prisoners .
the german news magazine der spiegel reported last month that a delegation from berlin visited guantanamo recently to meet with several inmates , including a palestinian , a jordanian and a syrian who are likely candidates for resettlement .
the report also said that the inmates had been interviewed by german intelligence and police officials to determine their suitability and whether they would pose any risks if they were taken in .
president obama had pledged to close down the guantanamo camp by january this year , but some 200 detainees continue to be held there because finding them new homes is proving a major challenge .
his administration has been reluctant to send released prisoners back to their home countries because of fears for their safety .
amnesty criticizes germany meanwhile , the head of the german branch of human rights watchdog amnesty international , monika lueke , has criticized germany 's response to obama 's call for europe to accept freed guantanamo prisoners .
" german stands almost at the bottom of the list in europe where accepting guantanamo prisoners is concerned , " lueke said .
she added that other european countries have clearly understood that they " make a substantial contribution to increasing their own security " by accepting freed inmates .
the continued existence of the guantanamo camp provided " food for further terrorism , " she added. rb / apn / epd editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de berlin proposal to accept guantanamo detainees meets resistance berlin has confirmed it is considering taking in former guantanamo bay prisoners , but the proposal has met with stiff opposition from some german state leaders , who say the ex-detainees could pose a security threat .

interest rates are to be set at 5.1 percent , significantly lower than the 7.5 percent markets have been offering .
sources said the deal was almost a " carbon copy " of imf terms .
jean-claude juncker , who heads the eurogroup , and european monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn are scheduled to announce details of the plan on sunday .
" there will be a teleconference on sunday on greece in the usual eurogroup composition , " guy schuller , a spokesman for juncker , said .
" greece has not asked for help , but you have to be ready if they do " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner says the euro will survive greek debt crisis loaded gun greek prime minister george papandreou told to vima newspaper that athens may be forced to use the financial rescue package to tackle its 300-billion debt if markets remain skeptical as speculation mounts that greece could default .
papandrreou said that with the terms now set the gun on the table will be loaded .
speculators will know this , he added .
" the question remains whether this mechanism will convince markets just as a gun on the table .
if it does not convince them , it is a mechanism that is there to be used , " papandreou said .
papandreou has vowed that greece had no plans of leaving the euro-zone .
" the euro is not to blame for our problems .
greece belongs in the euro-zone .
any other scenario is ridiculous , " he said .
spanish foreign minister angel moratinos , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , was optimistic : " i am quite optimistic that we are again able to show solidarity and above all send a message to the speculators that the euro-zone is strong and firm . "
eu leaders last month agreed to a bailout plan for greece as a last resort , with the eu providing much of the funding through direct loans and the imf also providing assistance . nrt / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

interest rates are to be set at 5.1 percent , significantly lower than the 7.5 percent markets have been offering .
sources said the deal was almost a " carbon copy " of imf terms .
jean-claude juncker , who heads the eurogroup , and european monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn are scheduled to announce details of the plan on sunday .
" there will be a teleconference on sunday on greece in the usual eurogroup composition , " guy schuller , a spokesman for juncker , said .
" greece has not asked for help , but you have to be ready if they do " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner says the euro will survive greek debt crisis loaded gun greek prime minister george papandreou told to vima newspaper that athens may be forced to use the financial rescue package to tackle its 300-billion debt if markets remain skeptical as speculation mounts that greece could default .
papandrreou said that with the terms now set the gun on the table will be loaded .
speculators will know this , he added .
" the question remains whether this mechanism will convince markets just as a gun on the table .
if it does not convince them , it is a mechanism that is there to be used , " papandreou said .
papandreou has vowed that greece had no plans of leaving the euro-zone .
" the euro is not to blame for our problems .
greece belongs in the euro-zone .
any other scenario is ridiculous , " he said .
spanish foreign minister angel moratinos , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , was optimistic : " i am quite optimistic that we are again able to show solidarity and above all send a message to the speculators that the euro-zone is strong and firm . "
eu leaders last month agreed to a bailout plan for greece as a last resort , with the eu providing much of the funding through direct loans and the imf also providing assistance . nrt / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as the debate over the issue heats up in germany . members of the opposition social democrats and the green party in germany have urged chancellor angela merkel to agree to accommodate some prisoners due for release from the controversial us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba , during her upcoming visit to the united states .
her visit comes at a time when her cabinet has been debating whether germany should accept released guantanamo inmates .
the topic is expected to figure during the chancellor 's meeting with president obama . the deputy parliamentary floor leader of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that " germany should not leave the american president alone " in this matter .
" if chancellor angela merkel goes to washington empty-handed , it would be a personal affront to the us president , " greens leader claudia roth told the newspaper .
the federal government " should not bow to the wishes of the hard-liners ” in merkel 's christian democratic union and leave obama out on a limb where the guantanamo prisoners issue is concerned , she said . the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , are divided over the issue .
cdu interior minister thomas de maizière has called for a serious examination of the matter while states headed by the cdu and the csu have said they will not accept any prisoners .
growing debate the debate over the guantanamo prisoner issue intensified in recent weeks after it emerged that berlin resumed talks with washington over the possibility of accommodating released prisoners .
the german news magazine der spiegel reported last month that a delegation from berlin visited guantanamo recently to meet with several inmates , including a palestinian , a jordanian and a syrian who are likely candidates for resettlement .
the report also said that the inmates had been interviewed by german intelligence and police officials to determine their suitability and whether they would pose any risks if they were taken in .
president obama had pledged to close down the guantanamo camp by january this year , but some 200 detainees continue to be held there because finding them new homes is proving a major challenge .
his administration has been reluctant to send released prisoners back to their home countries because of fears for their safety .
amnesty criticizes germany meanwhile , the head of the german branch of human rights watchdog amnesty international , monika lueke , has criticized germany 's response to obama 's call for europe to accept freed guantanamo prisoners .
" german stands almost at the bottom of the list in europe where accepting guantanamo prisoners is concerned , " lueke said .
she added that other european countries have clearly understood that they " make a substantial contribution to increasing their own security " by accepting freed inmates .
the continued existence of the guantanamo camp provided " food for further terrorism , " she added. rb / apn / epd editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de berlin proposal to accept guantanamo detainees meets resistance berlin has confirmed it is considering taking in former guantanamo bay prisoners , but the proposal has met with stiff opposition from some german state leaders , who say the ex-detainees could pose a security threat .

the far-right jobbik party could come in second place . the political map of hungary is poised to be completely redrawn as the center-right opposition fidesz party is widely expected to trounce the socialists on sunday in national general elections .
fidesz holds almost 30 percent lead over the ruling socialists , according to recent opinion polls .
fidesz party leader viktor orban has called the election a " moment of truth " and drawn comparisons with historical revolutions and the end of communism in 1990 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidesz chief viktor orban with wife aniko levai his party has long held a lead in the opinion polls , with recent polls indicating fidesz has a 60 percent approval rating among decided voters .
support for the socialist party has been at rock bottom since shortly after re-election in 2006 and the leaking of a speech in which former prime minister ferenc gyurcsany acknowledged the party had lied to the public .
the woes of the hungarian left have since been compounded by a series of high-profile corruption scandals involving socialist politicians - not to mention hungary 's being hit especially hard by the economic crisis and a 25-billion-dollar international bail-out that eventually led gyurcsany to resign .
if fidesz wins two-thirds of the seats in parliament , it could give the party a platform for broad structural reform .
fidesz has promised to create one million jobs over 10 years , boost lending , support small business and slash taxes .
those promises have resonated with voters , who are looking to the party to improve their living standards .
far-right surge far-right nationalist party jobbik is also set to do well , polling between 8 and 11 percent .
it will likely get enough support to enter parliament for the first time and could even beat the socialists in the voting booth , becoming the second-biggest party in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabor vona is jobbik 's prime ministerial candidate founded in 2003 , jobbik uses strong anti-roma and anti-semitic rhetoric .
it has capitalized on public anger over job losses and corruption and has built on resentment towards the large roma minority , which it blames for many of the country 's ills .
in 2007 , jobbik established the hungarian guard , which dresses in uniforms resembling those worn by the country 's pre-world war ii fascists .
" i will be wearing my hungarian guard tunic when i enter on the first day of parliament , " party leader gabor vona told supporters in budapest .
fidesz has said it will not enter into a coalition with the jobbik party , no matter the result of the election .

a second round of voting , on april 25 , will finalize those constituencies and lists where no candidate won an absolute majority or voting was inconclusive due to low turnout in the first round .
in order to enter parliament a party must poll at least five percent of the national vote .
the poll was expected to close at 1700 gmt , but the national election committee said many polling stations would stay open longer because voters were still waiting to cast ballots in several places. cb / dpa / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the far-right jobbik party could come in second place . the political map of hungary is poised to be completely redrawn as the center-right opposition fidesz party is widely expected to trounce the socialists on sunday in national general elections .
fidesz holds almost 30 percent lead over the ruling socialists , according to recent opinion polls .
fidesz party leader viktor orban has called the election a " moment of truth " and drawn comparisons with historical revolutions and the end of communism in 1990 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidesz chief viktor orban with wife aniko levai his party has long held a lead in the opinion polls , with recent polls indicating fidesz has a 60 percent approval rating among decided voters .
support for the socialist party has been at rock bottom since shortly after re-election in 2006 and the leaking of a speech in which former prime minister ferenc gyurcsany acknowledged the party had lied to the public .
the woes of the hungarian left have since been compounded by a series of high-profile corruption scandals involving socialist politicians - not to mention hungary 's being hit especially hard by the economic crisis and a 25-billion-dollar international bail-out that eventually led gyurcsany to resign .
if fidesz wins two-thirds of the seats in parliament , it could give the party a platform for broad structural reform .
fidesz has promised to create one million jobs over 10 years , boost lending , support small business and slash taxes .
those promises have resonated with voters , who are looking to the party to improve their living standards .
far-right surge far-right nationalist party jobbik is also set to do well , polling between 8 and 11 percent .
it will likely get enough support to enter parliament for the first time and could even beat the socialists in the voting booth , becoming the second-biggest party in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabor vona is jobbik 's prime ministerial candidate founded in 2003 , jobbik uses strong anti-roma and anti-semitic rhetoric .
it has capitalized on public anger over job losses and corruption and has built on resentment towards the large roma minority , which it blames for many of the country 's ills .
in 2007 , jobbik established the hungarian guard , which dresses in uniforms resembling those worn by the country 's pre-world war ii fascists .
" i will be wearing my hungarian guard tunic when i enter on the first day of parliament , " party leader gabor vona told supporters in budapest .
fidesz has said it will not enter into a coalition with the jobbik party , no matter the result of the election .
proportional representation in the first round on april 11 , hungarian voters will place two ticks : one at the name of the candidate they want to directly represent their local constituency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of far-right paramilitary hungarian guard march during a demonstration the second mark goes at the name of a party fielding a regional list , and over half of 386 seats in parliament will be decided on a proportional representation basis .
a second round of voting , on april 25 , will finalize those constituencies and lists where no candidate won an absolute majority or voting was inconclusive due to low turnout in the first round .
in order to enter parliament a party must poll at least five percent of the national vote .
the poll was expected to close at 1700 gmt , but the national election committee said many polling stations would stay open longer because voters were still waiting to cast ballots in several places. cb / dpa / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the far-right jobbik party could come in second place . the political map of hungary is poised to be completely redrawn as the center-right opposition fidesz party is widely expected to trounce the socialists on sunday in national general elections .
fidesz holds almost 30 percent lead over the ruling socialists , according to recent opinion polls .
fidesz party leader viktor orban has called the election a " moment of truth " and drawn comparisons with historical revolutions and the end of communism in 1990 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidesz chief viktor orban with wife aniko levai his party has long held a lead in the opinion polls , with recent polls indicating fidesz has a 60 percent approval rating among decided voters .
support for the socialist party has been at rock bottom since shortly after re-election in 2006 and the leaking of a speech in which former prime minister ferenc gyurcsany acknowledged the party had lied to the public .
the woes of the hungarian left have since been compounded by a series of high-profile corruption scandals involving socialist politicians - not to mention hungary 's being hit especially hard by the economic crisis and a 25-billion-dollar international bail-out that eventually led gyurcsany to resign .
if fidesz wins two-thirds of the seats in parliament , it could give the party a platform for broad structural reform .
fidesz has promised to create one million jobs over 10 years , boost lending , support small business and slash taxes .
those promises have resonated with voters , who are looking to the party to improve their living standards .
far-right surge far-right nationalist party jobbik is also set to do well , polling between 8 and 11 percent .
it will likely get enough support to enter parliament for the first time and could even beat the socialists in the voting booth , becoming the second-biggest party in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabor vona is jobbik 's prime ministerial candidate founded in 2003 , jobbik uses strong anti-roma and anti-semitic rhetoric .
it has capitalized on public anger over job losses and corruption and has built on resentment towards the large roma minority , which it blames for many of the country 's ills .
in 2007 , jobbik established the hungarian guard , which dresses in uniforms resembling those worn by the country 's pre-world war ii fascists .
" i will be wearing my hungarian guard tunic when i enter on the first day of parliament , " party leader gabor vona told supporters in budapest .
fidesz has said it will not enter into a coalition with the jobbik party , no matter the result of the election .
proportional representation in the first round on april 11 , hungarian voters will place two ticks : one at the name of the candidate they want to directly represent their local constituency .

a second round of voting , on april 25 , will finalize those constituencies and lists where no candidate won an absolute majority or voting was inconclusive due to low turnout in the first round .
in order to enter parliament a party must poll at least five percent of the national vote .
the poll was expected to close at 1700 gmt , but the national election committee said many polling stations would stay open longer because voters were still waiting to cast ballots in several places. cb / dpa / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , russian officals continue to investigate the cause of the plane crash that killed all 96 on board . the body of polish president lech kaczynski has returned to warsaw , a day after the president and many of the country 's political and cultural elite died in a plane crash in western russia .
the president 's twin brother jaroslaw , poland 's acting president bronislaw komorowski and prime minister donald tusk met the coffin at warsaw 's military airport , where it was draped in the national flag .
first to kneel before the coffin was kaczynski 's adult daughter marta .
she was followed by the president 's identical twin jaroslaw , a former premier who now leads the conservative opposition .
he placed his hand briefly on his dead brother 's casket , before making the sign of the cross .
the coffin was then placed in a hearse as a military orchestra played the funeral march by 19th century franco-polish composer frederic chopin .
grief-stricken nation tens of thousands of mourners turned out to pay their respects , tossing flowers as the hearse as it made its way to the presidential palace in warsaw , where kacynski 's coffin is expected to lie in view .
" regardless of whether one agreed with his politics , or his views - and i did n't - he was our president , and he died tragically , " andrzej gerula , a 26-year-old computer programmer , told the afp news agency .
" he deserves our respect and our homage .
that 's why i 've come . "
at noon , poland observed two minutes of silence .
millions of mourners across this staunchly roman catholic nation packed into churches all through sunday to pray for the dead .
bildunterschrift : the remains of the other victims , including poland 's first lady and high-ranking cabinet members , were sent to moscow for identification before being returned to poland .
poland will observe a week of mourning to commemorate the crash , which prime minister donald tusk has called the worst tragedy in poland since world war two .
weather to blame ?
in moscow , an investigation into the crash continues , with authorities examining in-flight recordings for evidence of what caused the plane to come down just short of the runaway where it was trying to land . so far , russia says no technical glitches were to blame .
" the recordings that we have confirm there were no technical problems with the plane , " said alexander bastrykin , head of the prosecutor general 's office .
kaczynski and 95 others were killed when their ageing tupolev plane crashed in thick fog near smolensk in western russia on saturday , killing everyone on board .
the president was on en route to a memorial for the katyn forest massacre , in which 22,000 poles were murdered by the soviet secret police during world war two. smh / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the day 's other game , last season 's champions wolfsburg beat struggling nuremberg 2-0 . europa league semi-finalists hamburg snatched a late 2-1 victory at bochum to end a four-game losing streak in the german bundesliga .
the win takes hamburg to 48 points , just three behind fifth placed werder bremen and a place in next season 's europa league .
hamburg could also guarantee themselves a spot in the tournament next year if they win it this time around .
they play london club fulham in the semi-finals on april 22 and 29 .
hamburg , without striker paolo guerrero who began a five-match suspension for throwing a plastic bottle at a fan after last week 's goalless draw with hanover , went ahead in the 18th minute when midfielder robert tesche headed in from a corner for his first league goal of the season .
bochum equalized just after the half hour mark , when joel epalle headed into the path of slovenian international forward zlatko dedic , who volleyed in from 20 meters .
the visitors sealed the victory in the 88th minute when bochum substitute andreas johansson turned the ball into his own net under pressure from ruud van nistelrooy .
bochum , who extended their winless run to eight league games , are 15th with 28 points , one point and one place above hanover who are in the relegation playoff spot .

dzeko became the bundesliga 's top scorer with 19 goals .
twelve minutes later , makoto hasebe was given too much space on the right and delivered a pinpoint pass for grafite to head in at the far post for his 10th goal of the season. nrt / reuters / dpa editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the euro is not to blame for our problems .
greece belongs in the euro-zone .
any other scenario is ridiculous , " he said .

they play london club fulham in the semi-finals on april 22 and 29 .
hamburg , without striker paolo guerrero who began a five-match suspension for throwing a plastic bottle at a fan after last week 's goalless draw with hanover , went ahead in the 18th minute when midfielder robert tesche headed in from a corner for his first league goal of the season .
bochum equalized just after the half hour mark , when joel epalle headed into the path of slovenian international forward zlatko dedic , who volleyed in from 20 meters .
the visitors sealed the victory in the 88th minute when bochum substitute andreas johansson turned the ball into his own net under pressure from ruud van nistelrooy .
bochum , who extended their winless run to eight league games , are 15th with 28 points , one point and one place above hanover who are in the relegation playoff spot .

this comes as the debate over the issue heats up in germany . members of the opposition social democrats and the green party in germany have urged chancellor angela merkel to agree to accommodate some prisoners due for release from the controversial us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba , during her upcoming visit to the united states .
her visit comes at a time when her cabinet has been debating whether germany should accept released guantanamo inmates .
the topic is expected to figure during the chancellor 's meeting with president obama . the deputy parliamentary floor leader of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that " germany should not leave the american president alone " in this matter .
" if chancellor angela merkel goes to washington empty-handed , it would be a personal affront to the us president , " greens leader claudia roth told the newspaper .
the federal government " should not bow to the wishes of the hard-liners ” in merkel 's christian democratic union and leave obama out on a limb where the guantanamo prisoners issue is concerned , she said . the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , are divided over the issue .
cdu interior minister thomas de maizière has called for a serious examination of the matter while states headed by the cdu and the csu have said they will not accept any prisoners .
growing debate the debate over the guantanamo prisoner issue intensified in recent weeks after it emerged that berlin resumed talks with washington over the possibility of accommodating released prisoners .
the german news magazine der spiegel reported last month that a delegation from berlin visited guantanamo recently to meet with several inmates , including a palestinian , a jordanian and a syrian who are likely candidates for resettlement .
the report also said that the inmates had been interviewed by german intelligence and police officials to determine their suitability and whether they would pose any risks if they were taken in .
president obama had pledged to close down the guantanamo camp by january this year , but some 200 detainees continue to be held there because finding them new homes is proving a major challenge .
his administration has been reluctant to send released prisoners back to their home countries because of fears for their safety .
amnesty criticizes germany meanwhile , the head of the german branch of human rights watchdog amnesty international , monika lueke , has criticized germany 's response to obama 's call for europe to accept freed guantanamo prisoners .
" german stands almost at the bottom of the list in europe where accepting guantanamo prisoners is concerned , " lueke said .
she added that other european countries have clearly understood that they " make a substantial contribution to increasing their own security " by accepting freed inmates .
the continued existence of the guantanamo camp provided " food for further terrorism , " she added. rb / apn / epd editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de berlin proposal to accept guantanamo detainees meets resistance berlin has confirmed it is considering taking in former guantanamo bay prisoners , but the proposal has met with stiff opposition from some german state leaders , who say the ex-detainees could pose a security threat .

some two million people are expected to view it . the shroud will be on public view for six weeks at the turin cathedral .
it 's kept in a bullet-proof and climate-controlled case .
discovered in the mid-14th century in the french city of troyes , the shroud of turin is said to have been imprinted with an image of christ 's crucified body .
in 1898 , secondo pia , a lawyer and amateur photographer , obtained a negative image of the 4.4-meter shroud in which jesus was buried with far more striking features than those of the natural , sepia-colored positive .
the real thing or a medieval fake ?
samples of the blood-stained fabric were analyzed in 1988 using radiocarbon dating .
the analysis determined that the fibers in the cloth date from the middle ages , but those findings have been challenged .
the vatican has never confirmed the shroud 's authenticity . turin cardinal severino poletto , who led the opening ceremony in turin 's cathedral saturday , referred to the debate over the shroud 's authenticity , saying it was " not up to the church but for science to decide . "
poletto told ansa news agency that the shroud was a testament to " hidden suffering endured in silence between tears and despair . "

"
pope benedict xvi will travel to turin to see the shroud on may 2 .
benedict said his visit would be " a propitious occasion to contemplate this mysterious visage that speaks silently to the heart of men , inviting them to recognize the face of god .

" the euro is not to blame for our problems .
greece belongs in the euro-zone .
any other scenario is ridiculous , " he said .

this comes as the debate over the issue heats up in germany . members of the opposition social democrats and the green party in germany have urged chancellor angela merkel to agree to accommodate some prisoners due for release from the controversial us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba , during her upcoming visit to the united states .
her visit comes at a time when her cabinet has been debating whether germany should accept released guantanamo inmates .
the topic is expected to figure during the chancellor 's meeting with president obama . the deputy parliamentary floor leader of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that " germany should not leave the american president alone " in this matter .
" if chancellor angela merkel goes to washington empty-handed , it would be a personal affront to the us president , " greens leader claudia roth told the newspaper .
the federal government " should not bow to the wishes of the hard-liners ” in merkel 's christian democratic union and leave obama out on a limb where the guantanamo prisoners issue is concerned , she said . the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , are divided over the issue .
cdu interior minister thomas de maizière has called for a serious examination of the matter while states headed by the cdu and the csu have said they will not accept any prisoners .
growing debate the debate over the guantanamo prisoner issue intensified in recent weeks after it emerged that berlin resumed talks with washington over the possibility of accommodating released prisoners .
the german news magazine der spiegel reported last month that a delegation from berlin visited guantanamo recently to meet with several inmates , including a palestinian , a jordanian and a syrian who are likely candidates for resettlement .
the report also said that the inmates had been interviewed by german intelligence and police officials to determine their suitability and whether they would pose any risks if they were taken in .
president obama had pledged to close down the guantanamo camp by january this year , but some 200 detainees continue to be held there because finding them new homes is proving a major challenge .
his administration has been reluctant to send released prisoners back to their home countries because of fears for their safety .
amnesty criticizes germany meanwhile , the head of the german branch of human rights watchdog amnesty international , monika lueke , has criticized germany 's response to obama 's call for europe to accept freed guantanamo prisoners .
" german stands almost at the bottom of the list in europe where accepting guantanamo prisoners is concerned , " lueke said .
she added that other european countries have clearly understood that they " make a substantial contribution to increasing their own security " by accepting freed inmates .

interest rates are to be set at 5.1 percent , significantly lower than the 7.5 percent markets have been offering .
sources said the deal was almost a " carbon copy " of imf terms .
jean-claude juncker , who heads the eurogroup , and european monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn are scheduled to announce details of the plan on sunday .
" there will be a teleconference on sunday on greece in the usual eurogroup composition , " guy schuller , a spokesman for juncker , said .

papandrreou said that with the terms now set the gun on the table will be loaded .
speculators will know this , he added .
" the question remains whether this mechanism will convince markets just as a gun on the table .
if it does not convince them , it is a mechanism that is there to be used , " papandreou said .
papandreou has vowed that greece had no plans of leaving the euro-zone .
" the euro is not to blame for our problems .
greece belongs in the euro-zone .
any other scenario is ridiculous , " he said .
spanish foreign minister angel moratinos , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , was optimistic : " i am quite optimistic that we are again able to show solidarity and above all send a message to the speculators that the euro-zone is strong and firm . "
eu leaders last month agreed to a bailout plan for greece as a last resort , with the eu providing much of the funding through direct loans and the imf also providing assistance . nrt / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

interest rates are to be set at 5.1 percent , significantly lower than the 7.5 percent markets have been offering .
sources said the deal was almost a " carbon copy " of imf terms .
jean-claude juncker , who heads the eurogroup , and european monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn are scheduled to announce details of the plan on sunday .
" there will be a teleconference on sunday on greece in the usual eurogroup composition , " guy schuller , a spokesman for juncker , said .

papandrreou said that with the terms now set the gun on the table will be loaded .
speculators will know this , he added .
" the question remains whether this mechanism will convince markets just as a gun on the table .
if it does not convince them , it is a mechanism that is there to be used , " papandreou said .
papandreou has vowed that greece had no plans of leaving the euro-zone .
" the euro is not to blame for our problems .
greece belongs in the euro-zone .
any other scenario is ridiculous , " he said .
spanish foreign minister angel moratinos , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , was optimistic : " i am quite optimistic that we are again able to show solidarity and above all send a message to the speculators that the euro-zone is strong and firm . "

this comes as the debate over the issue heats up in germany . members of the opposition social democrats and the green party in germany have urged chancellor angela merkel to agree to accommodate some prisoners due for release from the controversial us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba , during her upcoming visit to the united states .
her visit comes at a time when her cabinet has been debating whether germany should accept released guantanamo inmates .
the topic is expected to figure during the chancellor 's meeting with president obama . the deputy parliamentary floor leader of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that " germany should not leave the american president alone " in this matter .
" if chancellor angela merkel goes to washington empty-handed , it would be a personal affront to the us president , " greens leader claudia roth told the newspaper .
the federal government " should not bow to the wishes of the hard-liners ” in merkel 's christian democratic union and leave obama out on a limb where the guantanamo prisoners issue is concerned , she said . the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , are divided over the issue .
cdu interior minister thomas de maizière has called for a serious examination of the matter while states headed by the cdu and the csu have said they will not accept any prisoners .
growing debate the debate over the guantanamo prisoner issue intensified in recent weeks after it emerged that berlin resumed talks with washington over the possibility of accommodating released prisoners .
the german news magazine der spiegel reported last month that a delegation from berlin visited guantanamo recently to meet with several inmates , including a palestinian , a jordanian and a syrian who are likely candidates for resettlement .
the report also said that the inmates had been interviewed by german intelligence and police officials to determine their suitability and whether they would pose any risks if they were taken in .
president obama had pledged to close down the guantanamo camp by january this year , but some 200 detainees continue to be held there because finding them new homes is proving a major challenge .
his administration has been reluctant to send released prisoners back to their home countries because of fears for their safety .
amnesty criticizes germany meanwhile , the head of the german branch of human rights watchdog amnesty international , monika lueke , has criticized germany 's response to obama 's call for europe to accept freed guantanamo prisoners .
" german stands almost at the bottom of the list in europe where accepting guantanamo prisoners is concerned , " lueke said .
she added that other european countries have clearly understood that they " make a substantial contribution to increasing their own security " by accepting freed inmates .
the continued existence of the guantanamo camp provided " food for further terrorism , " she added. rb / apn / epd editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the far-right jobbik party could come in second place . the political map of hungary is poised to be completely redrawn as the center-right opposition fidesz party is widely expected to trounce the socialists on sunday in national general elections .
fidesz holds almost 30 percent lead over the ruling socialists , according to recent opinion polls .
fidesz party leader viktor orban has called the election a " moment of truth " and drawn comparisons with historical revolutions and the end of communism in 1990 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidesz chief viktor orban with wife aniko levai his party has long held a lead in the opinion polls , with recent polls indicating fidesz has a 60 percent approval rating among decided voters .
support for the socialist party has been at rock bottom since shortly after re-election in 2006 and the leaking of a speech in which former prime minister ferenc gyurcsany acknowledged the party had lied to the public .
the woes of the hungarian left have since been compounded by a series of high-profile corruption scandals involving socialist politicians - not to mention hungary 's being hit especially hard by the economic crisis and a 25-billion-dollar international bail-out that eventually led gyurcsany to resign .
if fidesz wins two-thirds of the seats in parliament , it could give the party a platform for broad structural reform .
fidesz has promised to create one million jobs over 10 years , boost lending , support small business and slash taxes .
those promises have resonated with voters , who are looking to the party to improve their living standards .
far-right surge far-right nationalist party jobbik is also set to do well , polling between 8 and 11 percent .
it will likely get enough support to enter parliament for the first time and could even beat the socialists in the voting booth , becoming the second-biggest party in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabor vona is jobbik 's prime ministerial candidate founded in 2003 , jobbik uses strong anti-roma and anti-semitic rhetoric .
it has capitalized on public anger over job losses and corruption and has built on resentment towards the large roma minority , which it blames for many of the country 's ills .
in 2007 , jobbik established the hungarian guard , which dresses in uniforms resembling those worn by the country 's pre-world war ii fascists .
" i will be wearing my hungarian guard tunic when i enter on the first day of parliament , " party leader gabor vona told supporters in budapest .
fidesz has said it will not enter into a coalition with the jobbik party , no matter the result of the election .
proportional representation in the first round on april 11 , hungarian voters will place two ticks : one at the name of the candidate they want to directly represent their local constituency .

a second round of voting , on april 25 , will finalize those constituencies and lists where no candidate won an absolute majority or voting was inconclusive due to low turnout in the first round .
in order to enter parliament a party must poll at least five percent of the national vote .
the poll was expected to close at 1700 gmt , but the national election committee said many polling stations would stay open longer because voters were still waiting to cast ballots in several places. cb / dpa / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 11.04.2010 more beef : how europe can regain clout in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the failure to focus on substance has weakened the eu 's standing european officials are anxious about whether washington still views them as strong players on the world stage .
to strengthen ties they have to further unify eu foreign policy and focus on the issues , analysts say . when us president barack obama announced early in februray that he would not attend an eu-us summit designed to launch the new european leadership , pundits were quick to interpret this as a sure sign of europe being downgraded on the world stage .
although washington officials insisted that obama 's cancellation was due to an overloaded domestic agenda , europeans could not shake off the feeling that obama is giving them the cold shoulder .
now european nations will have to contend with an obama administration basking in the glow of a number of recent successful policy achievements starting with health care reform and ending with the signing of the arms reduction treaty with russia this week .
obama certainly wants european countries on board at the washington disarmament conference next week in his quest for a nuclear-free world , however he knows he can bargain from a position of strength .
german chancellor angela merkel is due to attend the nuclear security summit and aside from afghanistan and iran , obama has made progress on nuclear security a top priority on his foreign policy agenda .
therefore analysts believe that merkel 's presence at the summit will be very much appreciated in washington .
however , the problematic question will be how germany 's desire to have us tactical nuclear weapons removed from its soil can be reconciled with the american view of the weapons as an important security asset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european council president herman van rompuy : " the charisma of a damp rag " so can europe present a united front in washington ?
the eu-us summit planned for april was supposed to be the first since the lisbon treaty came into force in december 2009 which created the posts of eu president and high representative for foreign affairs .
washington : lisbon a missed opportunity analysts say that there is a strong impression in washington that the europeans have wasted the chance offered by lisbon to streamline their diplomacy and foreign-policy structures .
" there is a real sense that the us may have to show some tough love and tell its european counterparts very bluntly that it wants to work with a more unified europe and that its disappointed by the way things have been going over the last few months , " new york based richard gowan , policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
instead of one there are now at least four voices speaking for europe : the new permanent eu president , the still persisting six-month rotating presidency , the high representative , and the president of the european commission .
the problem , once raised by henry kissinger , of who to call when you want to talk to europe , has not exactly been solved by the lisbon treaty .
us focus on emerging powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing dialogue : obama and his chinese counterpart hu jintao another factor contributing to the europeans ' nervousness is obama 's focus on reaching out to emerging powers like brazil , india and above all china .
" the obama government has set out to form a closer political and economic relationship with china , raising fears in europe that such a g-2 could further reduce europe 's influence in the world , " the center for european reform said in a recent study .
obama 's attempt to adapt international political structures to meet the rise of the new superpowers is also encapsulated in his administration 's advocacy for the g20 in which china and india are full members .
" obama 's administration has decided to replace the g8 with the g20 as the premier forum of economic discussion .
it sees the g20 as an institution which brings new and established economic powers together .
the europeans feel rather downgraded by this prioritization , " gowan said .
on the other hand , gowan points out that european countries themselves have invested a lot in attempting to improve their relationship with china .
it should not come as a surprise that the us has a vital interest to do the same .
some analysts say that the growing importance of china does not necessarily take away from the strength of the transatlantic partnership .
" you have to differentiate between who is becoming most important in terms of challenges and economic cooperation and who is your natural partner .
the g2 already exists between the us and europe if you look at investment , jobs creation , and trade .
almost two thirds of the world 's economic activity still happens between the us and europe , " jan-friedrich kallmorgen , former head of the transatlantic program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
so while there might be a growing dialogue between the us and china , it is still far away from the kind of transatlantic cooperation that everyone has become accustomed to in europe .
common foreign policy goals overall , the eu and the us share many foreign policy goals and there is a lot more consensus than there was in the bush years .
both sides acknowledge that tackling climate change is a priority and that they need to make progress on international financial regulation .
they also seem to be on the same page when it comes to dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions and the situation in afghanistan .
while obama is said to be disappointed about the small number of extra troops from europe , his new approach to afghanistan is much closer to european - and in particular german - priorities .
" the concept that civil measures like police training , legal education and business administration should increasingly play a role in afghanistan has gained considerable ground in washington , " explains kallmorgen .
merkel in a strong position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " merkel is the leader you have to do buisness with in europe " although germany has been a difficult partner on afghanistan , analysts believe that german-us ties are still going strong .
according to gowan , german chancellor merkel may well be the most important european figure when it comes to transatlantic cooperation .
" merkel still represents the leader that you have to do business with in europe .
gordon brown faces electoral defeat , neither zapatero nor berlusconi have really impressed the current administration , and sarkozy is understood to be very critical of obama in private , " he explains .
on a personal level , you do not see the kind of public display of affection forced onto merkel by former president george w. bush .
but on a working level , gowan says she represents a stable partner for obama who has just been reelected and will be around for quite some time .
it is with these bread and butter issues that europeans will try to gain ground in relations with washington .
many commentators believe that instead of quarrelling over who shakes obama 's hand first and sulking over a summit no-show , european leaders should offer concrete foreign policy agreements and deliver on issues like financial regulation and international security .
maybe if there is more beef on the menu next time the eu invites obama over for dinner , he will gladly accept .

to strengthen ties they have to further unify eu foreign policy and focus on the issues , analysts say . when us president barack obama announced early in februray that he would not attend an eu-us summit designed to launch the new european leadership , pundits were quick to interpret this as a sure sign of europe being downgraded on the world stage .
although washington officials insisted that obama 's cancellation was due to an overloaded domestic agenda , europeans could not shake off the feeling that obama is giving them the cold shoulder .
now european nations will have to contend with an obama administration basking in the glow of a number of recent successful policy achievements starting with health care reform and ending with the signing of the arms reduction treaty with russia this week .
obama certainly wants european countries on board at the washington disarmament conference next week in his quest for a nuclear-free world , however he knows he can bargain from a position of strength .
german chancellor angela merkel is due to attend the nuclear security summit and aside from afghanistan and iran , obama has made progress on nuclear security a top priority on his foreign policy agenda .
therefore analysts believe that merkel 's presence at the summit will be very much appreciated in washington .
however , the problematic question will be how germany 's desire to have us tactical nuclear weapons removed from its soil can be reconciled with the american view of the weapons as an important security asset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european council president herman van rompuy : " the charisma of a damp rag " so can europe present a united front in washington ?
the eu-us summit planned for april was supposed to be the first since the lisbon treaty came into force in december 2009 which created the posts of eu president and high representative for foreign affairs .
washington : lisbon a missed opportunity analysts say that there is a strong impression in washington that the europeans have wasted the chance offered by lisbon to streamline their diplomacy and foreign-policy structures .
" there is a real sense that the us may have to show some tough love and tell its european counterparts very bluntly that it wants to work with a more unified europe and that its disappointed by the way things have been going over the last few months , " new york based richard gowan , policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
instead of one there are now at least four voices speaking for europe : the new permanent eu president , the still persisting six-month rotating presidency , the high representative , and the president of the european commission .
the problem , once raised by henry kissinger , of who to call when you want to talk to europe , has not exactly been solved by the lisbon treaty .
us focus on emerging powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing dialogue : obama and his chinese counterpart hu jintao another factor contributing to the europeans ' nervousness is obama 's focus on reaching out to emerging powers like brazil , india and above all china .
" the obama government has set out to form a closer political and economic relationship with china , raising fears in europe that such a g-2 could further reduce europe 's influence in the world , " the center for european reform said in a recent study .
obama 's attempt to adapt international political structures to meet the rise of the new superpowers is also encapsulated in his administration 's advocacy for the g20 in which china and india are full members .
" obama 's administration has decided to replace the g8 with the g20 as the premier forum of economic discussion .
it sees the g20 as an institution which brings new and established economic powers together .
the europeans feel rather downgraded by this prioritization , " gowan said .
on the other hand , gowan points out that european countries themselves have invested a lot in attempting to improve their relationship with china .
it should not come as a surprise that the us has a vital interest to do the same .
some analysts say that the growing importance of china does not necessarily take away from the strength of the transatlantic partnership .
" you have to differentiate between who is becoming most important in terms of challenges and economic cooperation and who is your natural partner .
the g2 already exists between the us and europe if you look at investment , jobs creation , and trade .
almost two thirds of the world 's economic activity still happens between the us and europe , " jan-friedrich kallmorgen , former head of the transatlantic program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
so while there might be a growing dialogue between the us and china , it is still far away from the kind of transatlantic cooperation that everyone has become accustomed to in europe .
common foreign policy goals overall , the eu and the us share many foreign policy goals and there is a lot more consensus than there was in the bush years .
both sides acknowledge that tackling climate change is a priority and that they need to make progress on international financial regulation .
they also seem to be on the same page when it comes to dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions and the situation in afghanistan .
while obama is said to be disappointed about the small number of extra troops from europe , his new approach to afghanistan is much closer to european - and in particular german - priorities .
" the concept that civil measures like police training , legal education and business administration should increasingly play a role in afghanistan has gained considerable ground in washington , " explains kallmorgen .
merkel in a strong position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " merkel is the leader you have to do buisness with in europe " although germany has been a difficult partner on afghanistan , analysts believe that german-us ties are still going strong .
according to gowan , german chancellor merkel may well be the most important european figure when it comes to transatlantic cooperation .
" merkel still represents the leader that you have to do business with in europe .
gordon brown faces electoral defeat , neither zapatero nor berlusconi have really impressed the current administration , and sarkozy is understood to be very critical of obama in private , " he explains .
on a personal level , you do not see the kind of public display of affection forced onto merkel by former president george w. bush .
but on a working level , gowan says she represents a stable partner for obama who has just been reelected and will be around for quite some time .
it is with these bread and butter issues that europeans will try to gain ground in relations with washington .
many commentators believe that instead of quarrelling over who shakes obama 's hand first and sulking over a summit no-show , european leaders should offer concrete foreign policy agreements and deliver on issues like financial regulation and international security .
maybe if there is more beef on the menu next time the eu invites obama over for dinner , he will gladly accept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 11.04.2010 more beef : how europe can regain clout in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the failure to focus on substance has weakened the eu 's standing european officials are anxious about whether washington still views them as strong players on the world stage .
to strengthen ties they have to further unify eu foreign policy and focus on the issues , analysts say . when us president barack obama announced early in februray that he would not attend an eu-us summit designed to launch the new european leadership , pundits were quick to interpret this as a sure sign of europe being downgraded on the world stage .
although washington officials insisted that obama 's cancellation was due to an overloaded domestic agenda , europeans could not shake off the feeling that obama is giving them the cold shoulder .
now european nations will have to contend with an obama administration basking in the glow of a number of recent successful policy achievements starting with health care reform and ending with the signing of the arms reduction treaty with russia this week .
obama certainly wants european countries on board at the washington disarmament conference next week in his quest for a nuclear-free world , however he knows he can bargain from a position of strength .
german chancellor angela merkel is due to attend the nuclear security summit and aside from afghanistan and iran , obama has made progress on nuclear security a top priority on his foreign policy agenda .
therefore analysts believe that merkel 's presence at the summit will be very much appreciated in washington .
however , the problematic question will be how germany 's desire to have us tactical nuclear weapons removed from its soil can be reconciled with the american view of the weapons as an important security asset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european council president herman van rompuy : " the charisma of a damp rag " so can europe present a united front in washington ?
the eu-us summit planned for april was supposed to be the first since the lisbon treaty came into force in december 2009 which created the posts of eu president and high representative for foreign affairs .
washington : lisbon a missed opportunity analysts say that there is a strong impression in washington that the europeans have wasted the chance offered by lisbon to streamline their diplomacy and foreign-policy structures .
" there is a real sense that the us may have to show some tough love and tell its european counterparts very bluntly that it wants to work with a more unified europe and that its disappointed by the way things have been going over the last few months , " new york based richard gowan , policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
instead of one there are now at least four voices speaking for europe : the new permanent eu president , the still persisting six-month rotating presidency , the high representative , and the president of the european commission .
the problem , once raised by henry kissinger , of who to call when you want to talk to europe , has not exactly been solved by the lisbon treaty .
us focus on emerging powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing dialogue : obama and his chinese counterpart hu jintao another factor contributing to the europeans ' nervousness is obama 's focus on reaching out to emerging powers like brazil , india and above all china .
" the obama government has set out to form a closer political and economic relationship with china , raising fears in europe that such a g-2 could further reduce europe 's influence in the world , " the center for european reform said in a recent study .
obama 's attempt to adapt international political structures to meet the rise of the new superpowers is also encapsulated in his administration 's advocacy for the g20 in which china and india are full members .
" obama 's administration has decided to replace the g8 with the g20 as the premier forum of economic discussion .
it sees the g20 as an institution which brings new and established economic powers together .
the europeans feel rather downgraded by this prioritization , " gowan said .
on the other hand , gowan points out that european countries themselves have invested a lot in attempting to improve their relationship with china .
it should not come as a surprise that the us has a vital interest to do the same .
some analysts say that the growing importance of china does not necessarily take away from the strength of the transatlantic partnership .
" you have to differentiate between who is becoming most important in terms of challenges and economic cooperation and who is your natural partner .
the g2 already exists between the us and europe if you look at investment , jobs creation , and trade .
almost two thirds of the world 's economic activity still happens between the us and europe , " jan-friedrich kallmorgen , former head of the transatlantic program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
so while there might be a growing dialogue between the us and china , it is still far away from the kind of transatlantic cooperation that everyone has become accustomed to in europe .
common foreign policy goals overall , the eu and the us share many foreign policy goals and there is a lot more consensus than there was in the bush years .
both sides acknowledge that tackling climate change is a priority and that they need to make progress on international financial regulation .
they also seem to be on the same page when it comes to dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions and the situation in afghanistan .
while obama is said to be disappointed about the small number of extra troops from europe , his new approach to afghanistan is much closer to european - and in particular german - priorities .
" the concept that civil measures like police training , legal education and business administration should increasingly play a role in afghanistan has gained considerable ground in washington , " explains kallmorgen .
merkel in a strong position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " merkel is the leader you have to do buisness with in europe " although germany has been a difficult partner on afghanistan , analysts believe that german-us ties are still going strong .
according to gowan , german chancellor merkel may well be the most important european figure when it comes to transatlantic cooperation .
" merkel still represents the leader that you have to do business with in europe .
gordon brown faces electoral defeat , neither zapatero nor berlusconi have really impressed the current administration , and sarkozy is understood to be very critical of obama in private , " he explains .
on a personal level , you do not see the kind of public display of affection forced onto merkel by former president george w. bush .
but on a working level , gowan says she represents a stable partner for obama who has just been reelected and will be around for quite some time .
it is with these bread and butter issues that europeans will try to gain ground in relations with washington .
many commentators believe that instead of quarrelling over who shakes obama 's hand first and sulking over a summit no-show , european leaders should offer concrete foreign policy agreements and deliver on issues like financial regulation and international security .
maybe if there is more beef on the menu next time the eu invites obama over for dinner , he will gladly accept .

the eu-us summit planned for april was supposed to be the first since the lisbon treaty came into force in december 2009 which created the posts of eu president and high representative for foreign affairs .
washington : lisbon a missed opportunity analysts say that there is a strong impression in washington that the europeans have wasted the chance offered by lisbon to streamline their diplomacy and foreign-policy structures .
" there is a real sense that the us may have to show some tough love and tell its european counterparts very bluntly that it wants to work with a more unified europe and that its disappointed by the way things have been going over the last few months , " new york based richard gowan , policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
instead of one there are now at least four voices speaking for europe : the new permanent eu president , the still persisting six-month rotating presidency , the high representative , and the president of the european commission .
the problem , once raised by henry kissinger , of who to call when you want to talk to europe , has not exactly been solved by the lisbon treaty .
us focus on emerging powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing dialogue : obama and his chinese counterpart hu jintao another factor contributing to the europeans ' nervousness is obama 's focus on reaching out to emerging powers like brazil , india and above all china .
" the obama government has set out to form a closer political and economic relationship with china , raising fears in europe that such a g-2 could further reduce europe 's influence in the world , " the center for european reform said in a recent study .
obama 's attempt to adapt international political structures to meet the rise of the new superpowers is also encapsulated in his administration 's advocacy for the g20 in which china and india are full members .
" obama 's administration has decided to replace the g8 with the g20 as the premier forum of economic discussion .
it sees the g20 as an institution which brings new and established economic powers together .
the europeans feel rather downgraded by this prioritization , " gowan said .
on the other hand , gowan points out that european countries themselves have invested a lot in attempting to improve their relationship with china .
it should not come as a surprise that the us has a vital interest to do the same .
some analysts say that the growing importance of china does not necessarily take away from the strength of the transatlantic partnership .
" you have to differentiate between who is becoming most important in terms of challenges and economic cooperation and who is your natural partner .
the g2 already exists between the us and europe if you look at investment , jobs creation , and trade .
almost two thirds of the world 's economic activity still happens between the us and europe , " jan-friedrich kallmorgen , former head of the transatlantic program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
so while there might be a growing dialogue between the us and china , it is still far away from the kind of transatlantic cooperation that everyone has become accustomed to in europe .
common foreign policy goals overall , the eu and the us share many foreign policy goals and there is a lot more consensus than there was in the bush years .
both sides acknowledge that tackling climate change is a priority and that they need to make progress on international financial regulation .
they also seem to be on the same page when it comes to dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions and the situation in afghanistan .
while obama is said to be disappointed about the small number of extra troops from europe , his new approach to afghanistan is much closer to european - and in particular german - priorities .
" the concept that civil measures like police training , legal education and business administration should increasingly play a role in afghanistan has gained considerable ground in washington , " explains kallmorgen .
merkel in a strong position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " merkel is the leader you have to do buisness with in europe " although germany has been a difficult partner on afghanistan , analysts believe that german-us ties are still going strong .
according to gowan , german chancellor merkel may well be the most important european figure when it comes to transatlantic cooperation .
" merkel still represents the leader that you have to do business with in europe .
gordon brown faces electoral defeat , neither zapatero nor berlusconi have really impressed the current administration , and sarkozy is understood to be very critical of obama in private , " he explains .
on a personal level , you do not see the kind of public display of affection forced onto merkel by former president george w. bush .
but on a working level , gowan says she represents a stable partner for obama who has just been reelected and will be around for quite some time .
it is with these bread and butter issues that europeans will try to gain ground in relations with washington .
many commentators believe that instead of quarrelling over who shakes obama 's hand first and sulking over a summit no-show , european leaders should offer concrete foreign policy agreements and deliver on issues like financial regulation and international security .
maybe if there is more beef on the menu next time the eu invites obama over for dinner , he will gladly accept .

to strengthen ties they have to further unify eu foreign policy and focus on the issues , analysts say . when us president barack obama announced early in februray that he would not attend an eu-us summit designed to launch the new european leadership , pundits were quick to interpret this as a sure sign of europe being downgraded on the world stage .
although washington officials insisted that obama 's cancellation was due to an overloaded domestic agenda , europeans could not shake off the feeling that obama is giving them the cold shoulder .
now european nations will have to contend with an obama administration basking in the glow of a number of recent successful policy achievements starting with health care reform and ending with the signing of the arms reduction treaty with russia this week .
obama certainly wants european countries on board at the washington disarmament conference next week in his quest for a nuclear-free world , however he knows he can bargain from a position of strength .
german chancellor angela merkel is due to attend the nuclear security summit and aside from afghanistan and iran , obama has made progress on nuclear security a top priority on his foreign policy agenda .
therefore analysts believe that merkel 's presence at the summit will be very much appreciated in washington .
however , the problematic question will be how germany 's desire to have us tactical nuclear weapons removed from its soil can be reconciled with the american view of the weapons as an important security asset .

" you have to differentiate between who is becoming most important in terms of challenges and economic cooperation and who is your natural partner .
the g2 already exists between the us and europe if you look at investment , jobs creation , and trade .
almost two thirds of the world 's economic activity still happens between the us and europe , " jan-friedrich kallmorgen , former head of the transatlantic program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
so while there might be a growing dialogue between the us and china , it is still far away from the kind of transatlantic cooperation that everyone has become accustomed to in europe .
common foreign policy goals overall , the eu and the us share many foreign policy goals and there is a lot more consensus than there was in the bush years .
both sides acknowledge that tackling climate change is a priority and that they need to make progress on international financial regulation .
they also seem to be on the same page when it comes to dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions and the situation in afghanistan .
while obama is said to be disappointed about the small number of extra troops from europe , his new approach to afghanistan is much closer to european - and in particular german - priorities .
" the concept that civil measures like police training , legal education and business administration should increasingly play a role in afghanistan has gained considerable ground in washington , " explains kallmorgen .
merkel in a strong position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " merkel is the leader you have to do buisness with in europe " although germany has been a difficult partner on afghanistan , analysts believe that german-us ties are still going strong .
according to gowan , german chancellor merkel may well be the most important european figure when it comes to transatlantic cooperation .
" merkel still represents the leader that you have to do business with in europe .
gordon brown faces electoral defeat , neither zapatero nor berlusconi have really impressed the current administration , and sarkozy is understood to be very critical of obama in private , " he explains .
on a personal level , you do not see the kind of public display of affection forced onto merkel by former president george w. bush .
but on a working level , gowan says she represents a stable partner for obama who has just been reelected and will be around for quite some time .
it is with these bread and butter issues that europeans will try to gain ground in relations with washington .
many commentators believe that instead of quarrelling over who shakes obama 's hand first and sulking over a summit no-show , european leaders should offer concrete foreign policy agreements and deliver on issues like financial regulation and international security .
maybe if there is more beef on the menu next time the eu invites obama over for dinner , he will gladly accept .

to strengthen ties they have to further unify eu foreign policy and focus on the issues , analysts say . when us president barack obama announced early in februray that he would not attend an eu-us summit designed to launch the new european leadership , pundits were quick to interpret this as a sure sign of europe being downgraded on the world stage .
although washington officials insisted that obama 's cancellation was due to an overloaded domestic agenda , europeans could not shake off the feeling that obama is giving them the cold shoulder .
now european nations will have to contend with an obama administration basking in the glow of a number of recent successful policy achievements starting with health care reform and ending with the signing of the arms reduction treaty with russia this week .
obama certainly wants european countries on board at the washington disarmament conference next week in his quest for a nuclear-free world , however he knows he can bargain from a position of strength .
german chancellor angela merkel is due to attend the nuclear security summit and aside from afghanistan and iran , obama has made progress on nuclear security a top priority on his foreign policy agenda .
therefore analysts believe that merkel 's presence at the summit will be very much appreciated in washington .
however , the problematic question will be how germany 's desire to have us tactical nuclear weapons removed from its soil can be reconciled with the american view of the weapons as an important security asset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european council president herman van rompuy : " the charisma of a damp rag " so can europe present a united front in washington ?
the eu-us summit planned for april was supposed to be the first since the lisbon treaty came into force in december 2009 which created the posts of eu president and high representative for foreign affairs .
washington : lisbon a missed opportunity analysts say that there is a strong impression in washington that the europeans have wasted the chance offered by lisbon to streamline their diplomacy and foreign-policy structures .
" there is a real sense that the us may have to show some tough love and tell its european counterparts very bluntly that it wants to work with a more unified europe and that its disappointed by the way things have been going over the last few months , " new york based richard gowan , policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
instead of one there are now at least four voices speaking for europe : the new permanent eu president , the still persisting six-month rotating presidency , the high representative , and the president of the european commission .
the problem , once raised by henry kissinger , of who to call when you want to talk to europe , has not exactly been solved by the lisbon treaty .
us focus on emerging powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing dialogue : obama and his chinese counterpart hu jintao another factor contributing to the europeans ' nervousness is obama 's focus on reaching out to emerging powers like brazil , india and above all china .
" the obama government has set out to form a closer political and economic relationship with china , raising fears in europe that such a g-2 could further reduce europe 's influence in the world , " the center for european reform said in a recent study .
obama 's attempt to adapt international political structures to meet the rise of the new superpowers is also encapsulated in his administration 's advocacy for the g20 in which china and india are full members .
" obama 's administration has decided to replace the g8 with the g20 as the premier forum of economic discussion .
it sees the g20 as an institution which brings new and established economic powers together .
the europeans feel rather downgraded by this prioritization , " gowan said .
on the other hand , gowan points out that european countries themselves have invested a lot in attempting to improve their relationship with china .
it should not come as a surprise that the us has a vital interest to do the same .
some analysts say that the growing importance of china does not necessarily take away from the strength of the transatlantic partnership .

to strengthen ties they have to further unify eu foreign policy and focus on the issues , analysts say . when us president barack obama announced early in februray that he would not attend an eu-us summit designed to launch the new european leadership , pundits were quick to interpret this as a sure sign of europe being downgraded on the world stage .
although washington officials insisted that obama 's cancellation was due to an overloaded domestic agenda , europeans could not shake off the feeling that obama is giving them the cold shoulder .
now european nations will have to contend with an obama administration basking in the glow of a number of recent successful policy achievements starting with health care reform and ending with the signing of the arms reduction treaty with russia this week .
obama certainly wants european countries on board at the washington disarmament conference next week in his quest for a nuclear-free world , however he knows he can bargain from a position of strength .
german chancellor angela merkel is due to attend the nuclear security summit and aside from afghanistan and iran , obama has made progress on nuclear security a top priority on his foreign policy agenda .
therefore analysts believe that merkel 's presence at the summit will be very much appreciated in washington .
however , the problematic question will be how germany 's desire to have us tactical nuclear weapons removed from its soil can be reconciled with the american view of the weapons as an important security asset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european council president herman van rompuy : " the charisma of a damp rag " so can europe present a united front in washington ?
the eu-us summit planned for april was supposed to be the first since the lisbon treaty came into force in december 2009 which created the posts of eu president and high representative for foreign affairs .
washington : lisbon a missed opportunity analysts say that there is a strong impression in washington that the europeans have wasted the chance offered by lisbon to streamline their diplomacy and foreign-policy structures .
" there is a real sense that the us may have to show some tough love and tell its european counterparts very bluntly that it wants to work with a more unified europe and that its disappointed by the way things have been going over the last few months , " new york based richard gowan , policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
instead of one there are now at least four voices speaking for europe : the new permanent eu president , the still persisting six-month rotating presidency , the high representative , and the president of the european commission .
the problem , once raised by henry kissinger , of who to call when you want to talk to europe , has not exactly been solved by the lisbon treaty .
us focus on emerging powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing dialogue : obama and his chinese counterpart hu jintao another factor contributing to the europeans ' nervousness is obama 's focus on reaching out to emerging powers like brazil , india and above all china .
" the obama government has set out to form a closer political and economic relationship with china , raising fears in europe that such a g-2 could further reduce europe 's influence in the world , " the center for european reform said in a recent study .
obama 's attempt to adapt international political structures to meet the rise of the new superpowers is also encapsulated in his administration 's advocacy for the g20 in which china and india are full members .
" obama 's administration has decided to replace the g8 with the g20 as the premier forum of economic discussion .
it sees the g20 as an institution which brings new and established economic powers together .
the europeans feel rather downgraded by this prioritization , " gowan said .
on the other hand , gowan points out that european countries themselves have invested a lot in attempting to improve their relationship with china .
it should not come as a surprise that the us has a vital interest to do the same .
some analysts say that the growing importance of china does not necessarily take away from the strength of the transatlantic partnership .
" you have to differentiate between who is becoming most important in terms of challenges and economic cooperation and who is your natural partner .
the g2 already exists between the us and europe if you look at investment , jobs creation , and trade .
almost two thirds of the world 's economic activity still happens between the us and europe , " jan-friedrich kallmorgen , former head of the transatlantic program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
so while there might be a growing dialogue between the us and china , it is still far away from the kind of transatlantic cooperation that everyone has become accustomed to in europe .
common foreign policy goals overall , the eu and the us share many foreign policy goals and there is a lot more consensus than there was in the bush years .
both sides acknowledge that tackling climate change is a priority and that they need to make progress on international financial regulation .
they also seem to be on the same page when it comes to dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions and the situation in afghanistan .
while obama is said to be disappointed about the small number of extra troops from europe , his new approach to afghanistan is much closer to european - and in particular german - priorities .
" the concept that civil measures like police training , legal education and business administration should increasingly play a role in afghanistan has gained considerable ground in washington , " explains kallmorgen .
merkel in a strong position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " merkel is the leader you have to do buisness with in europe " although germany has been a difficult partner on afghanistan , analysts believe that german-us ties are still going strong .
according to gowan , german chancellor merkel may well be the most important european figure when it comes to transatlantic cooperation .
" merkel still represents the leader that you have to do business with in europe .
gordon brown faces electoral defeat , neither zapatero nor berlusconi have really impressed the current administration , and sarkozy is understood to be very critical of obama in private , " he explains .
on a personal level , you do not see the kind of public display of affection forced onto merkel by former president george w. bush .
but on a working level , gowan says she represents a stable partner for obama who has just been reelected and will be around for quite some time .
it is with these bread and butter issues that europeans will try to gain ground in relations with washington .
many commentators believe that instead of quarrelling over who shakes obama 's hand first and sulking over a summit no-show , european leaders should offer concrete foreign policy agreements and deliver on issues like financial regulation and international security .
maybe if there is more beef on the menu next time the eu invites obama over for dinner , he will gladly accept .

this comes as the debate over the issue heats up in germany . members of the opposition social democrats and the green party in germany have urged chancellor angela merkel to agree to accommodate some prisoners due for release from the controversial us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba , during her upcoming visit to the united states .
her visit comes at a time when her cabinet has been debating whether germany should accept released guantanamo inmates .
the topic is expected to figure during the chancellor 's meeting with president obama . the deputy parliamentary floor leader of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that " germany should not leave the american president alone " in this matter .

the report also said that the inmates had been interviewed by german intelligence and police officials to determine their suitability and whether they would pose any risks if they were taken in .
president obama had pledged to close down the guantanamo camp by january this year , but some 200 detainees continue to be held there because finding them new homes is proving a major challenge .
his administration has been reluctant to send released prisoners back to their home countries because of fears for their safety .

she added that other european countries have clearly understood that they " make a substantial contribution to increasing their own security " by accepting freed inmates .

meanwhile , russian officals continue to investigate the cause of the plane crash that killed all 96 on board . the body of polish president lech kaczynski has returned to warsaw , a day after the president and many of the country 's political and cultural elite died in a plane crash in western russia .
the president 's twin brother jaroslaw , poland 's acting president bronislaw komorowski and prime minister donald tusk met the coffin at warsaw 's military airport , where it was draped in the national flag .
first to kneel before the coffin was kaczynski 's adult daughter marta .
she was followed by the president 's identical twin jaroslaw , a former premier who now leads the conservative opposition .
he placed his hand briefly on his dead brother 's casket , before making the sign of the cross .
the coffin was then placed in a hearse as a military orchestra played the funeral march by 19th century franco-polish composer frederic chopin .
grief-stricken nation tens of thousands of mourners turned out to pay their respects , tossing flowers as the hearse as it made its way to the presidential palace in warsaw , where kacynski 's coffin is expected to lie in view .
" regardless of whether one agreed with his politics , or his views - and i did n't - he was our president , and he died tragically , " andrzej gerula , a 26-year-old computer programmer , told the afp news agency .
" he deserves our respect and our homage .
that 's why i 've come . "
at noon , poland observed two minutes of silence .
millions of mourners across this staunchly roman catholic nation packed into churches all through sunday to pray for the dead .
bildunterschrift : the remains of the other victims , including poland 's first lady and high-ranking cabinet members , were sent to moscow for identification before being returned to poland .
poland will observe a week of mourning to commemorate the crash , which prime minister donald tusk has called the worst tragedy in poland since world war two .
weather to blame ?
in moscow , an investigation into the crash continues , with authorities examining in-flight recordings for evidence of what caused the plane to come down just short of the runaway where it was trying to land . so far , russia says no technical glitches were to blame .
" the recordings that we have confirm there were no technical problems with the plane , " said alexander bastrykin , head of the prosecutor general 's office .
kaczynski and 95 others were killed when their ageing tupolev plane crashed in thick fog near smolensk in western russia on saturday , killing everyone on board .
the president was on en route to a memorial for the katyn forest massacre , in which 22,000 poles were murdered by the soviet secret police during world war two. smh / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , russian officals continue to investigate the cause of the plane crash that killed all 96 on board . the body of polish president lech kaczynski has returned to warsaw , a day after the president and many of the country 's political and cultural elite died in a plane crash in western russia .
the president 's twin brother jaroslaw , poland 's acting president bronislaw komorowski and prime minister donald tusk met the coffin at warsaw 's military airport , where it was draped in the national flag .
first to kneel before the coffin was kaczynski 's adult daughter marta .
she was followed by the president 's identical twin jaroslaw , a former premier who now leads the conservative opposition .
he placed his hand briefly on his dead brother 's casket , before making the sign of the cross .
the coffin was then placed in a hearse as a military orchestra played the funeral march by 19th century franco-polish composer frederic chopin .
grief-stricken nation tens of thousands of mourners turned out to pay their respects , tossing flowers as the hearse as it made its way to the presidential palace in warsaw , where kacynski 's coffin is expected to lie in view .
" regardless of whether one agreed with his politics , or his views - and i did n't - he was our president , and he died tragically , " andrzej gerula , a 26-year-old computer programmer , told the afp news agency .
" he deserves our respect and our homage .
that 's why i 've come . "
at noon , poland observed two minutes of silence .
millions of mourners across this staunchly roman catholic nation packed into churches all through sunday to pray for the dead .
bildunterschrift : the remains of the other victims , including poland 's first lady and high-ranking cabinet members , were sent to moscow for identification before being returned to poland .
poland will observe a week of mourning to commemorate the crash , which prime minister donald tusk has called the worst tragedy in poland since world war two .
weather to blame ?
in moscow , an investigation into the crash continues , with authorities examining in-flight recordings for evidence of what caused the plane to come down just short of the runaway where it was trying to land . so far , russia says no technical glitches were to blame .
" the recordings that we have confirm there were no technical problems with the plane , " said alexander bastrykin , head of the prosecutor general 's office .
kaczynski and 95 others were killed when their ageing tupolev plane crashed in thick fog near smolensk in western russia on saturday , killing everyone on board .
the president was on en route to a memorial for the katyn forest massacre , in which 22,000 poles were murdered by the soviet secret police during world war two. smh / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as the debate over the issue heats up in germany . members of the opposition social democrats and the green party in germany have urged chancellor angela merkel to agree to accommodate some prisoners due for release from the controversial us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba , during her upcoming visit to the united states .
her visit comes at a time when her cabinet has been debating whether germany should accept released guantanamo inmates .
the topic is expected to figure during the chancellor 's meeting with president obama . the deputy parliamentary floor leader of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that " germany should not leave the american president alone " in this matter .
" if chancellor angela merkel goes to washington empty-handed , it would be a personal affront to the us president , " greens leader claudia roth told the newspaper .
the federal government " should not bow to the wishes of the hard-liners ” in merkel 's christian democratic union and leave obama out on a limb where the guantanamo prisoners issue is concerned , she said . the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , are divided over the issue .
cdu interior minister thomas de maizière has called for a serious examination of the matter while states headed by the cdu and the csu have said they will not accept any prisoners .
growing debate the debate over the guantanamo prisoner issue intensified in recent weeks after it emerged that berlin resumed talks with washington over the possibility of accommodating released prisoners .
the german news magazine der spiegel reported last month that a delegation from berlin visited guantanamo recently to meet with several inmates , including a palestinian , a jordanian and a syrian who are likely candidates for resettlement .
the report also said that the inmates had been interviewed by german intelligence and police officials to determine their suitability and whether they would pose any risks if they were taken in .
president obama had pledged to close down the guantanamo camp by january this year , but some 200 detainees continue to be held there because finding them new homes is proving a major challenge .
his administration has been reluctant to send released prisoners back to their home countries because of fears for their safety .
amnesty criticizes germany meanwhile , the head of the german branch of human rights watchdog amnesty international , monika lueke , has criticized germany 's response to obama 's call for europe to accept freed guantanamo prisoners .
" german stands almost at the bottom of the list in europe where accepting guantanamo prisoners is concerned , " lueke said .
she added that other european countries have clearly understood that they " make a substantial contribution to increasing their own security " by accepting freed inmates .
the continued existence of the guantanamo camp provided " food for further terrorism , " she added. rb / apn / epd editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de berlin proposal to accept guantanamo detainees meets resistance berlin has confirmed it is considering taking in former guantanamo bay prisoners , but the proposal has met with stiff opposition from some german state leaders , who say the ex-detainees could pose a security threat .

first to kneel before the coffin was kaczynski 's adult daughter marta .
she was followed by the president 's identical twin jaroslaw , a former premier who now leads the conservative opposition .
he placed his hand briefly on his dead brother 's casket , before making the sign of the cross .
the coffin was then placed in a hearse as a military orchestra played the funeral march by 19th century franco-polish composer frederic chopin .
grief-stricken nation tens of thousands of mourners turned out to pay their respects , tossing flowers as the hearse as it made its way to the presidential palace in warsaw , where kacynski 's coffin is expected to lie in view .
" regardless of whether one agreed with his politics , or his views - and i did n't - he was our president , and he died tragically , " andrzej gerula , a 26-year-old computer programmer , told the afp news agency .
" he deserves our respect and our homage .
that 's why i 've come . "
at noon , poland observed two minutes of silence .
millions of mourners across this staunchly roman catholic nation packed into churches all through sunday to pray for the dead .
bildunterschrift : the remains of the other victims , including poland 's first lady and high-ranking cabinet members , were sent to moscow for identification before being returned to poland .
poland will observe a week of mourning to commemorate the crash , which prime minister donald tusk has called the worst tragedy in poland since world war two .
weather to blame ?
in moscow , an investigation into the crash continues , with authorities examining in-flight recordings for evidence of what caused the plane to come down just short of the runaway where it was trying to land . so far , russia says no technical glitches were to blame .
" the recordings that we have confirm there were no technical problems with the plane , " said alexander bastrykin , head of the prosecutor general 's office .
kaczynski and 95 others were killed when their ageing tupolev plane crashed in thick fog near smolensk in western russia on saturday , killing everyone on board .

this comes as the debate over the issue heats up in germany . members of the opposition social democrats and the green party in germany have urged chancellor angela merkel to agree to accommodate some prisoners due for release from the controversial us detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba , during her upcoming visit to the united states .
her visit comes at a time when her cabinet has been debating whether germany should accept released guantanamo inmates .
the topic is expected to figure during the chancellor 's meeting with president obama . the deputy parliamentary floor leader of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that " germany should not leave the american president alone " in this matter .
" if chancellor angela merkel goes to washington empty-handed , it would be a personal affront to the us president , " greens leader claudia roth told the newspaper .
the federal government " should not bow to the wishes of the hard-liners ” in merkel 's christian democratic union and leave obama out on a limb where the guantanamo prisoners issue is concerned , she said . the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , are divided over the issue .
cdu interior minister thomas de maizière has called for a serious examination of the matter while states headed by the cdu and the csu have said they will not accept any prisoners .
growing debate the debate over the guantanamo prisoner issue intensified in recent weeks after it emerged that berlin resumed talks with washington over the possibility of accommodating released prisoners .
the german news magazine der spiegel reported last month that a delegation from berlin visited guantanamo recently to meet with several inmates , including a palestinian , a jordanian and a syrian who are likely candidates for resettlement .
the report also said that the inmates had been interviewed by german intelligence and police officials to determine their suitability and whether they would pose any risks if they were taken in .
president obama had pledged to close down the guantanamo camp by january this year , but some 200 detainees continue to be held there because finding them new homes is proving a major challenge .
his administration has been reluctant to send released prisoners back to their home countries because of fears for their safety .
amnesty criticizes germany meanwhile , the head of the german branch of human rights watchdog amnesty international , monika lueke , has criticized germany 's response to obama 's call for europe to accept freed guantanamo prisoners .
" german stands almost at the bottom of the list in europe where accepting guantanamo prisoners is concerned , " lueke said .
she added that other european countries have clearly understood that they " make a substantial contribution to increasing their own security " by accepting freed inmates .

interest rates are to be set at 5.1 percent , significantly lower than the 7.5 percent markets have been offering .
sources said the deal was almost a " carbon copy " of imf terms .
jean-claude juncker , who heads the eurogroup , and european monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn are scheduled to announce details of the plan on sunday .
" there will be a teleconference on sunday on greece in the usual eurogroup composition , " guy schuller , a spokesman for juncker , said .
" greece has not asked for help , but you have to be ready if they do " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner says the euro will survive greek debt crisis loaded gun greek prime minister george papandreou told to vima newspaper that athens may be forced to use the financial rescue package to tackle its 300-billion debt if markets remain skeptical as speculation mounts that greece could default .
papandrreou said that with the terms now set the gun on the table will be loaded .
speculators will know this , he added .
" the question remains whether this mechanism will convince markets just as a gun on the table .
if it does not convince them , it is a mechanism that is there to be used , " papandreou said .
papandreou has vowed that greece had no plans of leaving the euro-zone .
" the euro is not to blame for our problems .

some two million people are expected to view it . the shroud will be on public view for six weeks at the turin cathedral .
it 's kept in a bullet-proof and climate-controlled case .
discovered in the mid-14th century in the french city of troyes , the shroud of turin is said to have been imprinted with an image of christ 's crucified body .
in 1898 , secondo pia , a lawyer and amateur photographer , obtained a negative image of the 4.4-meter shroud in which jesus was buried with far more striking features than those of the natural , sepia-colored positive .
the real thing or a medieval fake ?
samples of the blood-stained fabric were analyzed in 1988 using radiocarbon dating .
the analysis determined that the fibers in the cloth date from the middle ages , but those findings have been challenged .
the vatican has never confirmed the shroud 's authenticity . turin cardinal severino poletto , who led the opening ceremony in turin 's cathedral saturday , referred to the debate over the shroud 's authenticity , saying it was " not up to the church but for science to decide . "
poletto told ansa news agency that the shroud was a testament to " hidden suffering endured in silence between tears and despair . "
bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is shown a copy of the shroud of turin he recalled that the late pope john paul ii said the shroud evoked thoughts of the " millions of men who die of hunger , of the horrors perpetrated in so many wars -lrb- and -rrb- the brutal exploitation of women and children . "
pope benedict xvi will travel to turin to see the shroud on may 2 .
benedict said his visit would be " a propitious occasion to contemplate this mysterious visage that speaks silently to the heart of men , inviting them to recognize the face of god .

fidesz holds almost 30 percent lead over the ruling socialists , according to recent opinion polls .
fidesz party leader viktor orban has called the election a " moment of truth " and drawn comparisons with historical revolutions and the end of communism in 1990 .

meanwhile , russian officals continue to investigate the cause of the plane crash that killed all 96 on board . the body of polish president lech kaczynski has returned to warsaw , a day after the president and many of the country 's political and cultural elite died in a plane crash in western russia .
the president 's twin brother jaroslaw , poland 's acting president bronislaw komorowski and prime minister donald tusk met the coffin at warsaw 's military airport , where it was draped in the national flag .
first to kneel before the coffin was kaczynski 's adult daughter marta .
she was followed by the president 's identical twin jaroslaw , a former premier who now leads the conservative opposition .
he placed his hand briefly on his dead brother 's casket , before making the sign of the cross .
the coffin was then placed in a hearse as a military orchestra played the funeral march by 19th century franco-polish composer frederic chopin .
grief-stricken nation tens of thousands of mourners turned out to pay their respects , tossing flowers as the hearse as it made its way to the presidential palace in warsaw , where kacynski 's coffin is expected to lie in view .
" regardless of whether one agreed with his politics , or his views - and i did n't - he was our president , and he died tragically , " andrzej gerula , a 26-year-old computer programmer , told the afp news agency .
" he deserves our respect and our homage .
that 's why i 've come . "
at noon , poland observed two minutes of silence .
millions of mourners across this staunchly roman catholic nation packed into churches all through sunday to pray for the dead .
bildunterschrift : the remains of the other victims , including poland 's first lady and high-ranking cabinet members , were sent to moscow for identification before being returned to poland .
poland will observe a week of mourning to commemorate the crash , which prime minister donald tusk has called the worst tragedy in poland since world war two .
weather to blame ?
in moscow , an investigation into the crash continues , with authorities examining in-flight recordings for evidence of what caused the plane to come down just short of the runaway where it was trying to land . so far , russia says no technical glitches were to blame .
" the recordings that we have confirm there were no technical problems with the plane , " said alexander bastrykin , head of the prosecutor general 's office .

interest rates are to be set at 5.1 percent , significantly lower than the 7.5 percent markets have been offering .
sources said the deal was almost a " carbon copy " of imf terms .
jean-claude juncker , who heads the eurogroup , and european monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn are scheduled to announce details of the plan on sunday .
" there will be a teleconference on sunday on greece in the usual eurogroup composition , " guy schuller , a spokesman for juncker , said .
" greece has not asked for help , but you have to be ready if they do " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner says the euro will survive greek debt crisis loaded gun greek prime minister george papandreou told to vima newspaper that athens may be forced to use the financial rescue package to tackle its 300-billion debt if markets remain skeptical as speculation mounts that greece could default .
papandrreou said that with the terms now set the gun on the table will be loaded .
speculators will know this , he added .
" the question remains whether this mechanism will convince markets just as a gun on the table .
if it does not convince them , it is a mechanism that is there to be used , " papandreou said .
papandreou has vowed that greece had no plans of leaving the euro-zone .
" the euro is not to blame for our problems .
greece belongs in the euro-zone .
any other scenario is ridiculous , " he said .
spanish foreign minister angel moratinos , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , was optimistic : " i am quite optimistic that we are again able to show solidarity and above all send a message to the speculators that the euro-zone is strong and firm . "
eu leaders last month agreed to a bailout plan for greece as a last resort , with the eu providing much of the funding through direct loans and the imf also providing assistance . nrt / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 11.04.2010 more beef : how europe can regain clout in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the failure to focus on substance has weakened the eu 's standing european officials are anxious about whether washington still views them as strong players on the world stage .
to strengthen ties they have to further unify eu foreign policy and focus on the issues , analysts say . when us president barack obama announced early in februray that he would not attend an eu-us summit designed to launch the new european leadership , pundits were quick to interpret this as a sure sign of europe being downgraded on the world stage .
although washington officials insisted that obama 's cancellation was due to an overloaded domestic agenda , europeans could not shake off the feeling that obama is giving them the cold shoulder .
now european nations will have to contend with an obama administration basking in the glow of a number of recent successful policy achievements starting with health care reform and ending with the signing of the arms reduction treaty with russia this week .
obama certainly wants european countries on board at the washington disarmament conference next week in his quest for a nuclear-free world , however he knows he can bargain from a position of strength .
german chancellor angela merkel is due to attend the nuclear security summit and aside from afghanistan and iran , obama has made progress on nuclear security a top priority on his foreign policy agenda .
therefore analysts believe that merkel 's presence at the summit will be very much appreciated in washington .
however , the problematic question will be how germany 's desire to have us tactical nuclear weapons removed from its soil can be reconciled with the american view of the weapons as an important security asset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european council president herman van rompuy : " the charisma of a damp rag " so can europe present a united front in washington ?
the eu-us summit planned for april was supposed to be the first since the lisbon treaty came into force in december 2009 which created the posts of eu president and high representative for foreign affairs .
washington : lisbon a missed opportunity analysts say that there is a strong impression in washington that the europeans have wasted the chance offered by lisbon to streamline their diplomacy and foreign-policy structures .
" there is a real sense that the us may have to show some tough love and tell its european counterparts very bluntly that it wants to work with a more unified europe and that its disappointed by the way things have been going over the last few months , " new york based richard gowan , policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
instead of one there are now at least four voices speaking for europe : the new permanent eu president , the still persisting six-month rotating presidency , the high representative , and the president of the european commission .
the problem , once raised by henry kissinger , of who to call when you want to talk to europe , has not exactly been solved by the lisbon treaty .
us focus on emerging powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing dialogue : obama and his chinese counterpart hu jintao another factor contributing to the europeans ' nervousness is obama 's focus on reaching out to emerging powers like brazil , india and above all china .
" the obama government has set out to form a closer political and economic relationship with china , raising fears in europe that such a g-2 could further reduce europe 's influence in the world , " the center for european reform said in a recent study .
obama 's attempt to adapt international political structures to meet the rise of the new superpowers is also encapsulated in his administration 's advocacy for the g20 in which china and india are full members .
" obama 's administration has decided to replace the g8 with the g20 as the premier forum of economic discussion .
it sees the g20 as an institution which brings new and established economic powers together .
the europeans feel rather downgraded by this prioritization , " gowan said .
on the other hand , gowan points out that european countries themselves have invested a lot in attempting to improve their relationship with china .
it should not come as a surprise that the us has a vital interest to do the same .
some analysts say that the growing importance of china does not necessarily take away from the strength of the transatlantic partnership .
" you have to differentiate between who is becoming most important in terms of challenges and economic cooperation and who is your natural partner .
the g2 already exists between the us and europe if you look at investment , jobs creation , and trade .
almost two thirds of the world 's economic activity still happens between the us and europe , " jan-friedrich kallmorgen , former head of the transatlantic program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
so while there might be a growing dialogue between the us and china , it is still far away from the kind of transatlantic cooperation that everyone has become accustomed to in europe .
common foreign policy goals overall , the eu and the us share many foreign policy goals and there is a lot more consensus than there was in the bush years .
both sides acknowledge that tackling climate change is a priority and that they need to make progress on international financial regulation .
they also seem to be on the same page when it comes to dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions and the situation in afghanistan .
while obama is said to be disappointed about the small number of extra troops from europe , his new approach to afghanistan is much closer to european - and in particular german - priorities .
" the concept that civil measures like police training , legal education and business administration should increasingly play a role in afghanistan has gained considerable ground in washington , " explains kallmorgen .
merkel in a strong position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " merkel is the leader you have to do buisness with in europe " although germany has been a difficult partner on afghanistan , analysts believe that german-us ties are still going strong .
according to gowan , german chancellor merkel may well be the most important european figure when it comes to transatlantic cooperation .
" merkel still represents the leader that you have to do business with in europe .
gordon brown faces electoral defeat , neither zapatero nor berlusconi have really impressed the current administration , and sarkozy is understood to be very critical of obama in private , " he explains .
on a personal level , you do not see the kind of public display of affection forced onto merkel by former president george w. bush .
but on a working level , gowan says she represents a stable partner for obama who has just been reelected and will be around for quite some time .
it is with these bread and butter issues that europeans will try to gain ground in relations with washington .
many commentators believe that instead of quarrelling over who shakes obama 's hand first and sulking over a summit no-show , european leaders should offer concrete foreign policy agreements and deliver on issues like financial regulation and international security .
maybe if there is more beef on the menu next time the eu invites obama over for dinner , he will gladly accept .

" merkel still represents the leader that you have to do business with in europe .
gordon brown faces electoral defeat , neither zapatero nor berlusconi have really impressed the current administration , and sarkozy is understood to be very critical of obama in private , " he explains .

but on a working level , gowan says she represents a stable partner for obama who has just been reelected and will be around for quite some time .
it is with these bread and butter issues that europeans will try to gain ground in relations with washington .
many commentators believe that instead of quarrelling over who shakes obama 's hand first and sulking over a summit no-show , european leaders should offer concrete foreign policy agreements and deliver on issues like financial regulation and international security .
maybe if there is more beef on the menu next time the eu invites obama over for dinner , he will gladly accept .

to strengthen ties they have to further unify eu foreign policy and focus on the issues , analysts say . when us president barack obama announced early in februray that he would not attend an eu-us summit designed to launch the new european leadership , pundits were quick to interpret this as a sure sign of europe being downgraded on the world stage .
although washington officials insisted that obama 's cancellation was due to an overloaded domestic agenda , europeans could not shake off the feeling that obama is giving them the cold shoulder .
now european nations will have to contend with an obama administration basking in the glow of a number of recent successful policy achievements starting with health care reform and ending with the signing of the arms reduction treaty with russia this week .
obama certainly wants european countries on board at the washington disarmament conference next week in his quest for a nuclear-free world , however he knows he can bargain from a position of strength .
german chancellor angela merkel is due to attend the nuclear security summit and aside from afghanistan and iran , obama has made progress on nuclear security a top priority on his foreign policy agenda .
therefore analysts believe that merkel 's presence at the summit will be very much appreciated in washington .
however , the problematic question will be how germany 's desire to have us tactical nuclear weapons removed from its soil can be reconciled with the american view of the weapons as an important security asset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european council president herman van rompuy : " the charisma of a damp rag " so can europe present a united front in washington ?
the eu-us summit planned for april was supposed to be the first since the lisbon treaty came into force in december 2009 which created the posts of eu president and high representative for foreign affairs .
washington : lisbon a missed opportunity analysts say that there is a strong impression in washington that the europeans have wasted the chance offered by lisbon to streamline their diplomacy and foreign-policy structures .
" there is a real sense that the us may have to show some tough love and tell its european counterparts very bluntly that it wants to work with a more unified europe and that its disappointed by the way things have been going over the last few months , " new york based richard gowan , policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
instead of one there are now at least four voices speaking for europe : the new permanent eu president , the still persisting six-month rotating presidency , the high representative , and the president of the european commission .
the problem , once raised by henry kissinger , of who to call when you want to talk to europe , has not exactly been solved by the lisbon treaty .
us focus on emerging powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing dialogue : obama and his chinese counterpart hu jintao another factor contributing to the europeans ' nervousness is obama 's focus on reaching out to emerging powers like brazil , india and above all china .
" the obama government has set out to form a closer political and economic relationship with china , raising fears in europe that such a g-2 could further reduce europe 's influence in the world , " the center for european reform said in a recent study .
obama 's attempt to adapt international political structures to meet the rise of the new superpowers is also encapsulated in his administration 's advocacy for the g20 in which china and india are full members .
" obama 's administration has decided to replace the g8 with the g20 as the premier forum of economic discussion .
it sees the g20 as an institution which brings new and established economic powers together .
the europeans feel rather downgraded by this prioritization , " gowan said .
on the other hand , gowan points out that european countries themselves have invested a lot in attempting to improve their relationship with china .
it should not come as a surprise that the us has a vital interest to do the same .
some analysts say that the growing importance of china does not necessarily take away from the strength of the transatlantic partnership .
" you have to differentiate between who is becoming most important in terms of challenges and economic cooperation and who is your natural partner .
the g2 already exists between the us and europe if you look at investment , jobs creation , and trade .
almost two thirds of the world 's economic activity still happens between the us and europe , " jan-friedrich kallmorgen , former head of the transatlantic program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
so while there might be a growing dialogue between the us and china , it is still far away from the kind of transatlantic cooperation that everyone has become accustomed to in europe .
common foreign policy goals overall , the eu and the us share many foreign policy goals and there is a lot more consensus than there was in the bush years .
both sides acknowledge that tackling climate change is a priority and that they need to make progress on international financial regulation .
they also seem to be on the same page when it comes to dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions and the situation in afghanistan .
while obama is said to be disappointed about the small number of extra troops from europe , his new approach to afghanistan is much closer to european - and in particular german - priorities .
" the concept that civil measures like police training , legal education and business administration should increasingly play a role in afghanistan has gained considerable ground in washington , " explains kallmorgen .
merkel in a strong position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " merkel is the leader you have to do buisness with in europe " although germany has been a difficult partner on afghanistan , analysts believe that german-us ties are still going strong .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 11.04.2010 more beef : how europe can regain clout in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the failure to focus on substance has weakened the eu 's standing european officials are anxious about whether washington still views them as strong players on the world stage .
to strengthen ties they have to further unify eu foreign policy and focus on the issues , analysts say . when us president barack obama announced early in februray that he would not attend an eu-us summit designed to launch the new european leadership , pundits were quick to interpret this as a sure sign of europe being downgraded on the world stage .
although washington officials insisted that obama 's cancellation was due to an overloaded domestic agenda , europeans could not shake off the feeling that obama is giving them the cold shoulder .
now european nations will have to contend with an obama administration basking in the glow of a number of recent successful policy achievements starting with health care reform and ending with the signing of the arms reduction treaty with russia this week .
obama certainly wants european countries on board at the washington disarmament conference next week in his quest for a nuclear-free world , however he knows he can bargain from a position of strength .
german chancellor angela merkel is due to attend the nuclear security summit and aside from afghanistan and iran , obama has made progress on nuclear security a top priority on his foreign policy agenda .
therefore analysts believe that merkel 's presence at the summit will be very much appreciated in washington .
however , the problematic question will be how germany 's desire to have us tactical nuclear weapons removed from its soil can be reconciled with the american view of the weapons as an important security asset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european council president herman van rompuy : " the charisma of a damp rag " so can europe present a united front in washington ?
the eu-us summit planned for april was supposed to be the first since the lisbon treaty came into force in december 2009 which created the posts of eu president and high representative for foreign affairs .
washington : lisbon a missed opportunity analysts say that there is a strong impression in washington that the europeans have wasted the chance offered by lisbon to streamline their diplomacy and foreign-policy structures .
" there is a real sense that the us may have to show some tough love and tell its european counterparts very bluntly that it wants to work with a more unified europe and that its disappointed by the way things have been going over the last few months , " new york based richard gowan , policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
instead of one there are now at least four voices speaking for europe : the new permanent eu president , the still persisting six-month rotating presidency , the high representative , and the president of the european commission .
the problem , once raised by henry kissinger , of who to call when you want to talk to europe , has not exactly been solved by the lisbon treaty .
us focus on emerging powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing dialogue : obama and his chinese counterpart hu jintao another factor contributing to the europeans ' nervousness is obama 's focus on reaching out to emerging powers like brazil , india and above all china .
" the obama government has set out to form a closer political and economic relationship with china , raising fears in europe that such a g-2 could further reduce europe 's influence in the world , " the center for european reform said in a recent study .
obama 's attempt to adapt international political structures to meet the rise of the new superpowers is also encapsulated in his administration 's advocacy for the g20 in which china and india are full members .
" obama 's administration has decided to replace the g8 with the g20 as the premier forum of economic discussion .
it sees the g20 as an institution which brings new and established economic powers together .
the europeans feel rather downgraded by this prioritization , " gowan said .
on the other hand , gowan points out that european countries themselves have invested a lot in attempting to improve their relationship with china .
it should not come as a surprise that the us has a vital interest to do the same .
some analysts say that the growing importance of china does not necessarily take away from the strength of the transatlantic partnership .
" you have to differentiate between who is becoming most important in terms of challenges and economic cooperation and who is your natural partner .
the g2 already exists between the us and europe if you look at investment , jobs creation , and trade .
almost two thirds of the world 's economic activity still happens between the us and europe , " jan-friedrich kallmorgen , former head of the transatlantic program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
so while there might be a growing dialogue between the us and china , it is still far away from the kind of transatlantic cooperation that everyone has become accustomed to in europe .
common foreign policy goals overall , the eu and the us share many foreign policy goals and there is a lot more consensus than there was in the bush years .
both sides acknowledge that tackling climate change is a priority and that they need to make progress on international financial regulation .
they also seem to be on the same page when it comes to dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions and the situation in afghanistan .
while obama is said to be disappointed about the small number of extra troops from europe , his new approach to afghanistan is much closer to european - and in particular german - priorities .
" the concept that civil measures like police training , legal education and business administration should increasingly play a role in afghanistan has gained considerable ground in washington , " explains kallmorgen .
merkel in a strong position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " merkel is the leader you have to do buisness with in europe " although germany has been a difficult partner on afghanistan , analysts believe that german-us ties are still going strong .
according to gowan , german chancellor merkel may well be the most important european figure when it comes to transatlantic cooperation .
" merkel still represents the leader that you have to do business with in europe .
gordon brown faces electoral defeat , neither zapatero nor berlusconi have really impressed the current administration , and sarkozy is understood to be very critical of obama in private , " he explains .
on a personal level , you do not see the kind of public display of affection forced onto merkel by former president george w. bush .
but on a working level , gowan says she represents a stable partner for obama who has just been reelected and will be around for quite some time .
it is with these bread and butter issues that europeans will try to gain ground in relations with washington .
many commentators believe that instead of quarrelling over who shakes obama 's hand first and sulking over a summit no-show , european leaders should offer concrete foreign policy agreements and deliver on issues like financial regulation and international security .
maybe if there is more beef on the menu next time the eu invites obama over for dinner , he will gladly accept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european council president herman van rompuy : " the charisma of a damp rag " so can europe present a united front in washington ?
the eu-us summit planned for april was supposed to be the first since the lisbon treaty came into force in december 2009 which created the posts of eu president and high representative for foreign affairs .
washington : lisbon a missed opportunity analysts say that there is a strong impression in washington that the europeans have wasted the chance offered by lisbon to streamline their diplomacy and foreign-policy structures .
" there is a real sense that the us may have to show some tough love and tell its european counterparts very bluntly that it wants to work with a more unified europe and that its disappointed by the way things have been going over the last few months , " new york based richard gowan , policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
instead of one there are now at least four voices speaking for europe : the new permanent eu president , the still persisting six-month rotating presidency , the high representative , and the president of the european commission .
the problem , once raised by henry kissinger , of who to call when you want to talk to europe , has not exactly been solved by the lisbon treaty .
us focus on emerging powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing dialogue : obama and his chinese counterpart hu jintao another factor contributing to the europeans ' nervousness is obama 's focus on reaching out to emerging powers like brazil , india and above all china .
" the obama government has set out to form a closer political and economic relationship with china , raising fears in europe that such a g-2 could further reduce europe 's influence in the world , " the center for european reform said in a recent study .
obama 's attempt to adapt international political structures to meet the rise of the new superpowers is also encapsulated in his administration 's advocacy for the g20 in which china and india are full members .
" obama 's administration has decided to replace the g8 with the g20 as the premier forum of economic discussion .
it sees the g20 as an institution which brings new and established economic powers together .
the europeans feel rather downgraded by this prioritization , " gowan said .
on the other hand , gowan points out that european countries themselves have invested a lot in attempting to improve their relationship with china .
it should not come as a surprise that the us has a vital interest to do the same .
some analysts say that the growing importance of china does not necessarily take away from the strength of the transatlantic partnership .
" you have to differentiate between who is becoming most important in terms of challenges and economic cooperation and who is your natural partner .
the g2 already exists between the us and europe if you look at investment , jobs creation , and trade .
almost two thirds of the world 's economic activity still happens between the us and europe , " jan-friedrich kallmorgen , former head of the transatlantic program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
so while there might be a growing dialogue between the us and china , it is still far away from the kind of transatlantic cooperation that everyone has become accustomed to in europe .
common foreign policy goals overall , the eu and the us share many foreign policy goals and there is a lot more consensus than there was in the bush years .
both sides acknowledge that tackling climate change is a priority and that they need to make progress on international financial regulation .
they also seem to be on the same page when it comes to dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions and the situation in afghanistan .
while obama is said to be disappointed about the small number of extra troops from europe , his new approach to afghanistan is much closer to european - and in particular german - priorities .
" the concept that civil measures like police training , legal education and business administration should increasingly play a role in afghanistan has gained considerable ground in washington , " explains kallmorgen .
merkel in a strong position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " merkel is the leader you have to do buisness with in europe " although germany has been a difficult partner on afghanistan , analysts believe that german-us ties are still going strong .
according to gowan , german chancellor merkel may well be the most important european figure when it comes to transatlantic cooperation .
" merkel still represents the leader that you have to do business with in europe .
gordon brown faces electoral defeat , neither zapatero nor berlusconi have really impressed the current administration , and sarkozy is understood to be very critical of obama in private , " he explains .
on a personal level , you do not see the kind of public display of affection forced onto merkel by former president george w. bush .
but on a working level , gowan says she represents a stable partner for obama who has just been reelected and will be around for quite some time .
it is with these bread and butter issues that europeans will try to gain ground in relations with washington .
many commentators believe that instead of quarrelling over who shakes obama 's hand first and sulking over a summit no-show , european leaders should offer concrete foreign policy agreements and deliver on issues like financial regulation and international security .
maybe if there is more beef on the menu next time the eu invites obama over for dinner , he will gladly accept .

while obama is said to be disappointed about the small number of extra troops from europe , his new approach to afghanistan is much closer to european - and in particular german - priorities .
" the concept that civil measures like police training , legal education and business administration should increasingly play a role in afghanistan has gained considerable ground in washington , " explains kallmorgen .
merkel in a strong position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " merkel is the leader you have to do buisness with in europe " although germany has been a difficult partner on afghanistan , analysts believe that german-us ties are still going strong .
according to gowan , german chancellor merkel may well be the most important european figure when it comes to transatlantic cooperation .
" merkel still represents the leader that you have to do business with in europe .
gordon brown faces electoral defeat , neither zapatero nor berlusconi have really impressed the current administration , and sarkozy is understood to be very critical of obama in private , " he explains .
on a personal level , you do not see the kind of public display of affection forced onto merkel by former president george w. bush .
but on a working level , gowan says she represents a stable partner for obama who has just been reelected and will be around for quite some time .
it is with these bread and butter issues that europeans will try to gain ground in relations with washington .
many commentators believe that instead of quarrelling over who shakes obama 's hand first and sulking over a summit no-show , european leaders should offer concrete foreign policy agreements and deliver on issues like financial regulation and international security .
maybe if there is more beef on the menu next time the eu invites obama over for dinner , he will gladly accept .

to strengthen ties they have to further unify eu foreign policy and focus on the issues , analysts say . when us president barack obama announced early in februray that he would not attend an eu-us summit designed to launch the new european leadership , pundits were quick to interpret this as a sure sign of europe being downgraded on the world stage .
although washington officials insisted that obama 's cancellation was due to an overloaded domestic agenda , europeans could not shake off the feeling that obama is giving them the cold shoulder .
now european nations will have to contend with an obama administration basking in the glow of a number of recent successful policy achievements starting with health care reform and ending with the signing of the arms reduction treaty with russia this week .
obama certainly wants european countries on board at the washington disarmament conference next week in his quest for a nuclear-free world , however he knows he can bargain from a position of strength .
german chancellor angela merkel is due to attend the nuclear security summit and aside from afghanistan and iran , obama has made progress on nuclear security a top priority on his foreign policy agenda .
therefore analysts believe that merkel 's presence at the summit will be very much appreciated in washington .
however , the problematic question will be how germany 's desire to have us tactical nuclear weapons removed from its soil can be reconciled with the american view of the weapons as an important security asset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european council president herman van rompuy : " the charisma of a damp rag " so can europe present a united front in washington ?
the eu-us summit planned for april was supposed to be the first since the lisbon treaty came into force in december 2009 which created the posts of eu president and high representative for foreign affairs .
washington : lisbon a missed opportunity analysts say that there is a strong impression in washington that the europeans have wasted the chance offered by lisbon to streamline their diplomacy and foreign-policy structures .
" there is a real sense that the us may have to show some tough love and tell its european counterparts very bluntly that it wants to work with a more unified europe and that its disappointed by the way things have been going over the last few months , " new york based richard gowan , policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
instead of one there are now at least four voices speaking for europe : the new permanent eu president , the still persisting six-month rotating presidency , the high representative , and the president of the european commission .
the problem , once raised by henry kissinger , of who to call when you want to talk to europe , has not exactly been solved by the lisbon treaty .
us focus on emerging powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing dialogue : obama and his chinese counterpart hu jintao another factor contributing to the europeans ' nervousness is obama 's focus on reaching out to emerging powers like brazil , india and above all china .
" the obama government has set out to form a closer political and economic relationship with china , raising fears in europe that such a g-2 could further reduce europe 's influence in the world , " the center for european reform said in a recent study .
obama 's attempt to adapt international political structures to meet the rise of the new superpowers is also encapsulated in his administration 's advocacy for the g20 in which china and india are full members .
" obama 's administration has decided to replace the g8 with the g20 as the premier forum of economic discussion .
it sees the g20 as an institution which brings new and established economic powers together .
the europeans feel rather downgraded by this prioritization , " gowan said .
on the other hand , gowan points out that european countries themselves have invested a lot in attempting to improve their relationship with china .
it should not come as a surprise that the us has a vital interest to do the same .
some analysts say that the growing importance of china does not necessarily take away from the strength of the transatlantic partnership .
" you have to differentiate between who is becoming most important in terms of challenges and economic cooperation and who is your natural partner .
the g2 already exists between the us and europe if you look at investment , jobs creation , and trade .
almost two thirds of the world 's economic activity still happens between the us and europe , " jan-friedrich kallmorgen , former head of the transatlantic program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
so while there might be a growing dialogue between the us and china , it is still far away from the kind of transatlantic cooperation that everyone has become accustomed to in europe .
common foreign policy goals overall , the eu and the us share many foreign policy goals and there is a lot more consensus than there was in the bush years .
both sides acknowledge that tackling climate change is a priority and that they need to make progress on international financial regulation .
they also seem to be on the same page when it comes to dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions and the situation in afghanistan .
while obama is said to be disappointed about the small number of extra troops from europe , his new approach to afghanistan is much closer to european - and in particular german - priorities .

to strengthen ties they have to further unify eu foreign policy and focus on the issues , analysts say . when us president barack obama announced early in februray that he would not attend an eu-us summit designed to launch the new european leadership , pundits were quick to interpret this as a sure sign of europe being downgraded on the world stage .
although washington officials insisted that obama 's cancellation was due to an overloaded domestic agenda , europeans could not shake off the feeling that obama is giving them the cold shoulder .
now european nations will have to contend with an obama administration basking in the glow of a number of recent successful policy achievements starting with health care reform and ending with the signing of the arms reduction treaty with russia this week .
obama certainly wants european countries on board at the washington disarmament conference next week in his quest for a nuclear-free world , however he knows he can bargain from a position of strength .
german chancellor angela merkel is due to attend the nuclear security summit and aside from afghanistan and iran , obama has made progress on nuclear security a top priority on his foreign policy agenda .
therefore analysts believe that merkel 's presence at the summit will be very much appreciated in washington .
however , the problematic question will be how germany 's desire to have us tactical nuclear weapons removed from its soil can be reconciled with the american view of the weapons as an important security asset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european council president herman van rompuy : " the charisma of a damp rag " so can europe present a united front in washington ?
the eu-us summit planned for april was supposed to be the first since the lisbon treaty came into force in december 2009 which created the posts of eu president and high representative for foreign affairs .
washington : lisbon a missed opportunity analysts say that there is a strong impression in washington that the europeans have wasted the chance offered by lisbon to streamline their diplomacy and foreign-policy structures .
" there is a real sense that the us may have to show some tough love and tell its european counterparts very bluntly that it wants to work with a more unified europe and that its disappointed by the way things have been going over the last few months , " new york based richard gowan , policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
instead of one there are now at least four voices speaking for europe : the new permanent eu president , the still persisting six-month rotating presidency , the high representative , and the president of the european commission .
the problem , once raised by henry kissinger , of who to call when you want to talk to europe , has not exactly been solved by the lisbon treaty .
us focus on emerging powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing dialogue : obama and his chinese counterpart hu jintao another factor contributing to the europeans ' nervousness is obama 's focus on reaching out to emerging powers like brazil , india and above all china .
" the obama government has set out to form a closer political and economic relationship with china , raising fears in europe that such a g-2 could further reduce europe 's influence in the world , " the center for european reform said in a recent study .
obama 's attempt to adapt international political structures to meet the rise of the new superpowers is also encapsulated in his administration 's advocacy for the g20 in which china and india are full members .
" obama 's administration has decided to replace the g8 with the g20 as the premier forum of economic discussion .
it sees the g20 as an institution which brings new and established economic powers together .
the europeans feel rather downgraded by this prioritization , " gowan said .
on the other hand , gowan points out that european countries themselves have invested a lot in attempting to improve their relationship with china .
it should not come as a surprise that the us has a vital interest to do the same .
some analysts say that the growing importance of china does not necessarily take away from the strength of the transatlantic partnership .
" you have to differentiate between who is becoming most important in terms of challenges and economic cooperation and who is your natural partner .
the g2 already exists between the us and europe if you look at investment , jobs creation , and trade .
almost two thirds of the world 's economic activity still happens between the us and europe , " jan-friedrich kallmorgen , former head of the transatlantic program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
so while there might be a growing dialogue between the us and china , it is still far away from the kind of transatlantic cooperation that everyone has become accustomed to in europe .
common foreign policy goals overall , the eu and the us share many foreign policy goals and there is a lot more consensus than there was in the bush years .
both sides acknowledge that tackling climate change is a priority and that they need to make progress on international financial regulation .
they also seem to be on the same page when it comes to dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions and the situation in afghanistan .
while obama is said to be disappointed about the small number of extra troops from europe , his new approach to afghanistan is much closer to european - and in particular german - priorities .
" the concept that civil measures like police training , legal education and business administration should increasingly play a role in afghanistan has gained considerable ground in washington , " explains kallmorgen .
merkel in a strong position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " merkel is the leader you have to do buisness with in europe " although germany has been a difficult partner on afghanistan , analysts believe that german-us ties are still going strong .
according to gowan , german chancellor merkel may well be the most important european figure when it comes to transatlantic cooperation .
" merkel still represents the leader that you have to do business with in europe .
gordon brown faces electoral defeat , neither zapatero nor berlusconi have really impressed the current administration , and sarkozy is understood to be very critical of obama in private , " he explains .
on a personal level , you do not see the kind of public display of affection forced onto merkel by former president george w. bush .
but on a working level , gowan says she represents a stable partner for obama who has just been reelected and will be around for quite some time .
it is with these bread and butter issues that europeans will try to gain ground in relations with washington .
many commentators believe that instead of quarrelling over who shakes obama 's hand first and sulking over a summit no-show , european leaders should offer concrete foreign policy agreements and deliver on issues like financial regulation and international security .
maybe if there is more beef on the menu next time the eu invites obama over for dinner , he will gladly accept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 11.04.2010 center-right poised to dominate hungarian elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in traditional dresses cast their votes in the village of veresegyhaz hungary votes on sunday in an election in which the governing socialists are set to suffer a major defeat at the hands of the center-right .
the far-right jobbik party could come in second place . the political map of hungary is poised to be completely redrawn as the center-right opposition fidesz party is widely expected to trounce the socialists on sunday in national general elections .
fidesz holds almost 30 percent lead over the ruling socialists , according to recent opinion polls .
fidesz party leader viktor orban has called the election a " moment of truth " and drawn comparisons with historical revolutions and the end of communism in 1990 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidesz chief viktor orban with wife aniko levai his party has long held a lead in the opinion polls , with recent polls indicating fidesz has a 60 percent approval rating among decided voters .
support for the socialist party has been at rock bottom since shortly after re-election in 2006 and the leaking of a speech in which former prime minister ferenc gyurcsany acknowledged the party had lied to the public .
the woes of the hungarian left have since been compounded by a series of high-profile corruption scandals involving socialist politicians - not to mention hungary 's being hit especially hard by the economic crisis and a 25-billion-dollar international bail-out that eventually led gyurcsany to resign .
if fidesz wins two-thirds of the seats in parliament , it could give the party a platform for broad structural reform .
fidesz has promised to create one million jobs over 10 years , boost lending , support small business and slash taxes .
those promises have resonated with voters , who are looking to the party to improve their living standards .
far-right surge far-right nationalist party jobbik is also set to do well , polling between 8 and 11 percent .
it will likely get enough support to enter parliament for the first time and could even beat the socialists in the voting booth , becoming the second-biggest party in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabor vona is jobbik 's prime ministerial candidate founded in 2003 , jobbik uses strong anti-roma and anti-semitic rhetoric .
it has capitalized on public anger over job losses and corruption and has built on resentment towards the large roma minority , which it blames for many of the country 's ills .
in 2007 , jobbik established the hungarian guard , which dresses in uniforms resembling those worn by the country 's pre-world war ii fascists .
" i will be wearing my hungarian guard tunic when i enter on the first day of parliament , " party leader gabor vona told supporters in budapest .
fidesz has said it will not enter into a coalition with the jobbik party , no matter the result of the election .
proportional representation in the first round on april 11 , hungarian voters will place two ticks : one at the name of the candidate they want to directly represent their local constituency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of far-right paramilitary hungarian guard march during a demonstration the second mark goes at the name of a party fielding a regional list , and over half of 386 seats in parliament will be decided on a proportional representation basis .
a second round of voting , on april 25 , will finalize those constituencies and lists where no candidate won an absolute majority or voting was inconclusive due to low turnout in the first round .
in order to enter parliament a party must poll at least five percent of the national vote .
the poll was expected to close at 1700 gmt , but the national election committee said many polling stations would stay open longer because voters were still waiting to cast ballots in several places. cb / dpa / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the topic is expected to figure during the chancellor 's meeting with president obama . the deputy parliamentary floor leader of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper that " germany should not leave the american president alone " in this matter .

president obama had pledged to close down the guantanamo camp by january this year , but some 200 detainees continue to be held there because finding them new homes is proving a major challenge .

president obama had pledged to close down the guantanamo camp by january this year , but some 200 detainees continue to be held there because finding them new homes is proving a major challenge .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 11.04.2010 center-right poised to dominate hungarian elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in traditional dresses cast their votes in the village of veresegyhaz hungary votes on sunday in an election in which the governing socialists are set to suffer a major defeat at the hands of the center-right .
the far-right jobbik party could come in second place . the political map of hungary is poised to be completely redrawn as the center-right opposition fidesz party is widely expected to trounce the socialists on sunday in national general elections .
fidesz holds almost 30 percent lead over the ruling socialists , according to recent opinion polls .
fidesz party leader viktor orban has called the election a " moment of truth " and drawn comparisons with historical revolutions and the end of communism in 1990 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidesz chief viktor orban with wife aniko levai his party has long held a lead in the opinion polls , with recent polls indicating fidesz has a 60 percent approval rating among decided voters .
support for the socialist party has been at rock bottom since shortly after re-election in 2006 and the leaking of a speech in which former prime minister ferenc gyurcsany acknowledged the party had lied to the public .
the woes of the hungarian left have since been compounded by a series of high-profile corruption scandals involving socialist politicians - not to mention hungary 's being hit especially hard by the economic crisis and a 25-billion-dollar international bail-out that eventually led gyurcsany to resign .
if fidesz wins two-thirds of the seats in parliament , it could give the party a platform for broad structural reform .
fidesz has promised to create one million jobs over 10 years , boost lending , support small business and slash taxes .
those promises have resonated with voters , who are looking to the party to improve their living standards .
far-right surge far-right nationalist party jobbik is also set to do well , polling between 8 and 11 percent .
it will likely get enough support to enter parliament for the first time and could even beat the socialists in the voting booth , becoming the second-biggest party in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabor vona is jobbik 's prime ministerial candidate founded in 2003 , jobbik uses strong anti-roma and anti-semitic rhetoric .
it has capitalized on public anger over job losses and corruption and has built on resentment towards the large roma minority , which it blames for many of the country 's ills .
in 2007 , jobbik established the hungarian guard , which dresses in uniforms resembling those worn by the country 's pre-world war ii fascists .
" i will be wearing my hungarian guard tunic when i enter on the first day of parliament , " party leader gabor vona told supporters in budapest .
fidesz has said it will not enter into a coalition with the jobbik party , no matter the result of the election .
proportional representation in the first round on april 11 , hungarian voters will place two ticks : one at the name of the candidate they want to directly represent their local constituency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of far-right paramilitary hungarian guard march during a demonstration the second mark goes at the name of a party fielding a regional list , and over half of 386 seats in parliament will be decided on a proportional representation basis .
a second round of voting , on april 25 , will finalize those constituencies and lists where no candidate won an absolute majority or voting was inconclusive due to low turnout in the first round .
in order to enter parliament a party must poll at least five percent of the national vote .
the poll was expected to close at 1700 gmt , but the national election committee said many polling stations would stay open longer because voters were still waiting to cast ballots in several places. cb / dpa / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the far-right jobbik party could come in second place . the political map of hungary is poised to be completely redrawn as the center-right opposition fidesz party is widely expected to trounce the socialists on sunday in national general elections .
fidesz holds almost 30 percent lead over the ruling socialists , according to recent opinion polls .
fidesz party leader viktor orban has called the election a " moment of truth " and drawn comparisons with historical revolutions and the end of communism in 1990 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidesz chief viktor orban with wife aniko levai his party has long held a lead in the opinion polls , with recent polls indicating fidesz has a 60 percent approval rating among decided voters .
support for the socialist party has been at rock bottom since shortly after re-election in 2006 and the leaking of a speech in which former prime minister ferenc gyurcsany acknowledged the party had lied to the public .
the woes of the hungarian left have since been compounded by a series of high-profile corruption scandals involving socialist politicians - not to mention hungary 's being hit especially hard by the economic crisis and a 25-billion-dollar international bail-out that eventually led gyurcsany to resign .
if fidesz wins two-thirds of the seats in parliament , it could give the party a platform for broad structural reform .
fidesz has promised to create one million jobs over 10 years , boost lending , support small business and slash taxes .
those promises have resonated with voters , who are looking to the party to improve their living standards .
far-right surge far-right nationalist party jobbik is also set to do well , polling between 8 and 11 percent .
it will likely get enough support to enter parliament for the first time and could even beat the socialists in the voting booth , becoming the second-biggest party in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabor vona is jobbik 's prime ministerial candidate founded in 2003 , jobbik uses strong anti-roma and anti-semitic rhetoric .
it has capitalized on public anger over job losses and corruption and has built on resentment towards the large roma minority , which it blames for many of the country 's ills .
in 2007 , jobbik established the hungarian guard , which dresses in uniforms resembling those worn by the country 's pre-world war ii fascists .
" i will be wearing my hungarian guard tunic when i enter on the first day of parliament , " party leader gabor vona told supporters in budapest .
fidesz has said it will not enter into a coalition with the jobbik party , no matter the result of the election .
proportional representation in the first round on april 11 , hungarian voters will place two ticks : one at the name of the candidate they want to directly represent their local constituency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of far-right paramilitary hungarian guard march during a demonstration the second mark goes at the name of a party fielding a regional list , and over half of 386 seats in parliament will be decided on a proportional representation basis .
a second round of voting , on april 25 , will finalize those constituencies and lists where no candidate won an absolute majority or voting was inconclusive due to low turnout in the first round .
in order to enter parliament a party must poll at least five percent of the national vote .
the poll was expected to close at 1700 gmt , but the national election committee said many polling stations would stay open longer because voters were still waiting to cast ballots in several places. cb / dpa / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she was followed by the president 's identical twin jaroslaw , a former premier who now leads the conservative opposition .
he placed his hand briefly on his dead brother 's casket , before making the sign of the cross .
the coffin was then placed in a hearse as a military orchestra played the funeral march by 19th century franco-polish composer frederic chopin .

" the euro is not to blame for our problems .
greece belongs in the euro-zone .
any other scenario is ridiculous , " he said .

the far-right jobbik party could come in second place . the political map of hungary is poised to be completely redrawn as the center-right opposition fidesz party is widely expected to trounce the socialists on sunday in national general elections .
fidesz holds almost 30 percent lead over the ruling socialists , according to recent opinion polls .
fidesz party leader viktor orban has called the election a " moment of truth " and drawn comparisons with historical revolutions and the end of communism in 1990 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidesz chief viktor orban with wife aniko levai his party has long held a lead in the opinion polls , with recent polls indicating fidesz has a 60 percent approval rating among decided voters .
support for the socialist party has been at rock bottom since shortly after re-election in 2006 and the leaking of a speech in which former prime minister ferenc gyurcsany acknowledged the party had lied to the public .
the woes of the hungarian left have since been compounded by a series of high-profile corruption scandals involving socialist politicians - not to mention hungary 's being hit especially hard by the economic crisis and a 25-billion-dollar international bail-out that eventually led gyurcsany to resign .
if fidesz wins two-thirds of the seats in parliament , it could give the party a platform for broad structural reform .
fidesz has promised to create one million jobs over 10 years , boost lending , support small business and slash taxes .
those promises have resonated with voters , who are looking to the party to improve their living standards .
far-right surge far-right nationalist party jobbik is also set to do well , polling between 8 and 11 percent .
it will likely get enough support to enter parliament for the first time and could even beat the socialists in the voting booth , becoming the second-biggest party in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabor vona is jobbik 's prime ministerial candidate founded in 2003 , jobbik uses strong anti-roma and anti-semitic rhetoric .
it has capitalized on public anger over job losses and corruption and has built on resentment towards the large roma minority , which it blames for many of the country 's ills .
in 2007 , jobbik established the hungarian guard , which dresses in uniforms resembling those worn by the country 's pre-world war ii fascists .
" i will be wearing my hungarian guard tunic when i enter on the first day of parliament , " party leader gabor vona told supporters in budapest .
fidesz has said it will not enter into a coalition with the jobbik party , no matter the result of the election .
proportional representation in the first round on april 11 , hungarian voters will place two ticks : one at the name of the candidate they want to directly represent their local constituency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of far-right paramilitary hungarian guard march during a demonstration the second mark goes at the name of a party fielding a regional list , and over half of 386 seats in parliament will be decided on a proportional representation basis .
a second round of voting , on april 25 , will finalize those constituencies and lists where no candidate won an absolute majority or voting was inconclusive due to low turnout in the first round .
in order to enter parliament a party must poll at least five percent of the national vote .
the poll was expected to close at 1700 gmt , but the national election committee said many polling stations would stay open longer because voters were still waiting to cast ballots in several places. cb / dpa / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 11.04.2010 center-right poised to dominate hungarian elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in traditional dresses cast their votes in the village of veresegyhaz hungary votes on sunday in an election in which the governing socialists are set to suffer a major defeat at the hands of the center-right .
the far-right jobbik party could come in second place . the political map of hungary is poised to be completely redrawn as the center-right opposition fidesz party is widely expected to trounce the socialists on sunday in national general elections .
fidesz holds almost 30 percent lead over the ruling socialists , according to recent opinion polls .
fidesz party leader viktor orban has called the election a " moment of truth " and drawn comparisons with historical revolutions and the end of communism in 1990 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidesz chief viktor orban with wife aniko levai his party has long held a lead in the opinion polls , with recent polls indicating fidesz has a 60 percent approval rating among decided voters .
support for the socialist party has been at rock bottom since shortly after re-election in 2006 and the leaking of a speech in which former prime minister ferenc gyurcsany acknowledged the party had lied to the public .
the woes of the hungarian left have since been compounded by a series of high-profile corruption scandals involving socialist politicians - not to mention hungary 's being hit especially hard by the economic crisis and a 25-billion-dollar international bail-out that eventually led gyurcsany to resign .
if fidesz wins two-thirds of the seats in parliament , it could give the party a platform for broad structural reform .
fidesz has promised to create one million jobs over 10 years , boost lending , support small business and slash taxes .
those promises have resonated with voters , who are looking to the party to improve their living standards .
far-right surge far-right nationalist party jobbik is also set to do well , polling between 8 and 11 percent .
it will likely get enough support to enter parliament for the first time and could even beat the socialists in the voting booth , becoming the second-biggest party in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabor vona is jobbik 's prime ministerial candidate founded in 2003 , jobbik uses strong anti-roma and anti-semitic rhetoric .
it has capitalized on public anger over job losses and corruption and has built on resentment towards the large roma minority , which it blames for many of the country 's ills .
in 2007 , jobbik established the hungarian guard , which dresses in uniforms resembling those worn by the country 's pre-world war ii fascists .
" i will be wearing my hungarian guard tunic when i enter on the first day of parliament , " party leader gabor vona told supporters in budapest .

the far-right jobbik party could come in second place . the political map of hungary is poised to be completely redrawn as the center-right opposition fidesz party is widely expected to trounce the socialists on sunday in national general elections .
fidesz holds almost 30 percent lead over the ruling socialists , according to recent opinion polls .
fidesz party leader viktor orban has called the election a " moment of truth " and drawn comparisons with historical revolutions and the end of communism in 1990 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidesz chief viktor orban with wife aniko levai his party has long held a lead in the opinion polls , with recent polls indicating fidesz has a 60 percent approval rating among decided voters .
support for the socialist party has been at rock bottom since shortly after re-election in 2006 and the leaking of a speech in which former prime minister ferenc gyurcsany acknowledged the party had lied to the public .
the woes of the hungarian left have since been compounded by a series of high-profile corruption scandals involving socialist politicians - not to mention hungary 's being hit especially hard by the economic crisis and a 25-billion-dollar international bail-out that eventually led gyurcsany to resign .
if fidesz wins two-thirds of the seats in parliament , it could give the party a platform for broad structural reform .
fidesz has promised to create one million jobs over 10 years , boost lending , support small business and slash taxes .
those promises have resonated with voters , who are looking to the party to improve their living standards .
far-right surge far-right nationalist party jobbik is also set to do well , polling between 8 and 11 percent .
it will likely get enough support to enter parliament for the first time and could even beat the socialists in the voting booth , becoming the second-biggest party in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabor vona is jobbik 's prime ministerial candidate founded in 2003 , jobbik uses strong anti-roma and anti-semitic rhetoric .
it has capitalized on public anger over job losses and corruption and has built on resentment towards the large roma minority , which it blames for many of the country 's ills .
in 2007 , jobbik established the hungarian guard , which dresses in uniforms resembling those worn by the country 's pre-world war ii fascists .
" i will be wearing my hungarian guard tunic when i enter on the first day of parliament , " party leader gabor vona told supporters in budapest .

to strengthen ties they have to further unify eu foreign policy and focus on the issues , analysts say . when us president barack obama announced early in februray that he would not attend an eu-us summit designed to launch the new european leadership , pundits were quick to interpret this as a sure sign of europe being downgraded on the world stage .
although washington officials insisted that obama 's cancellation was due to an overloaded domestic agenda , europeans could not shake off the feeling that obama is giving them the cold shoulder .
now european nations will have to contend with an obama administration basking in the glow of a number of recent successful policy achievements starting with health care reform and ending with the signing of the arms reduction treaty with russia this week .
obama certainly wants european countries on board at the washington disarmament conference next week in his quest for a nuclear-free world , however he knows he can bargain from a position of strength .
german chancellor angela merkel is due to attend the nuclear security summit and aside from afghanistan and iran , obama has made progress on nuclear security a top priority on his foreign policy agenda .
therefore analysts believe that merkel 's presence at the summit will be very much appreciated in washington .
however , the problematic question will be how germany 's desire to have us tactical nuclear weapons removed from its soil can be reconciled with the american view of the weapons as an important security asset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european council president herman van rompuy : " the charisma of a damp rag " so can europe present a united front in washington ?
the eu-us summit planned for april was supposed to be the first since the lisbon treaty came into force in december 2009 which created the posts of eu president and high representative for foreign affairs .
washington : lisbon a missed opportunity analysts say that there is a strong impression in washington that the europeans have wasted the chance offered by lisbon to streamline their diplomacy and foreign-policy structures .
" there is a real sense that the us may have to show some tough love and tell its european counterparts very bluntly that it wants to work with a more unified europe and that its disappointed by the way things have been going over the last few months , " new york based richard gowan , policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
instead of one there are now at least four voices speaking for europe : the new permanent eu president , the still persisting six-month rotating presidency , the high representative , and the president of the european commission .
the problem , once raised by henry kissinger , of who to call when you want to talk to europe , has not exactly been solved by the lisbon treaty .
us focus on emerging powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing dialogue : obama and his chinese counterpart hu jintao another factor contributing to the europeans ' nervousness is obama 's focus on reaching out to emerging powers like brazil , india and above all china .
" the obama government has set out to form a closer political and economic relationship with china , raising fears in europe that such a g-2 could further reduce europe 's influence in the world , " the center for european reform said in a recent study .
obama 's attempt to adapt international political structures to meet the rise of the new superpowers is also encapsulated in his administration 's advocacy for the g20 in which china and india are full members .
" obama 's administration has decided to replace the g8 with the g20 as the premier forum of economic discussion .
it sees the g20 as an institution which brings new and established economic powers together .
the europeans feel rather downgraded by this prioritization , " gowan said .
on the other hand , gowan points out that european countries themselves have invested a lot in attempting to improve their relationship with china .
it should not come as a surprise that the us has a vital interest to do the same .
some analysts say that the growing importance of china does not necessarily take away from the strength of the transatlantic partnership .
" you have to differentiate between who is becoming most important in terms of challenges and economic cooperation and who is your natural partner .
the g2 already exists between the us and europe if you look at investment , jobs creation , and trade .
almost two thirds of the world 's economic activity still happens between the us and europe , " jan-friedrich kallmorgen , former head of the transatlantic program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
so while there might be a growing dialogue between the us and china , it is still far away from the kind of transatlantic cooperation that everyone has become accustomed to in europe .
common foreign policy goals overall , the eu and the us share many foreign policy goals and there is a lot more consensus than there was in the bush years .
both sides acknowledge that tackling climate change is a priority and that they need to make progress on international financial regulation .
they also seem to be on the same page when it comes to dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions and the situation in afghanistan .
while obama is said to be disappointed about the small number of extra troops from europe , his new approach to afghanistan is much closer to european - and in particular german - priorities .
" the concept that civil measures like police training , legal education and business administration should increasingly play a role in afghanistan has gained considerable ground in washington , " explains kallmorgen .
merkel in a strong position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " merkel is the leader you have to do buisness with in europe " although germany has been a difficult partner on afghanistan , analysts believe that german-us ties are still going strong .
according to gowan , german chancellor merkel may well be the most important european figure when it comes to transatlantic cooperation .
" merkel still represents the leader that you have to do business with in europe .
gordon brown faces electoral defeat , neither zapatero nor berlusconi have really impressed the current administration , and sarkozy is understood to be very critical of obama in private , " he explains .
on a personal level , you do not see the kind of public display of affection forced onto merkel by former president george w. bush .
but on a working level , gowan says she represents a stable partner for obama who has just been reelected and will be around for quite some time .
it is with these bread and butter issues that europeans will try to gain ground in relations with washington .
many commentators believe that instead of quarrelling over who shakes obama 's hand first and sulking over a summit no-show , european leaders should offer concrete foreign policy agreements and deliver on issues like financial regulation and international security .
maybe if there is more beef on the menu next time the eu invites obama over for dinner , he will gladly accept .

" the obama government has set out to form a closer political and economic relationship with china , raising fears in europe that such a g-2 could further reduce europe 's influence in the world , " the center for european reform said in a recent study .
obama 's attempt to adapt international political structures to meet the rise of the new superpowers is also encapsulated in his administration 's advocacy for the g20 in which china and india are full members .
" obama 's administration has decided to replace the g8 with the g20 as the premier forum of economic discussion .
it sees the g20 as an institution which brings new and established economic powers together .
the europeans feel rather downgraded by this prioritization , " gowan said .
on the other hand , gowan points out that european countries themselves have invested a lot in attempting to improve their relationship with china .
it should not come as a surprise that the us has a vital interest to do the same .
some analysts say that the growing importance of china does not necessarily take away from the strength of the transatlantic partnership .
" you have to differentiate between who is becoming most important in terms of challenges and economic cooperation and who is your natural partner .
the g2 already exists between the us and europe if you look at investment , jobs creation , and trade .
almost two thirds of the world 's economic activity still happens between the us and europe , " jan-friedrich kallmorgen , former head of the transatlantic program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
so while there might be a growing dialogue between the us and china , it is still far away from the kind of transatlantic cooperation that everyone has become accustomed to in europe .
common foreign policy goals overall , the eu and the us share many foreign policy goals and there is a lot more consensus than there was in the bush years .
both sides acknowledge that tackling climate change is a priority and that they need to make progress on international financial regulation .
they also seem to be on the same page when it comes to dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions and the situation in afghanistan .
while obama is said to be disappointed about the small number of extra troops from europe , his new approach to afghanistan is much closer to european - and in particular german - priorities .
" the concept that civil measures like police training , legal education and business administration should increasingly play a role in afghanistan has gained considerable ground in washington , " explains kallmorgen .
merkel in a strong position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " merkel is the leader you have to do buisness with in europe " although germany has been a difficult partner on afghanistan , analysts believe that german-us ties are still going strong .
according to gowan , german chancellor merkel may well be the most important european figure when it comes to transatlantic cooperation .
" merkel still represents the leader that you have to do business with in europe .
gordon brown faces electoral defeat , neither zapatero nor berlusconi have really impressed the current administration , and sarkozy is understood to be very critical of obama in private , " he explains .
on a personal level , you do not see the kind of public display of affection forced onto merkel by former president george w. bush .
but on a working level , gowan says she represents a stable partner for obama who has just been reelected and will be around for quite some time .
it is with these bread and butter issues that europeans will try to gain ground in relations with washington .
many commentators believe that instead of quarrelling over who shakes obama 's hand first and sulking over a summit no-show , european leaders should offer concrete foreign policy agreements and deliver on issues like financial regulation and international security .
maybe if there is more beef on the menu next time the eu invites obama over for dinner , he will gladly accept .

to strengthen ties they have to further unify eu foreign policy and focus on the issues , analysts say . when us president barack obama announced early in februray that he would not attend an eu-us summit designed to launch the new european leadership , pundits were quick to interpret this as a sure sign of europe being downgraded on the world stage .
although washington officials insisted that obama 's cancellation was due to an overloaded domestic agenda , europeans could not shake off the feeling that obama is giving them the cold shoulder .
now european nations will have to contend with an obama administration basking in the glow of a number of recent successful policy achievements starting with health care reform and ending with the signing of the arms reduction treaty with russia this week .
obama certainly wants european countries on board at the washington disarmament conference next week in his quest for a nuclear-free world , however he knows he can bargain from a position of strength .
german chancellor angela merkel is due to attend the nuclear security summit and aside from afghanistan and iran , obama has made progress on nuclear security a top priority on his foreign policy agenda .
therefore analysts believe that merkel 's presence at the summit will be very much appreciated in washington .
however , the problematic question will be how germany 's desire to have us tactical nuclear weapons removed from its soil can be reconciled with the american view of the weapons as an important security asset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european council president herman van rompuy : " the charisma of a damp rag " so can europe present a united front in washington ?
the eu-us summit planned for april was supposed to be the first since the lisbon treaty came into force in december 2009 which created the posts of eu president and high representative for foreign affairs .
washington : lisbon a missed opportunity analysts say that there is a strong impression in washington that the europeans have wasted the chance offered by lisbon to streamline their diplomacy and foreign-policy structures .
" there is a real sense that the us may have to show some tough love and tell its european counterparts very bluntly that it wants to work with a more unified europe and that its disappointed by the way things have been going over the last few months , " new york based richard gowan , policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
instead of one there are now at least four voices speaking for europe : the new permanent eu president , the still persisting six-month rotating presidency , the high representative , and the president of the european commission .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 11.04.2010 more beef : how europe can regain clout in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the failure to focus on substance has weakened the eu 's standing european officials are anxious about whether washington still views them as strong players on the world stage .
to strengthen ties they have to further unify eu foreign policy and focus on the issues , analysts say . when us president barack obama announced early in februray that he would not attend an eu-us summit designed to launch the new european leadership , pundits were quick to interpret this as a sure sign of europe being downgraded on the world stage .
although washington officials insisted that obama 's cancellation was due to an overloaded domestic agenda , europeans could not shake off the feeling that obama is giving them the cold shoulder .
now european nations will have to contend with an obama administration basking in the glow of a number of recent successful policy achievements starting with health care reform and ending with the signing of the arms reduction treaty with russia this week .
obama certainly wants european countries on board at the washington disarmament conference next week in his quest for a nuclear-free world , however he knows he can bargain from a position of strength .
german chancellor angela merkel is due to attend the nuclear security summit and aside from afghanistan and iran , obama has made progress on nuclear security a top priority on his foreign policy agenda .
therefore analysts believe that merkel 's presence at the summit will be very much appreciated in washington .
however , the problematic question will be how germany 's desire to have us tactical nuclear weapons removed from its soil can be reconciled with the american view of the weapons as an important security asset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european council president herman van rompuy : " the charisma of a damp rag " so can europe present a united front in washington ?
the eu-us summit planned for april was supposed to be the first since the lisbon treaty came into force in december 2009 which created the posts of eu president and high representative for foreign affairs .
washington : lisbon a missed opportunity analysts say that there is a strong impression in washington that the europeans have wasted the chance offered by lisbon to streamline their diplomacy and foreign-policy structures .
" there is a real sense that the us may have to show some tough love and tell its european counterparts very bluntly that it wants to work with a more unified europe and that its disappointed by the way things have been going over the last few months , " new york based richard gowan , policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
instead of one there are now at least four voices speaking for europe : the new permanent eu president , the still persisting six-month rotating presidency , the high representative , and the president of the european commission .
the problem , once raised by henry kissinger , of who to call when you want to talk to europe , has not exactly been solved by the lisbon treaty .
us focus on emerging powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing dialogue : obama and his chinese counterpart hu jintao another factor contributing to the europeans ' nervousness is obama 's focus on reaching out to emerging powers like brazil , india and above all china .
" the obama government has set out to form a closer political and economic relationship with china , raising fears in europe that such a g-2 could further reduce europe 's influence in the world , " the center for european reform said in a recent study .
obama 's attempt to adapt international political structures to meet the rise of the new superpowers is also encapsulated in his administration 's advocacy for the g20 in which china and india are full members .
" obama 's administration has decided to replace the g8 with the g20 as the premier forum of economic discussion .
it sees the g20 as an institution which brings new and established economic powers together .
the europeans feel rather downgraded by this prioritization , " gowan said .
on the other hand , gowan points out that european countries themselves have invested a lot in attempting to improve their relationship with china .
it should not come as a surprise that the us has a vital interest to do the same .
some analysts say that the growing importance of china does not necessarily take away from the strength of the transatlantic partnership .
" you have to differentiate between who is becoming most important in terms of challenges and economic cooperation and who is your natural partner .
the g2 already exists between the us and europe if you look at investment , jobs creation , and trade .
almost two thirds of the world 's economic activity still happens between the us and europe , " jan-friedrich kallmorgen , former head of the transatlantic program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
so while there might be a growing dialogue between the us and china , it is still far away from the kind of transatlantic cooperation that everyone has become accustomed to in europe .
common foreign policy goals overall , the eu and the us share many foreign policy goals and there is a lot more consensus than there was in the bush years .
both sides acknowledge that tackling climate change is a priority and that they need to make progress on international financial regulation .
they also seem to be on the same page when it comes to dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions and the situation in afghanistan .
while obama is said to be disappointed about the small number of extra troops from europe , his new approach to afghanistan is much closer to european - and in particular german - priorities .
" the concept that civil measures like police training , legal education and business administration should increasingly play a role in afghanistan has gained considerable ground in washington , " explains kallmorgen .
merkel in a strong position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " merkel is the leader you have to do buisness with in europe " although germany has been a difficult partner on afghanistan , analysts believe that german-us ties are still going strong .
according to gowan , german chancellor merkel may well be the most important european figure when it comes to transatlantic cooperation .
" merkel still represents the leader that you have to do business with in europe .
gordon brown faces electoral defeat , neither zapatero nor berlusconi have really impressed the current administration , and sarkozy is understood to be very critical of obama in private , " he explains .
on a personal level , you do not see the kind of public display of affection forced onto merkel by former president george w. bush .

interest rates are to be set at 5.1 percent , significantly lower than the 7.5 percent markets have been offering .
sources said the deal was almost a " carbon copy " of imf terms .
jean-claude juncker , who heads the eurogroup , and european monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn are scheduled to announce details of the plan on sunday .
" there will be a teleconference on sunday on greece in the usual eurogroup composition , " guy schuller , a spokesman for juncker , said .

papandrreou said that with the terms now set the gun on the table will be loaded .
speculators will know this , he added .
" the question remains whether this mechanism will convince markets just as a gun on the table .
if it does not convince them , it is a mechanism that is there to be used , " papandreou said .
papandreou has vowed that greece had no plans of leaving the euro-zone .
" the euro is not to blame for our problems .
greece belongs in the euro-zone .
any other scenario is ridiculous , " he said .
spanish foreign minister angel moratinos , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , was optimistic : " i am quite optimistic that we are again able to show solidarity and above all send a message to the speculators that the euro-zone is strong and firm . "

the far-right jobbik party could come in second place . the political map of hungary is poised to be completely redrawn as the center-right opposition fidesz party is widely expected to trounce the socialists on sunday in national general elections .
fidesz holds almost 30 percent lead over the ruling socialists , according to recent opinion polls .
fidesz party leader viktor orban has called the election a " moment of truth " and drawn comparisons with historical revolutions and the end of communism in 1990 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidesz chief viktor orban with wife aniko levai his party has long held a lead in the opinion polls , with recent polls indicating fidesz has a 60 percent approval rating among decided voters .
support for the socialist party has been at rock bottom since shortly after re-election in 2006 and the leaking of a speech in which former prime minister ferenc gyurcsany acknowledged the party had lied to the public .
the woes of the hungarian left have since been compounded by a series of high-profile corruption scandals involving socialist politicians - not to mention hungary 's being hit especially hard by the economic crisis and a 25-billion-dollar international bail-out that eventually led gyurcsany to resign .
if fidesz wins two-thirds of the seats in parliament , it could give the party a platform for broad structural reform .
fidesz has promised to create one million jobs over 10 years , boost lending , support small business and slash taxes .
those promises have resonated with voters , who are looking to the party to improve their living standards .
far-right surge far-right nationalist party jobbik is also set to do well , polling between 8 and 11 percent .
it will likely get enough support to enter parliament for the first time and could even beat the socialists in the voting booth , becoming the second-biggest party in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabor vona is jobbik 's prime ministerial candidate founded in 2003 , jobbik uses strong anti-roma and anti-semitic rhetoric .
it has capitalized on public anger over job losses and corruption and has built on resentment towards the large roma minority , which it blames for many of the country 's ills .
in 2007 , jobbik established the hungarian guard , which dresses in uniforms resembling those worn by the country 's pre-world war ii fascists .
" i will be wearing my hungarian guard tunic when i enter on the first day of parliament , " party leader gabor vona told supporters in budapest .
fidesz has said it will not enter into a coalition with the jobbik party , no matter the result of the election .
proportional representation in the first round on april 11 , hungarian voters will place two ticks : one at the name of the candidate they want to directly represent their local constituency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of far-right paramilitary hungarian guard march during a demonstration the second mark goes at the name of a party fielding a regional list , and over half of 386 seats in parliament will be decided on a proportional representation basis .
a second round of voting , on april 25 , will finalize those constituencies and lists where no candidate won an absolute majority or voting was inconclusive due to low turnout in the first round .
in order to enter parliament a party must poll at least five percent of the national vote .
the poll was expected to close at 1700 gmt , but the national election committee said many polling stations would stay open longer because voters were still waiting to cast ballots in several places. cb / dpa / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the far-right jobbik party could come in second place . the political map of hungary is poised to be completely redrawn as the center-right opposition fidesz party is widely expected to trounce the socialists on sunday in national general elections .
fidesz holds almost 30 percent lead over the ruling socialists , according to recent opinion polls .
fidesz party leader viktor orban has called the election a " moment of truth " and drawn comparisons with historical revolutions and the end of communism in 1990 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fidesz chief viktor orban with wife aniko levai his party has long held a lead in the opinion polls , with recent polls indicating fidesz has a 60 percent approval rating among decided voters .
support for the socialist party has been at rock bottom since shortly after re-election in 2006 and the leaking of a speech in which former prime minister ferenc gyurcsany acknowledged the party had lied to the public .
the woes of the hungarian left have since been compounded by a series of high-profile corruption scandals involving socialist politicians - not to mention hungary 's being hit especially hard by the economic crisis and a 25-billion-dollar international bail-out that eventually led gyurcsany to resign .
if fidesz wins two-thirds of the seats in parliament , it could give the party a platform for broad structural reform .

those promises have resonated with voters , who are looking to the party to improve their living standards .

some two million people are expected to view it . the shroud will be on public view for six weeks at the turin cathedral .
it 's kept in a bullet-proof and climate-controlled case .
discovered in the mid-14th century in the french city of troyes , the shroud of turin is said to have been imprinted with an image of christ 's crucified body .
in 1898 , secondo pia , a lawyer and amateur photographer , obtained a negative image of the 4.4-meter shroud in which jesus was buried with far more striking features than those of the natural , sepia-colored positive .
the real thing or a medieval fake ?
samples of the blood-stained fabric were analyzed in 1988 using radiocarbon dating .
the analysis determined that the fibers in the cloth date from the middle ages , but those findings have been challenged .
the vatican has never confirmed the shroud 's authenticity . turin cardinal severino poletto , who led the opening ceremony in turin 's cathedral saturday , referred to the debate over the shroud 's authenticity , saying it was " not up to the church but for science to decide . "
poletto told ansa news agency that the shroud was a testament to " hidden suffering endured in silence between tears and despair . "
bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is shown a copy of the shroud of turin he recalled that the late pope john paul ii said the shroud evoked thoughts of the " millions of men who die of hunger , of the horrors perpetrated in so many wars -lrb- and -rrb- the brutal exploitation of women and children . "
pope benedict xvi will travel to turin to see the shroud on may 2 .
benedict said his visit would be " a propitious occasion to contemplate this mysterious visage that speaks silently to the heart of men , inviting them to recognize the face of god .

she was followed by the president 's identical twin jaroslaw , a former premier who now leads the conservative opposition .
he placed his hand briefly on his dead brother 's casket , before making the sign of the cross .
the coffin was then placed in a hearse as a military orchestra played the funeral march by 19th century franco-polish composer frederic chopin .
grief-stricken nation tens of thousands of mourners turned out to pay their respects , tossing flowers as the hearse as it made its way to the presidential palace in warsaw , where kacynski 's coffin is expected to lie in view .
" regardless of whether one agreed with his politics , or his views - and i did n't - he was our president , and he died tragically , " andrzej gerula , a 26-year-old computer programmer , told the afp news agency .

some two million people are expected to view it . the shroud will be on public view for six weeks at the turin cathedral .
it 's kept in a bullet-proof and climate-controlled case .
discovered in the mid-14th century in the french city of troyes , the shroud of turin is said to have been imprinted with an image of christ 's crucified body .
in 1898 , secondo pia , a lawyer and amateur photographer , obtained a negative image of the 4.4-meter shroud in which jesus was buried with far more striking features than those of the natural , sepia-colored positive .
the real thing or a medieval fake ?
samples of the blood-stained fabric were analyzed in 1988 using radiocarbon dating .
the analysis determined that the fibers in the cloth date from the middle ages , but those findings have been challenged .
the vatican has never confirmed the shroud 's authenticity . turin cardinal severino poletto , who led the opening ceremony in turin 's cathedral saturday , referred to the debate over the shroud 's authenticity , saying it was " not up to the church but for science to decide . "
poletto told ansa news agency that the shroud was a testament to " hidden suffering endured in silence between tears and despair . "
bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is shown a copy of the shroud of turin he recalled that the late pope john paul ii said the shroud evoked thoughts of the " millions of men who die of hunger , of the horrors perpetrated in so many wars -lrb- and -rrb- the brutal exploitation of women and children . "
pope benedict xvi will travel to turin to see the shroud on may 2 .
benedict said his visit would be " a propitious occasion to contemplate this mysterious visage that speaks silently to the heart of men , inviting them to recognize the face of god .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 11.04.2010 more beef : how europe can regain clout in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the failure to focus on substance has weakened the eu 's standing european officials are anxious about whether washington still views them as strong players on the world stage .
to strengthen ties they have to further unify eu foreign policy and focus on the issues , analysts say . when us president barack obama announced early in februray that he would not attend an eu-us summit designed to launch the new european leadership , pundits were quick to interpret this as a sure sign of europe being downgraded on the world stage .
although washington officials insisted that obama 's cancellation was due to an overloaded domestic agenda , europeans could not shake off the feeling that obama is giving them the cold shoulder .
now european nations will have to contend with an obama administration basking in the glow of a number of recent successful policy achievements starting with health care reform and ending with the signing of the arms reduction treaty with russia this week .
obama certainly wants european countries on board at the washington disarmament conference next week in his quest for a nuclear-free world , however he knows he can bargain from a position of strength .
german chancellor angela merkel is due to attend the nuclear security summit and aside from afghanistan and iran , obama has made progress on nuclear security a top priority on his foreign policy agenda .
therefore analysts believe that merkel 's presence at the summit will be very much appreciated in washington .
however , the problematic question will be how germany 's desire to have us tactical nuclear weapons removed from its soil can be reconciled with the american view of the weapons as an important security asset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european council president herman van rompuy : " the charisma of a damp rag " so can europe present a united front in washington ?
the eu-us summit planned for april was supposed to be the first since the lisbon treaty came into force in december 2009 which created the posts of eu president and high representative for foreign affairs .
washington : lisbon a missed opportunity analysts say that there is a strong impression in washington that the europeans have wasted the chance offered by lisbon to streamline their diplomacy and foreign-policy structures .
" there is a real sense that the us may have to show some tough love and tell its european counterparts very bluntly that it wants to work with a more unified europe and that its disappointed by the way things have been going over the last few months , " new york based richard gowan , policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
instead of one there are now at least four voices speaking for europe : the new permanent eu president , the still persisting six-month rotating presidency , the high representative , and the president of the european commission .
the problem , once raised by henry kissinger , of who to call when you want to talk to europe , has not exactly been solved by the lisbon treaty .
us focus on emerging powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing dialogue : obama and his chinese counterpart hu jintao another factor contributing to the europeans ' nervousness is obama 's focus on reaching out to emerging powers like brazil , india and above all china .
" the obama government has set out to form a closer political and economic relationship with china , raising fears in europe that such a g-2 could further reduce europe 's influence in the world , " the center for european reform said in a recent study .
obama 's attempt to adapt international political structures to meet the rise of the new superpowers is also encapsulated in his administration 's advocacy for the g20 in which china and india are full members .
" obama 's administration has decided to replace the g8 with the g20 as the premier forum of economic discussion .
it sees the g20 as an institution which brings new and established economic powers together .
the europeans feel rather downgraded by this prioritization , " gowan said .
on the other hand , gowan points out that european countries themselves have invested a lot in attempting to improve their relationship with china .
it should not come as a surprise that the us has a vital interest to do the same .
some analysts say that the growing importance of china does not necessarily take away from the strength of the transatlantic partnership .
" you have to differentiate between who is becoming most important in terms of challenges and economic cooperation and who is your natural partner .
the g2 already exists between the us and europe if you look at investment , jobs creation , and trade .
almost two thirds of the world 's economic activity still happens between the us and europe , " jan-friedrich kallmorgen , former head of the transatlantic program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
so while there might be a growing dialogue between the us and china , it is still far away from the kind of transatlantic cooperation that everyone has become accustomed to in europe .
common foreign policy goals overall , the eu and the us share many foreign policy goals and there is a lot more consensus than there was in the bush years .
both sides acknowledge that tackling climate change is a priority and that they need to make progress on international financial regulation .
they also seem to be on the same page when it comes to dealing with iran 's nuclear ambitions and the situation in afghanistan .
while obama is said to be disappointed about the small number of extra troops from europe , his new approach to afghanistan is much closer to european - and in particular german - priorities .
" the concept that civil measures like police training , legal education and business administration should increasingly play a role in afghanistan has gained considerable ground in washington , " explains kallmorgen .
merkel in a strong position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " merkel is the leader you have to do buisness with in europe " although germany has been a difficult partner on afghanistan , analysts believe that german-us ties are still going strong .
according to gowan , german chancellor merkel may well be the most important european figure when it comes to transatlantic cooperation .
" merkel still represents the leader that you have to do business with in europe .
gordon brown faces electoral defeat , neither zapatero nor berlusconi have really impressed the current administration , and sarkozy is understood to be very critical of obama in private , " he explains .
on a personal level , you do not see the kind of public display of affection forced onto merkel by former president george w. bush .
but on a working level , gowan says she represents a stable partner for obama who has just been reelected and will be around for quite some time .
it is with these bread and butter issues that europeans will try to gain ground in relations with washington .
many commentators believe that instead of quarrelling over who shakes obama 's hand first and sulking over a summit no-show , european leaders should offer concrete foreign policy agreements and deliver on issues like financial regulation and international security .
maybe if there is more beef on the menu next time the eu invites obama over for dinner , he will gladly accept .
