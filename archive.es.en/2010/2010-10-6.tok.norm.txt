chinese premier wen jiabao was in berlin after an eu-asia summit produced mixed results . germany has agreed to forge closer economic ties with china and press beijing 's case to be recognized as a market economy by the european union .
chancellor angela merkel met chinese premier wen jiabao at the meseberg palace near berlin following an eu-asia summit in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and wen met to build on discussions in brussels a joint statement issued by the german and chinese delegations after the meeting said that both leaders supported " strengthening european-chinese economic relations and want to encourage them through consultation and building up cooperation . "
it said there was a need for china and the eu to strengthen mutual political confidence and deepen strategic co-operation . "
the statement said that germany would work to get the european union to recognize china as a market economy by 2016 , giving the country certain benefits under international trade rules .
leaders at the summit in brussels had earlier reached broad agreement on reforms to help stabilize the international economy .
however , efforts to gain concessions from china to allow a more rapid appreciation in the value of the yuan appear to have failed .
changes in global economy the biennial asia europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- brought together 27 eu and 19 asian leaders , with agreement that reforms were needed to keep pace with changes in the world economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 is to discuss issues such as financial regulation " the priority is now to reach agreement on a system of global financial , monetary and economic governance : we have to act together very closely on this , " said summit chairman and president of the european council herman van rompuy .
leaders from the nations represented , 12 of which are members of the g20 group of leading economies , agreed that the next g20 summit in the south korean capital , seoul , next month should address a range of issues .
issues up for discussion at that summit include ensuring better government spending control and tighter regulation of the financial industry .
states also moved closer to a firm deal on the redistribution of voting rights within international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , for which european states retain disproportionate power compared with asian states .
a broad agreement on the need for reform was reached , although disagreements remained on the precise details .
no movement on chinese currency european nations also pressed - without success - for a china to allow its currency , the yuan , to increase in value , amid charges that beijing is deliberately devaluing its money to aid its export industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western countries say the yuan is being kept artificially low the chairman of eurozone finance ministers , jean-claude juncker said euro nations had urged an " orderly , significant and broad-based appreciation " of the yuan .
when asked about the chinese response , juncker said .
" the chinese authorities do not share our view . "
leaders also pledged to seek an urgent , legally-binding deal on global warming at united nations climate talks in cancun , mexico , beginning next month .
the german and chinese negotiations also touched on climate change , with both countries saying that they hoped progress would be made at the talks .
recognition of china as a market economy would make it less vulnerable to charges that it is dumping products onto global markets against world trade organization rules .

five were apparently german citizens .
in the past five weeks alone , the cia has launched 23 remote attacks in pakistan . just one click of the mouse at cia headquarters in the us state of virginia is all that is needed to crush a suspected al qaeda cell thousands of miles away in the border region between pakistan and afghanistan .
and to kill dozens of people in one strike . the unmanned aerial vehicles , which are equipped with high-resolution infrared cameras and hellfire rockets , have become us president barack obama ’ s weapon of choice in the so-called war on terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drone attacks on the border region between pakistan and afghanistan are launched from thousands of miles away however , critics argue that the drones are used to carry out extrajudicial executions . pentagon press secretary geoff morell dismisses such criticism : " oh come on you know the climate there as well as i do .
there are terrorists who exist and i would point out that it is in the pakistanis ’ interest to do this . " he argues that not only are the populations of the united states and europe at risk of terrorism but the government in islamabad too .
the pentagon and the cia , which functions almost like a secret paramilitary subcontractor , consider these drone attacks as obama ’ s most precise weapon in the fight against terror . hailed as great political achievement by some a year ago , the head of the pakistani taliban , baitullah mehsud , was killed in a missile attack launched by a predator drone . obama 's legal adviser harold koh agrees .

five were apparently german citizens .
in the past five weeks alone , the cia has launched 23 remote attacks in pakistan . just one click of the mouse at cia headquarters in the us state of virginia is all that is needed to crush a suspected al qaeda cell thousands of miles away in the border region between pakistan and afghanistan .
and to kill dozens of people in one strike . the unmanned aerial vehicles , which are equipped with high-resolution infrared cameras and hellfire rockets , have become us president barack obama ’ s weapon of choice in the so-called war on terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drone attacks on the border region between pakistan and afghanistan are launched from thousands of miles away however , critics argue that the drones are used to carry out extrajudicial executions . pentagon press secretary geoff morell dismisses such criticism : " oh come on you know the climate there as well as i do .
there are terrorists who exist and i would point out that it is in the pakistanis ’ interest to do this . " he argues that not only are the populations of the united states and europe at risk of terrorism but the government in islamabad too .
the pentagon and the cia , which functions almost like a secret paramilitary subcontractor , consider these drone attacks as obama ’ s most precise weapon in the fight against terror . hailed as great political achievement by some a year ago , the head of the pakistani taliban , baitullah mehsud , was killed in a missile attack launched by a predator drone . obama 's legal adviser harold koh agrees .
he does not think the drones are instruments of extrajudicial state murder but says that " a state that is engaged in armed conflict may use lethal force .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 06.10.2010 israel does n't need reconciliation with wagner , says holocaust survivor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noah klieger survived several concentration camps during the holocaust richard wagner 's music has been boycotted in israel in light of the nazi pogroms of 1938 .
holocaust survivor and israeli journalist noah klieger explains why the ban is justified and does n't hinder reconciliation . the israel chamber orchestra has agreed to perform a work by anti-semitic composer richard wagner -lrb- 1813-1883 -rrb- at next year 's bayreuth festival , although an unofficial boycott of the composer 's music has been observed in israel for over 70 years .
prominent israeli journalist and holocaust survivor noah klieger -lrb- born in 1926 in strasbourg -rrb- explains how the unspoken wagner ban came about in israel and why he is opposed to an israeli orchestra performing wagner 's music . deutsche welle : why are you opposed to the israel chamber orchestra playing wagner at the bayreuth festival ? noah klieger : i 'm against it because i 'm against playing wagner in israel .
wagner was the father of the theory of the races ; he was the first one to claim that there was a master race - the germans - and a low-class race - the jews .
he was the first to explain this in writing .
in 1938 , the symphony orchestra of eretz israel , which later became the israeli philharmonic orchestra , was about to perform wagner in a concert in tel aviv directed by -lsb- arturo -rsb- toscanini .
bronislaw huberman , the man who founded it , decided that the orchestra could not play wagner .
november 8-9 , 1938 was the so-called night of broken glass where the synagogues were destroyed and burned all over germany and austria , thousands of shops were looted and destroyed , hundreds of jews were murdered and tens of thousands of jews were sent to concentration camps .
huberman then realized that -lsb- wagner 's -rsb- theory had been realized by the germans at that time .
so he decided not to play wagner .
then he decided , together with the bosses of the jewish community in palestine - there was no israeli government at that time - to boycott wagner .
this happened before the shoah .
so , of course it was taken over later , because during the shoah it became clear that hitler was a great admirer of wagner .
not only did he adopt his theories , but he adopted his music as well .
the boycott has never been lifted .
it 's true that sometimes directors have tried to perform wagner in israel .
a man who decided to do it was daniel barenboim who , in a concert with a german orchestra , performed wagner , claiming that it was done spontaneously .
but it 's not true - you can not perform spontaneously with an orchestra .
you would say , then , that if the holocaust had not happened , israel would still have a boycott against wagner ? yes , i think so , because the pogroms happened .
it was not decided after the holocaust , it was decided after the pogroms in 1938 . by the way , there is no official ban .
it 's a sentimental ban .
as long as some of us are still alive , people should refrain from imposing wagner on us .
but we 're the not only ones ; there are many , many israelis who were born after the holocaust who are also against wagner for the same reason . how does this younger generation view wagner ? i do n't even know whether the younger generation is very familiar with wagner .
i do n't think that many young people are fond of wagner .
i 'm convinced they 're not . do you think that the israeli orchestra playing in bayreuth could serve as an act of reconciliation ? we do n't need reconciliation with wagner .
we have reconciliation with germany .
we have nothing against the new german generations .
i go to germany very often ; i lecture in germany .
i lecture on the shoah , but this is a different story .
i have no problem whatsoever , because they 're not the same germans .
but wagner is the same wagner - whether it 's today or 100 years ago , it 's the same wagner with the same theory . does the ban apply to any other composers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 night of broken glass was evidence that the nazis 's anti-semitism had turned violent no .
richard strauss was at least as strong an anti-semite as wagner was , but we play strauss . why ? because he is not the father of this -lsb- racial -rsb- theory .
if we banned all anti-semites , we would n't have a lot of writers , poets and composers because most of them were anti-jewish .

holocaust survivor and israeli journalist noah klieger explains why the ban is justified and does n't hinder reconciliation . the israel chamber orchestra has agreed to perform a work by anti-semitic composer richard wagner -lrb- 1813-1883 -rrb- at next year 's bayreuth festival , although an unofficial boycott of the composer 's music has been observed in israel for over 70 years .
prominent israeli journalist and holocaust survivor noah klieger -lrb- born in 1926 in strasbourg -rrb- explains how the unspoken wagner ban came about in israel and why he is opposed to an israeli orchestra performing wagner 's music . deutsche welle : why are you opposed to the israel chamber orchestra playing wagner at the bayreuth festival ? noah klieger : i 'm against it because i 'm against playing wagner in israel .
wagner was the father of the theory of the races ; he was the first one to claim that there was a master race - the germans - and a low-class race - the jews .
he was the first to explain this in writing .
in 1938 , the symphony orchestra of eretz israel , which later became the israeli philharmonic orchestra , was about to perform wagner in a concert in tel aviv directed by -lsb- arturo -rsb- toscanini .
bronislaw huberman , the man who founded it , decided that the orchestra could not play wagner .
november 8-9 , 1938 was the so-called night of broken glass where the synagogues were destroyed and burned all over germany and austria , thousands of shops were looted and destroyed , hundreds of jews were murdered and tens of thousands of jews were sent to concentration camps .
huberman then realized that -lsb- wagner 's -rsb- theory had been realized by the germans at that time .
so he decided not to play wagner .
then he decided , together with the bosses of the jewish community in palestine - there was no israeli government at that time - to boycott wagner .
this happened before the shoah .
so , of course it was taken over later , because during the shoah it became clear that hitler was a great admirer of wagner .
not only did he adopt his theories , but he adopted his music as well .
the boycott has never been lifted .
it 's true that sometimes directors have tried to perform wagner in israel .
a man who decided to do it was daniel barenboim who , in a concert with a german orchestra , performed wagner , claiming that it was done spontaneously .
but it 's not true - you can not perform spontaneously with an orchestra .
you would say , then , that if the holocaust had not happened , israel would still have a boycott against wagner ? yes , i think so , because the pogroms happened .
it was not decided after the holocaust , it was decided after the pogroms in 1938 . by the way , there is no official ban .
it 's a sentimental ban .
as long as some of us are still alive , people should refrain from imposing wagner on us .
but we 're the not only ones ; there are many , many israelis who were born after the holocaust who are also against wagner for the same reason . how does this younger generation view wagner ? i do n't even know whether the younger generation is very familiar with wagner .
i do n't think that many young people are fond of wagner .
i 'm convinced they 're not . do you think that the israeli orchestra playing in bayreuth could serve as an act of reconciliation ? we do n't need reconciliation with wagner .
we have reconciliation with germany .
we have nothing against the new german generations .
i go to germany very often ; i lecture in germany .
i lecture on the shoah , but this is a different story .
i have no problem whatsoever , because they 're not the same germans .
but wagner is the same wagner - whether it 's today or 100 years ago , it 's the same wagner with the same theory . does the ban apply to any other composers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 night of broken glass was evidence that the nazis 's anti-semitism had turned violent no .
richard strauss was at least as strong an anti-semite as wagner was , but we play strauss . why ? because he is not the father of this -lsb- racial -rsb- theory .
if we banned all anti-semites , we would n't have a lot of writers , poets and composers because most of them were anti-jewish .
i can give you a list of about a hundred .
but we have their books , we read their books , we study their books , we even teach from their books .
the same thing goes for music , but wagner is a different story . have you had the personal experience of listening to wagner 's music ? i know wagner 's music , but i really do n't like this music .
it 's too bombastic for me .
it 's only a joke of course -lsb- laughing -rsb- but it 's music where you can not even sleep in the opera because it 's much too loud . i personally do n't like his music , but i know that he 's a genius without any doubt .

it 's set to start the ball rolling for similar agreements with other asian countries . the european union and south korea signed a record free-trade agreement in brussels on wednesday .
it 's expected to cut around 3 billion euros ' -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- worth of tariffs and lift administrative barriers and regulations on goods ranging from cars to whisky .
" this agreement is by far the most important trade deal ever concluded be the european union with one country and the first free trade deal with an asian country , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso .
the accord is set to take effect on july 1 , 2011 , once ratified by the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's luxury car industry may cash in on the deal the deal could double trade between europe and south korea by boosting business by 30 billion euros a year .
" the pact sends a strong signal that trade liberalization is a key element for recovery of the world economy , " said eu president herman van rompuy .
the eu runs a deficit with south korea in goods trade , although trends suggest the korean market offers significant growth potential for european firms .
expanding trade with asia the eu hopes that trade liberalization will broaden its influence in asia .
lifting customs duties on imported goods will make imported south korean products cheaper in the eu and eu goods cheaper in south korea .
europe 's spirits industry welcomed the deal for its potential in boosting sales of eu-produced drinks such as scotch whisky and french cognac .
the german luxury car and meat industries also hope to benefit from this arrangement .
italy was initially hesitant about the deal , fearing its national carmaker , fiat , could be outdone by south korea 's kia und hyundai car manufacturers .
but the country dropped its veto in return for delaying the treaty 's implementation until july 1 .
tariffs on some goods , such as small cars , will continue for up to five years thereafter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rompuy : free trade will help economic recovery the eu deal with south korea could trigger a rush among asian states to enter trade pacts with the 27-nation bloc . japan is keen to have better access to european markets .
on tuesday , japanese officials said that they hoped to start free-trade talks with the eu in the spring , partly in reaction to the korean agreement .
as japan and korea are competitors in several industries , japanese manufacturers stand to lose market share in europe 's automotive and electronics markets .
malaysian diplomats said that they , too , had agreed to open free-trade negotiations with the eu .

an investment company holding 150,000 postbank shares is prepared to file a legal complaint protesting deutsche bank ’ s offer . deutsche bank announced in september it would offer smaller postbank shareholders who hold what 's called the free float 25 euros per share as part of an effort to consolidate control over postbank by increasing its 29.95 percent stake .
now , one of those small shareholders , dusseldorf-based effecten-spiegel , is close to filing a legal complaint once the offer is made official .
germany 's financial regulator bafin had allowed for the shares to be sold at 25 euros , based on a three-month average .
deutsche bank intends to fund the purchase through 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.1bn -rrb- in capital , raised by issuing 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros each .
law circumvented ?
marlis weidtmann , executive director of effecten-spiegel , which holds 150,000 postbank shares , says deutsche bank is trying to circumvent laws regulating takeovers .
deutsche bank has had a multi-tiered agreement with postbank 's owner , deutsche post , since january 2009 , in which it agreed to buy the former parent company 's 27.4 percent stake for 45 euros a share .
but those shares wo n't actually change hands until 2012 , leaving deutsche bank with less than 30 percent ownership of postbank for now and thus free to buy shares for 25 euros each – their average value over the last three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and postbank have long gone hand-in-hand weidtmann added that the details of the agreement have never been made completely public , but that independent calculations based on widely available information show the shares would be worth at least 36 euros each , if it were to be legally acknowledged that deutsche bank has more than a 30 percent stake in postbank .
“ it makes us suspicious , because we have to ask ourselves , ‘ what 's written in there ? ' ”
weidtmann told deutsche welle .
“ what surprises me is that bafin has played along thus far . ”
a ‘ soap bubble ' bonn-based lawyer wienand meilicke , who co-authored the report published in the trade journal zip , which valued the postbank shares at 36 euros , says “ a whole lot of people ” will be short-changed through deutsche bank 's plans .
“ if someone sticks a needle in this thing the soap bubble will pop , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ i am of the opinion that there is a significant chance this case will be successful in court .
but that means fighting the german banking establishment . ”
according to weidtmann , deutsche bank has so far defended its plans by “ always pulling back and making the argument that the shares wo n't change hands until 2012 . ”
tight-lipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and deutsche bank have angered smaller shareholders a deutsche bank spokesman told deutsche welle the bank “ sees no legal grounds for the complaint . ”
he referred to the position taken by frankfurt-based law firm hengeler mueller which , in a january 2009 press release , spoke of having advised deutsche bank on an “ improved transaction structure ” for its acquisition of postbank shares .
a hengeler mueller spokesman , however , declined to comment .
postbank has 24 million retail clients – more than any other bank in germany – and deutsche bank has been working to increase its number of domestic customers .
also , banks will soon be required to hold more capital to safeguard against future financial crises under the new basel iii accord , which will come into force in 2012 .
acquiring postbank will likely help deutsche bank meet those requirements .

they help them find jobs , schools and kindergartens . cristina nastase stands in the dirty courtyard of a run-down grey tenement building in berlin 's tiergarten district at eight o 'clock in the morning , softly calling out two names under an open window .
curtains and clothing hung out to dry on clotheslines flap in the breeze .
many of the tenants here are roma from romania who entered germany with a tourist visa and would like to stay .
cristina nastase , 32 , is also romanian , an education welfare officer who helps roma and migrant workers .
angela and her two-year-old son , david , appear at the door , cristina greets them , and they all walk to the boy 's new kindergarten .
it 's a completely new experience for mother and son .
only the other day , they were out on the streets begging , like many of the roma here .
a chance for the children " attending kindergarten is important , " cristina says .
" it gives david a chance to have an untroubled childhood , and he can learn german . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cristina works on the streets of berlin , offering help cristina comforts the cranky child on the 20-minute walk to the kindergarten , she listens to angela 's problems and they discuss the cleaning job cristina has gotten her in her son 's kindergarten , which gives the single mother a chance to earn a little money and learn a bit german .
once they get to the kindergarten , david immediately runs off to play with the other children .
moved to tears , cristina watches him .
" in the streets , i often encounter families with children , " she says .
" it is really touching when a child gets the chance to enjoy his childhood . "
cultural mediators many roma are illiterate and speak little german .
they are not in a position to fill in school applications , proper rental contracts or health insurance forms - things they need to be able to stay in germany , even as eu citizens .
often , they end up on the streets , cleaning car windshields or begging for money .
but outreach workers may be able to help .
cristina nastase and one other co-worker were sent by the berlin-based organization " southeast europe culture " to do community outreach .
funding comes from local government .
kindergarten teacher barbara thorm accepted david under the condition that cristina accompanied mother and son during the first week , helping with translations and explaining , for instance , the importance of punctuality .
" things go wrong so often not because of the people involved but because there is no concept as to how to interact , " thorm says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : begging may be a thing of the past for some roma children in berlin photos to send home while david and his mother spend the day in the kindergarten , cristina 's next stop takes her to the city 's cathedral , a spot that not only draws many tourists , but beggars from romania as well .
cristina asks a roma woman carrying a small child whether she needs help .
in next to no time , the outreach worker is surrounded by roma women .
" they are very open , " cristina says .
" you only need to show an interest in their concerns . "
today the women clamor to have their pictures taken so they can send them home to romania .
for the next 15 minutes or so , they have fun taking photos - a regular part of cristina 's job .
but the regular requests for money , a job or an apartment are not as easy for cristina to fulfill - for lack of funds and time .

chinese premier wen jiabao was in berlin after an eu-asia summit produced mixed results . germany has agreed to forge closer economic ties with china and press beijing 's case to be recognized as a market economy by the european union .
chancellor angela merkel met chinese premier wen jiabao at the meseberg palace near berlin following an eu-asia summit in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and wen met to build on discussions in brussels a joint statement issued by the german and chinese delegations after the meeting said that both leaders supported " strengthening european-chinese economic relations and want to encourage them through consultation and building up cooperation . "
it said there was a need for china and the eu to strengthen mutual political confidence and deepen strategic co-operation . "
the statement said that germany would work to get the european union to recognize china as a market economy by 2016 , giving the country certain benefits under international trade rules .
leaders at the summit in brussels had earlier reached broad agreement on reforms to help stabilize the international economy .
however , efforts to gain concessions from china to allow a more rapid appreciation in the value of the yuan appear to have failed .
changes in global economy the biennial asia europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- brought together 27 eu and 19 asian leaders , with agreement that reforms were needed to keep pace with changes in the world economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 is to discuss issues such as financial regulation " the priority is now to reach agreement on a system of global financial , monetary and economic governance : we have to act together very closely on this , " said summit chairman and president of the european council herman van rompuy .
leaders from the nations represented , 12 of which are members of the g20 group of leading economies , agreed that the next g20 summit in the south korean capital , seoul , next month should address a range of issues .
issues up for discussion at that summit include ensuring better government spending control and tighter regulation of the financial industry .
states also moved closer to a firm deal on the redistribution of voting rights within international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , for which european states retain disproportionate power compared with asian states .
a broad agreement on the need for reform was reached , although disagreements remained on the precise details .
no movement on chinese currency european nations also pressed - without success - for a china to allow its currency , the yuan , to increase in value , amid charges that beijing is deliberately devaluing its money to aid its export industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western countries say the yuan is being kept artificially low the chairman of eurozone finance ministers , jean-claude juncker said euro nations had urged an " orderly , significant and broad-based appreciation " of the yuan .
when asked about the chinese response , juncker said .
" the chinese authorities do not share our view . "
leaders also pledged to seek an urgent , legally-binding deal on global warming at united nations climate talks in cancun , mexico , beginning next month .
the german and chinese negotiations also touched on climate change , with both countries saying that they hoped progress would be made at the talks .
recognition of china as a market economy would make it less vulnerable to charges that it is dumping products onto global markets against world trade organization rules .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 06.10.2010 israel does n't need reconciliation with wagner , says holocaust survivor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noah klieger survived several concentration camps during the holocaust richard wagner 's music has been boycotted in israel in light of the nazi pogroms of 1938 .
holocaust survivor and israeli journalist noah klieger explains why the ban is justified and does n't hinder reconciliation . the israel chamber orchestra has agreed to perform a work by anti-semitic composer richard wagner -lrb- 1813-1883 -rrb- at next year 's bayreuth festival , although an unofficial boycott of the composer 's music has been observed in israel for over 70 years .
prominent israeli journalist and holocaust survivor noah klieger -lrb- born in 1926 in strasbourg -rrb- explains how the unspoken wagner ban came about in israel and why he is opposed to an israeli orchestra performing wagner 's music . deutsche welle : why are you opposed to the israel chamber orchestra playing wagner at the bayreuth festival ? noah klieger : i 'm against it because i 'm against playing wagner in israel .
wagner was the father of the theory of the races ; he was the first one to claim that there was a master race - the germans - and a low-class race - the jews .
he was the first to explain this in writing .
in 1938 , the symphony orchestra of eretz israel , which later became the israeli philharmonic orchestra , was about to perform wagner in a concert in tel aviv directed by -lsb- arturo -rsb- toscanini .
bronislaw huberman , the man who founded it , decided that the orchestra could not play wagner .
november 8-9 , 1938 was the so-called night of broken glass where the synagogues were destroyed and burned all over germany and austria , thousands of shops were looted and destroyed , hundreds of jews were murdered and tens of thousands of jews were sent to concentration camps .
huberman then realized that -lsb- wagner 's -rsb- theory had been realized by the germans at that time .
so he decided not to play wagner .
then he decided , together with the bosses of the jewish community in palestine - there was no israeli government at that time - to boycott wagner .
this happened before the shoah .
so , of course it was taken over later , because during the shoah it became clear that hitler was a great admirer of wagner .
not only did he adopt his theories , but he adopted his music as well .
the boycott has never been lifted .
it 's true that sometimes directors have tried to perform wagner in israel .
a man who decided to do it was daniel barenboim who , in a concert with a german orchestra , performed wagner , claiming that it was done spontaneously .
but it 's not true - you can not perform spontaneously with an orchestra .
you would say , then , that if the holocaust had not happened , israel would still have a boycott against wagner ? yes , i think so , because the pogroms happened .
it was not decided after the holocaust , it was decided after the pogroms in 1938 . by the way , there is no official ban .
it 's a sentimental ban .
as long as some of us are still alive , people should refrain from imposing wagner on us .
but we 're the not only ones ; there are many , many israelis who were born after the holocaust who are also against wagner for the same reason . how does this younger generation view wagner ? i do n't even know whether the younger generation is very familiar with wagner .
i do n't think that many young people are fond of wagner .
i 'm convinced they 're not . do you think that the israeli orchestra playing in bayreuth could serve as an act of reconciliation ? we do n't need reconciliation with wagner .
we have reconciliation with germany .
we have nothing against the new german generations .
i go to germany very often ; i lecture in germany .
i lecture on the shoah , but this is a different story .
i have no problem whatsoever , because they 're not the same germans .
but wagner is the same wagner - whether it 's today or 100 years ago , it 's the same wagner with the same theory . does the ban apply to any other composers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 night of broken glass was evidence that the nazis 's anti-semitism had turned violent no .
richard strauss was at least as strong an anti-semite as wagner was , but we play strauss . why ? because he is not the father of this -lsb- racial -rsb- theory .
if we banned all anti-semites , we would n't have a lot of writers , poets and composers because most of them were anti-jewish .
i can give you a list of about a hundred .
but we have their books , we read their books , we study their books , we even teach from their books .
the same thing goes for music , but wagner is a different story . have you had the personal experience of listening to wagner 's music ? i know wagner 's music , but i really do n't like this music .
it 's too bombastic for me .
it 's only a joke of course -lsb- laughing -rsb- but it 's music where you can not even sleep in the opera because it 's much too loud . i personally do n't like his music , but i know that he 's a genius without any doubt .
he was one of the greatest composers ever , but this has nothing to do with his theories . interview : kate bowen / ma 'ayan yahbes editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de israeli orchestra breaks boycott to perform at 2011 bayreuth festival in israel , there is an unspoken ban on performing the works of anti-semitic composer richard wagner .
the announcement that an israeli orchestra will perform at the wagner festival in bayreuth has caused a stir at home .

an investment company holding 150,000 postbank shares is prepared to file a legal complaint protesting deutsche bank ’ s offer . deutsche bank announced in september it would offer smaller postbank shareholders who hold what 's called the free float 25 euros per share as part of an effort to consolidate control over postbank by increasing its 29.95 percent stake .
now , one of those small shareholders , dusseldorf-based effecten-spiegel , is close to filing a legal complaint once the offer is made official .
germany 's financial regulator bafin had allowed for the shares to be sold at 25 euros , based on a three-month average .
deutsche bank intends to fund the purchase through 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.1bn -rrb- in capital , raised by issuing 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros each .
law circumvented ?
marlis weidtmann , executive director of effecten-spiegel , which holds 150,000 postbank shares , says deutsche bank is trying to circumvent laws regulating takeovers .
deutsche bank has had a multi-tiered agreement with postbank 's owner , deutsche post , since january 2009 , in which it agreed to buy the former parent company 's 27.4 percent stake for 45 euros a share .
but those shares wo n't actually change hands until 2012 , leaving deutsche bank with less than 30 percent ownership of postbank for now and thus free to buy shares for 25 euros each – their average value over the last three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and postbank have long gone hand-in-hand weidtmann added that the details of the agreement have never been made completely public , but that independent calculations based on widely available information show the shares would be worth at least 36 euros each , if it were to be legally acknowledged that deutsche bank has more than a 30 percent stake in postbank .
“ it makes us suspicious , because we have to ask ourselves , ‘ what 's written in there ? ' ”
weidtmann told deutsche welle .
“ what surprises me is that bafin has played along thus far . ”
a ‘ soap bubble ' bonn-based lawyer wienand meilicke , who co-authored the report published in the trade journal zip , which valued the postbank shares at 36 euros , says “ a whole lot of people ” will be short-changed through deutsche bank 's plans .
“ if someone sticks a needle in this thing the soap bubble will pop , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ i am of the opinion that there is a significant chance this case will be successful in court .
but that means fighting the german banking establishment . ”
according to weidtmann , deutsche bank has so far defended its plans by “ always pulling back and making the argument that the shares wo n't change hands until 2012 . ”
tight-lipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and deutsche bank have angered smaller shareholders a deutsche bank spokesman told deutsche welle the bank “ sees no legal grounds for the complaint . ”
he referred to the position taken by frankfurt-based law firm hengeler mueller which , in a january 2009 press release , spoke of having advised deutsche bank on an “ improved transaction structure ” for its acquisition of postbank shares .
a hengeler mueller spokesman , however , declined to comment .
postbank has 24 million retail clients – more than any other bank in germany – and deutsche bank has been working to increase its number of domestic customers .
also , banks will soon be required to hold more capital to safeguard against future financial crises under the new basel iii accord , which will come into force in 2012 .
acquiring postbank will likely help deutsche bank meet those requirements .

this year , bookworms can sample from tons of digital literature content and media . star authors like american jonathan franzen and briton ken follett , and not one , but two german nobel prize winners - guenter grass and herta mueller - are expected to attend this year 's frankfurt book fair , which runs from october 6-10 .
those names may be the literature fair 's trump card , but organizers say they also hope to showcase new concepts for the future of publishing .
" the biggest trend is that various media are merging , " said frankfurt book fair 's director , juergen boos .
" when people sit at their computers , they often have news pages open , as well as their e-mail and other programs .
that shows how dynamic things are . "
the worlds of film and publishing are coming closer together , he added .
" people load all their preferred media onto one device , or have several different devices that they jump back and forth from . "
bridging lit and tech in a program called " frankfurt sparks , " the fair is to showcase new technologies which demand fresh content .
with reading devices , apps , and internet platforms beginning to edge out or at least alter traditional printed books , the program 's intention in focusing on that trend is to spark debate .
" frankfurt storydrive " is a cross-media conference accompanying the fair , where publishers , technology and software developers , game representatives and media users can brainstorm about developing " worlds " for good stories and continue the debate about literature trends .
" device providers need content to arouse consumer interest in their devices , " said bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , a cooperation partner at the conference .
" the frankfurt book fair provides that content , so it is a typical win-win situation for both the fair and the technology sector , " he said .

a new german reading device is slotted for debut at the fair , for instance , since internet book giant amazon has been hesitant to issue its kindle on the german market due to unclarified copyright issues .
another continued challenge for publishers is that many internet users do not want to pay for digital content , boos said , but it 's also a trend that offers potential for new developments .
" when ' avatar ' - the hugely successful movie - was created , the book , computer game and music were developed and marketed all at the same time , " boos stressed .
" that was a first , and it shows that people are thinking differently . "
good news and bad boos aims to tap into this cross-media market , but has a few hurdles to leap at this year 's fair .
bucking past years ' trends of record participation , this year sees a five percent drop in exhibitors , bringing the number to around 6,900 .
there are also 100,000 fewer new publications .
but there is some good news , too .

the children 's literature market is likewise buzzing , and the education sector can boast 11 percent more exhibitors this year .
the book fair is advancing its campaign for literacy and human rights , while the literary agents center is bursting at the seams .

this year , bookworms can sample from tons of digital literature content and media . star authors like american jonathan franzen and briton ken follett , and not one , but two german nobel prize winners - guenter grass and herta mueller - are expected to attend this year 's frankfurt book fair , which runs from october 6-10 .
those names may be the literature fair 's trump card , but organizers say they also hope to showcase new concepts for the future of publishing .
" the biggest trend is that various media are merging , " said frankfurt book fair 's director , juergen boos .
" when people sit at their computers , they often have news pages open , as well as their e-mail and other programs .
that shows how dynamic things are . "
the worlds of film and publishing are coming closer together , he added .
" people load all their preferred media onto one device , or have several different devices that they jump back and forth from . "
bridging lit and tech in a program called " frankfurt sparks , " the fair is to showcase new technologies which demand fresh content .
with reading devices , apps , and internet platforms beginning to edge out or at least alter traditional printed books , the program 's intention in focusing on that trend is to spark debate .
" frankfurt storydrive " is a cross-media conference accompanying the fair , where publishers , technology and software developers , game representatives and media users can brainstorm about developing " worlds " for good stories and continue the debate about literature trends .
" device providers need content to arouse consumer interest in their devices , " said bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , a cooperation partner at the conference .
" the frankfurt book fair provides that content , so it is a typical win-win situation for both the fair and the technology sector , " he said .
bildunterschrift : not everything has gone digital growth in digital area rohleder anticipates growth of 20 percent in the next decade for the sector that merges literature and technology .
a new german reading device is slotted for debut at the fair , for instance , since internet book giant amazon has been hesitant to issue its kindle on the german market due to unclarified copyright issues .
another continued challenge for publishers is that many internet users do not want to pay for digital content , boos said , but it 's also a trend that offers potential for new developments .
" when ' avatar ' - the hugely successful movie - was created , the book , computer game and music were developed and marketed all at the same time , " boos stressed .
" that was a first , and it shows that people are thinking differently . "
good news and bad boos aims to tap into this cross-media market , but has a few hurdles to leap at this year 's fair .
bucking past years ' trends of record participation , this year sees a five percent drop in exhibitors , bringing the number to around 6,900 .
there are also 100,000 fewer new publications .
but there is some good news , too .
with argentinia as the focus this year , 216 new translations are coming out of the country .
the children 's literature market is likewise buzzing , and the education sector can boast 11 percent more exhibitors this year .
the book fair is advancing its campaign for literacy and human rights , while the literary agents center is bursting at the seams .
" that is the most significant record we can report - that the licensing sector is been growing steadily , with more agents than in previous years so that they do n't all fit into the hall intended for them .
that 's the growth to be proud of at this year 's fair and is its backbone , " boos said .

bridging lit and tech in a program called " frankfurt sparks , " the fair is to showcase new technologies which demand fresh content .
with reading devices , apps , and internet platforms beginning to edge out or at least alter traditional printed books , the program 's intention in focusing on that trend is to spark debate .
" frankfurt storydrive " is a cross-media conference accompanying the fair , where publishers , technology and software developers , game representatives and media users can brainstorm about developing " worlds " for good stories and continue the debate about literature trends .
" device providers need content to arouse consumer interest in their devices , " said bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , a cooperation partner at the conference .

a new german reading device is slotted for debut at the fair , for instance , since internet book giant amazon has been hesitant to issue its kindle on the german market due to unclarified copyright issues .
another continued challenge for publishers is that many internet users do not want to pay for digital content , boos said , but it 's also a trend that offers potential for new developments .
" when ' avatar ' - the hugely successful movie - was created , the book , computer game and music were developed and marketed all at the same time , " boos stressed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 06.10.2010 deutsche bank may face lawsuit over postbank takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank is after postbank 's 24 million retail clients deutsche bank ’ s takeover plans for postbank are likely to become more complicated .
an investment company holding 150,000 postbank shares is prepared to file a legal complaint protesting deutsche bank ’ s offer . deutsche bank announced in september it would offer smaller postbank shareholders who hold what 's called the free float 25 euros per share as part of an effort to consolidate control over postbank by increasing its 29.95 percent stake .
now , one of those small shareholders , dusseldorf-based effecten-spiegel , is close to filing a legal complaint once the offer is made official .
germany 's financial regulator bafin had allowed for the shares to be sold at 25 euros , based on a three-month average .
deutsche bank intends to fund the purchase through 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.1bn -rrb- in capital , raised by issuing 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros each .
law circumvented ?
marlis weidtmann , executive director of effecten-spiegel , which holds 150,000 postbank shares , says deutsche bank is trying to circumvent laws regulating takeovers .
deutsche bank has had a multi-tiered agreement with postbank 's owner , deutsche post , since january 2009 , in which it agreed to buy the former parent company 's 27.4 percent stake for 45 euros a share .
but those shares wo n't actually change hands until 2012 , leaving deutsche bank with less than 30 percent ownership of postbank for now and thus free to buy shares for 25 euros each – their average value over the last three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and postbank have long gone hand-in-hand weidtmann added that the details of the agreement have never been made completely public , but that independent calculations based on widely available information show the shares would be worth at least 36 euros each , if it were to be legally acknowledged that deutsche bank has more than a 30 percent stake in postbank .
“ it makes us suspicious , because we have to ask ourselves , ‘ what 's written in there ? ' ”
weidtmann told deutsche welle .
“ what surprises me is that bafin has played along thus far . ”
a ‘ soap bubble ' bonn-based lawyer wienand meilicke , who co-authored the report published in the trade journal zip , which valued the postbank shares at 36 euros , says “ a whole lot of people ” will be short-changed through deutsche bank 's plans .
“ if someone sticks a needle in this thing the soap bubble will pop , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ i am of the opinion that there is a significant chance this case will be successful in court .
but that means fighting the german banking establishment . ”

tight-lipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and deutsche bank have angered smaller shareholders a deutsche bank spokesman told deutsche welle the bank “ sees no legal grounds for the complaint . ”
he referred to the position taken by frankfurt-based law firm hengeler mueller which , in a january 2009 press release , spoke of having advised deutsche bank on an “ improved transaction structure ” for its acquisition of postbank shares .
a hengeler mueller spokesman , however , declined to comment .
postbank has 24 million retail clients – more than any other bank in germany – and deutsche bank has been working to increase its number of domestic customers .
also , banks will soon be required to hold more capital to safeguard against future financial crises under the new basel iii accord , which will come into force in 2012 .
acquiring postbank will likely help deutsche bank meet those requirements .

an investment company holding 150,000 postbank shares is prepared to file a legal complaint protesting deutsche bank ’ s offer . deutsche bank announced in september it would offer smaller postbank shareholders who hold what 's called the free float 25 euros per share as part of an effort to consolidate control over postbank by increasing its 29.95 percent stake .
now , one of those small shareholders , dusseldorf-based effecten-spiegel , is close to filing a legal complaint once the offer is made official .
germany 's financial regulator bafin had allowed for the shares to be sold at 25 euros , based on a three-month average .
deutsche bank intends to fund the purchase through 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.1bn -rrb- in capital , raised by issuing 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros each .
law circumvented ?
marlis weidtmann , executive director of effecten-spiegel , which holds 150,000 postbank shares , says deutsche bank is trying to circumvent laws regulating takeovers .
deutsche bank has had a multi-tiered agreement with postbank 's owner , deutsche post , since january 2009 , in which it agreed to buy the former parent company 's 27.4 percent stake for 45 euros a share .
but those shares wo n't actually change hands until 2012 , leaving deutsche bank with less than 30 percent ownership of postbank for now and thus free to buy shares for 25 euros each – their average value over the last three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and postbank have long gone hand-in-hand weidtmann added that the details of the agreement have never been made completely public , but that independent calculations based on widely available information show the shares would be worth at least 36 euros each , if it were to be legally acknowledged that deutsche bank has more than a 30 percent stake in postbank .
“ it makes us suspicious , because we have to ask ourselves , ‘ what 's written in there ? ' ”
weidtmann told deutsche welle .
“ what surprises me is that bafin has played along thus far . ”
a ‘ soap bubble ' bonn-based lawyer wienand meilicke , who co-authored the report published in the trade journal zip , which valued the postbank shares at 36 euros , says “ a whole lot of people ” will be short-changed through deutsche bank 's plans .
“ if someone sticks a needle in this thing the soap bubble will pop , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ i am of the opinion that there is a significant chance this case will be successful in court .
but that means fighting the german banking establishment . ”
according to weidtmann , deutsche bank has so far defended its plans by “ always pulling back and making the argument that the shares wo n't change hands until 2012 . ”
tight-lipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and deutsche bank have angered smaller shareholders a deutsche bank spokesman told deutsche welle the bank “ sees no legal grounds for the complaint . ”

it 's set to start the ball rolling for similar agreements with other asian countries . the european union and south korea signed a record free-trade agreement in brussels on wednesday .
it 's expected to cut around 3 billion euros ' -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- worth of tariffs and lift administrative barriers and regulations on goods ranging from cars to whisky .
" this agreement is by far the most important trade deal ever concluded be the european union with one country and the first free trade deal with an asian country , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso .
the accord is set to take effect on july 1 , 2011 , once ratified by the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's luxury car industry may cash in on the deal the deal could double trade between europe and south korea by boosting business by 30 billion euros a year .
" the pact sends a strong signal that trade liberalization is a key element for recovery of the world economy , " said eu president herman van rompuy .
the eu runs a deficit with south korea in goods trade , although trends suggest the korean market offers significant growth potential for european firms .
expanding trade with asia the eu hopes that trade liberalization will broaden its influence in asia .
lifting customs duties on imported goods will make imported south korean products cheaper in the eu and eu goods cheaper in south korea .
europe 's spirits industry welcomed the deal for its potential in boosting sales of eu-produced drinks such as scotch whisky and french cognac .
the german luxury car and meat industries also hope to benefit from this arrangement .
italy was initially hesitant about the deal , fearing its national carmaker , fiat , could be outdone by south korea 's kia und hyundai car manufacturers .
but the country dropped its veto in return for delaying the treaty 's implementation until july 1 .
tariffs on some goods , such as small cars , will continue for up to five years thereafter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rompuy : free trade will help economic recovery the eu deal with south korea could trigger a rush among asian states to enter trade pacts with the 27-nation bloc . japan is keen to have better access to european markets .
on tuesday , japanese officials said that they hoped to start free-trade talks with the eu in the spring , partly in reaction to the korean agreement .
as japan and korea are competitors in several industries , japanese manufacturers stand to lose market share in europe 's automotive and electronics markets .
malaysian diplomats said that they , too , had agreed to open free-trade negotiations with the eu .

it came at a time when europe , too , was undergoing political change . ludwig van beethoven -lrb- 1770-1827 -rrb- symphony no. 3 in e-flat major , op .
55 -lrb- eroica -rrb- bamberg symphony orchestra conductor : jonathan nott mp3 recorded by deutschlandfunk on october 3 , 2010 in the beethoven hall , bonn . when napoleon bonaparte crowned himself emperor in paris ' notre dame cathedral in late 1804 , beethoven was in the process of composing his third symphony , in e-flat major .
the composer had been a supporter of napoleon and planned to dedicate the massive orchestral work to him .
but , as the story goes , when beethoven heard the news of the self-coronation , he was furious and scratched out the dedication . though the composer 's admiration for napoleon never completely dwindled , his great e-flat symphony was published with the title it is known under today : " sinfonia eroica - composed to celebrate the memory of a great man . " the symphony superseded all of beethoven 's previous orchestral works in length , complexity , form and virtuosity .
as with most ground-breaking works , the eroica symphony was initially pelted with criticism upon its premiere in vienna in 1805 . it is performed here by the bamberg symphony orchestra under the direction of their chief conductor , jonathan nott .
originally from the uk , nott has directed the bavarian orchestra since 2000 , bringing it to both national and international acclaim . author : kate bowen -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it came at a time when europe , too , was undergoing political change . ludwig van beethoven -lrb- 1770-1827 -rrb- symphony no. 3 in e-flat major , op .
55 -lrb- eroica -rrb- bamberg symphony orchestra conductor : jonathan nott mp3 recorded by deutschlandfunk on october 3 , 2010 in the beethoven hall , bonn . when napoleon bonaparte crowned himself emperor in paris ' notre dame cathedral in late 1804 , beethoven was in the process of composing his third symphony , in e-flat major .
the composer had been a supporter of napoleon and planned to dedicate the massive orchestral work to him .
but , as the story goes , when beethoven heard the news of the self-coronation , he was furious and scratched out the dedication . though the composer 's admiration for napoleon never completely dwindled , his great e-flat symphony was published with the title it is known under today : " sinfonia eroica - composed to celebrate the memory of a great man . " the symphony superseded all of beethoven 's previous orchestral works in length , complexity , form and virtuosity .
as with most ground-breaking works , the eroica symphony was initially pelted with criticism upon its premiere in vienna in 1805 . it is performed here by the bamberg symphony orchestra under the direction of their chief conductor , jonathan nott .
originally from the uk , nott has directed the bavarian orchestra since 2000 , bringing it to both national and international acclaim . author : kate bowen -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 06.10.2010 venice continues work on massive flood protection project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice scientists say high water events are increasing the mose flood gates aim to stave off potential disaster in the city and the larger venice lagoon when the adriatic sea surges .
local scientists say that such events are on the rise in recent years . last month , under the bright summer italian sun , tourists rolled up their trousers and waded through water in front of the centuries-old basilica on venice 's famous piazza san marco .
this was one of the most recent occurances of " acqua alta , " or " high water , " a term used in the veneto region for the exceptional tide peaks occurring in the adriatic sea , which reaching their maximum in the venetian lagoon , invade the foundations and inundate the older and lower parts of venice .
according to the technicians at the city 's tide monitoring and forecast center , these high water events are becoming more frequent and last a longer time .
" the worry is that the increase in the frequency of these high water events does n't show any sign of slowing down , " said paolo canestrelli , the center 's director said in a recent interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's increasing at an almost exponential rate . "
canestrelli cited various reasons for this , one of which he says is climate change .
he added that the fluctuating environment has caused rising sea levels and more frequent storm surges .
plus , he noted , the land the city sits on is also sinking - it 's estimated venice has sunk at least 23 centimeters -lrb- 9.05 inches -rrb- in the past century .
but whatever the reason , the data speaks for itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's tide monitoring and forecast center said that 2009 was a record year for high water a ' record ' year according to canestrelli , 2009 was a record flood year in venice - the worst in more than a century .
the tide reached 80 centimeters , flooding large parts of piazza san marco , more than 125 times .
it reached 110 centimeters , and so invaded large parts of city 16 times .
in the decades since venice began officially recording the " acqua alta " measurements in the early twentieth century , tides of greater than 110 centimeters occurred on an average three or four times a year .
this year , 2010 , canestrelli says , already promises to be worse .
" i think that this year we 'll reach a record higher than that of last year , " he warned in september .
" we 've already had 102 cases of water higher than 80 cm .
so already 102 times , piazza san marco has seen water and there 's still four months to go . "
a decades-old plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mose project encompasses 78 floodgates to block the inlets when the tide reaches over 110 centimeters that 's why now , more than ever , the city needs a huge barrier to protect itself .
the mose project , an italian acronym for " experimental electromechanical module " - and an allusion to moses , who parted the red sea - is intended to protect the city from exceptional high water events .
work has been underway on the project since 2003 and engineers recently estimated that it still wo n't be completed for a number of years to come .
mose provides for 78 floodgates that will rise and block the three inlets connecting venice with the adriatic sea , when a tide of 110 centimetres or more is forecast .
when the alarm sounds , compressed air will fill the gates and empty them of water .
they 'll rotate around their hinges , emerge from the depths and cut off the lagoon from the sea , stopping the tidal flow .
at the lido inlet , the widest of venice 's three entrances to the sea , workers are building the concrete " caissons " or containers that will house 20 of those floodgates , each larger than the wing of a 747 .
but it will be four more years before mose is able to protect venice – two years longer than originally expected , and venetians have been waiting for decades before that .
it was the great flood of 1966 , causing the lagoon to rise almost two meters above its normal levels , which focused attention on the danger to the city .
in 1987 , a consortium of italian companies , the consorzio venezia nuova , was entrusted with finding a solution .
but it was n't until 2003 that construction actually began . " two thirds of the work has been completed now and we 're waiting for remaining 25 percent of the money to do the remaining , " said giovanni cecconi , a consorzio hydrologist .
" from a technical point of view we are pretty much on schedule , and the only risk of delay can come from financing .
by the year 2014 , all the four barriers will start operation , if the money will come . " a multi-billion euro project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget of this massive construction project has ballooned to over 4.5 billion euros mose is the largest public works scheme in italian history , involving 3,000 workers spread over several sites .
its budget has blown out from three billion to more than four and half billion euros .
critics fear it could cost taxpayers close to double that in the end .
at the lido inlet construction site , cecconi is also keen to trumpet mose 's green credentials as the project has long been the target of conservationists .
they say the lagoon is one of the most important wetlands in western europe and the tidal exchange with the sea is essential to its well-being .
cecconi pointed out that the gates can be deployed just partially to minimise the effect on the environment .
" we leave the tidal flow in and out of the lagoon available all the time , but not during the storm surges , so -lrb- we 'll deploy them -rrb- just three to five times a year , for three to four hours , " he said . but cecconi 's comments do n't mollify guido ortalli of italia nostra , a group of citizens concerned to protect italy 's cultural heritage . he describes the project as " very heavy , very costly and technically complicated " and involving " really high maintenance costs . " whatever the objections , most people agree that something must be done , or one of civilization 's most beautiful locations may simply sink beneath the waves .
still , for many in venice , the work on defending the city ca n't finish soon enough .

it says quieter ways of conducting business at sea are already at hand . underwater noise is more than just pollution – it 's a killer .
this is the message the whale and dolphin conservation society hopes to spread with " sonar sucks , " a campaign launched in germany this week to raise awareness of the impact of underwater noise on sea mammals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sound travels more effectively under water than above the whale and dolphin conservation society -lrb- wdcs -rrb- has called for a range of noise-fighting measures to be implemented , including an international moratorium on low- and medium-frequency military sonar equipment , and on oil and gas development of the arctic region , saying underwater noise pollution created by those activities is putting entire aquatic populations at risk .
" it 's the old fashioned out of sight , out of mind – the way that we used to talk about chemical pollution is now the way that we start to look at noise pollution , " mark simmonds , the wdcs international director of science , told deutsche welle .
seeing by hearing whales , dolphins and porpoises rely on hearing for most of their basic needs : they use sonar to communicate , to orient themselves , to find food and mates .
man-made noise can drown out the sounds the mammals rely on day to day with consequences ranging from loss of habitat to death – and according to the wdcs , that noise is increasing .
" the equivalent would be losing your sight and going blind for us … and worse , in some of the noisier areas , " simmonds said .
noise disturbances can cause marine mammals to alter their behavior and abandon breeding and feeding areas , cause injury and lead to whales and dolphins beaching .
in a statement released by the german branch of the wdcs , the organization said that military sonar , marine construction and development , seismic exploration by the oil and gas industry , and the increasing number of ships in the world ’ s oceans are all helping to create an increasingly disorienting environment for the world ’ s cetaceans .
government inaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : offshore wind parks generate noise during their construction , not operation animal welfare groups say the effect of noise on marine mammals has been well documented but that governments have taken little heed .
" as far back as 2004 an historic european parliamentary resolution called on the eu member states to restrict the use of high-intensity sonar but sadly too little has been done , " international fund for animal welfare european union director lesley o 'donnell said .
" eu member states have a clear obligation to protect whales and their habitats from ocean noise which can disturb , injure and even kill whales and other marine species even after it has travelled tremendous distances . "
human activities like construction and oil drilling can create noise levels over 260 decibels – louder than a rocket taking off – and because noise travels differently underwater than through the air , the effects can be felt even hundreds of kilometers from the source .
" low-frequency active sonar from the military can range in distance from 1000 to 1500 kilometers -lsb- through water -rsb- , " wdcs germany conservation manager karsten brenning said .
" that would mean that if you would switch on -lrb- an equivalent above-water -rrb- device in moscow , it would be difficult to have a conversation on german streets . "
problem of wind parks the wdcs pointed to increasing arctic development and a growing amount of energy-related construction at sea as particular areas of concern .
seismic studies , in which sound waves are used to provide information on potential gas and oil deposits on the ocean floor , are being undertaken in designated whale sanctuaries , including the dogger bank and the moray firth in the north sea .
the latter may become home to a major wind farm if a recent proposal from consortium moray offshore renewables goes ahead .
" there 's a lot of development going on in the seas of europe that hasn ’ t been going on before , " simmonds said .
" as people who are essentially environmentalists at heart we like renewable energy … but it ’ s the way that these things are being constructed and fixed into the seabed , the hammering , the pile-driving , this is a very loud source of noise . "
technical solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly stealthy submarines prove ships can be made quieter , says the wdcs the wdcs said new technologies and alternative methods could make industry more environmentally friendly at sea .
simmonds pointed to the use of " bubble curtains " or " jackets " to disrupt the spread of noise that occurs when hammering pylons into place .
he also pointed to the great advances in submarine stealth technology that have been made , saying that these offered great cross-over potential for reducing the impact of ship 's engines .
in terms of noise generated by surveys for resources beneath the seabed , karsten brenning suggested more focus on " passive " seismic surveying , which is more like listening to the seabed than bouncing sound off it .
" there are technological mechanisms coming along but we need more investment and more focus on those , " simmonds said .

it 's set to start the ball rolling for similar agreements with other asian countries . the european union and south korea signed a record free-trade agreement in brussels on wednesday .
it 's expected to cut around 3 billion euros ' -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- worth of tariffs and lift administrative barriers and regulations on goods ranging from cars to whisky .
" this agreement is by far the most important trade deal ever concluded be the european union with one country and the first free trade deal with an asian country , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso .
the accord is set to take effect on july 1 , 2011 , once ratified by the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's luxury car industry may cash in on the deal the deal could double trade between europe and south korea by boosting business by 30 billion euros a year .
" the pact sends a strong signal that trade liberalization is a key element for recovery of the world economy , " said eu president herman van rompuy .
the eu runs a deficit with south korea in goods trade , although trends suggest the korean market offers significant growth potential for european firms .
expanding trade with asia the eu hopes that trade liberalization will broaden its influence in asia .
lifting customs duties on imported goods will make imported south korean products cheaper in the eu and eu goods cheaper in south korea .
europe 's spirits industry welcomed the deal for its potential in boosting sales of eu-produced drinks such as scotch whisky and french cognac .
the german luxury car and meat industries also hope to benefit from this arrangement .
italy was initially hesitant about the deal , fearing its national carmaker , fiat , could be outdone by south korea 's kia und hyundai car manufacturers .
but the country dropped its veto in return for delaying the treaty 's implementation until july 1 .
tariffs on some goods , such as small cars , will continue for up to five years thereafter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rompuy : free trade will help economic recovery the eu deal with south korea could trigger a rush among asian states to enter trade pacts with the 27-nation bloc . japan is keen to have better access to european markets .
on tuesday , japanese officials said that they hoped to start free-trade talks with the eu in the spring , partly in reaction to the korean agreement .
as japan and korea are competitors in several industries , japanese manufacturers stand to lose market share in europe 's automotive and electronics markets .
malaysian diplomats said that they , too , had agreed to open free-trade negotiations with the eu .

" this agreement is by far the most important trade deal ever concluded be the european union with one country and the first free trade deal with an asian country , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso .
the accord is set to take effect on july 1 , 2011 , once ratified by the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's luxury car industry may cash in on the deal the deal could double trade between europe and south korea by boosting business by 30 billion euros a year .
" the pact sends a strong signal that trade liberalization is a key element for recovery of the world economy , " said eu president herman van rompuy .
the eu runs a deficit with south korea in goods trade , although trends suggest the korean market offers significant growth potential for european firms .
expanding trade with asia the eu hopes that trade liberalization will broaden its influence in asia .
lifting customs duties on imported goods will make imported south korean products cheaper in the eu and eu goods cheaper in south korea .
europe 's spirits industry welcomed the deal for its potential in boosting sales of eu-produced drinks such as scotch whisky and french cognac .
the german luxury car and meat industries also hope to benefit from this arrangement .
italy was initially hesitant about the deal , fearing its national carmaker , fiat , could be outdone by south korea 's kia und hyundai car manufacturers .
but the country dropped its veto in return for delaying the treaty 's implementation until july 1 .
tariffs on some goods , such as small cars , will continue for up to five years thereafter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rompuy : free trade will help economic recovery the eu deal with south korea could trigger a rush among asian states to enter trade pacts with the 27-nation bloc . japan is keen to have better access to european markets .
on tuesday , japanese officials said that they hoped to start free-trade talks with the eu in the spring , partly in reaction to the korean agreement .
as japan and korea are competitors in several industries , japanese manufacturers stand to lose market share in europe 's automotive and electronics markets .
malaysian diplomats said that they , too , had agreed to open free-trade negotiations with the eu .

an investment company holding 150,000 postbank shares is prepared to file a legal complaint protesting deutsche bank ’ s offer . deutsche bank announced in september it would offer smaller postbank shareholders who hold what 's called the free float 25 euros per share as part of an effort to consolidate control over postbank by increasing its 29.95 percent stake .
now , one of those small shareholders , dusseldorf-based effecten-spiegel , is close to filing a legal complaint once the offer is made official .
germany 's financial regulator bafin had allowed for the shares to be sold at 25 euros , based on a three-month average .
deutsche bank intends to fund the purchase through 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.1bn -rrb- in capital , raised by issuing 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros each .
law circumvented ?
marlis weidtmann , executive director of effecten-spiegel , which holds 150,000 postbank shares , says deutsche bank is trying to circumvent laws regulating takeovers .
deutsche bank has had a multi-tiered agreement with postbank 's owner , deutsche post , since january 2009 , in which it agreed to buy the former parent company 's 27.4 percent stake for 45 euros a share .
but those shares wo n't actually change hands until 2012 , leaving deutsche bank with less than 30 percent ownership of postbank for now and thus free to buy shares for 25 euros each – their average value over the last three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and postbank have long gone hand-in-hand weidtmann added that the details of the agreement have never been made completely public , but that independent calculations based on widely available information show the shares would be worth at least 36 euros each , if it were to be legally acknowledged that deutsche bank has more than a 30 percent stake in postbank .
“ it makes us suspicious , because we have to ask ourselves , ‘ what 's written in there ? ' ”
weidtmann told deutsche welle .
“ what surprises me is that bafin has played along thus far . ”
a ‘ soap bubble ' bonn-based lawyer wienand meilicke , who co-authored the report published in the trade journal zip , which valued the postbank shares at 36 euros , says “ a whole lot of people ” will be short-changed through deutsche bank 's plans .
“ if someone sticks a needle in this thing the soap bubble will pop , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ i am of the opinion that there is a significant chance this case will be successful in court .
but that means fighting the german banking establishment . ”
according to weidtmann , deutsche bank has so far defended its plans by “ always pulling back and making the argument that the shares wo n't change hands until 2012 . ”
tight-lipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and deutsche bank have angered smaller shareholders a deutsche bank spokesman told deutsche welle the bank “ sees no legal grounds for the complaint . ”
he referred to the position taken by frankfurt-based law firm hengeler mueller which , in a january 2009 press release , spoke of having advised deutsche bank on an “ improved transaction structure ” for its acquisition of postbank shares .
a hengeler mueller spokesman , however , declined to comment .
postbank has 24 million retail clients – more than any other bank in germany – and deutsche bank has been working to increase its number of domestic customers .
also , banks will soon be required to hold more capital to safeguard against future financial crises under the new basel iii accord , which will come into force in 2012 .
acquiring postbank will likely help deutsche bank meet those requirements .

however , one venezuelan pianist who excels at playing off the cuff is an exception to the rule . gabriela montero -lrb- 1970- -rrb- improvisation on the song " guantanamera " gabriela montero -lrb- piano -rrb- mp3 recorded at the petersberg near bonn on september 25 , 2010 by deutsche welle -lrb- dw -rrb- improvisation has been called the well-spring of all music .
in the baroque and classical periods , it was standard practice .
the improvisational abilities of composers like bach , handel and mozart were legendary .
beethoven also showed a prodigious improvisational talent at the piano .
many of his piano sonatas , although precisely crafted compositions , reflect the freewheeling spirit of improvisational fantasy with their tempestuous runs and cascading successions of chords . today , the art of improvisation is widespread in jazz but rare within the realm of " classical " or " serious " music - with one exception being church organists who may improvise preludes or accompaniments to hymn tunes .
however , a talent of the caliber of venezuelan pianist gabriela montero is extremely rare .
montero , who says that she began improvising at age five , has been asked repeatedly " how she does it , " for which she has no answer . to demonstrate her gift for spur-of-the-moment invention , montero often begins a recital playing works from the repertory , but in the second half , improvises elaborate pieces based on melodies suggested by audience members .
the styles and rhythms can vary from romantic to rumba and from the toccata to the tango . we 've chosen a brief excerpt from her all-improvised recital at the petersberg hotel near bonn .
she begins by plucking out the melody of the song " guantanamera " and then builds an elaborate and cleverly crafted musical edifice from the song 's motifs .
experiencing gabriela montero live in concert reminds one of the fact that without improvisation , there would be no music . author : rick fulker editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 06.10.2010 venice continues work on massive flood protection project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice scientists say high water events are increasing the mose flood gates aim to stave off potential disaster in the city and the larger venice lagoon when the adriatic sea surges .
local scientists say that such events are on the rise in recent years . last month , under the bright summer italian sun , tourists rolled up their trousers and waded through water in front of the centuries-old basilica on venice 's famous piazza san marco .
this was one of the most recent occurances of " acqua alta , " or " high water , " a term used in the veneto region for the exceptional tide peaks occurring in the adriatic sea , which reaching their maximum in the venetian lagoon , invade the foundations and inundate the older and lower parts of venice .
according to the technicians at the city 's tide monitoring and forecast center , these high water events are becoming more frequent and last a longer time .
" the worry is that the increase in the frequency of these high water events does n't show any sign of slowing down , " said paolo canestrelli , the center 's director said in a recent interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's increasing at an almost exponential rate . "
canestrelli cited various reasons for this , one of which he says is climate change .
he added that the fluctuating environment has caused rising sea levels and more frequent storm surges .
plus , he noted , the land the city sits on is also sinking - it 's estimated venice has sunk at least 23 centimeters -lrb- 9.05 inches -rrb- in the past century .
but whatever the reason , the data speaks for itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's tide monitoring and forecast center said that 2009 was a record year for high water a ' record ' year according to canestrelli , 2009 was a record flood year in venice - the worst in more than a century .
the tide reached 80 centimeters , flooding large parts of piazza san marco , more than 125 times .
it reached 110 centimeters , and so invaded large parts of city 16 times .
in the decades since venice began officially recording the " acqua alta " measurements in the early twentieth century , tides of greater than 110 centimeters occurred on an average three or four times a year .
this year , 2010 , canestrelli says , already promises to be worse .
" i think that this year we 'll reach a record higher than that of last year , " he warned in september .
" we 've already had 102 cases of water higher than 80 cm .
so already 102 times , piazza san marco has seen water and there 's still four months to go . "
a decades-old plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mose project encompasses 78 floodgates to block the inlets when the tide reaches over 110 centimeters that 's why now , more than ever , the city needs a huge barrier to protect itself .
the mose project , an italian acronym for " experimental electromechanical module " - and an allusion to moses , who parted the red sea - is intended to protect the city from exceptional high water events .
work has been underway on the project since 2003 and engineers recently estimated that it still wo n't be completed for a number of years to come .
mose provides for 78 floodgates that will rise and block the three inlets connecting venice with the adriatic sea , when a tide of 110 centimetres or more is forecast .
when the alarm sounds , compressed air will fill the gates and empty them of water .
they 'll rotate around their hinges , emerge from the depths and cut off the lagoon from the sea , stopping the tidal flow .
at the lido inlet , the widest of venice 's three entrances to the sea , workers are building the concrete " caissons " or containers that will house 20 of those floodgates , each larger than the wing of a 747 .
but it will be four more years before mose is able to protect venice – two years longer than originally expected , and venetians have been waiting for decades before that .
it was the great flood of 1966 , causing the lagoon to rise almost two meters above its normal levels , which focused attention on the danger to the city .
in 1987 , a consortium of italian companies , the consorzio venezia nuova , was entrusted with finding a solution .
but it was n't until 2003 that construction actually began . " two thirds of the work has been completed now and we 're waiting for remaining 25 percent of the money to do the remaining , " said giovanni cecconi , a consorzio hydrologist .
" from a technical point of view we are pretty much on schedule , and the only risk of delay can come from financing .
by the year 2014 , all the four barriers will start operation , if the money will come . " a multi-billion euro project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget of this massive construction project has ballooned to over 4.5 billion euros mose is the largest public works scheme in italian history , involving 3,000 workers spread over several sites .
its budget has blown out from three billion to more than four and half billion euros .
critics fear it could cost taxpayers close to double that in the end .
at the lido inlet construction site , cecconi is also keen to trumpet mose 's green credentials as the project has long been the target of conservationists .
they say the lagoon is one of the most important wetlands in western europe and the tidal exchange with the sea is essential to its well-being .
cecconi pointed out that the gates can be deployed just partially to minimise the effect on the environment .
" we leave the tidal flow in and out of the lagoon available all the time , but not during the storm surges , so -lrb- we 'll deploy them -rrb- just three to five times a year , for three to four hours , " he said . but cecconi 's comments do n't mollify guido ortalli of italia nostra , a group of citizens concerned to protect italy 's cultural heritage . he describes the project as " very heavy , very costly and technically complicated " and involving " really high maintenance costs . " whatever the objections , most people agree that something must be done , or one of civilization 's most beautiful locations may simply sink beneath the waves .
still , for many in venice , the work on defending the city ca n't finish soon enough .

local scientists say that such events are on the rise in recent years . last month , under the bright summer italian sun , tourists rolled up their trousers and waded through water in front of the centuries-old basilica on venice 's famous piazza san marco .
this was one of the most recent occurances of " acqua alta , " or " high water , " a term used in the veneto region for the exceptional tide peaks occurring in the adriatic sea , which reaching their maximum in the venetian lagoon , invade the foundations and inundate the older and lower parts of venice .
according to the technicians at the city 's tide monitoring and forecast center , these high water events are becoming more frequent and last a longer time .
" the worry is that the increase in the frequency of these high water events does n't show any sign of slowing down , " said paolo canestrelli , the center 's director said in a recent interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's increasing at an almost exponential rate . "
canestrelli cited various reasons for this , one of which he says is climate change .
he added that the fluctuating environment has caused rising sea levels and more frequent storm surges .
plus , he noted , the land the city sits on is also sinking - it 's estimated venice has sunk at least 23 centimeters -lrb- 9.05 inches -rrb- in the past century .
but whatever the reason , the data speaks for itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's tide monitoring and forecast center said that 2009 was a record year for high water a ' record ' year according to canestrelli , 2009 was a record flood year in venice - the worst in more than a century .
the tide reached 80 centimeters , flooding large parts of piazza san marco , more than 125 times .
it reached 110 centimeters , and so invaded large parts of city 16 times .
in the decades since venice began officially recording the " acqua alta " measurements in the early twentieth century , tides of greater than 110 centimeters occurred on an average three or four times a year .
this year , 2010 , canestrelli says , already promises to be worse .
" i think that this year we 'll reach a record higher than that of last year , " he warned in september .
" we 've already had 102 cases of water higher than 80 cm .
so already 102 times , piazza san marco has seen water and there 's still four months to go . "
a decades-old plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mose project encompasses 78 floodgates to block the inlets when the tide reaches over 110 centimeters that 's why now , more than ever , the city needs a huge barrier to protect itself .
the mose project , an italian acronym for " experimental electromechanical module " - and an allusion to moses , who parted the red sea - is intended to protect the city from exceptional high water events .
work has been underway on the project since 2003 and engineers recently estimated that it still wo n't be completed for a number of years to come .
mose provides for 78 floodgates that will rise and block the three inlets connecting venice with the adriatic sea , when a tide of 110 centimetres or more is forecast .
when the alarm sounds , compressed air will fill the gates and empty them of water .
they 'll rotate around their hinges , emerge from the depths and cut off the lagoon from the sea , stopping the tidal flow .
at the lido inlet , the widest of venice 's three entrances to the sea , workers are building the concrete " caissons " or containers that will house 20 of those floodgates , each larger than the wing of a 747 .
but it will be four more years before mose is able to protect venice – two years longer than originally expected , and venetians have been waiting for decades before that .

fears have been raised that the sludge could pollute the nearby danube , an important european waterway . hungary declared a state of emergency on tuesday after a toxic sludge spill swamped seven villages in what officials called the worst chemical accident in the country 's history . up to 40 square kilometers -lrb- 15.5 square miles -rrb- of land have been affected , giving rise to fears that the sludge could eventually pollute the nearby danube river , which courses through three european capitals before flowing into the black sea .

" the two-meter -lrb- 6.6-foot -rrb- tide of red toxic sludge killed four people and injured 120 others on tuesday .
eight of the injured are in serious condition and six people remain missing .
officials said on wednesday that the death toll could rise . the european union would be willing to help hungarian authorities should they need assistance in cleaning up the toxic chemical spill , eu spokesman joe hennon said wednesday . further down the danube in romania , the country 's environment ministry said it was monitoring water quality round-the-clock and stressed that the level of pollutants had not crossed the acceptable limits .

fears have been raised that the sludge could pollute the nearby danube , an important european waterway . hungary declared a state of emergency on tuesday after a toxic sludge spill swamped seven villages in what officials called the worst chemical accident in the country 's history . up to 40 square kilometers -lrb- 15.5 square miles -rrb- of land have been affected , giving rise to fears that the sludge could eventually pollute the nearby danube river , which courses through three european capitals before flowing into the black sea . " the sludge could reach the -lsb- danube -rsb- in four or five days , " said the deputy chief of the water management company for western hungary , sandor toth , adding that " from the point of view of water management , it 's a catastrophe . " the two-meter -lrb- 6.6-foot -rrb- tide of red toxic sludge killed four people and injured 120 others on tuesday .
eight of the injured are in serious condition and six people remain missing .
officials said on wednesday that the death toll could rise . the european union would be willing to help hungarian authorities should they need assistance in cleaning up the toxic chemical spill , eu spokesman joe hennon said wednesday . further down the danube in romania , the country 's environment ministry said it was monitoring water quality round-the-clock and stressed that the level of pollutants had not crossed the acceptable limits .

the plant produces alumina , which is used in the smelting of aluminum . the red mud is a toxic residue left over from the plant 's aluminum production .
it is slightly radioactive , highly corrosive and contains toxic heavy metals such as lead , cadmium , arsenic and chromium .
it destroyed all vegetation other than trees and seeped into hundreds of houses in seven villages , leaving residents unsure of when they would be able to return to their homes . " this is an unprecedented incident that affects deeply the ecosystem , wetlands and surface water bodies of the region as well as pointing out the fragility of our drinking water reserves , " gabor figeczky , the deputy country officer of the environmental group wwf hungary , said in a statement . environment state secretary illes said there was suspicion that hungarian aluminum production and trade company -lrb- mal -rrb- , which owns the ajka reservoir , had stored more red sludge in the reservoir than was allowed , and that its walls had displayed stress fractures prior to the spill . mal chief zoltan bakonyi insisted , however , that the company had done nothing wrong , saying the company would suspend all production for the time being . prime minister viktor orban , in a message to the hungarian people on tuesday , sent condolences to the victims ' families and promised a thorough investigation to determine " who is responsible for this man-made catastrophe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 06.10.2010 israel does n't need reconciliation with wagner , says holocaust survivor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noah klieger survived several concentration camps during the holocaust richard wagner 's music has been boycotted in israel in light of the nazi pogroms of 1938 .
holocaust survivor and israeli journalist noah klieger explains why the ban is justified and does n't hinder reconciliation . the israel chamber orchestra has agreed to perform a work by anti-semitic composer richard wagner -lrb- 1813-1883 -rrb- at next year 's bayreuth festival , although an unofficial boycott of the composer 's music has been observed in israel for over 70 years .
prominent israeli journalist and holocaust survivor noah klieger -lrb- born in 1926 in strasbourg -rrb- explains how the unspoken wagner ban came about in israel and why he is opposed to an israeli orchestra performing wagner 's music . deutsche welle : why are you opposed to the israel chamber orchestra playing wagner at the bayreuth festival ? noah klieger : i 'm against it because i 'm against playing wagner in israel .
wagner was the father of the theory of the races ; he was the first one to claim that there was a master race - the germans - and a low-class race - the jews .
he was the first to explain this in writing .
in 1938 , the symphony orchestra of eretz israel , which later became the israeli philharmonic orchestra , was about to perform wagner in a concert in tel aviv directed by -lsb- arturo -rsb- toscanini .
bronislaw huberman , the man who founded it , decided that the orchestra could not play wagner .
november 8-9 , 1938 was the so-called night of broken glass where the synagogues were destroyed and burned all over germany and austria , thousands of shops were looted and destroyed , hundreds of jews were murdered and tens of thousands of jews were sent to concentration camps .
huberman then realized that -lsb- wagner 's -rsb- theory had been realized by the germans at that time .
so he decided not to play wagner .
then he decided , together with the bosses of the jewish community in palestine - there was no israeli government at that time - to boycott wagner .
this happened before the shoah .
so , of course it was taken over later , because during the shoah it became clear that hitler was a great admirer of wagner .
not only did he adopt his theories , but he adopted his music as well .
the boycott has never been lifted .
it 's true that sometimes directors have tried to perform wagner in israel .
a man who decided to do it was daniel barenboim who , in a concert with a german orchestra , performed wagner , claiming that it was done spontaneously .
but it 's not true - you can not perform spontaneously with an orchestra .
you would say , then , that if the holocaust had not happened , israel would still have a boycott against wagner ? yes , i think so , because the pogroms happened .
it was not decided after the holocaust , it was decided after the pogroms in 1938 . by the way , there is no official ban .
it 's a sentimental ban .
as long as some of us are still alive , people should refrain from imposing wagner on us .
but we 're the not only ones ; there are many , many israelis who were born after the holocaust who are also against wagner for the same reason . how does this younger generation view wagner ? i do n't even know whether the younger generation is very familiar with wagner .

i have no problem whatsoever , because they 're not the same germans .

holocaust survivor and israeli journalist noah klieger explains why the ban is justified and does n't hinder reconciliation . the israel chamber orchestra has agreed to perform a work by anti-semitic composer richard wagner -lrb- 1813-1883 -rrb- at next year 's bayreuth festival , although an unofficial boycott of the composer 's music has been observed in israel for over 70 years .
prominent israeli journalist and holocaust survivor noah klieger -lrb- born in 1926 in strasbourg -rrb- explains how the unspoken wagner ban came about in israel and why he is opposed to an israeli orchestra performing wagner 's music . deutsche welle : why are you opposed to the israel chamber orchestra playing wagner at the bayreuth festival ? noah klieger : i 'm against it because i 'm against playing wagner in israel .
wagner was the father of the theory of the races ; he was the first one to claim that there was a master race - the germans - and a low-class race - the jews .
he was the first to explain this in writing .
in 1938 , the symphony orchestra of eretz israel , which later became the israeli philharmonic orchestra , was about to perform wagner in a concert in tel aviv directed by -lsb- arturo -rsb- toscanini .
bronislaw huberman , the man who founded it , decided that the orchestra could not play wagner .
november 8-9 , 1938 was the so-called night of broken glass where the synagogues were destroyed and burned all over germany and austria , thousands of shops were looted and destroyed , hundreds of jews were murdered and tens of thousands of jews were sent to concentration camps .
huberman then realized that -lsb- wagner 's -rsb- theory had been realized by the germans at that time .
so he decided not to play wagner .
then he decided , together with the bosses of the jewish community in palestine - there was no israeli government at that time - to boycott wagner .
this happened before the shoah .
so , of course it was taken over later , because during the shoah it became clear that hitler was a great admirer of wagner .
not only did he adopt his theories , but he adopted his music as well .
the boycott has never been lifted .
it 's true that sometimes directors have tried to perform wagner in israel .
a man who decided to do it was daniel barenboim who , in a concert with a german orchestra , performed wagner , claiming that it was done spontaneously .
but it 's not true - you can not perform spontaneously with an orchestra .
you would say , then , that if the holocaust had not happened , israel would still have a boycott against wagner ? yes , i think so , because the pogroms happened .
it was not decided after the holocaust , it was decided after the pogroms in 1938 . by the way , there is no official ban .
it 's a sentimental ban .
as long as some of us are still alive , people should refrain from imposing wagner on us .
but we 're the not only ones ; there are many , many israelis who were born after the holocaust who are also against wagner for the same reason . how does this younger generation view wagner ? i do n't even know whether the younger generation is very familiar with wagner .
i do n't think that many young people are fond of wagner .
i 'm convinced they 're not . do you think that the israeli orchestra playing in bayreuth could serve as an act of reconciliation ? we do n't need reconciliation with wagner .
we have reconciliation with germany .
we have nothing against the new german generations .
i go to germany very often ; i lecture in germany .
i lecture on the shoah , but this is a different story .
i have no problem whatsoever , because they 're not the same germans .
but wagner is the same wagner - whether it 's today or 100 years ago , it 's the same wagner with the same theory . does the ban apply to any other composers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 night of broken glass was evidence that the nazis 's anti-semitism had turned violent no .
richard strauss was at least as strong an anti-semite as wagner was , but we play strauss . why ? because he is not the father of this -lsb- racial -rsb- theory .
if we banned all anti-semites , we would n't have a lot of writers , poets and composers because most of them were anti-jewish .
i can give you a list of about a hundred .
but we have their books , we read their books , we study their books , we even teach from their books .
the same thing goes for music , but wagner is a different story . have you had the personal experience of listening to wagner 's music ? i know wagner 's music , but i really do n't like this music .
it 's too bombastic for me .
it 's only a joke of course -lsb- laughing -rsb- but it 's music where you can not even sleep in the opera because it 's much too loud . i personally do n't like his music , but i know that he 's a genius without any doubt .
he was one of the greatest composers ever , but this has nothing to do with his theories . interview : kate bowen / ma 'ayan yahbes editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , one venezuelan pianist who excels at playing off the cuff is an exception to the rule . gabriela montero -lrb- 1970- -rrb- improvisation on the song " guantanamera " gabriela montero -lrb- piano -rrb- mp3 recorded at the petersberg near bonn on september 25 , 2010 by deutsche welle -lrb- dw -rrb- improvisation has been called the well-spring of all music .
in the baroque and classical periods , it was standard practice .
the improvisational abilities of composers like bach , handel and mozart were legendary .
beethoven also showed a prodigious improvisational talent at the piano .
many of his piano sonatas , although precisely crafted compositions , reflect the freewheeling spirit of improvisational fantasy with their tempestuous runs and cascading successions of chords . today , the art of improvisation is widespread in jazz but rare within the realm of " classical " or " serious " music - with one exception being church organists who may improvise preludes or accompaniments to hymn tunes .
however , a talent of the caliber of venezuelan pianist gabriela montero is extremely rare .
montero , who says that she began improvising at age five , has been asked repeatedly " how she does it , " for which she has no answer . to demonstrate her gift for spur-of-the-moment invention , montero often begins a recital playing works from the repertory , but in the second half , improvises elaborate pieces based on melodies suggested by audience members .
the styles and rhythms can vary from romantic to rumba and from the toccata to the tango . we 've chosen a brief excerpt from her all-improvised recital at the petersberg hotel near bonn .
she begins by plucking out the melody of the song " guantanamera " and then builds an elaborate and cleverly crafted musical edifice from the song 's motifs .
experiencing gabriela montero live in concert reminds one of the fact that without improvisation , there would be no music . author : rick fulker editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chinese premier wen jiabao was in berlin after an eu-asia summit produced mixed results . germany has agreed to forge closer economic ties with china and press beijing 's case to be recognized as a market economy by the european union .
chancellor angela merkel met chinese premier wen jiabao at the meseberg palace near berlin following an eu-asia summit in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and wen met to build on discussions in brussels a joint statement issued by the german and chinese delegations after the meeting said that both leaders supported " strengthening european-chinese economic relations and want to encourage them through consultation and building up cooperation . "
it said there was a need for china and the eu to strengthen mutual political confidence and deepen strategic co-operation . "
the statement said that germany would work to get the european union to recognize china as a market economy by 2016 , giving the country certain benefits under international trade rules .
leaders at the summit in brussels had earlier reached broad agreement on reforms to help stabilize the international economy .
however , efforts to gain concessions from china to allow a more rapid appreciation in the value of the yuan appear to have failed .
changes in global economy the biennial asia europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- brought together 27 eu and 19 asian leaders , with agreement that reforms were needed to keep pace with changes in the world economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 is to discuss issues such as financial regulation " the priority is now to reach agreement on a system of global financial , monetary and economic governance : we have to act together very closely on this , " said summit chairman and president of the european council herman van rompuy .
leaders from the nations represented , 12 of which are members of the g20 group of leading economies , agreed that the next g20 summit in the south korean capital , seoul , next month should address a range of issues .
issues up for discussion at that summit include ensuring better government spending control and tighter regulation of the financial industry .
states also moved closer to a firm deal on the redistribution of voting rights within international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , for which european states retain disproportionate power compared with asian states .
a broad agreement on the need for reform was reached , although disagreements remained on the precise details .
no movement on chinese currency european nations also pressed - without success - for a china to allow its currency , the yuan , to increase in value , amid charges that beijing is deliberately devaluing its money to aid its export industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western countries say the yuan is being kept artificially low the chairman of eurozone finance ministers , jean-claude juncker said euro nations had urged an " orderly , significant and broad-based appreciation " of the yuan .
when asked about the chinese response , juncker said .
" the chinese authorities do not share our view . "
leaders also pledged to seek an urgent , legally-binding deal on global warming at united nations climate talks in cancun , mexico , beginning next month .
the german and chinese negotiations also touched on climate change , with both countries saying that they hoped progress would be made at the talks .
recognition of china as a market economy would make it less vulnerable to charges that it is dumping products onto global markets against world trade organization rules .

chancellor angela merkel met chinese premier wen jiabao at the meseberg palace near berlin following an eu-asia summit in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and wen met to build on discussions in brussels a joint statement issued by the german and chinese delegations after the meeting said that both leaders supported " strengthening european-chinese economic relations and want to encourage them through consultation and building up cooperation . "
it said there was a need for china and the eu to strengthen mutual political confidence and deepen strategic co-operation . "
the statement said that germany would work to get the european union to recognize china as a market economy by 2016 , giving the country certain benefits under international trade rules .

five were apparently german citizens .
in the past five weeks alone , the cia has launched 23 remote attacks in pakistan . just one click of the mouse at cia headquarters in the us state of virginia is all that is needed to crush a suspected al qaeda cell thousands of miles away in the border region between pakistan and afghanistan .
and to kill dozens of people in one strike . the unmanned aerial vehicles , which are equipped with high-resolution infrared cameras and hellfire rockets , have become us president barack obama ’ s weapon of choice in the so-called war on terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drone attacks on the border region between pakistan and afghanistan are launched from thousands of miles away however , critics argue that the drones are used to carry out extrajudicial executions . pentagon press secretary geoff morell dismisses such criticism : " oh come on you know the climate there as well as i do .
there are terrorists who exist and i would point out that it is in the pakistanis ’ interest to do this . " he argues that not only are the populations of the united states and europe at risk of terrorism but the government in islamabad too .
the pentagon and the cia , which functions almost like a secret paramilitary subcontractor , consider these drone attacks as obama ’ s most precise weapon in the fight against terror . hailed as great political achievement by some a year ago , the head of the pakistani taliban , baitullah mehsud , was killed in a missile attack launched by a predator drone . obama 's legal adviser harold koh agrees .
he does not think the drones are instruments of extrajudicial state murder but says that " a state that is engaged in armed conflict may use lethal force . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of drones has been stepped up under us president barack obama 's watch conservative media organizations in the us see the attacks as obama ’ s greatest political achievement so far .
" the obama administration deserves tremendous credit , " says bret stephens from the wall street journal , who thinks that top terrorists are now struggling to survive because of the steady rain of attacks . " human capital is your greatest resource , " he says , arguing that terrorist networks are losing good people fast . collateral damage seen as a necessary evil the fact that up to 321 civilians were killed in the 16 drone attacks launched against baitullah mehsud is seen as necessary collateral damage by the current administration . the cia is set to continue deciding which suspected terrorists are put on the list for the next killer drone attack . human rights activist cathy kelly , who organized the only demonstration that has taken place in the us against obama ’ s drone war , is outraged and says that " the united states is moving into robotic warfare at an alarming rate . " she deplores the fact that nobody is being held to account because the cia is running the show . author : ralph sina / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's set to start the ball rolling for similar agreements with other asian countries . the european union and south korea signed a record free-trade agreement in brussels on wednesday .
it 's expected to cut around 3 billion euros ' -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- worth of tariffs and lift administrative barriers and regulations on goods ranging from cars to whisky .
" this agreement is by far the most important trade deal ever concluded be the european union with one country and the first free trade deal with an asian country , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso .
the accord is set to take effect on july 1 , 2011 , once ratified by the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's luxury car industry may cash in on the deal the deal could double trade between europe and south korea by boosting business by 30 billion euros a year .
" the pact sends a strong signal that trade liberalization is a key element for recovery of the world economy , " said eu president herman van rompuy .
the eu runs a deficit with south korea in goods trade , although trends suggest the korean market offers significant growth potential for european firms .
expanding trade with asia the eu hopes that trade liberalization will broaden its influence in asia .
lifting customs duties on imported goods will make imported south korean products cheaper in the eu and eu goods cheaper in south korea .
europe 's spirits industry welcomed the deal for its potential in boosting sales of eu-produced drinks such as scotch whisky and french cognac .
the german luxury car and meat industries also hope to benefit from this arrangement .
italy was initially hesitant about the deal , fearing its national carmaker , fiat , could be outdone by south korea 's kia und hyundai car manufacturers .
but the country dropped its veto in return for delaying the treaty 's implementation until july 1 .
tariffs on some goods , such as small cars , will continue for up to five years thereafter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rompuy : free trade will help economic recovery the eu deal with south korea could trigger a rush among asian states to enter trade pacts with the 27-nation bloc . japan is keen to have better access to european markets .
on tuesday , japanese officials said that they hoped to start free-trade talks with the eu in the spring , partly in reaction to the korean agreement .
as japan and korea are competitors in several industries , japanese manufacturers stand to lose market share in europe 's automotive and electronics markets .
malaysian diplomats said that they , too , had agreed to open free-trade negotiations with the eu .

however , one venezuelan pianist who excels at playing off the cuff is an exception to the rule . gabriela montero -lrb- 1970- -rrb- improvisation on the song " guantanamera " gabriela montero -lrb- piano -rrb- mp3 recorded at the petersberg near bonn on september 25 , 2010 by deutsche welle -lrb- dw -rrb- improvisation has been called the well-spring of all music .
in the baroque and classical periods , it was standard practice .
the improvisational abilities of composers like bach , handel and mozart were legendary .
beethoven also showed a prodigious improvisational talent at the piano .
many of his piano sonatas , although precisely crafted compositions , reflect the freewheeling spirit of improvisational fantasy with their tempestuous runs and cascading successions of chords . today , the art of improvisation is widespread in jazz but rare within the realm of " classical " or " serious " music - with one exception being church organists who may improvise preludes or accompaniments to hymn tunes .
however , a talent of the caliber of venezuelan pianist gabriela montero is extremely rare .
montero , who says that she began improvising at age five , has been asked repeatedly " how she does it , " for which she has no answer . to demonstrate her gift for spur-of-the-moment invention , montero often begins a recital playing works from the repertory , but in the second half , improvises elaborate pieces based on melodies suggested by audience members .
the styles and rhythms can vary from romantic to rumba and from the toccata to the tango . we 've chosen a brief excerpt from her all-improvised recital at the petersberg hotel near bonn .
she begins by plucking out the melody of the song " guantanamera " and then builds an elaborate and cleverly crafted musical edifice from the song 's motifs .
experiencing gabriela montero live in concert reminds one of the fact that without improvisation , there would be no music . author : rick fulker editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ít is expected to take effect as of july 1 , 2011 , after ratification by the parliaments .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of drones has been stepped up under us president barack obama 's watch conservative media organizations in the us see the attacks as obama ’ s greatest political achievement so far .
" the obama administration deserves tremendous credit , " says bret stephens from the wall street journal , who thinks that top terrorists are now struggling to survive because of the steady rain of attacks . " human capital is your greatest resource , " he says , arguing that terrorist networks are losing good people fast . collateral damage seen as a necessary evil the fact that up to 321 civilians were killed in the 16 drone attacks launched against baitullah mehsud is seen as necessary collateral damage by the current administration . the cia is set to continue deciding which suspected terrorists are put on the list for the next killer drone attack . human rights activist cathy kelly , who organized the only demonstration that has taken place in the us against obama ’ s drone war , is outraged and says that " the united states is moving into robotic warfare at an alarming rate . " she deplores the fact that nobody is being held to account because the cia is running the show . author : ralph sina / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 06.10.2010 frankfurt book fair merges literature and technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina is this year 's guest of honor at the fair the frankfurt book fair is the biggest book show in the world , drawing hundreds of thousands of visitors .
this year , bookworms can sample from tons of digital literature content and media . star authors like american jonathan franzen and briton ken follett , and not one , but two german nobel prize winners - guenter grass and herta mueller - are expected to attend this year 's frankfurt book fair , which runs from october 6-10 .
those names may be the literature fair 's trump card , but organizers say they also hope to showcase new concepts for the future of publishing .
" the biggest trend is that various media are merging , " said frankfurt book fair 's director , juergen boos .
" when people sit at their computers , they often have news pages open , as well as their e-mail and other programs .
that shows how dynamic things are . "
the worlds of film and publishing are coming closer together , he added .
" people load all their preferred media onto one device , or have several different devices that they jump back and forth from . "
bridging lit and tech in a program called " frankfurt sparks , " the fair is to showcase new technologies which demand fresh content .
with reading devices , apps , and internet platforms beginning to edge out or at least alter traditional printed books , the program 's intention in focusing on that trend is to spark debate .
" frankfurt storydrive " is a cross-media conference accompanying the fair , where publishers , technology and software developers , game representatives and media users can brainstorm about developing " worlds " for good stories and continue the debate about literature trends .
" device providers need content to arouse consumer interest in their devices , " said bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , a cooperation partner at the conference .
" the frankfurt book fair provides that content , so it is a typical win-win situation for both the fair and the technology sector , " he said .
bildunterschrift : not everything has gone digital growth in digital area rohleder anticipates growth of 20 percent in the next decade for the sector that merges literature and technology .
a new german reading device is slotted for debut at the fair , for instance , since internet book giant amazon has been hesitant to issue its kindle on the german market due to unclarified copyright issues .
another continued challenge for publishers is that many internet users do not want to pay for digital content , boos said , but it 's also a trend that offers potential for new developments .
" when ' avatar ' - the hugely successful movie - was created , the book , computer game and music were developed and marketed all at the same time , " boos stressed .
" that was a first , and it shows that people are thinking differently . "
good news and bad boos aims to tap into this cross-media market , but has a few hurdles to leap at this year 's fair .
bucking past years ' trends of record participation , this year sees a five percent drop in exhibitors , bringing the number to around 6,900 .
there are also 100,000 fewer new publications .
but there is some good news , too .
with argentinia as the focus this year , 216 new translations are coming out of the country .
the children 's literature market is likewise buzzing , and the education sector can boast 11 percent more exhibitors this year .
the book fair is advancing its campaign for literacy and human rights , while the literary agents center is bursting at the seams .

this year , bookworms can sample from tons of digital literature content and media . star authors like american jonathan franzen and briton ken follett , and not one , but two german nobel prize winners - guenter grass and herta mueller - are expected to attend this year 's frankfurt book fair , which runs from october 6-10 .
those names may be the literature fair 's trump card , but organizers say they also hope to showcase new concepts for the future of publishing .
" the biggest trend is that various media are merging , " said frankfurt book fair 's director , juergen boos .
" when people sit at their computers , they often have news pages open , as well as their e-mail and other programs .
that shows how dynamic things are . "
the worlds of film and publishing are coming closer together , he added .
" people load all their preferred media onto one device , or have several different devices that they jump back and forth from . "
bridging lit and tech in a program called " frankfurt sparks , " the fair is to showcase new technologies which demand fresh content .
with reading devices , apps , and internet platforms beginning to edge out or at least alter traditional printed books , the program 's intention in focusing on that trend is to spark debate .
" frankfurt storydrive " is a cross-media conference accompanying the fair , where publishers , technology and software developers , game representatives and media users can brainstorm about developing " worlds " for good stories and continue the debate about literature trends .
" device providers need content to arouse consumer interest in their devices , " said bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , a cooperation partner at the conference .
" the frankfurt book fair provides that content , so it is a typical win-win situation for both the fair and the technology sector , " he said .
bildunterschrift : not everything has gone digital growth in digital area rohleder anticipates growth of 20 percent in the next decade for the sector that merges literature and technology .
a new german reading device is slotted for debut at the fair , for instance , since internet book giant amazon has been hesitant to issue its kindle on the german market due to unclarified copyright issues .
another continued challenge for publishers is that many internet users do not want to pay for digital content , boos said , but it 's also a trend that offers potential for new developments .
" when ' avatar ' - the hugely successful movie - was created , the book , computer game and music were developed and marketed all at the same time , " boos stressed .
" that was a first , and it shows that people are thinking differently . "
good news and bad boos aims to tap into this cross-media market , but has a few hurdles to leap at this year 's fair .
bucking past years ' trends of record participation , this year sees a five percent drop in exhibitors , bringing the number to around 6,900 .
there are also 100,000 fewer new publications .
but there is some good news , too .
with argentinia as the focus this year , 216 new translations are coming out of the country .
the children 's literature market is likewise buzzing , and the education sector can boast 11 percent more exhibitors this year .
the book fair is advancing its campaign for literacy and human rights , while the literary agents center is bursting at the seams .
" that is the most significant record we can report - that the licensing sector is been growing steadily , with more agents than in previous years so that they do n't all fit into the hall intended for them .

" anton bruckner -lrb- 1824-1896 -rrb- symphony no. 7 in e major , 2nd movement : adagio sehr feierlich und sehr langsam bavarian state orchestra conductor : kent nagano mp3 recorded in the beethoven hall , bonn on september 12 , 2010 by west german radio , cologne -lrb- wdr -rrb- it was n't until the premiere of his seventh symphony that bruckner achieved wide-reaching recognition .
the first performances in 1884 and 1885 were the breakthrough for the composer , who was painfully shy and often suffered from a lack of self-esteem . we 've chosen the adagio movement for you .
connections to a composer 's biography are relatively rare in symphonies , but this one is an exception : after bruckner heard of the death of richard wagner in early 1883 , he set the conclusion of the adagio as a funeral ode for wagner , whom he called his personal " master of all masters . " at this concert in the beethoven hall , american conductor kent nagano was honored with the wilhelm furtwaengler prize .
furtwaengler is considered one of the 20th century 's foremost conductors .
since 2008 , the prize has been awarded at the beethovenfest .
with this , writes ermano sens-grosholz , patron of the award , nagano is recognized as an " exemplary artist with standard-setting musical achievements and for his engagement for social causes and projects , in particular with regard to the education of musical youth .

another continued challenge for publishers is that many internet users do not want to pay for digital content , boos said , but it 's also a trend that offers potential for new developments .
" when ' avatar ' - the hugely successful movie - was created , the book , computer game and music were developed and marketed all at the same time , " boos stressed .
" that was a first , and it shows that people are thinking differently . "
good news and bad boos aims to tap into this cross-media market , but has a few hurdles to leap at this year 's fair .
bucking past years ' trends of record participation , this year sees a five percent drop in exhibitors , bringing the number to around 6,900 .
there are also 100,000 fewer new publications .
but there is some good news , too .
with argentinia as the focus this year , 216 new translations are coming out of the country .
the children 's literature market is likewise buzzing , and the education sector can boast 11 percent more exhibitors this year .
the book fair is advancing its campaign for literacy and human rights , while the literary agents center is bursting at the seams .
" that is the most significant record we can report - that the licensing sector is been growing steadily , with more agents than in previous years so that they do n't all fit into the hall intended for them .
that 's the growth to be proud of at this year 's fair and is its backbone , " boos said .

this year , bookworms can sample from tons of digital literature content and media . star authors like american jonathan franzen and briton ken follett , and not one , but two german nobel prize winners - guenter grass and herta mueller - are expected to attend this year 's frankfurt book fair , which runs from october 6-10 .
those names may be the literature fair 's trump card , but organizers say they also hope to showcase new concepts for the future of publishing .
" the biggest trend is that various media are merging , " said frankfurt book fair 's director , juergen boos .
" when people sit at their computers , they often have news pages open , as well as their e-mail and other programs .
that shows how dynamic things are . "
the worlds of film and publishing are coming closer together , he added .
" people load all their preferred media onto one device , or have several different devices that they jump back and forth from . "
bridging lit and tech in a program called " frankfurt sparks , " the fair is to showcase new technologies which demand fresh content .
with reading devices , apps , and internet platforms beginning to edge out or at least alter traditional printed books , the program 's intention in focusing on that trend is to spark debate .
" frankfurt storydrive " is a cross-media conference accompanying the fair , where publishers , technology and software developers , game representatives and media users can brainstorm about developing " worlds " for good stories and continue the debate about literature trends .
" device providers need content to arouse consumer interest in their devices , " said bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , a cooperation partner at the conference .
" the frankfurt book fair provides that content , so it is a typical win-win situation for both the fair and the technology sector , " he said .

they help them find jobs , schools and kindergartens . cristina nastase stands in the dirty courtyard of a run-down grey tenement building in berlin 's tiergarten district at eight o 'clock in the morning , softly calling out two names under an open window .
curtains and clothing hung out to dry on clotheslines flap in the breeze .
many of the tenants here are roma from romania who entered germany with a tourist visa and would like to stay .
cristina nastase , 32 , is also romanian , an education welfare officer who helps roma and migrant workers .
angela and her two-year-old son , david , appear at the door , cristina greets them , and they all walk to the boy 's new kindergarten .
it 's a completely new experience for mother and son .
only the other day , they were out on the streets begging , like many of the roma here .

once they get to the kindergarten , david immediately runs off to play with the other children .
moved to tears , cristina watches him .
" in the streets , i often encounter families with children , " she says .

cultural mediators many roma are illiterate and speak little german .
they are not in a position to fill in school applications , proper rental contracts or health insurance forms - things they need to be able to stay in germany , even as eu citizens .

but outreach workers may be able to help .
cristina nastase and one other co-worker were sent by the berlin-based organization " southeast europe culture " to do community outreach .
funding comes from local government .
kindergarten teacher barbara thorm accepted david under the condition that cristina accompanied mother and son during the first week , helping with translations and explaining , for instance , the importance of punctuality .

cristina asks a roma woman carrying a small child whether she needs help .
in next to no time , the outreach worker is surrounded by roma women .
" they are very open , " cristina says .
" you only need to show an interest in their concerns . "
today the women clamor to have their pictures taken so they can send them home to romania .
for the next 15 minutes or so , they have fun taking photos - a regular part of cristina 's job .
but the regular requests for money , a job or an apartment are not as easy for cristina to fulfill - for lack of funds and time .
the project is scheduled to end in december , but she is hopeful that berlin 's roma outreach project will be extended .

it came at a time when europe , too , was undergoing political change . ludwig van beethoven -lrb- 1770-1827 -rrb- symphony no. 3 in e-flat major , op .
55 -lrb- eroica -rrb- bamberg symphony orchestra conductor : jonathan nott mp3 recorded by deutschlandfunk on october 3 , 2010 in the beethoven hall , bonn . when napoleon bonaparte crowned himself emperor in paris ' notre dame cathedral in late 1804 , beethoven was in the process of composing his third symphony , in e-flat major .
the composer had been a supporter of napoleon and planned to dedicate the massive orchestral work to him .
but , as the story goes , when beethoven heard the news of the self-coronation , he was furious and scratched out the dedication . though the composer 's admiration for napoleon never completely dwindled , his great e-flat symphony was published with the title it is known under today : " sinfonia eroica - composed to celebrate the memory of a great man . " the symphony superseded all of beethoven 's previous orchestral works in length , complexity , form and virtuosity .
as with most ground-breaking works , the eroica symphony was initially pelted with criticism upon its premiere in vienna in 1805 . it is performed here by the bamberg symphony orchestra under the direction of their chief conductor , jonathan nott .
originally from the uk , nott has directed the bavarian orchestra since 2000 , bringing it to both national and international acclaim . author : kate bowen -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they help them find jobs , schools and kindergartens . cristina nastase stands in the dirty courtyard of a run-down grey tenement building in berlin 's tiergarten district at eight o 'clock in the morning , softly calling out two names under an open window .
curtains and clothing hung out to dry on clotheslines flap in the breeze .
many of the tenants here are roma from romania who entered germany with a tourist visa and would like to stay .
cristina nastase , 32 , is also romanian , an education welfare officer who helps roma and migrant workers .
angela and her two-year-old son , david , appear at the door , cristina greets them , and they all walk to the boy 's new kindergarten .
it 's a completely new experience for mother and son .
only the other day , they were out on the streets begging , like many of the roma here .
a chance for the children " attending kindergarten is important , " cristina says .
" it gives david a chance to have an untroubled childhood , and he can learn german . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cristina works on the streets of berlin , offering help cristina comforts the cranky child on the 20-minute walk to the kindergarten , she listens to angela 's problems and they discuss the cleaning job cristina has gotten her in her son 's kindergarten , which gives the single mother a chance to earn a little money and learn a bit german .
once they get to the kindergarten , david immediately runs off to play with the other children .
moved to tears , cristina watches him .
" in the streets , i often encounter families with children , " she says .
" it is really touching when a child gets the chance to enjoy his childhood . "
cultural mediators many roma are illiterate and speak little german .
they are not in a position to fill in school applications , proper rental contracts or health insurance forms - things they need to be able to stay in germany , even as eu citizens .
often , they end up on the streets , cleaning car windshields or begging for money .
but outreach workers may be able to help .
cristina nastase and one other co-worker were sent by the berlin-based organization " southeast europe culture " to do community outreach .
funding comes from local government .
kindergarten teacher barbara thorm accepted david under the condition that cristina accompanied mother and son during the first week , helping with translations and explaining , for instance , the importance of punctuality .
" things go wrong so often not because of the people involved but because there is no concept as to how to interact , " thorm says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : begging may be a thing of the past for some roma children in berlin photos to send home while david and his mother spend the day in the kindergarten , cristina 's next stop takes her to the city 's cathedral , a spot that not only draws many tourists , but beggars from romania as well .
cristina asks a roma woman carrying a small child whether she needs help .
in next to no time , the outreach worker is surrounded by roma women .
" they are very open , " cristina says .
" you only need to show an interest in their concerns . "
today the women clamor to have their pictures taken so they can send them home to romania .
for the next 15 minutes or so , they have fun taking photos - a regular part of cristina 's job .
but the regular requests for money , a job or an apartment are not as easy for cristina to fulfill - for lack of funds and time .
the project is scheduled to end in december , but she is hopeful that berlin 's roma outreach project will be extended .

they help them find jobs , schools and kindergartens . cristina nastase stands in the dirty courtyard of a run-down grey tenement building in berlin 's tiergarten district at eight o 'clock in the morning , softly calling out two names under an open window .
curtains and clothing hung out to dry on clotheslines flap in the breeze .
many of the tenants here are roma from romania who entered germany with a tourist visa and would like to stay .
cristina nastase , 32 , is also romanian , an education welfare officer who helps roma and migrant workers .
angela and her two-year-old son , david , appear at the door , cristina greets them , and they all walk to the boy 's new kindergarten .
it 's a completely new experience for mother and son .
only the other day , they were out on the streets begging , like many of the roma here .
a chance for the children " attending kindergarten is important , " cristina says .
" it gives david a chance to have an untroubled childhood , and he can learn german . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cristina works on the streets of berlin , offering help cristina comforts the cranky child on the 20-minute walk to the kindergarten , she listens to angela 's problems and they discuss the cleaning job cristina has gotten her in her son 's kindergarten , which gives the single mother a chance to earn a little money and learn a bit german .
once they get to the kindergarten , david immediately runs off to play with the other children .
moved to tears , cristina watches him .
" in the streets , i often encounter families with children , " she says .
" it is really touching when a child gets the chance to enjoy his childhood . "
cultural mediators many roma are illiterate and speak little german .
they are not in a position to fill in school applications , proper rental contracts or health insurance forms - things they need to be able to stay in germany , even as eu citizens .
often , they end up on the streets , cleaning car windshields or begging for money .
but outreach workers may be able to help .
cristina nastase and one other co-worker were sent by the berlin-based organization " southeast europe culture " to do community outreach .
funding comes from local government .
kindergarten teacher barbara thorm accepted david under the condition that cristina accompanied mother and son during the first week , helping with translations and explaining , for instance , the importance of punctuality .
" things go wrong so often not because of the people involved but because there is no concept as to how to interact , " thorm says .

cristina asks a roma woman carrying a small child whether she needs help .
in next to no time , the outreach worker is surrounded by roma women .
" they are very open , " cristina says .
" you only need to show an interest in their concerns . "
today the women clamor to have their pictures taken so they can send them home to romania .
for the next 15 minutes or so , they have fun taking photos - a regular part of cristina 's job .
but the regular requests for money , a job or an apartment are not as easy for cristina to fulfill - for lack of funds and time .
the project is scheduled to end in december , but she is hopeful that berlin 's roma outreach project will be extended .

they help them find jobs , schools and kindergartens . cristina nastase stands in the dirty courtyard of a run-down grey tenement building in berlin 's tiergarten district at eight o 'clock in the morning , softly calling out two names under an open window .
curtains and clothing hung out to dry on clotheslines flap in the breeze .
many of the tenants here are roma from romania who entered germany with a tourist visa and would like to stay .
cristina nastase , 32 , is also romanian , an education welfare officer who helps roma and migrant workers .
angela and her two-year-old son , david , appear at the door , cristina greets them , and they all walk to the boy 's new kindergarten .
it 's a completely new experience for mother and son .
only the other day , they were out on the streets begging , like many of the roma here .
a chance for the children " attending kindergarten is important , " cristina says .
" it gives david a chance to have an untroubled childhood , and he can learn german . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cristina works on the streets of berlin , offering help cristina comforts the cranky child on the 20-minute walk to the kindergarten , she listens to angela 's problems and they discuss the cleaning job cristina has gotten her in her son 's kindergarten , which gives the single mother a chance to earn a little money and learn a bit german .
once they get to the kindergarten , david immediately runs off to play with the other children .
moved to tears , cristina watches him .
" in the streets , i often encounter families with children , " she says .
" it is really touching when a child gets the chance to enjoy his childhood . "
cultural mediators many roma are illiterate and speak little german .
they are not in a position to fill in school applications , proper rental contracts or health insurance forms - things they need to be able to stay in germany , even as eu citizens .
often , they end up on the streets , cleaning car windshields or begging for money .
but outreach workers may be able to help .
cristina nastase and one other co-worker were sent by the berlin-based organization " southeast europe culture " to do community outreach .
funding comes from local government .
kindergarten teacher barbara thorm accepted david under the condition that cristina accompanied mother and son during the first week , helping with translations and explaining , for instance , the importance of punctuality .
" things go wrong so often not because of the people involved but because there is no concept as to how to interact , " thorm says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : begging may be a thing of the past for some roma children in berlin photos to send home while david and his mother spend the day in the kindergarten , cristina 's next stop takes her to the city 's cathedral , a spot that not only draws many tourists , but beggars from romania as well .
cristina asks a roma woman carrying a small child whether she needs help .
in next to no time , the outreach worker is surrounded by roma women .
" they are very open , " cristina says .
" you only need to show an interest in their concerns . "
today the women clamor to have their pictures taken so they can send them home to romania .
for the next 15 minutes or so , they have fun taking photos - a regular part of cristina 's job .
but the regular requests for money , a job or an apartment are not as easy for cristina to fulfill - for lack of funds and time .
the project is scheduled to end in december , but she is hopeful that berlin 's roma outreach project will be extended .

chinese premier wen jiabao was in berlin after an eu-asia summit produced mixed results . germany has agreed to forge closer economic ties with china and press beijing 's case to be recognized as a market economy by the european union .
chancellor angela merkel met chinese premier wen jiabao at the meseberg palace near berlin following an eu-asia summit in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and wen met to build on discussions in brussels a joint statement issued by the german and chinese delegations after the meeting said that both leaders supported " strengthening european-chinese economic relations and want to encourage them through consultation and building up cooperation . "
it said there was a need for china and the eu to strengthen mutual political confidence and deepen strategic co-operation . "
the statement said that germany would work to get the european union to recognize china as a market economy by 2016 , giving the country certain benefits under international trade rules .
leaders at the summit in brussels had earlier reached broad agreement on reforms to help stabilize the international economy .
however , efforts to gain concessions from china to allow a more rapid appreciation in the value of the yuan appear to have failed .
changes in global economy the biennial asia europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- brought together 27 eu and 19 asian leaders , with agreement that reforms were needed to keep pace with changes in the world economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 is to discuss issues such as financial regulation " the priority is now to reach agreement on a system of global financial , monetary and economic governance : we have to act together very closely on this , " said summit chairman and president of the european council herman van rompuy .
leaders from the nations represented , 12 of which are members of the g20 group of leading economies , agreed that the next g20 summit in the south korean capital , seoul , next month should address a range of issues .
issues up for discussion at that summit include ensuring better government spending control and tighter regulation of the financial industry .
states also moved closer to a firm deal on the redistribution of voting rights within international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , for which european states retain disproportionate power compared with asian states .

he called on supporters and opponents to continue a dialogue , hoping to avoid more violent protests . in an effort to bridge the communication gap between supporters and opponents of stuttgart 's train station renovation project , the premier of baden-wuerttemberg , stefan mappus , has announced that he is bringing in a mediator to help facilitate dialogue between the two sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geissler is known as a neutral mediator in a speech to the state assembly in stuttgart , mappus announced the appointment of heiner geissler as a mediator between the state and opponents of the controversial project , which is known as stuttgart 21 .
geissler is a former secretary general of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . " i am confident that there is a way to reconcile , " mappus said , " and this way leads through an unbiased moderator who will involve all sides without preconditions . " although the 80-year-old geissler is a member of mappus ' cdu , in previous roles as an arbitrator he has been known for reaching across party lines . renewed invitation in addition to naming geissler as arbitrator , mappus issued a call for further discussion about the project . " today , i renew today my invitation to discussions for all critics of the project , " mappus said .
" my appeal is this : let 's achieve a forum together where dialogue is possible and that the factual arguments become the guiding force of our discussion . " demonstrations last week against the stuttgart 21 project turned violent as police used water cannon , tear gas and pepper spray to disperse protesters .
two demonstrators who were hit in the face with the water cannons are still recovering and may have suffered permanent eye damage . on wednesday , mappus repeated a previous statement that scenes of violence must not be repeated . opponents gain ground mappus ' speech comes a day after the state government agreed to delay further demolition work on the project until after state elections in march 2011 .
the announcement appeared to be a major turn in the government 's response to opponents of the project , which has been planned for more than a decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say their reaction was measured however , mappus has said repeatedly that stopping the construction project - which has been already underway for six months - was not an option , as contracts have already been signed and legislation passed . meanwhile public opposition to the project has become more organized and vocal - largely in response to the use of force by police at last week 's demonstration .
state police chief wolf hammann said the officers ' response was in line with the actions taken by some protesters , which included spraying pepper spray and throwing chestnuts , plastic bottles and fireworks at the police .
in berlin , the federal government was set to discuss the protests and the police reaction on wednesday .
call for more transparency stuttgart 21 meant to make the city and the surrounding region part of a 1,500-kilometer -lrb- 932-mile -rrb- high-speed rail route across europe .
it also involves digging tunnels to create a new rail connection between stuttgart and the western city of ulm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tunnel project has been in the mix for years opponents say the money required for the project , an estimated seven billion euros -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- , would be better spent on updating the existing rail network .
the managers of the project , which include german rail company deutsche bahn , have been sharply criticized .

he called on supporters and opponents to continue a dialogue , hoping to avoid more violent protests . in an effort to bridge the communication gap between supporters and opponents of stuttgart 's train station renovation project , the premier of baden-wuerttemberg , stefan mappus , has announced that he is bringing in a mediator to help facilitate dialogue between the two sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geissler is known as a neutral mediator in a speech to the state assembly in stuttgart , mappus announced the appointment of heiner geissler as a mediator between the state and opponents of the controversial project , which is known as stuttgart 21 .
geissler is a former secretary general of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 06.10.2010 venice continues work on massive flood protection project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice scientists say high water events are increasing the mose flood gates aim to stave off potential disaster in the city and the larger venice lagoon when the adriatic sea surges .
local scientists say that such events are on the rise in recent years . last month , under the bright summer italian sun , tourists rolled up their trousers and waded through water in front of the centuries-old basilica on venice 's famous piazza san marco .
this was one of the most recent occurances of " acqua alta , " or " high water , " a term used in the veneto region for the exceptional tide peaks occurring in the adriatic sea , which reaching their maximum in the venetian lagoon , invade the foundations and inundate the older and lower parts of venice .
according to the technicians at the city 's tide monitoring and forecast center , these high water events are becoming more frequent and last a longer time .
" the worry is that the increase in the frequency of these high water events does n't show any sign of slowing down , " said paolo canestrelli , the center 's director said in a recent interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's increasing at an almost exponential rate . "
canestrelli cited various reasons for this , one of which he says is climate change .
he added that the fluctuating environment has caused rising sea levels and more frequent storm surges .
plus , he noted , the land the city sits on is also sinking - it 's estimated venice has sunk at least 23 centimeters -lrb- 9.05 inches -rrb- in the past century .
but whatever the reason , the data speaks for itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's tide monitoring and forecast center said that 2009 was a record year for high water a ' record ' year according to canestrelli , 2009 was a record flood year in venice - the worst in more than a century .
the tide reached 80 centimeters , flooding large parts of piazza san marco , more than 125 times .
it reached 110 centimeters , and so invaded large parts of city 16 times .
in the decades since venice began officially recording the " acqua alta " measurements in the early twentieth century , tides of greater than 110 centimeters occurred on an average three or four times a year .
this year , 2010 , canestrelli says , already promises to be worse .
" i think that this year we 'll reach a record higher than that of last year , " he warned in september .
" we 've already had 102 cases of water higher than 80 cm .
so already 102 times , piazza san marco has seen water and there 's still four months to go . "
a decades-old plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mose project encompasses 78 floodgates to block the inlets when the tide reaches over 110 centimeters that 's why now , more than ever , the city needs a huge barrier to protect itself .
the mose project , an italian acronym for " experimental electromechanical module " - and an allusion to moses , who parted the red sea - is intended to protect the city from exceptional high water events .
work has been underway on the project since 2003 and engineers recently estimated that it still wo n't be completed for a number of years to come .
mose provides for 78 floodgates that will rise and block the three inlets connecting venice with the adriatic sea , when a tide of 110 centimetres or more is forecast .
when the alarm sounds , compressed air will fill the gates and empty them of water .
they 'll rotate around their hinges , emerge from the depths and cut off the lagoon from the sea , stopping the tidal flow .
at the lido inlet , the widest of venice 's three entrances to the sea , workers are building the concrete " caissons " or containers that will house 20 of those floodgates , each larger than the wing of a 747 .
but it will be four more years before mose is able to protect venice – two years longer than originally expected , and venetians have been waiting for decades before that .
it was the great flood of 1966 , causing the lagoon to rise almost two meters above its normal levels , which focused attention on the danger to the city .
in 1987 , a consortium of italian companies , the consorzio venezia nuova , was entrusted with finding a solution .
but it was n't until 2003 that construction actually began . " two thirds of the work has been completed now and we 're waiting for remaining 25 percent of the money to do the remaining , " said giovanni cecconi , a consorzio hydrologist .
" from a technical point of view we are pretty much on schedule , and the only risk of delay can come from financing .
by the year 2014 , all the four barriers will start operation , if the money will come . " a multi-billion euro project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget of this massive construction project has ballooned to over 4.5 billion euros mose is the largest public works scheme in italian history , involving 3,000 workers spread over several sites .
its budget has blown out from three billion to more than four and half billion euros .
critics fear it could cost taxpayers close to double that in the end .
at the lido inlet construction site , cecconi is also keen to trumpet mose 's green credentials as the project has long been the target of conservationists .
they say the lagoon is one of the most important wetlands in western europe and the tidal exchange with the sea is essential to its well-being .
cecconi pointed out that the gates can be deployed just partially to minimise the effect on the environment .
" we leave the tidal flow in and out of the lagoon available all the time , but not during the storm surges , so -lrb- we 'll deploy them -rrb- just three to five times a year , for three to four hours , " he said . but cecconi 's comments do n't mollify guido ortalli of italia nostra , a group of citizens concerned to protect italy 's cultural heritage . he describes the project as " very heavy , very costly and technically complicated " and involving " really high maintenance costs . " whatever the objections , most people agree that something must be done , or one of civilization 's most beautiful locations may simply sink beneath the waves .
still , for many in venice , the work on defending the city ca n't finish soon enough .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's tide monitoring and forecast center said that 2009 was a record year for high water a ' record ' year according to canestrelli , 2009 was a record flood year in venice - the worst in more than a century .
the tide reached 80 centimeters , flooding large parts of piazza san marco , more than 125 times .
it reached 110 centimeters , and so invaded large parts of city 16 times .
in the decades since venice began officially recording the " acqua alta " measurements in the early twentieth century , tides of greater than 110 centimeters occurred on an average three or four times a year .
this year , 2010 , canestrelli says , already promises to be worse .
" i think that this year we 'll reach a record higher than that of last year , " he warned in september .
" we 've already had 102 cases of water higher than 80 cm .
so already 102 times , piazza san marco has seen water and there 's still four months to go . "
a decades-old plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mose project encompasses 78 floodgates to block the inlets when the tide reaches over 110 centimeters that 's why now , more than ever , the city needs a huge barrier to protect itself .
the mose project , an italian acronym for " experimental electromechanical module " - and an allusion to moses , who parted the red sea - is intended to protect the city from exceptional high water events .
work has been underway on the project since 2003 and engineers recently estimated that it still wo n't be completed for a number of years to come .
mose provides for 78 floodgates that will rise and block the three inlets connecting venice with the adriatic sea , when a tide of 110 centimetres or more is forecast .
when the alarm sounds , compressed air will fill the gates and empty them of water .
they 'll rotate around their hinges , emerge from the depths and cut off the lagoon from the sea , stopping the tidal flow .
at the lido inlet , the widest of venice 's three entrances to the sea , workers are building the concrete " caissons " or containers that will house 20 of those floodgates , each larger than the wing of a 747 .
but it will be four more years before mose is able to protect venice – two years longer than originally expected , and venetians have been waiting for decades before that .
it was the great flood of 1966 , causing the lagoon to rise almost two meters above its normal levels , which focused attention on the danger to the city .
in 1987 , a consortium of italian companies , the consorzio venezia nuova , was entrusted with finding a solution .
but it was n't until 2003 that construction actually began . " two thirds of the work has been completed now and we 're waiting for remaining 25 percent of the money to do the remaining , " said giovanni cecconi , a consorzio hydrologist .
" from a technical point of view we are pretty much on schedule , and the only risk of delay can come from financing .
by the year 2014 , all the four barriers will start operation , if the money will come . " a multi-billion euro project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget of this massive construction project has ballooned to over 4.5 billion euros mose is the largest public works scheme in italian history , involving 3,000 workers spread over several sites .
its budget has blown out from three billion to more than four and half billion euros .
critics fear it could cost taxpayers close to double that in the end .
at the lido inlet construction site , cecconi is also keen to trumpet mose 's green credentials as the project has long been the target of conservationists .
they say the lagoon is one of the most important wetlands in western europe and the tidal exchange with the sea is essential to its well-being .
cecconi pointed out that the gates can be deployed just partially to minimise the effect on the environment .
" we leave the tidal flow in and out of the lagoon available all the time , but not during the storm surges , so -lrb- we 'll deploy them -rrb- just three to five times a year , for three to four hours , " he said . but cecconi 's comments do n't mollify guido ortalli of italia nostra , a group of citizens concerned to protect italy 's cultural heritage . he describes the project as " very heavy , very costly and technically complicated " and involving " really high maintenance costs . " whatever the objections , most people agree that something must be done , or one of civilization 's most beautiful locations may simply sink beneath the waves .
still , for many in venice , the work on defending the city ca n't finish soon enough .

local scientists say that such events are on the rise in recent years . last month , under the bright summer italian sun , tourists rolled up their trousers and waded through water in front of the centuries-old basilica on venice 's famous piazza san marco .
this was one of the most recent occurances of " acqua alta , " or " high water , " a term used in the veneto region for the exceptional tide peaks occurring in the adriatic sea , which reaching their maximum in the venetian lagoon , invade the foundations and inundate the older and lower parts of venice .
according to the technicians at the city 's tide monitoring and forecast center , these high water events are becoming more frequent and last a longer time .
" the worry is that the increase in the frequency of these high water events does n't show any sign of slowing down , " said paolo canestrelli , the center 's director said in a recent interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's increasing at an almost exponential rate . "
canestrelli cited various reasons for this , one of which he says is climate change .
he added that the fluctuating environment has caused rising sea levels and more frequent storm surges .

it says quieter ways of conducting business at sea are already at hand . underwater noise is more than just pollution – it 's a killer .
this is the message the whale and dolphin conservation society hopes to spread with " sonar sucks , " a campaign launched in germany this week to raise awareness of the impact of underwater noise on sea mammals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sound travels more effectively under water than above the whale and dolphin conservation society -lrb- wdcs -rrb- has called for a range of noise-fighting measures to be implemented , including an international moratorium on low- and medium-frequency military sonar equipment , and on oil and gas development of the arctic region , saying underwater noise pollution created by those activities is putting entire aquatic populations at risk .
" it 's the old fashioned out of sight , out of mind – the way that we used to talk about chemical pollution is now the way that we start to look at noise pollution , " mark simmonds , the wdcs international director of science , told deutsche welle .
seeing by hearing whales , dolphins and porpoises rely on hearing for most of their basic needs : they use sonar to communicate , to orient themselves , to find food and mates .
man-made noise can drown out the sounds the mammals rely on day to day with consequences ranging from loss of habitat to death – and according to the wdcs , that noise is increasing .
" the equivalent would be losing your sight and going blind for us … and worse , in some of the noisier areas , " simmonds said .
noise disturbances can cause marine mammals to alter their behavior and abandon breeding and feeding areas , cause injury and lead to whales and dolphins beaching .
in a statement released by the german branch of the wdcs , the organization said that military sonar , marine construction and development , seismic exploration by the oil and gas industry , and the increasing number of ships in the world ’ s oceans are all helping to create an increasingly disorienting environment for the world ’ s cetaceans .
government inaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : offshore wind parks generate noise during their construction , not operation animal welfare groups say the effect of noise on marine mammals has been well documented but that governments have taken little heed .
" as far back as 2004 an historic european parliamentary resolution called on the eu member states to restrict the use of high-intensity sonar but sadly too little has been done , " international fund for animal welfare european union director lesley o 'donnell said .
" eu member states have a clear obligation to protect whales and their habitats from ocean noise which can disturb , injure and even kill whales and other marine species even after it has travelled tremendous distances . "
human activities like construction and oil drilling can create noise levels over 260 decibels – louder than a rocket taking off – and because noise travels differently underwater than through the air , the effects can be felt even hundreds of kilometers from the source .
" low-frequency active sonar from the military can range in distance from 1000 to 1500 kilometers -lsb- through water -rsb- , " wdcs germany conservation manager karsten brenning said .
" that would mean that if you would switch on -lrb- an equivalent above-water -rrb- device in moscow , it would be difficult to have a conversation on german streets . "
problem of wind parks the wdcs pointed to increasing arctic development and a growing amount of energy-related construction at sea as particular areas of concern .
seismic studies , in which sound waves are used to provide information on potential gas and oil deposits on the ocean floor , are being undertaken in designated whale sanctuaries , including the dogger bank and the moray firth in the north sea .
the latter may become home to a major wind farm if a recent proposal from consortium moray offshore renewables goes ahead .
" there 's a lot of development going on in the seas of europe that hasn ’ t been going on before , " simmonds said .
" as people who are essentially environmentalists at heart we like renewable energy … but it ’ s the way that these things are being constructed and fixed into the seabed , the hammering , the pile-driving , this is a very loud source of noise . "
technical solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly stealthy submarines prove ships can be made quieter , says the wdcs the wdcs said new technologies and alternative methods could make industry more environmentally friendly at sea .
simmonds pointed to the use of " bubble curtains " or " jackets " to disrupt the spread of noise that occurs when hammering pylons into place .
he also pointed to the great advances in submarine stealth technology that have been made , saying that these offered great cross-over potential for reducing the impact of ship 's engines .
in terms of noise generated by surveys for resources beneath the seabed , karsten brenning suggested more focus on " passive " seismic surveying , which is more like listening to the seabed than bouncing sound off it .
" there are technological mechanisms coming along but we need more investment and more focus on those , " simmonds said .

it says quieter ways of conducting business at sea are already at hand . underwater noise is more than just pollution – it 's a killer .
this is the message the whale and dolphin conservation society hopes to spread with " sonar sucks , " a campaign launched in germany this week to raise awareness of the impact of underwater noise on sea mammals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sound travels more effectively under water than above the whale and dolphin conservation society -lrb- wdcs -rrb- has called for a range of noise-fighting measures to be implemented , including an international moratorium on low- and medium-frequency military sonar equipment , and on oil and gas development of the arctic region , saying underwater noise pollution created by those activities is putting entire aquatic populations at risk .
" it 's the old fashioned out of sight , out of mind – the way that we used to talk about chemical pollution is now the way that we start to look at noise pollution , " mark simmonds , the wdcs international director of science , told deutsche welle .
seeing by hearing whales , dolphins and porpoises rely on hearing for most of their basic needs : they use sonar to communicate , to orient themselves , to find food and mates .
man-made noise can drown out the sounds the mammals rely on day to day with consequences ranging from loss of habitat to death – and according to the wdcs , that noise is increasing .
" the equivalent would be losing your sight and going blind for us … and worse , in some of the noisier areas , " simmonds said .
noise disturbances can cause marine mammals to alter their behavior and abandon breeding and feeding areas , cause injury and lead to whales and dolphins beaching .
in a statement released by the german branch of the wdcs , the organization said that military sonar , marine construction and development , seismic exploration by the oil and gas industry , and the increasing number of ships in the world ’ s oceans are all helping to create an increasingly disorienting environment for the world ’ s cetaceans .
government inaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : offshore wind parks generate noise during their construction , not operation animal welfare groups say the effect of noise on marine mammals has been well documented but that governments have taken little heed .
" as far back as 2004 an historic european parliamentary resolution called on the eu member states to restrict the use of high-intensity sonar but sadly too little has been done , " international fund for animal welfare european union director lesley o 'donnell said .
" eu member states have a clear obligation to protect whales and their habitats from ocean noise which can disturb , injure and even kill whales and other marine species even after it has travelled tremendous distances . "
human activities like construction and oil drilling can create noise levels over 260 decibels – louder than a rocket taking off – and because noise travels differently underwater than through the air , the effects can be felt even hundreds of kilometers from the source .
" low-frequency active sonar from the military can range in distance from 1000 to 1500 kilometers -lsb- through water -rsb- , " wdcs germany conservation manager karsten brenning said .
" that would mean that if you would switch on -lrb- an equivalent above-water -rrb- device in moscow , it would be difficult to have a conversation on german streets . "
problem of wind parks the wdcs pointed to increasing arctic development and a growing amount of energy-related construction at sea as particular areas of concern .
seismic studies , in which sound waves are used to provide information on potential gas and oil deposits on the ocean floor , are being undertaken in designated whale sanctuaries , including the dogger bank and the moray firth in the north sea .
the latter may become home to a major wind farm if a recent proposal from consortium moray offshore renewables goes ahead .
" there 's a lot of development going on in the seas of europe that hasn ’ t been going on before , " simmonds said .
" as people who are essentially environmentalists at heart we like renewable energy … but it ’ s the way that these things are being constructed and fixed into the seabed , the hammering , the pile-driving , this is a very loud source of noise . "
technical solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly stealthy submarines prove ships can be made quieter , says the wdcs the wdcs said new technologies and alternative methods could make industry more environmentally friendly at sea .
simmonds pointed to the use of " bubble curtains " or " jackets " to disrupt the spread of noise that occurs when hammering pylons into place .
he also pointed to the great advances in submarine stealth technology that have been made , saying that these offered great cross-over potential for reducing the impact of ship 's engines .
in terms of noise generated by surveys for resources beneath the seabed , karsten brenning suggested more focus on " passive " seismic surveying , which is more like listening to the seabed than bouncing sound off it .
" there are technological mechanisms coming along but we need more investment and more focus on those , " simmonds said .

this is the message the whale and dolphin conservation society hopes to spread with " sonar sucks , " a campaign launched in germany this week to raise awareness of the impact of underwater noise on sea mammals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sound travels more effectively under water than above the whale and dolphin conservation society -lrb- wdcs -rrb- has called for a range of noise-fighting measures to be implemented , including an international moratorium on low- and medium-frequency military sonar equipment , and on oil and gas development of the arctic region , saying underwater noise pollution created by those activities is putting entire aquatic populations at risk .
" it 's the old fashioned out of sight , out of mind – the way that we used to talk about chemical pollution is now the way that we start to look at noise pollution , " mark simmonds , the wdcs international director of science , told deutsche welle .
seeing by hearing whales , dolphins and porpoises rely on hearing for most of their basic needs : they use sonar to communicate , to orient themselves , to find food and mates .
man-made noise can drown out the sounds the mammals rely on day to day with consequences ranging from loss of habitat to death – and according to the wdcs , that noise is increasing .
" the equivalent would be losing your sight and going blind for us … and worse , in some of the noisier areas , " simmonds said .
noise disturbances can cause marine mammals to alter their behavior and abandon breeding and feeding areas , cause injury and lead to whales and dolphins beaching .
in a statement released by the german branch of the wdcs , the organization said that military sonar , marine construction and development , seismic exploration by the oil and gas industry , and the increasing number of ships in the world ’ s oceans are all helping to create an increasingly disorienting environment for the world ’ s cetaceans .
government inaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : offshore wind parks generate noise during their construction , not operation animal welfare groups say the effect of noise on marine mammals has been well documented but that governments have taken little heed .
" as far back as 2004 an historic european parliamentary resolution called on the eu member states to restrict the use of high-intensity sonar but sadly too little has been done , " international fund for animal welfare european union director lesley o 'donnell said .
" eu member states have a clear obligation to protect whales and their habitats from ocean noise which can disturb , injure and even kill whales and other marine species even after it has travelled tremendous distances . "
human activities like construction and oil drilling can create noise levels over 260 decibels – louder than a rocket taking off – and because noise travels differently underwater than through the air , the effects can be felt even hundreds of kilometers from the source .
" low-frequency active sonar from the military can range in distance from 1000 to 1500 kilometers -lsb- through water -rsb- , " wdcs germany conservation manager karsten brenning said .
" that would mean that if you would switch on -lrb- an equivalent above-water -rrb- device in moscow , it would be difficult to have a conversation on german streets . "
problem of wind parks the wdcs pointed to increasing arctic development and a growing amount of energy-related construction at sea as particular areas of concern .
seismic studies , in which sound waves are used to provide information on potential gas and oil deposits on the ocean floor , are being undertaken in designated whale sanctuaries , including the dogger bank and the moray firth in the north sea .
the latter may become home to a major wind farm if a recent proposal from consortium moray offshore renewables goes ahead .
" there 's a lot of development going on in the seas of europe that hasn ’ t been going on before , " simmonds said .
" as people who are essentially environmentalists at heart we like renewable energy … but it ’ s the way that these things are being constructed and fixed into the seabed , the hammering , the pile-driving , this is a very loud source of noise . "
technical solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly stealthy submarines prove ships can be made quieter , says the wdcs the wdcs said new technologies and alternative methods could make industry more environmentally friendly at sea .
simmonds pointed to the use of " bubble curtains " or " jackets " to disrupt the spread of noise that occurs when hammering pylons into place .
he also pointed to the great advances in submarine stealth technology that have been made , saying that these offered great cross-over potential for reducing the impact of ship 's engines .
in terms of noise generated by surveys for resources beneath the seabed , karsten brenning suggested more focus on " passive " seismic surveying , which is more like listening to the seabed than bouncing sound off it .
" there are technological mechanisms coming along but we need more investment and more focus on those , " simmonds said .

they help them find jobs , schools and kindergartens . cristina nastase stands in the dirty courtyard of a run-down grey tenement building in berlin 's tiergarten district at eight o 'clock in the morning , softly calling out two names under an open window .
curtains and clothing hung out to dry on clotheslines flap in the breeze .
many of the tenants here are roma from romania who entered germany with a tourist visa and would like to stay .
cristina nastase , 32 , is also romanian , an education welfare officer who helps roma and migrant workers .
angela and her two-year-old son , david , appear at the door , cristina greets them , and they all walk to the boy 's new kindergarten .
it 's a completely new experience for mother and son .
only the other day , they were out on the streets begging , like many of the roma here .
a chance for the children " attending kindergarten is important , " cristina says .
" it gives david a chance to have an untroubled childhood , and he can learn german . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cristina works on the streets of berlin , offering help cristina comforts the cranky child on the 20-minute walk to the kindergarten , she listens to angela 's problems and they discuss the cleaning job cristina has gotten her in her son 's kindergarten , which gives the single mother a chance to earn a little money and learn a bit german .
once they get to the kindergarten , david immediately runs off to play with the other children .
moved to tears , cristina watches him .
" in the streets , i often encounter families with children , " she says .
" it is really touching when a child gets the chance to enjoy his childhood . "
cultural mediators many roma are illiterate and speak little german .
they are not in a position to fill in school applications , proper rental contracts or health insurance forms - things they need to be able to stay in germany , even as eu citizens .
often , they end up on the streets , cleaning car windshields or begging for money .
but outreach workers may be able to help .
cristina nastase and one other co-worker were sent by the berlin-based organization " southeast europe culture " to do community outreach .
funding comes from local government .
kindergarten teacher barbara thorm accepted david under the condition that cristina accompanied mother and son during the first week , helping with translations and explaining , for instance , the importance of punctuality .
" things go wrong so often not because of the people involved but because there is no concept as to how to interact , " thorm says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : begging may be a thing of the past for some roma children in berlin photos to send home while david and his mother spend the day in the kindergarten , cristina 's next stop takes her to the city 's cathedral , a spot that not only draws many tourists , but beggars from romania as well .
cristina asks a roma woman carrying a small child whether she needs help .
in next to no time , the outreach worker is surrounded by roma women .
" they are very open , " cristina says .

they help them find jobs , schools and kindergartens . cristina nastase stands in the dirty courtyard of a run-down grey tenement building in berlin 's tiergarten district at eight o 'clock in the morning , softly calling out two names under an open window .
curtains and clothing hung out to dry on clotheslines flap in the breeze .
many of the tenants here are roma from romania who entered germany with a tourist visa and would like to stay .
cristina nastase , 32 , is also romanian , an education welfare officer who helps roma and migrant workers .
angela and her two-year-old son , david , appear at the door , cristina greets them , and they all walk to the boy 's new kindergarten .
it 's a completely new experience for mother and son .
only the other day , they were out on the streets begging , like many of the roma here .
a chance for the children " attending kindergarten is important , " cristina says .
" it gives david a chance to have an untroubled childhood , and he can learn german . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cristina works on the streets of berlin , offering help cristina comforts the cranky child on the 20-minute walk to the kindergarten , she listens to angela 's problems and they discuss the cleaning job cristina has gotten her in her son 's kindergarten , which gives the single mother a chance to earn a little money and learn a bit german .
once they get to the kindergarten , david immediately runs off to play with the other children .
moved to tears , cristina watches him .
" in the streets , i often encounter families with children , " she says .
" it is really touching when a child gets the chance to enjoy his childhood . "
cultural mediators many roma are illiterate and speak little german .
they are not in a position to fill in school applications , proper rental contracts or health insurance forms - things they need to be able to stay in germany , even as eu citizens .
often , they end up on the streets , cleaning car windshields or begging for money .
but outreach workers may be able to help .
cristina nastase and one other co-worker were sent by the berlin-based organization " southeast europe culture " to do community outreach .
funding comes from local government .
kindergarten teacher barbara thorm accepted david under the condition that cristina accompanied mother and son during the first week , helping with translations and explaining , for instance , the importance of punctuality .
" things go wrong so often not because of the people involved but because there is no concept as to how to interact , " thorm says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : begging may be a thing of the past for some roma children in berlin photos to send home while david and his mother spend the day in the kindergarten , cristina 's next stop takes her to the city 's cathedral , a spot that not only draws many tourists , but beggars from romania as well .
cristina asks a roma woman carrying a small child whether she needs help .
in next to no time , the outreach worker is surrounded by roma women .
" they are very open , " cristina says .
" you only need to show an interest in their concerns . "
today the women clamor to have their pictures taken so they can send them home to romania .
for the next 15 minutes or so , they have fun taking photos - a regular part of cristina 's job .
but the regular requests for money , a job or an apartment are not as easy for cristina to fulfill - for lack of funds and time .
the project is scheduled to end in december , but she is hopeful that berlin 's roma outreach project will be extended .

he called on supporters and opponents to continue a dialogue , hoping to avoid more violent protests . in an effort to bridge the communication gap between supporters and opponents of stuttgart 's train station renovation project , the premier of baden-wuerttemberg , stefan mappus , has announced that he is bringing in a mediator to help facilitate dialogue between the two sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geissler is known as a neutral mediator in a speech to the state assembly in stuttgart , mappus announced the appointment of heiner geissler as a mediator between the state and opponents of the controversial project , which is known as stuttgart 21 .
geissler is a former secretary general of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . " i am confident that there is a way to reconcile , " mappus said , " and this way leads through an unbiased moderator who will involve all sides without preconditions . " although the 80-year-old geissler is a member of mappus ' cdu , in previous roles as an arbitrator he has been known for reaching across party lines . renewed invitation in addition to naming geissler as arbitrator , mappus issued a call for further discussion about the project . " today , i renew today my invitation to discussions for all critics of the project , " mappus said .
" my appeal is this : let 's achieve a forum together where dialogue is possible and that the factual arguments become the guiding force of our discussion . " demonstrations last week against the stuttgart 21 project turned violent as police used water cannon , tear gas and pepper spray to disperse protesters .
two demonstrators who were hit in the face with the water cannons are still recovering and may have suffered permanent eye damage . on wednesday , mappus repeated a previous statement that scenes of violence must not be repeated . opponents gain ground mappus ' speech comes a day after the state government agreed to delay further demolition work on the project until after state elections in march 2011 .
the announcement appeared to be a major turn in the government 's response to opponents of the project , which has been planned for more than a decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say their reaction was measured however , mappus has said repeatedly that stopping the construction project - which has been already underway for six months - was not an option , as contracts have already been signed and legislation passed . meanwhile public opposition to the project has become more organized and vocal - largely in response to the use of force by police at last week 's demonstration .
state police chief wolf hammann said the officers ' response was in line with the actions taken by some protesters , which included spraying pepper spray and throwing chestnuts , plastic bottles and fireworks at the police .
in berlin , the federal government was set to discuss the protests and the police reaction on wednesday .
call for more transparency stuttgart 21 meant to make the city and the surrounding region part of a 1,500-kilometer -lrb- 932-mile -rrb- high-speed rail route across europe .
it also involves digging tunnels to create a new rail connection between stuttgart and the western city of ulm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tunnel project has been in the mix for years opponents say the money required for the project , an estimated seven billion euros -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- , would be better spent on updating the existing rail network .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say their reaction was measured however , mappus has said repeatedly that stopping the construction project - which has been already underway for six months - was not an option , as contracts have already been signed and legislation passed . meanwhile public opposition to the project has become more organized and vocal - largely in response to the use of force by police at last week 's demonstration .
state police chief wolf hammann said the officers ' response was in line with the actions taken by some protesters , which included spraying pepper spray and throwing chestnuts , plastic bottles and fireworks at the police .
in berlin , the federal government was set to discuss the protests and the police reaction on wednesday .

the managers of the project , which include german rail company deutsche bahn , have been sharply criticized .

local scientists say that such events are on the rise in recent years . last month , under the bright summer italian sun , tourists rolled up their trousers and waded through water in front of the centuries-old basilica on venice 's famous piazza san marco .
this was one of the most recent occurances of " acqua alta , " or " high water , " a term used in the veneto region for the exceptional tide peaks occurring in the adriatic sea , which reaching their maximum in the venetian lagoon , invade the foundations and inundate the older and lower parts of venice .
according to the technicians at the city 's tide monitoring and forecast center , these high water events are becoming more frequent and last a longer time .
" the worry is that the increase in the frequency of these high water events does n't show any sign of slowing down , " said paolo canestrelli , the center 's director said in a recent interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's increasing at an almost exponential rate . "
canestrelli cited various reasons for this , one of which he says is climate change .
he added that the fluctuating environment has caused rising sea levels and more frequent storm surges .
plus , he noted , the land the city sits on is also sinking - it 's estimated venice has sunk at least 23 centimeters -lrb- 9.05 inches -rrb- in the past century .
but whatever the reason , the data speaks for itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's tide monitoring and forecast center said that 2009 was a record year for high water a ' record ' year according to canestrelli , 2009 was a record flood year in venice - the worst in more than a century .
the tide reached 80 centimeters , flooding large parts of piazza san marco , more than 125 times .
it reached 110 centimeters , and so invaded large parts of city 16 times .
in the decades since venice began officially recording the " acqua alta " measurements in the early twentieth century , tides of greater than 110 centimeters occurred on an average three or four times a year .
this year , 2010 , canestrelli says , already promises to be worse .
" i think that this year we 'll reach a record higher than that of last year , " he warned in september .
" we 've already had 102 cases of water higher than 80 cm .
so already 102 times , piazza san marco has seen water and there 's still four months to go . "
a decades-old plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mose project encompasses 78 floodgates to block the inlets when the tide reaches over 110 centimeters that 's why now , more than ever , the city needs a huge barrier to protect itself .
the mose project , an italian acronym for " experimental electromechanical module " - and an allusion to moses , who parted the red sea - is intended to protect the city from exceptional high water events .
work has been underway on the project since 2003 and engineers recently estimated that it still wo n't be completed for a number of years to come .
mose provides for 78 floodgates that will rise and block the three inlets connecting venice with the adriatic sea , when a tide of 110 centimetres or more is forecast .
when the alarm sounds , compressed air will fill the gates and empty them of water .
they 'll rotate around their hinges , emerge from the depths and cut off the lagoon from the sea , stopping the tidal flow .
at the lido inlet , the widest of venice 's three entrances to the sea , workers are building the concrete " caissons " or containers that will house 20 of those floodgates , each larger than the wing of a 747 .
but it will be four more years before mose is able to protect venice – two years longer than originally expected , and venetians have been waiting for decades before that .
it was the great flood of 1966 , causing the lagoon to rise almost two meters above its normal levels , which focused attention on the danger to the city .
in 1987 , a consortium of italian companies , the consorzio venezia nuova , was entrusted with finding a solution .
but it was n't until 2003 that construction actually began . " two thirds of the work has been completed now and we 're waiting for remaining 25 percent of the money to do the remaining , " said giovanni cecconi , a consorzio hydrologist .
" from a technical point of view we are pretty much on schedule , and the only risk of delay can come from financing .
by the year 2014 , all the four barriers will start operation , if the money will come . " a multi-billion euro project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget of this massive construction project has ballooned to over 4.5 billion euros mose is the largest public works scheme in italian history , involving 3,000 workers spread over several sites .
its budget has blown out from three billion to more than four and half billion euros .
critics fear it could cost taxpayers close to double that in the end .
at the lido inlet construction site , cecconi is also keen to trumpet mose 's green credentials as the project has long been the target of conservationists .
they say the lagoon is one of the most important wetlands in western europe and the tidal exchange with the sea is essential to its well-being .
cecconi pointed out that the gates can be deployed just partially to minimise the effect on the environment .
" we leave the tidal flow in and out of the lagoon available all the time , but not during the storm surges , so -lrb- we 'll deploy them -rrb- just three to five times a year , for three to four hours , " he said . but cecconi 's comments do n't mollify guido ortalli of italia nostra , a group of citizens concerned to protect italy 's cultural heritage . he describes the project as " very heavy , very costly and technically complicated " and involving " really high maintenance costs . " whatever the objections , most people agree that something must be done , or one of civilization 's most beautiful locations may simply sink beneath the waves .
still , for many in venice , the work on defending the city ca n't finish soon enough .

wagner was the father of the theory of the races ; he was the first one to claim that there was a master race - the germans - and a low-class race - the jews .
he was the first to explain this in writing .
in 1938 , the symphony orchestra of eretz israel , which later became the israeli philharmonic orchestra , was about to perform wagner in a concert in tel aviv directed by -lsb- arturo -rsb- toscanini .
bronislaw huberman , the man who founded it , decided that the orchestra could not play wagner .
november 8-9 , 1938 was the so-called night of broken glass where the synagogues were destroyed and burned all over germany and austria , thousands of shops were looted and destroyed , hundreds of jews were murdered and tens of thousands of jews were sent to concentration camps .
huberman then realized that -lsb- wagner 's -rsb- theory had been realized by the germans at that time .
so he decided not to play wagner .
then he decided , together with the bosses of the jewish community in palestine - there was no israeli government at that time - to boycott wagner .
this happened before the shoah .
so , of course it was taken over later , because during the shoah it became clear that hitler was a great admirer of wagner .
not only did he adopt his theories , but he adopted his music as well .
the boycott has never been lifted .
it 's true that sometimes directors have tried to perform wagner in israel .
a man who decided to do it was daniel barenboim who , in a concert with a german orchestra , performed wagner , claiming that it was done spontaneously .
but it 's not true - you can not perform spontaneously with an orchestra .
you would say , then , that if the holocaust had not happened , israel would still have a boycott against wagner ? yes , i think so , because the pogroms happened .
it was not decided after the holocaust , it was decided after the pogroms in 1938 . by the way , there is no official ban .
it 's a sentimental ban .
as long as some of us are still alive , people should refrain from imposing wagner on us .
but we 're the not only ones ; there are many , many israelis who were born after the holocaust who are also against wagner for the same reason . how does this younger generation view wagner ? i do n't even know whether the younger generation is very familiar with wagner .
i do n't think that many young people are fond of wagner .
i 'm convinced they 're not . do you think that the israeli orchestra playing in bayreuth could serve as an act of reconciliation ? we do n't need reconciliation with wagner .
we have reconciliation with germany .
we have nothing against the new german generations .
i go to germany very often ; i lecture in germany .
i lecture on the shoah , but this is a different story .
i have no problem whatsoever , because they 're not the same germans .
but wagner is the same wagner - whether it 's today or 100 years ago , it 's the same wagner with the same theory . does the ban apply to any other composers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 night of broken glass was evidence that the nazis 's anti-semitism had turned violent no .
richard strauss was at least as strong an anti-semite as wagner was , but we play strauss . why ? because he is not the father of this -lsb- racial -rsb- theory .
if we banned all anti-semites , we would n't have a lot of writers , poets and composers because most of them were anti-jewish .
i can give you a list of about a hundred .
but we have their books , we read their books , we study their books , we even teach from their books .
the same thing goes for music , but wagner is a different story . have you had the personal experience of listening to wagner 's music ? i know wagner 's music , but i really do n't like this music .
it 's too bombastic for me .
it 's only a joke of course -lsb- laughing -rsb- but it 's music where you can not even sleep in the opera because it 's much too loud . i personally do n't like his music , but i know that he 's a genius without any doubt .

holocaust survivor and israeli journalist noah klieger explains why the ban is justified and does n't hinder reconciliation . the israel chamber orchestra has agreed to perform a work by anti-semitic composer richard wagner -lrb- 1813-1883 -rrb- at next year 's bayreuth festival , although an unofficial boycott of the composer 's music has been observed in israel for over 70 years .
prominent israeli journalist and holocaust survivor noah klieger -lrb- born in 1926 in strasbourg -rrb- explains how the unspoken wagner ban came about in israel and why he is opposed to an israeli orchestra performing wagner 's music . deutsche welle : why are you opposed to the israel chamber orchestra playing wagner at the bayreuth festival ? noah klieger : i 'm against it because i 'm against playing wagner in israel .
wagner was the father of the theory of the races ; he was the first one to claim that there was a master race - the germans - and a low-class race - the jews .
he was the first to explain this in writing .
in 1938 , the symphony orchestra of eretz israel , which later became the israeli philharmonic orchestra , was about to perform wagner in a concert in tel aviv directed by -lsb- arturo -rsb- toscanini .
bronislaw huberman , the man who founded it , decided that the orchestra could not play wagner .
november 8-9 , 1938 was the so-called night of broken glass where the synagogues were destroyed and burned all over germany and austria , thousands of shops were looted and destroyed , hundreds of jews were murdered and tens of thousands of jews were sent to concentration camps .
huberman then realized that -lsb- wagner 's -rsb- theory had been realized by the germans at that time .
so he decided not to play wagner .
then he decided , together with the bosses of the jewish community in palestine - there was no israeli government at that time - to boycott wagner .
this happened before the shoah .
so , of course it was taken over later , because during the shoah it became clear that hitler was a great admirer of wagner .
not only did he adopt his theories , but he adopted his music as well .
the boycott has never been lifted .
it 's true that sometimes directors have tried to perform wagner in israel .
a man who decided to do it was daniel barenboim who , in a concert with a german orchestra , performed wagner , claiming that it was done spontaneously .
but it 's not true - you can not perform spontaneously with an orchestra .
you would say , then , that if the holocaust had not happened , israel would still have a boycott against wagner ? yes , i think so , because the pogroms happened .
it was not decided after the holocaust , it was decided after the pogroms in 1938 . by the way , there is no official ban .
it 's a sentimental ban .
as long as some of us are still alive , people should refrain from imposing wagner on us .
but we 're the not only ones ; there are many , many israelis who were born after the holocaust who are also against wagner for the same reason . how does this younger generation view wagner ? i do n't even know whether the younger generation is very familiar with wagner .
i do n't think that many young people are fond of wagner .
i 'm convinced they 're not . do you think that the israeli orchestra playing in bayreuth could serve as an act of reconciliation ? we do n't need reconciliation with wagner .
we have reconciliation with germany .
we have nothing against the new german generations .
i go to germany very often ; i lecture in germany .
i lecture on the shoah , but this is a different story .
i have no problem whatsoever , because they 're not the same germans .
but wagner is the same wagner - whether it 's today or 100 years ago , it 's the same wagner with the same theory . does the ban apply to any other composers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 night of broken glass was evidence that the nazis 's anti-semitism had turned violent no .
richard strauss was at least as strong an anti-semite as wagner was , but we play strauss . why ? because he is not the father of this -lsb- racial -rsb- theory .
if we banned all anti-semites , we would n't have a lot of writers , poets and composers because most of them were anti-jewish .
i can give you a list of about a hundred .
but we have their books , we read their books , we study their books , we even teach from their books .
the same thing goes for music , but wagner is a different story . have you had the personal experience of listening to wagner 's music ? i know wagner 's music , but i really do n't like this music .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 06.10.2010 venice continues work on massive flood protection project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice scientists say high water events are increasing the mose flood gates aim to stave off potential disaster in the city and the larger venice lagoon when the adriatic sea surges .
local scientists say that such events are on the rise in recent years . last month , under the bright summer italian sun , tourists rolled up their trousers and waded through water in front of the centuries-old basilica on venice 's famous piazza san marco .
this was one of the most recent occurances of " acqua alta , " or " high water , " a term used in the veneto region for the exceptional tide peaks occurring in the adriatic sea , which reaching their maximum in the venetian lagoon , invade the foundations and inundate the older and lower parts of venice .
according to the technicians at the city 's tide monitoring and forecast center , these high water events are becoming more frequent and last a longer time .
" the worry is that the increase in the frequency of these high water events does n't show any sign of slowing down , " said paolo canestrelli , the center 's director said in a recent interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's increasing at an almost exponential rate . "
canestrelli cited various reasons for this , one of which he says is climate change .
he added that the fluctuating environment has caused rising sea levels and more frequent storm surges .
plus , he noted , the land the city sits on is also sinking - it 's estimated venice has sunk at least 23 centimeters -lrb- 9.05 inches -rrb- in the past century .
but whatever the reason , the data speaks for itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's tide monitoring and forecast center said that 2009 was a record year for high water a ' record ' year according to canestrelli , 2009 was a record flood year in venice - the worst in more than a century .
the tide reached 80 centimeters , flooding large parts of piazza san marco , more than 125 times .
it reached 110 centimeters , and so invaded large parts of city 16 times .
in the decades since venice began officially recording the " acqua alta " measurements in the early twentieth century , tides of greater than 110 centimeters occurred on an average three or four times a year .
this year , 2010 , canestrelli says , already promises to be worse .
" i think that this year we 'll reach a record higher than that of last year , " he warned in september .
" we 've already had 102 cases of water higher than 80 cm .
so already 102 times , piazza san marco has seen water and there 's still four months to go . "
a decades-old plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mose project encompasses 78 floodgates to block the inlets when the tide reaches over 110 centimeters that 's why now , more than ever , the city needs a huge barrier to protect itself .
the mose project , an italian acronym for " experimental electromechanical module " - and an allusion to moses , who parted the red sea - is intended to protect the city from exceptional high water events .
work has been underway on the project since 2003 and engineers recently estimated that it still wo n't be completed for a number of years to come .
mose provides for 78 floodgates that will rise and block the three inlets connecting venice with the adriatic sea , when a tide of 110 centimetres or more is forecast .
when the alarm sounds , compressed air will fill the gates and empty them of water .
they 'll rotate around their hinges , emerge from the depths and cut off the lagoon from the sea , stopping the tidal flow .
at the lido inlet , the widest of venice 's three entrances to the sea , workers are building the concrete " caissons " or containers that will house 20 of those floodgates , each larger than the wing of a 747 .
but it will be four more years before mose is able to protect venice – two years longer than originally expected , and venetians have been waiting for decades before that .
it was the great flood of 1966 , causing the lagoon to rise almost two meters above its normal levels , which focused attention on the danger to the city .
in 1987 , a consortium of italian companies , the consorzio venezia nuova , was entrusted with finding a solution .
but it was n't until 2003 that construction actually began . " two thirds of the work has been completed now and we 're waiting for remaining 25 percent of the money to do the remaining , " said giovanni cecconi , a consorzio hydrologist .
" from a technical point of view we are pretty much on schedule , and the only risk of delay can come from financing .
by the year 2014 , all the four barriers will start operation , if the money will come . " a multi-billion euro project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget of this massive construction project has ballooned to over 4.5 billion euros mose is the largest public works scheme in italian history , involving 3,000 workers spread over several sites .
its budget has blown out from three billion to more than four and half billion euros .
critics fear it could cost taxpayers close to double that in the end .
at the lido inlet construction site , cecconi is also keen to trumpet mose 's green credentials as the project has long been the target of conservationists .
they say the lagoon is one of the most important wetlands in western europe and the tidal exchange with the sea is essential to its well-being .
cecconi pointed out that the gates can be deployed just partially to minimise the effect on the environment .
" we leave the tidal flow in and out of the lagoon available all the time , but not during the storm surges , so -lrb- we 'll deploy them -rrb- just three to five times a year , for three to four hours , " he said . but cecconi 's comments do n't mollify guido ortalli of italia nostra , a group of citizens concerned to protect italy 's cultural heritage . he describes the project as " very heavy , very costly and technically complicated " and involving " really high maintenance costs . " whatever the objections , most people agree that something must be done , or one of civilization 's most beautiful locations may simply sink beneath the waves .
still , for many in venice , the work on defending the city ca n't finish soon enough .

local scientists say that such events are on the rise in recent years . last month , under the bright summer italian sun , tourists rolled up their trousers and waded through water in front of the centuries-old basilica on venice 's famous piazza san marco .
this was one of the most recent occurances of " acqua alta , " or " high water , " a term used in the veneto region for the exceptional tide peaks occurring in the adriatic sea , which reaching their maximum in the venetian lagoon , invade the foundations and inundate the older and lower parts of venice .
according to the technicians at the city 's tide monitoring and forecast center , these high water events are becoming more frequent and last a longer time .
" the worry is that the increase in the frequency of these high water events does n't show any sign of slowing down , " said paolo canestrelli , the center 's director said in a recent interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's increasing at an almost exponential rate . "
canestrelli cited various reasons for this , one of which he says is climate change .
he added that the fluctuating environment has caused rising sea levels and more frequent storm surges .
plus , he noted , the land the city sits on is also sinking - it 's estimated venice has sunk at least 23 centimeters -lrb- 9.05 inches -rrb- in the past century .
but whatever the reason , the data speaks for itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's tide monitoring and forecast center said that 2009 was a record year for high water a ' record ' year according to canestrelli , 2009 was a record flood year in venice - the worst in more than a century .
the tide reached 80 centimeters , flooding large parts of piazza san marco , more than 125 times .
it reached 110 centimeters , and so invaded large parts of city 16 times .
in the decades since venice began officially recording the " acqua alta " measurements in the early twentieth century , tides of greater than 110 centimeters occurred on an average three or four times a year .
this year , 2010 , canestrelli says , already promises to be worse .
" i think that this year we 'll reach a record higher than that of last year , " he warned in september .
" we 've already had 102 cases of water higher than 80 cm .
so already 102 times , piazza san marco has seen water and there 's still four months to go . "
a decades-old plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mose project encompasses 78 floodgates to block the inlets when the tide reaches over 110 centimeters that 's why now , more than ever , the city needs a huge barrier to protect itself .
the mose project , an italian acronym for " experimental electromechanical module " - and an allusion to moses , who parted the red sea - is intended to protect the city from exceptional high water events .
work has been underway on the project since 2003 and engineers recently estimated that it still wo n't be completed for a number of years to come .
mose provides for 78 floodgates that will rise and block the three inlets connecting venice with the adriatic sea , when a tide of 110 centimetres or more is forecast .
when the alarm sounds , compressed air will fill the gates and empty them of water .
they 'll rotate around their hinges , emerge from the depths and cut off the lagoon from the sea , stopping the tidal flow .
at the lido inlet , the widest of venice 's three entrances to the sea , workers are building the concrete " caissons " or containers that will house 20 of those floodgates , each larger than the wing of a 747 .
but it will be four more years before mose is able to protect venice – two years longer than originally expected , and venetians have been waiting for decades before that .
it was the great flood of 1966 , causing the lagoon to rise almost two meters above its normal levels , which focused attention on the danger to the city .
in 1987 , a consortium of italian companies , the consorzio venezia nuova , was entrusted with finding a solution .
but it was n't until 2003 that construction actually began . " two thirds of the work has been completed now and we 're waiting for remaining 25 percent of the money to do the remaining , " said giovanni cecconi , a consorzio hydrologist .
" from a technical point of view we are pretty much on schedule , and the only risk of delay can come from financing .
by the year 2014 , all the four barriers will start operation , if the money will come . " a multi-billion euro project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget of this massive construction project has ballooned to over 4.5 billion euros mose is the largest public works scheme in italian history , involving 3,000 workers spread over several sites .
its budget has blown out from three billion to more than four and half billion euros .
critics fear it could cost taxpayers close to double that in the end .
at the lido inlet construction site , cecconi is also keen to trumpet mose 's green credentials as the project has long been the target of conservationists .
they say the lagoon is one of the most important wetlands in western europe and the tidal exchange with the sea is essential to its well-being .
cecconi pointed out that the gates can be deployed just partially to minimise the effect on the environment .
" we leave the tidal flow in and out of the lagoon available all the time , but not during the storm surges , so -lrb- we 'll deploy them -rrb- just three to five times a year , for three to four hours , " he said . but cecconi 's comments do n't mollify guido ortalli of italia nostra , a group of citizens concerned to protect italy 's cultural heritage . he describes the project as " very heavy , very costly and technically complicated " and involving " really high maintenance costs . " whatever the objections , most people agree that something must be done , or one of civilization 's most beautiful locations may simply sink beneath the waves .
still , for many in venice , the work on defending the city ca n't finish soon enough .

the poll , conducted by berlin-based pollster forsa and sponsored by stern magazine and private broadcaster rtl , found that 24 percent of germans would vote for the greens in an election , up one percentage point from last week .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped two points to 23 percent .
the ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- picked up one more point with 31 percent , while their junior-partner free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took 5 percent .
the left party received 10 percent .
the results were based on responses from 2,501 german voters interviewed between sept .
27 and oct .
1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth and co-chief cem oezdemir have reason to celebrate gaining support by default forsa chief manfred guellner told stern that the spd was focusing on the wrong issues .
for example the criticism of the government 's minimal 5-euro increase in monthly welfare payments appears to be less important to former spd supporters in the middle class .
" the greens are profiting from weaknesses of the other parties , " he said .
" they 're gaining the deserters from the spd , but also from the cdu . "
he added that the greens have also benefitted from the leadership of renate kuenast and juergen tritten , chief and deputy chairs of the greens in parliament respectively .
several other opinion research institutions have found national support for the greens to be somewhat lower , just below the spd around 20 percent .
but many polls suggest the greens are ahead of the spd in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg and in berlin - where they appear to be the strongest party .
not an spd ' satellite or splinter group ' green party chief claudia roth pointed to the poll as evidence that the party has broken out of its previous role on the sidelines and is becoming a major player in german politics on par with the spd and cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens may have benefitted from anti-nuclear sentiment " the time of being the ' junior partners ' is over , " she told daily newspaper rheinische post .
" some former spd supporters still have not yet understood that we are not a satellite or splinter group from them . "
meanwhile the spd 's parliamentary chief thomas oppermann said the greens have benefitted from highly emotional issues for germans , like the government 's proposal to extend the lifespan of germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the anti-nuclear mobilization has paid off for the greens , " he said , even when the spd 's criticism of nuclear energy has been just as intense .

it said there was a need for china and the eu to strengthen mutual political confidence and deepen strategic co-operation . "
the statement said that germany would work to get the european union to recognize china as a market economy by 2016 , giving the country certain benefits under international trade rules .

however , efforts to gain concessions from china to allow a more rapid appreciation in the value of the yuan appear to have failed .

it 's set to start the ball rolling for similar agreements with other asian countries . the european union and south korea signed a record free-trade agreement in brussels on wednesday .
it 's expected to cut around 3 billion euros ' -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- worth of tariffs and lift administrative barriers and regulations on goods ranging from cars to whisky .
" this agreement is by far the most important trade deal ever concluded be the european union with one country and the first free trade deal with an asian country , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso .
the accord is set to take effect on july 1 , 2011 , once ratified by the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's luxury car industry may cash in on the deal the deal could double trade between europe and south korea by boosting business by 30 billion euros a year .
" the pact sends a strong signal that trade liberalization is a key element for recovery of the world economy , " said eu president herman van rompuy .
the eu runs a deficit with south korea in goods trade , although trends suggest the korean market offers significant growth potential for european firms .
expanding trade with asia the eu hopes that trade liberalization will broaden its influence in asia .
lifting customs duties on imported goods will make imported south korean products cheaper in the eu and eu goods cheaper in south korea .
europe 's spirits industry welcomed the deal for its potential in boosting sales of eu-produced drinks such as scotch whisky and french cognac .
the german luxury car and meat industries also hope to benefit from this arrangement .
italy was initially hesitant about the deal , fearing its national carmaker , fiat , could be outdone by south korea 's kia und hyundai car manufacturers .
but the country dropped its veto in return for delaying the treaty 's implementation until july 1 .
tariffs on some goods , such as small cars , will continue for up to five years thereafter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rompuy : free trade will help economic recovery the eu deal with south korea could trigger a rush among asian states to enter trade pacts with the 27-nation bloc . japan is keen to have better access to european markets .
on tuesday , japanese officials said that they hoped to start free-trade talks with the eu in the spring , partly in reaction to the korean agreement .
as japan and korea are competitors in several industries , japanese manufacturers stand to lose market share in europe 's automotive and electronics markets .
malaysian diplomats said that they , too , had agreed to open free-trade negotiations with the eu .

it 's expected to cut around 3 billion euros ' -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- worth of tariffs and lift administrative barriers and regulations on goods ranging from cars to whisky .
" this agreement is by far the most important trade deal ever concluded be the european union with one country and the first free trade deal with an asian country , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso .
the accord is set to take effect on july 1 , 2011 , once ratified by the european parliament .

" the pact sends a strong signal that trade liberalization is a key element for recovery of the world economy , " said eu president herman van rompuy .
the eu runs a deficit with south korea in goods trade , although trends suggest the korean market offers significant growth potential for european firms .
expanding trade with asia the eu hopes that trade liberalization will broaden its influence in asia .
lifting customs duties on imported goods will make imported south korean products cheaper in the eu and eu goods cheaper in south korea .
europe 's spirits industry welcomed the deal for its potential in boosting sales of eu-produced drinks such as scotch whisky and french cognac .
the german luxury car and meat industries also hope to benefit from this arrangement .
italy was initially hesitant about the deal , fearing its national carmaker , fiat , could be outdone by south korea 's kia und hyundai car manufacturers .
but the country dropped its veto in return for delaying the treaty 's implementation until july 1 .
tariffs on some goods , such as small cars , will continue for up to five years thereafter .

malaysian diplomats said that they , too , had agreed to open free-trade negotiations with the eu .

fears have been raised that the sludge could pollute the nearby danube , an important european waterway . hungary declared a state of emergency on tuesday after a toxic sludge spill swamped seven villages in what officials called the worst chemical accident in the country 's history . up to 40 square kilometers -lrb- 15.5 square miles -rrb- of land have been affected , giving rise to fears that the sludge could eventually pollute the nearby danube river , which courses through three european capitals before flowing into the black sea . " the sludge could reach the -lsb- danube -rsb- in four or five days , " said the deputy chief of the water management company for western hungary , sandor toth , adding that " from the point of view of water management , it 's a catastrophe . " the two-meter -lrb- 6.6-foot -rrb- tide of red toxic sludge killed four people and injured 120 others on tuesday .
eight of the injured are in serious condition and six people remain missing .
officials said on wednesday that the death toll could rise . the european union would be willing to help hungarian authorities should they need assistance in cleaning up the toxic chemical spill , eu spokesman joe hennon said wednesday . further down the danube in romania , the country 's environment ministry said it was monitoring water quality round-the-clock and stressed that the level of pollutants had not crossed the acceptable limits . ' man-made catastrophe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toxic flood killed four people and injured 120 others the area around ajka , in western hungary , was inundated with the sludge after the walls of the ajkai aluminia refinery 's residue reservoir , about 160 kilometers -lrb- 100 miles -rrb- southwest of budapest , broke on monday .
the plant produces alumina , which is used in the smelting of aluminum . the red mud is a toxic residue left over from the plant 's aluminum production .
it is slightly radioactive , highly corrosive and contains toxic heavy metals such as lead , cadmium , arsenic and chromium .
it destroyed all vegetation other than trees and seeped into hundreds of houses in seven villages , leaving residents unsure of when they would be able to return to their homes . " this is an unprecedented incident that affects deeply the ecosystem , wetlands and surface water bodies of the region as well as pointing out the fragility of our drinking water reserves , " gabor figeczky , the deputy country officer of the environmental group wwf hungary , said in a statement . environment state secretary illes said there was suspicion that hungarian aluminum production and trade company -lrb- mal -rrb- , which owns the ajka reservoir , had stored more red sludge in the reservoir than was allowed , and that its walls had displayed stress fractures prior to the spill . mal chief zoltan bakonyi insisted , however , that the company had done nothing wrong , saying the company would suspend all production for the time being . prime minister viktor orban , in a message to the hungarian people on tuesday , sent condolences to the victims ' families and promised a thorough investigation to determine " who is responsible for this man-made catastrophe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 06.10.2010 greens overtake spd as most popular opposition party , poll says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results were the best yet for the greens for the first time since its founding three decades ago , a poll suggests the german green party has overtaken the social democrats in popularity , bolstering the greens ' claim that they are the main opposition party . the 30-year-old green party in germany appeared to have broken a major barrier on wednesday as a poll suggested it has surpassed the older social democratics as the country 's most popular opposition party .
the poll , conducted by berlin-based pollster forsa and sponsored by stern magazine and private broadcaster rtl , found that 24 percent of germans would vote for the greens in an election , up one percentage point from last week .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped two points to 23 percent .
the ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- picked up one more point with 31 percent , while their junior-partner free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took 5 percent .
the left party received 10 percent .
the results were based on responses from 2,501 german voters interviewed between sept .
27 and oct .
1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth and co-chief cem oezdemir have reason to celebrate gaining support by default forsa chief manfred guellner told stern that the spd was focusing on the wrong issues .
for example the criticism of the government 's minimal 5-euro increase in monthly welfare payments appears to be less important to former spd supporters in the middle class .
" the greens are profiting from weaknesses of the other parties , " he said .
" they 're gaining the deserters from the spd , but also from the cdu . "
he added that the greens have also benefitted from the leadership of renate kuenast and juergen tritten , chief and deputy chairs of the greens in parliament respectively .
several other opinion research institutions have found national support for the greens to be somewhat lower , just below the spd around 20 percent .
but many polls suggest the greens are ahead of the spd in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg and in berlin - where they appear to be the strongest party .
not an spd ' satellite or splinter group ' green party chief claudia roth pointed to the poll as evidence that the party has broken out of its previous role on the sidelines and is becoming a major player in german politics on par with the spd and cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens may have benefitted from anti-nuclear sentiment " the time of being the ' junior partners ' is over , " she told daily newspaper rheinische post .
" some former spd supporters still have not yet understood that we are not a satellite or splinter group from them . "
meanwhile the spd 's parliamentary chief thomas oppermann said the greens have benefitted from highly emotional issues for germans , like the government 's proposal to extend the lifespan of germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the anti-nuclear mobilization has paid off for the greens , " he said , even when the spd 's criticism of nuclear energy has been just as intense .

an investment company holding 150,000 postbank shares is prepared to file a legal complaint protesting deutsche bank ’ s offer . deutsche bank announced in september it would offer smaller postbank shareholders who hold what 's called the free float 25 euros per share as part of an effort to consolidate control over postbank by increasing its 29.95 percent stake .
now , one of those small shareholders , dusseldorf-based effecten-spiegel , is close to filing a legal complaint once the offer is made official .
germany 's financial regulator bafin had allowed for the shares to be sold at 25 euros , based on a three-month average .
deutsche bank intends to fund the purchase through 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.1bn -rrb- in capital , raised by issuing 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros each .
law circumvented ?
marlis weidtmann , executive director of effecten-spiegel , which holds 150,000 postbank shares , says deutsche bank is trying to circumvent laws regulating takeovers .
deutsche bank has had a multi-tiered agreement with postbank 's owner , deutsche post , since january 2009 , in which it agreed to buy the former parent company 's 27.4 percent stake for 45 euros a share .
but those shares wo n't actually change hands until 2012 , leaving deutsche bank with less than 30 percent ownership of postbank for now and thus free to buy shares for 25 euros each – their average value over the last three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and postbank have long gone hand-in-hand weidtmann added that the details of the agreement have never been made completely public , but that independent calculations based on widely available information show the shares would be worth at least 36 euros each , if it were to be legally acknowledged that deutsche bank has more than a 30 percent stake in postbank .
“ it makes us suspicious , because we have to ask ourselves , ‘ what 's written in there ? ' ”
weidtmann told deutsche welle .
“ what surprises me is that bafin has played along thus far . ”
a ‘ soap bubble ' bonn-based lawyer wienand meilicke , who co-authored the report published in the trade journal zip , which valued the postbank shares at 36 euros , says “ a whole lot of people ” will be short-changed through deutsche bank 's plans .
“ if someone sticks a needle in this thing the soap bubble will pop , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ i am of the opinion that there is a significant chance this case will be successful in court .
but that means fighting the german banking establishment . ”
according to weidtmann , deutsche bank has so far defended its plans by “ always pulling back and making the argument that the shares wo n't change hands until 2012 . ”
tight-lipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and deutsche bank have angered smaller shareholders a deutsche bank spokesman told deutsche welle the bank “ sees no legal grounds for the complaint . ”
he referred to the position taken by frankfurt-based law firm hengeler mueller which , in a january 2009 press release , spoke of having advised deutsche bank on an “ improved transaction structure ” for its acquisition of postbank shares .
a hengeler mueller spokesman , however , declined to comment .
postbank has 24 million retail clients – more than any other bank in germany – and deutsche bank has been working to increase its number of domestic customers .
also , banks will soon be required to hold more capital to safeguard against future financial crises under the new basel iii accord , which will come into force in 2012 .
acquiring postbank will likely help deutsche bank meet those requirements .

fears have been raised that the sludge could pollute the nearby danube , an important european waterway . hungary declared a state of emergency on tuesday after a toxic sludge spill swamped seven villages in what officials called the worst chemical accident in the country 's history . up to 40 square kilometers -lrb- 15.5 square miles -rrb- of land have been affected , giving rise to fears that the sludge could eventually pollute the nearby danube river , which courses through three european capitals before flowing into the black sea . " the sludge could reach the -lsb- danube -rsb- in four or five days , " said the deputy chief of the water management company for western hungary , sandor toth , adding that " from the point of view of water management , it 's a catastrophe . " the two-meter -lrb- 6.6-foot -rrb- tide of red toxic sludge killed four people and injured 120 others on tuesday .
eight of the injured are in serious condition and six people remain missing .
officials said on wednesday that the death toll could rise . the european union would be willing to help hungarian authorities should they need assistance in cleaning up the toxic chemical spill , eu spokesman joe hennon said wednesday . further down the danube in romania , the country 's environment ministry said it was monitoring water quality round-the-clock and stressed that the level of pollutants had not crossed the acceptable limits . ' man-made catastrophe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toxic flood killed four people and injured 120 others the area around ajka , in western hungary , was inundated with the sludge after the walls of the ajkai aluminia refinery 's residue reservoir , about 160 kilometers -lrb- 100 miles -rrb- southwest of budapest , broke on monday .
the plant produces alumina , which is used in the smelting of aluminum . the red mud is a toxic residue left over from the plant 's aluminum production .
it is slightly radioactive , highly corrosive and contains toxic heavy metals such as lead , cadmium , arsenic and chromium .
it destroyed all vegetation other than trees and seeped into hundreds of houses in seven villages , leaving residents unsure of when they would be able to return to their homes . " this is an unprecedented incident that affects deeply the ecosystem , wetlands and surface water bodies of the region as well as pointing out the fragility of our drinking water reserves , " gabor figeczky , the deputy country officer of the environmental group wwf hungary , said in a statement . environment state secretary illes said there was suspicion that hungarian aluminum production and trade company -lrb- mal -rrb- , which owns the ajka reservoir , had stored more red sludge in the reservoir than was allowed , and that its walls had displayed stress fractures prior to the spill . mal chief zoltan bakonyi insisted , however , that the company had done nothing wrong , saying the company would suspend all production for the time being . prime minister viktor orban , in a message to the hungarian people on tuesday , sent condolences to the victims ' families and promised a thorough investigation to determine " who is responsible for this man-made catastrophe .

fears have been raised that the sludge could pollute the nearby danube , an important european waterway . hungary declared a state of emergency on tuesday after a toxic sludge spill swamped seven villages in what officials called the worst chemical accident in the country 's history . up to 40 square kilometers -lrb- 15.5 square miles -rrb- of land have been affected , giving rise to fears that the sludge could eventually pollute the nearby danube river , which courses through three european capitals before flowing into the black sea . " the sludge could reach the -lsb- danube -rsb- in four or five days , " said the deputy chief of the water management company for western hungary , sandor toth , adding that " from the point of view of water management , it 's a catastrophe . " the two-meter -lrb- 6.6-foot -rrb- tide of red toxic sludge killed four people and injured 120 others on tuesday .
eight of the injured are in serious condition and six people remain missing .
officials said on wednesday that the death toll could rise . the european union would be willing to help hungarian authorities should they need assistance in cleaning up the toxic chemical spill , eu spokesman joe hennon said wednesday . further down the danube in romania , the country 's environment ministry said it was monitoring water quality round-the-clock and stressed that the level of pollutants had not crossed the acceptable limits .

he called on supporters and opponents to continue a dialogue , hoping to avoid more violent protests . in an effort to bridge the communication gap between supporters and opponents of stuttgart 's train station renovation project , the premier of baden-wuerttemberg , stefan mappus , has announced that he is bringing in a mediator to help facilitate dialogue between the two sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geissler is known as a neutral mediator in a speech to the state assembly in stuttgart , mappus announced the appointment of heiner geissler as a mediator between the state and opponents of the controversial project , which is known as stuttgart 21 .
geissler is a former secretary general of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . " i am confident that there is a way to reconcile , " mappus said , " and this way leads through an unbiased moderator who will involve all sides without preconditions . " although the 80-year-old geissler is a member of mappus ' cdu , in previous roles as an arbitrator he has been known for reaching across party lines . renewed invitation in addition to naming geissler as arbitrator , mappus issued a call for further discussion about the project . " today , i renew today my invitation to discussions for all critics of the project , " mappus said .
" my appeal is this : let 's achieve a forum together where dialogue is possible and that the factual arguments become the guiding force of our discussion . " demonstrations last week against the stuttgart 21 project turned violent as police used water cannon , tear gas and pepper spray to disperse protesters .
two demonstrators who were hit in the face with the water cannons are still recovering and may have suffered permanent eye damage . on wednesday , mappus repeated a previous statement that scenes of violence must not be repeated . opponents gain ground mappus ' speech comes a day after the state government agreed to delay further demolition work on the project until after state elections in march 2011 .
the announcement appeared to be a major turn in the government 's response to opponents of the project , which has been planned for more than a decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say their reaction was measured however , mappus has said repeatedly that stopping the construction project - which has been already underway for six months - was not an option , as contracts have already been signed and legislation passed . meanwhile public opposition to the project has become more organized and vocal - largely in response to the use of force by police at last week 's demonstration .
state police chief wolf hammann said the officers ' response was in line with the actions taken by some protesters , which included spraying pepper spray and throwing chestnuts , plastic bottles and fireworks at the police .
in berlin , the federal government was set to discuss the protests and the police reaction on wednesday .
call for more transparency stuttgart 21 meant to make the city and the surrounding region part of a 1,500-kilometer -lrb- 932-mile -rrb- high-speed rail route across europe .
it also involves digging tunnels to create a new rail connection between stuttgart and the western city of ulm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tunnel project has been in the mix for years opponents say the money required for the project , an estimated seven billion euros -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- , would be better spent on updating the existing rail network .
the managers of the project , which include german rail company deutsche bahn , have been sharply criticized .

an investment company holding 150,000 postbank shares is prepared to file a legal complaint protesting deutsche bank ’ s offer . deutsche bank announced in september it would offer smaller postbank shareholders who hold what 's called the free float 25 euros per share as part of an effort to consolidate control over postbank by increasing its 29.95 percent stake .
now , one of those small shareholders , dusseldorf-based effecten-spiegel , is close to filing a legal complaint once the offer is made official .
germany 's financial regulator bafin had allowed for the shares to be sold at 25 euros , based on a three-month average .
deutsche bank intends to fund the purchase through 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.1bn -rrb- in capital , raised by issuing 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros each .
law circumvented ?
marlis weidtmann , executive director of effecten-spiegel , which holds 150,000 postbank shares , says deutsche bank is trying to circumvent laws regulating takeovers .
deutsche bank has had a multi-tiered agreement with postbank 's owner , deutsche post , since january 2009 , in which it agreed to buy the former parent company 's 27.4 percent stake for 45 euros a share .
but those shares wo n't actually change hands until 2012 , leaving deutsche bank with less than 30 percent ownership of postbank for now and thus free to buy shares for 25 euros each – their average value over the last three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and postbank have long gone hand-in-hand weidtmann added that the details of the agreement have never been made completely public , but that independent calculations based on widely available information show the shares would be worth at least 36 euros each , if it were to be legally acknowledged that deutsche bank has more than a 30 percent stake in postbank .
“ it makes us suspicious , because we have to ask ourselves , ‘ what 's written in there ? ' ”
weidtmann told deutsche welle .
“ what surprises me is that bafin has played along thus far . ”
a ‘ soap bubble ' bonn-based lawyer wienand meilicke , who co-authored the report published in the trade journal zip , which valued the postbank shares at 36 euros , says “ a whole lot of people ” will be short-changed through deutsche bank 's plans .
“ if someone sticks a needle in this thing the soap bubble will pop , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ i am of the opinion that there is a significant chance this case will be successful in court .
but that means fighting the german banking establishment . ”
according to weidtmann , deutsche bank has so far defended its plans by “ always pulling back and making the argument that the shares wo n't change hands until 2012 . ”
tight-lipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and deutsche bank have angered smaller shareholders a deutsche bank spokesman told deutsche welle the bank “ sees no legal grounds for the complaint . ”
he referred to the position taken by frankfurt-based law firm hengeler mueller which , in a january 2009 press release , spoke of having advised deutsche bank on an “ improved transaction structure ” for its acquisition of postbank shares .
a hengeler mueller spokesman , however , declined to comment .
postbank has 24 million retail clients – more than any other bank in germany – and deutsche bank has been working to increase its number of domestic customers .
also , banks will soon be required to hold more capital to safeguard against future financial crises under the new basel iii accord , which will come into force in 2012 .
acquiring postbank will likely help deutsche bank meet those requirements .

postbank has 24 million retail clients – more than any other bank in germany – and deutsche bank has been working to increase its number of domestic customers .
also , banks will soon be required to hold more capital to safeguard against future financial crises under the new basel iii accord , which will come into force in 2012 .
acquiring postbank will likely help deutsche bank meet those requirements .

an investment company holding 150,000 postbank shares is prepared to file a legal complaint protesting deutsche bank ’ s offer . deutsche bank announced in september it would offer smaller postbank shareholders who hold what 's called the free float 25 euros per share as part of an effort to consolidate control over postbank by increasing its 29.95 percent stake .
now , one of those small shareholders , dusseldorf-based effecten-spiegel , is close to filing a legal complaint once the offer is made official .
germany 's financial regulator bafin had allowed for the shares to be sold at 25 euros , based on a three-month average .
deutsche bank intends to fund the purchase through 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.1bn -rrb- in capital , raised by issuing 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros each .
law circumvented ?
marlis weidtmann , executive director of effecten-spiegel , which holds 150,000 postbank shares , says deutsche bank is trying to circumvent laws regulating takeovers .
deutsche bank has had a multi-tiered agreement with postbank 's owner , deutsche post , since january 2009 , in which it agreed to buy the former parent company 's 27.4 percent stake for 45 euros a share .
but those shares wo n't actually change hands until 2012 , leaving deutsche bank with less than 30 percent ownership of postbank for now and thus free to buy shares for 25 euros each – their average value over the last three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and postbank have long gone hand-in-hand weidtmann added that the details of the agreement have never been made completely public , but that independent calculations based on widely available information show the shares would be worth at least 36 euros each , if it were to be legally acknowledged that deutsche bank has more than a 30 percent stake in postbank .
“ it makes us suspicious , because we have to ask ourselves , ‘ what 's written in there ? ' ”
weidtmann told deutsche welle .
“ what surprises me is that bafin has played along thus far . ”
a ‘ soap bubble ' bonn-based lawyer wienand meilicke , who co-authored the report published in the trade journal zip , which valued the postbank shares at 36 euros , says “ a whole lot of people ” will be short-changed through deutsche bank 's plans .
“ if someone sticks a needle in this thing the soap bubble will pop , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ i am of the opinion that there is a significant chance this case will be successful in court .
but that means fighting the german banking establishment . ”
according to weidtmann , deutsche bank has so far defended its plans by “ always pulling back and making the argument that the shares wo n't change hands until 2012 . ”
tight-lipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and deutsche bank have angered smaller shareholders a deutsche bank spokesman told deutsche welle the bank “ sees no legal grounds for the complaint . ”

this year , bookworms can sample from tons of digital literature content and media . star authors like american jonathan franzen and briton ken follett , and not one , but two german nobel prize winners - guenter grass and herta mueller - are expected to attend this year 's frankfurt book fair , which runs from october 6-10 .
those names may be the literature fair 's trump card , but organizers say they also hope to showcase new concepts for the future of publishing .
" the biggest trend is that various media are merging , " said frankfurt book fair 's director , juergen boos .
" when people sit at their computers , they often have news pages open , as well as their e-mail and other programs .
that shows how dynamic things are . "
the worlds of film and publishing are coming closer together , he added .
" people load all their preferred media onto one device , or have several different devices that they jump back and forth from . "
bridging lit and tech in a program called " frankfurt sparks , " the fair is to showcase new technologies which demand fresh content .
with reading devices , apps , and internet platforms beginning to edge out or at least alter traditional printed books , the program 's intention in focusing on that trend is to spark debate .
" frankfurt storydrive " is a cross-media conference accompanying the fair , where publishers , technology and software developers , game representatives and media users can brainstorm about developing " worlds " for good stories and continue the debate about literature trends .
" device providers need content to arouse consumer interest in their devices , " said bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , a cooperation partner at the conference .
" the frankfurt book fair provides that content , so it is a typical win-win situation for both the fair and the technology sector , " he said .
bildunterschrift : not everything has gone digital growth in digital area rohleder anticipates growth of 20 percent in the next decade for the sector that merges literature and technology .
a new german reading device is slotted for debut at the fair , for instance , since internet book giant amazon has been hesitant to issue its kindle on the german market due to unclarified copyright issues .
another continued challenge for publishers is that many internet users do not want to pay for digital content , boos said , but it 's also a trend that offers potential for new developments .
" when ' avatar ' - the hugely successful movie - was created , the book , computer game and music were developed and marketed all at the same time , " boos stressed .
" that was a first , and it shows that people are thinking differently . "
good news and bad boos aims to tap into this cross-media market , but has a few hurdles to leap at this year 's fair .

there are also 100,000 fewer new publications .
but there is some good news , too .
with argentinia as the focus this year , 216 new translations are coming out of the country .
the children 's literature market is likewise buzzing , and the education sector can boast 11 percent more exhibitors this year .
the book fair is advancing its campaign for literacy and human rights , while the literary agents center is bursting at the seams .
" that is the most significant record we can report - that the licensing sector is been growing steadily , with more agents than in previous years so that they do n't all fit into the hall intended for them .
that 's the growth to be proud of at this year 's fair and is its backbone , " boos said .

this year , bookworms can sample from tons of digital literature content and media . star authors like american jonathan franzen and briton ken follett , and not one , but two german nobel prize winners - guenter grass and herta mueller - are expected to attend this year 's frankfurt book fair , which runs from october 6-10 .
those names may be the literature fair 's trump card , but organizers say they also hope to showcase new concepts for the future of publishing .
" the biggest trend is that various media are merging , " said frankfurt book fair 's director , juergen boos .
" when people sit at their computers , they often have news pages open , as well as their e-mail and other programs .
that shows how dynamic things are . "
the worlds of film and publishing are coming closer together , he added .
" people load all their preferred media onto one device , or have several different devices that they jump back and forth from . "
bridging lit and tech in a program called " frankfurt sparks , " the fair is to showcase new technologies which demand fresh content .
with reading devices , apps , and internet platforms beginning to edge out or at least alter traditional printed books , the program 's intention in focusing on that trend is to spark debate .
" frankfurt storydrive " is a cross-media conference accompanying the fair , where publishers , technology and software developers , game representatives and media users can brainstorm about developing " worlds " for good stories and continue the debate about literature trends .
" device providers need content to arouse consumer interest in their devices , " said bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , a cooperation partner at the conference .
" the frankfurt book fair provides that content , so it is a typical win-win situation for both the fair and the technology sector , " he said .
bildunterschrift : not everything has gone digital growth in digital area rohleder anticipates growth of 20 percent in the next decade for the sector that merges literature and technology .
a new german reading device is slotted for debut at the fair , for instance , since internet book giant amazon has been hesitant to issue its kindle on the german market due to unclarified copyright issues .
another continued challenge for publishers is that many internet users do not want to pay for digital content , boos said , but it 's also a trend that offers potential for new developments .
" when ' avatar ' - the hugely successful movie - was created , the book , computer game and music were developed and marketed all at the same time , " boos stressed .
" that was a first , and it shows that people are thinking differently . "
good news and bad boos aims to tap into this cross-media market , but has a few hurdles to leap at this year 's fair .
bucking past years ' trends of record participation , this year sees a five percent drop in exhibitors , bringing the number to around 6,900 .
there are also 100,000 fewer new publications .
but there is some good news , too .
with argentinia as the focus this year , 216 new translations are coming out of the country .
the children 's literature market is likewise buzzing , and the education sector can boast 11 percent more exhibitors this year .
the book fair is advancing its campaign for literacy and human rights , while the literary agents center is bursting at the seams .
" that is the most significant record we can report - that the licensing sector is been growing steadily , with more agents than in previous years so that they do n't all fit into the hall intended for them .
that 's the growth to be proud of at this year 's fair and is its backbone , " boos said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 06.10.2010 greens overtake spd as most popular opposition party , poll says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results were the best yet for the greens for the first time since its founding three decades ago , a poll suggests the german green party has overtaken the social democrats in popularity , bolstering the greens ' claim that they are the main opposition party . the 30-year-old green party in germany appeared to have broken a major barrier on wednesday as a poll suggested it has surpassed the older social democratics as the country 's most popular opposition party .
the poll , conducted by berlin-based pollster forsa and sponsored by stern magazine and private broadcaster rtl , found that 24 percent of germans would vote for the greens in an election , up one percentage point from last week .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped two points to 23 percent .
the ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- picked up one more point with 31 percent , while their junior-partner free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took 5 percent .
the left party received 10 percent .
the results were based on responses from 2,501 german voters interviewed between sept .
27 and oct .
1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth and co-chief cem oezdemir have reason to celebrate gaining support by default forsa chief manfred guellner told stern that the spd was focusing on the wrong issues .
for example the criticism of the government 's minimal 5-euro increase in monthly welfare payments appears to be less important to former spd supporters in the middle class .
" the greens are profiting from weaknesses of the other parties , " he said .
" they 're gaining the deserters from the spd , but also from the cdu . "
he added that the greens have also benefitted from the leadership of renate kuenast and juergen tritten , chief and deputy chairs of the greens in parliament respectively .
several other opinion research institutions have found national support for the greens to be somewhat lower , just below the spd around 20 percent .
but many polls suggest the greens are ahead of the spd in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg and in berlin - where they appear to be the strongest party .
not an spd ' satellite or splinter group ' green party chief claudia roth pointed to the poll as evidence that the party has broken out of its previous role on the sidelines and is becoming a major player in german politics on par with the spd and cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens may have benefitted from anti-nuclear sentiment " the time of being the ' junior partners ' is over , " she told daily newspaper rheinische post .
" some former spd supporters still have not yet understood that we are not a satellite or splinter group from them . "
meanwhile the spd 's parliamentary chief thomas oppermann said the greens have benefitted from highly emotional issues for germans , like the government 's proposal to extend the lifespan of germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the anti-nuclear mobilization has paid off for the greens , " he said , even when the spd 's criticism of nuclear energy has been just as intense .

fears have been raised that the sludge could pollute the nearby danube , an important european waterway . hungary declared a state of emergency on tuesday after a toxic sludge spill swamped seven villages in what officials called the worst chemical accident in the country 's history . up to 40 square kilometers -lrb- 15.5 square miles -rrb- of land have been affected , giving rise to fears that the sludge could eventually pollute the nearby danube river , which courses through three european capitals before flowing into the black sea . " the sludge could reach the -lsb- danube -rsb- in four or five days , " said the deputy chief of the water management company for western hungary , sandor toth , adding that " from the point of view of water management , it 's a catastrophe . " the two-meter -lrb- 6.6-foot -rrb- tide of red toxic sludge killed four people and injured 120 others on tuesday .
eight of the injured are in serious condition and six people remain missing .
officials said on wednesday that the death toll could rise . the european union would be willing to help hungarian authorities should they need assistance in cleaning up the toxic chemical spill , eu spokesman joe hennon said wednesday . further down the danube in romania , the country 's environment ministry said it was monitoring water quality round-the-clock and stressed that the level of pollutants had not crossed the acceptable limits . ' man-made catastrophe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toxic flood killed four people and injured 120 others the area around ajka , in western hungary , was inundated with the sludge after the walls of the ajkai aluminia refinery 's residue reservoir , about 160 kilometers -lrb- 100 miles -rrb- southwest of budapest , broke on monday .
the plant produces alumina , which is used in the smelting of aluminum . the red mud is a toxic residue left over from the plant 's aluminum production .
it is slightly radioactive , highly corrosive and contains toxic heavy metals such as lead , cadmium , arsenic and chromium .
it destroyed all vegetation other than trees and seeped into hundreds of houses in seven villages , leaving residents unsure of when they would be able to return to their homes . " this is an unprecedented incident that affects deeply the ecosystem , wetlands and surface water bodies of the region as well as pointing out the fragility of our drinking water reserves , " gabor figeczky , the deputy country officer of the environmental group wwf hungary , said in a statement . environment state secretary illes said there was suspicion that hungarian aluminum production and trade company -lrb- mal -rrb- , which owns the ajka reservoir , had stored more red sludge in the reservoir than was allowed , and that its walls had displayed stress fractures prior to the spill . mal chief zoltan bakonyi insisted , however , that the company had done nothing wrong , saying the company would suspend all production for the time being . prime minister viktor orban , in a message to the hungarian people on tuesday , sent condolences to the victims ' families and promised a thorough investigation to determine " who is responsible for this man-made catastrophe .

however , one venezuelan pianist who excels at playing off the cuff is an exception to the rule . gabriela montero -lrb- 1970- -rrb- improvisation on the song " guantanamera " gabriela montero -lrb- piano -rrb- mp3 recorded at the petersberg near bonn on september 25 , 2010 by deutsche welle -lrb- dw -rrb- improvisation has been called the well-spring of all music .
in the baroque and classical periods , it was standard practice .
the improvisational abilities of composers like bach , handel and mozart were legendary .
beethoven also showed a prodigious improvisational talent at the piano .
many of his piano sonatas , although precisely crafted compositions , reflect the freewheeling spirit of improvisational fantasy with their tempestuous runs and cascading successions of chords . today , the art of improvisation is widespread in jazz but rare within the realm of " classical " or " serious " music - with one exception being church organists who may improvise preludes or accompaniments to hymn tunes .
however , a talent of the caliber of venezuelan pianist gabriela montero is extremely rare .
montero , who says that she began improvising at age five , has been asked repeatedly " how she does it , " for which she has no answer . to demonstrate her gift for spur-of-the-moment invention , montero often begins a recital playing works from the repertory , but in the second half , improvises elaborate pieces based on melodies suggested by audience members .
the styles and rhythms can vary from romantic to rumba and from the toccata to the tango . we 've chosen a brief excerpt from her all-improvised recital at the petersberg hotel near bonn .
she begins by plucking out the melody of the song " guantanamera " and then builds an elaborate and cleverly crafted musical edifice from the song 's motifs .

the poll , conducted by berlin-based pollster forsa and sponsored by stern magazine and private broadcaster rtl , found that 24 percent of germans would vote for the greens in an election , up one percentage point from last week .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped two points to 23 percent .
the ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- picked up one more point with 31 percent , while their junior-partner free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took 5 percent .
the left party received 10 percent .
the results were based on responses from 2,501 german voters interviewed between sept .

for example the criticism of the government 's minimal 5-euro increase in monthly welfare payments appears to be less important to former spd supporters in the middle class .
" the greens are profiting from weaknesses of the other parties , " he said .
" they 're gaining the deserters from the spd , but also from the cdu . "
he added that the greens have also benefitted from the leadership of renate kuenast and juergen tritten , chief and deputy chairs of the greens in parliament respectively .
several other opinion research institutions have found national support for the greens to be somewhat lower , just below the spd around 20 percent .
but many polls suggest the greens are ahead of the spd in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg and in berlin - where they appear to be the strongest party .
not an spd ' satellite or splinter group ' green party chief claudia roth pointed to the poll as evidence that the party has broken out of its previous role on the sidelines and is becoming a major player in german politics on par with the spd and cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens may have benefitted from anti-nuclear sentiment " the time of being the ' junior partners ' is over , " she told daily newspaper rheinische post .
" some former spd supporters still have not yet understood that we are not a satellite or splinter group from them . "
meanwhile the spd 's parliamentary chief thomas oppermann said the greens have benefitted from highly emotional issues for germans , like the government 's proposal to extend the lifespan of germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the anti-nuclear mobilization has paid off for the greens , " he said , even when the spd 's criticism of nuclear energy has been just as intense .

fears have been raised that the sludge could pollute the nearby danube , an important european waterway . hungary declared a state of emergency on tuesday after a toxic sludge spill swamped seven villages in what officials called the worst chemical accident in the country 's history . up to 40 square kilometers -lrb- 15.5 square miles -rrb- of land have been affected , giving rise to fears that the sludge could eventually pollute the nearby danube river , which courses through three european capitals before flowing into the black sea . " the sludge could reach the -lsb- danube -rsb- in four or five days , " said the deputy chief of the water management company for western hungary , sandor toth , adding that " from the point of view of water management , it 's a catastrophe . " the two-meter -lrb- 6.6-foot -rrb- tide of red toxic sludge killed four people and injured 120 others on tuesday .
eight of the injured are in serious condition and six people remain missing .
officials said on wednesday that the death toll could rise . the european union would be willing to help hungarian authorities should they need assistance in cleaning up the toxic chemical spill , eu spokesman joe hennon said wednesday . further down the danube in romania , the country 's environment ministry said it was monitoring water quality round-the-clock and stressed that the level of pollutants had not crossed the acceptable limits . ' man-made catastrophe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toxic flood killed four people and injured 120 others the area around ajka , in western hungary , was inundated with the sludge after the walls of the ajkai aluminia refinery 's residue reservoir , about 160 kilometers -lrb- 100 miles -rrb- southwest of budapest , broke on monday .
the plant produces alumina , which is used in the smelting of aluminum . the red mud is a toxic residue left over from the plant 's aluminum production .

holocaust survivor and israeli journalist noah klieger explains why the ban is justified and does n't hinder reconciliation . the israel chamber orchestra has agreed to perform a work by anti-semitic composer richard wagner -lrb- 1813-1883 -rrb- at next year 's bayreuth festival , although an unofficial boycott of the composer 's music has been observed in israel for over 70 years .
prominent israeli journalist and holocaust survivor noah klieger -lrb- born in 1926 in strasbourg -rrb- explains how the unspoken wagner ban came about in israel and why he is opposed to an israeli orchestra performing wagner 's music . deutsche welle : why are you opposed to the israel chamber orchestra playing wagner at the bayreuth festival ? noah klieger : i 'm against it because i 'm against playing wagner in israel .
wagner was the father of the theory of the races ; he was the first one to claim that there was a master race - the germans - and a low-class race - the jews .
he was the first to explain this in writing .
in 1938 , the symphony orchestra of eretz israel , which later became the israeli philharmonic orchestra , was about to perform wagner in a concert in tel aviv directed by -lsb- arturo -rsb- toscanini .
bronislaw huberman , the man who founded it , decided that the orchestra could not play wagner .
november 8-9 , 1938 was the so-called night of broken glass where the synagogues were destroyed and burned all over germany and austria , thousands of shops were looted and destroyed , hundreds of jews were murdered and tens of thousands of jews were sent to concentration camps .
huberman then realized that -lsb- wagner 's -rsb- theory had been realized by the germans at that time .
so he decided not to play wagner .
then he decided , together with the bosses of the jewish community in palestine - there was no israeli government at that time - to boycott wagner .
this happened before the shoah .
so , of course it was taken over later , because during the shoah it became clear that hitler was a great admirer of wagner .
not only did he adopt his theories , but he adopted his music as well .
the boycott has never been lifted .
it 's true that sometimes directors have tried to perform wagner in israel .
a man who decided to do it was daniel barenboim who , in a concert with a german orchestra , performed wagner , claiming that it was done spontaneously .
but it 's not true - you can not perform spontaneously with an orchestra .
you would say , then , that if the holocaust had not happened , israel would still have a boycott against wagner ? yes , i think so , because the pogroms happened .
it was not decided after the holocaust , it was decided after the pogroms in 1938 . by the way , there is no official ban .
it 's a sentimental ban .
as long as some of us are still alive , people should refrain from imposing wagner on us .
but we 're the not only ones ; there are many , many israelis who were born after the holocaust who are also against wagner for the same reason . how does this younger generation view wagner ? i do n't even know whether the younger generation is very familiar with wagner .
i do n't think that many young people are fond of wagner .
i 'm convinced they 're not . do you think that the israeli orchestra playing in bayreuth could serve as an act of reconciliation ? we do n't need reconciliation with wagner .
we have reconciliation with germany .
we have nothing against the new german generations .
i go to germany very often ; i lecture in germany .
i lecture on the shoah , but this is a different story .
i have no problem whatsoever , because they 're not the same germans .
but wagner is the same wagner - whether it 's today or 100 years ago , it 's the same wagner with the same theory . does the ban apply to any other composers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 night of broken glass was evidence that the nazis 's anti-semitism had turned violent no .
richard strauss was at least as strong an anti-semite as wagner was , but we play strauss . why ? because he is not the father of this -lsb- racial -rsb- theory .
if we banned all anti-semites , we would n't have a lot of writers , poets and composers because most of them were anti-jewish .
i can give you a list of about a hundred .
but we have their books , we read their books , we study their books , we even teach from their books .
the same thing goes for music , but wagner is a different story . have you had the personal experience of listening to wagner 's music ? i know wagner 's music , but i really do n't like this music .
it 's too bombastic for me .
it 's only a joke of course -lsb- laughing -rsb- but it 's music where you can not even sleep in the opera because it 's much too loud . i personally do n't like his music , but i know that he 's a genius without any doubt .
he was one of the greatest composers ever , but this has nothing to do with his theories . interview : kate bowen / ma 'ayan yahbes editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de israeli orchestra breaks boycott to perform at 2011 bayreuth festival in israel , there is an unspoken ban on performing the works of anti-semitic composer richard wagner .

holocaust survivor and israeli journalist noah klieger explains why the ban is justified and does n't hinder reconciliation . the israel chamber orchestra has agreed to perform a work by anti-semitic composer richard wagner -lrb- 1813-1883 -rrb- at next year 's bayreuth festival , although an unofficial boycott of the composer 's music has been observed in israel for over 70 years .
prominent israeli journalist and holocaust survivor noah klieger -lrb- born in 1926 in strasbourg -rrb- explains how the unspoken wagner ban came about in israel and why he is opposed to an israeli orchestra performing wagner 's music . deutsche welle : why are you opposed to the israel chamber orchestra playing wagner at the bayreuth festival ? noah klieger : i 'm against it because i 'm against playing wagner in israel .
wagner was the father of the theory of the races ; he was the first one to claim that there was a master race - the germans - and a low-class race - the jews .
he was the first to explain this in writing .
in 1938 , the symphony orchestra of eretz israel , which later became the israeli philharmonic orchestra , was about to perform wagner in a concert in tel aviv directed by -lsb- arturo -rsb- toscanini .
bronislaw huberman , the man who founded it , decided that the orchestra could not play wagner .
november 8-9 , 1938 was the so-called night of broken glass where the synagogues were destroyed and burned all over germany and austria , thousands of shops were looted and destroyed , hundreds of jews were murdered and tens of thousands of jews were sent to concentration camps .
huberman then realized that -lsb- wagner 's -rsb- theory had been realized by the germans at that time .
so he decided not to play wagner .
then he decided , together with the bosses of the jewish community in palestine - there was no israeli government at that time - to boycott wagner .
this happened before the shoah .
so , of course it was taken over later , because during the shoah it became clear that hitler was a great admirer of wagner .
not only did he adopt his theories , but he adopted his music as well .
the boycott has never been lifted .
it 's true that sometimes directors have tried to perform wagner in israel .
a man who decided to do it was daniel barenboim who , in a concert with a german orchestra , performed wagner , claiming that it was done spontaneously .
but it 's not true - you can not perform spontaneously with an orchestra .
you would say , then , that if the holocaust had not happened , israel would still have a boycott against wagner ? yes , i think so , because the pogroms happened .
it was not decided after the holocaust , it was decided after the pogroms in 1938 . by the way , there is no official ban .
it 's a sentimental ban .
as long as some of us are still alive , people should refrain from imposing wagner on us .
but we 're the not only ones ; there are many , many israelis who were born after the holocaust who are also against wagner for the same reason . how does this younger generation view wagner ? i do n't even know whether the younger generation is very familiar with wagner .
i do n't think that many young people are fond of wagner .
i 'm convinced they 're not . do you think that the israeli orchestra playing in bayreuth could serve as an act of reconciliation ? we do n't need reconciliation with wagner .
we have reconciliation with germany .
we have nothing against the new german generations .
i go to germany very often ; i lecture in germany .
i lecture on the shoah , but this is a different story .
i have no problem whatsoever , because they 're not the same germans .
but wagner is the same wagner - whether it 's today or 100 years ago , it 's the same wagner with the same theory . does the ban apply to any other composers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 night of broken glass was evidence that the nazis 's anti-semitism had turned violent no .
richard strauss was at least as strong an anti-semite as wagner was , but we play strauss . why ? because he is not the father of this -lsb- racial -rsb- theory .
if we banned all anti-semites , we would n't have a lot of writers , poets and composers because most of them were anti-jewish .
i can give you a list of about a hundred .
but we have their books , we read their books , we study their books , we even teach from their books .
the same thing goes for music , but wagner is a different story . have you had the personal experience of listening to wagner 's music ? i know wagner 's music , but i really do n't like this music .
it 's too bombastic for me .
it 's only a joke of course -lsb- laughing -rsb- but it 's music where you can not even sleep in the opera because it 's much too loud . i personally do n't like his music , but i know that he 's a genius without any doubt .
he was one of the greatest composers ever , but this has nothing to do with his theories . interview : kate bowen / ma 'ayan yahbes editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 06.10.2010 deutsche bank may face lawsuit over postbank takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank is after postbank 's 24 million retail clients deutsche bank ’ s takeover plans for postbank are likely to become more complicated .
an investment company holding 150,000 postbank shares is prepared to file a legal complaint protesting deutsche bank ’ s offer . deutsche bank announced in september it would offer smaller postbank shareholders who hold what 's called the free float 25 euros per share as part of an effort to consolidate control over postbank by increasing its 29.95 percent stake .
now , one of those small shareholders , dusseldorf-based effecten-spiegel , is close to filing a legal complaint once the offer is made official .
germany 's financial regulator bafin had allowed for the shares to be sold at 25 euros , based on a three-month average .
deutsche bank intends to fund the purchase through 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.1bn -rrb- in capital , raised by issuing 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros each .
law circumvented ?
marlis weidtmann , executive director of effecten-spiegel , which holds 150,000 postbank shares , says deutsche bank is trying to circumvent laws regulating takeovers .
deutsche bank has had a multi-tiered agreement with postbank 's owner , deutsche post , since january 2009 , in which it agreed to buy the former parent company 's 27.4 percent stake for 45 euros a share .
but those shares wo n't actually change hands until 2012 , leaving deutsche bank with less than 30 percent ownership of postbank for now and thus free to buy shares for 25 euros each – their average value over the last three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and postbank have long gone hand-in-hand weidtmann added that the details of the agreement have never been made completely public , but that independent calculations based on widely available information show the shares would be worth at least 36 euros each , if it were to be legally acknowledged that deutsche bank has more than a 30 percent stake in postbank .
“ it makes us suspicious , because we have to ask ourselves , ‘ what 's written in there ? ' ”
weidtmann told deutsche welle .
“ what surprises me is that bafin has played along thus far . ”
a ‘ soap bubble ' bonn-based lawyer wienand meilicke , who co-authored the report published in the trade journal zip , which valued the postbank shares at 36 euros , says “ a whole lot of people ” will be short-changed through deutsche bank 's plans .
“ if someone sticks a needle in this thing the soap bubble will pop , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ i am of the opinion that there is a significant chance this case will be successful in court .
but that means fighting the german banking establishment . ”
according to weidtmann , deutsche bank has so far defended its plans by “ always pulling back and making the argument that the shares wo n't change hands until 2012 . ”
tight-lipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and deutsche bank have angered smaller shareholders a deutsche bank spokesman told deutsche welle the bank “ sees no legal grounds for the complaint . ”
he referred to the position taken by frankfurt-based law firm hengeler mueller which , in a january 2009 press release , spoke of having advised deutsche bank on an “ improved transaction structure ” for its acquisition of postbank shares .
a hengeler mueller spokesman , however , declined to comment .
postbank has 24 million retail clients – more than any other bank in germany – and deutsche bank has been working to increase its number of domestic customers .
also , banks will soon be required to hold more capital to safeguard against future financial crises under the new basel iii accord , which will come into force in 2012 .
acquiring postbank will likely help deutsche bank meet those requirements .

it 's set to start the ball rolling for similar agreements with other asian countries . the european union and south korea signed a record free-trade agreement in brussels on wednesday .
it 's expected to cut around 3 billion euros ' -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- worth of tariffs and lift administrative barriers and regulations on goods ranging from cars to whisky .
" this agreement is by far the most important trade deal ever concluded be the european union with one country and the first free trade deal with an asian country , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso .
the accord is set to take effect on july 1 , 2011 , once ratified by the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's luxury car industry may cash in on the deal the deal could double trade between europe and south korea by boosting business by 30 billion euros a year .
" the pact sends a strong signal that trade liberalization is a key element for recovery of the world economy , " said eu president herman van rompuy .
the eu runs a deficit with south korea in goods trade , although trends suggest the korean market offers significant growth potential for european firms .
expanding trade with asia the eu hopes that trade liberalization will broaden its influence in asia .
lifting customs duties on imported goods will make imported south korean products cheaper in the eu and eu goods cheaper in south korea .
europe 's spirits industry welcomed the deal for its potential in boosting sales of eu-produced drinks such as scotch whisky and french cognac .
the german luxury car and meat industries also hope to benefit from this arrangement .
italy was initially hesitant about the deal , fearing its national carmaker , fiat , could be outdone by south korea 's kia und hyundai car manufacturers .
but the country dropped its veto in return for delaying the treaty 's implementation until july 1 .
tariffs on some goods , such as small cars , will continue for up to five years thereafter .

an investment company holding 150,000 postbank shares is prepared to file a legal complaint protesting deutsche bank ’ s offer . deutsche bank announced in september it would offer smaller postbank shareholders who hold what 's called the free float 25 euros per share as part of an effort to consolidate control over postbank by increasing its 29.95 percent stake .
now , one of those small shareholders , dusseldorf-based effecten-spiegel , is close to filing a legal complaint once the offer is made official .
germany 's financial regulator bafin had allowed for the shares to be sold at 25 euros , based on a three-month average .
deutsche bank intends to fund the purchase through 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.1bn -rrb- in capital , raised by issuing 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros each .
law circumvented ?
marlis weidtmann , executive director of effecten-spiegel , which holds 150,000 postbank shares , says deutsche bank is trying to circumvent laws regulating takeovers .
deutsche bank has had a multi-tiered agreement with postbank 's owner , deutsche post , since january 2009 , in which it agreed to buy the former parent company 's 27.4 percent stake for 45 euros a share .
but those shares wo n't actually change hands until 2012 , leaving deutsche bank with less than 30 percent ownership of postbank for now and thus free to buy shares for 25 euros each – their average value over the last three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and postbank have long gone hand-in-hand weidtmann added that the details of the agreement have never been made completely public , but that independent calculations based on widely available information show the shares would be worth at least 36 euros each , if it were to be legally acknowledged that deutsche bank has more than a 30 percent stake in postbank .
“ it makes us suspicious , because we have to ask ourselves , ‘ what 's written in there ? ' ”
weidtmann told deutsche welle .
“ what surprises me is that bafin has played along thus far . ”
a ‘ soap bubble ' bonn-based lawyer wienand meilicke , who co-authored the report published in the trade journal zip , which valued the postbank shares at 36 euros , says “ a whole lot of people ” will be short-changed through deutsche bank 's plans .
“ if someone sticks a needle in this thing the soap bubble will pop , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ i am of the opinion that there is a significant chance this case will be successful in court .
but that means fighting the german banking establishment . ”
according to weidtmann , deutsche bank has so far defended its plans by “ always pulling back and making the argument that the shares wo n't change hands until 2012 . ”
tight-lipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and deutsche bank have angered smaller shareholders a deutsche bank spokesman told deutsche welle the bank “ sees no legal grounds for the complaint . ”
he referred to the position taken by frankfurt-based law firm hengeler mueller which , in a january 2009 press release , spoke of having advised deutsche bank on an “ improved transaction structure ” for its acquisition of postbank shares .
a hengeler mueller spokesman , however , declined to comment .
postbank has 24 million retail clients – more than any other bank in germany – and deutsche bank has been working to increase its number of domestic customers .
also , banks will soon be required to hold more capital to safeguard against future financial crises under the new basel iii accord , which will come into force in 2012 .
acquiring postbank will likely help deutsche bank meet those requirements .

an investment company holding 150,000 postbank shares is prepared to file a legal complaint protesting deutsche bank ’ s offer . deutsche bank announced in september it would offer smaller postbank shareholders who hold what 's called the free float 25 euros per share as part of an effort to consolidate control over postbank by increasing its 29.95 percent stake .
now , one of those small shareholders , dusseldorf-based effecten-spiegel , is close to filing a legal complaint once the offer is made official .
germany 's financial regulator bafin had allowed for the shares to be sold at 25 euros , based on a three-month average .
deutsche bank intends to fund the purchase through 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.1bn -rrb- in capital , raised by issuing 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros each .
law circumvented ?
marlis weidtmann , executive director of effecten-spiegel , which holds 150,000 postbank shares , says deutsche bank is trying to circumvent laws regulating takeovers .
deutsche bank has had a multi-tiered agreement with postbank 's owner , deutsche post , since january 2009 , in which it agreed to buy the former parent company 's 27.4 percent stake for 45 euros a share .
but those shares wo n't actually change hands until 2012 , leaving deutsche bank with less than 30 percent ownership of postbank for now and thus free to buy shares for 25 euros each – their average value over the last three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and postbank have long gone hand-in-hand weidtmann added that the details of the agreement have never been made completely public , but that independent calculations based on widely available information show the shares would be worth at least 36 euros each , if it were to be legally acknowledged that deutsche bank has more than a 30 percent stake in postbank .
“ it makes us suspicious , because we have to ask ourselves , ‘ what 's written in there ? ' ”
weidtmann told deutsche welle .
“ what surprises me is that bafin has played along thus far . ”
a ‘ soap bubble ' bonn-based lawyer wienand meilicke , who co-authored the report published in the trade journal zip , which valued the postbank shares at 36 euros , says “ a whole lot of people ” will be short-changed through deutsche bank 's plans .
“ if someone sticks a needle in this thing the soap bubble will pop , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ i am of the opinion that there is a significant chance this case will be successful in court .
but that means fighting the german banking establishment . ”
according to weidtmann , deutsche bank has so far defended its plans by “ always pulling back and making the argument that the shares wo n't change hands until 2012 . ”
tight-lipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and deutsche bank have angered smaller shareholders a deutsche bank spokesman told deutsche welle the bank “ sees no legal grounds for the complaint . ”
he referred to the position taken by frankfurt-based law firm hengeler mueller which , in a january 2009 press release , spoke of having advised deutsche bank on an “ improved transaction structure ” for its acquisition of postbank shares .
a hengeler mueller spokesman , however , declined to comment .
postbank has 24 million retail clients – more than any other bank in germany – and deutsche bank has been working to increase its number of domestic customers .
also , banks will soon be required to hold more capital to safeguard against future financial crises under the new basel iii accord , which will come into force in 2012 .
acquiring postbank will likely help deutsche bank meet those requirements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 06.10.2010 greens overtake spd as most popular opposition party , poll says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results were the best yet for the greens for the first time since its founding three decades ago , a poll suggests the german green party has overtaken the social democrats in popularity , bolstering the greens ' claim that they are the main opposition party . the 30-year-old green party in germany appeared to have broken a major barrier on wednesday as a poll suggested it has surpassed the older social democratics as the country 's most popular opposition party .
the poll , conducted by berlin-based pollster forsa and sponsored by stern magazine and private broadcaster rtl , found that 24 percent of germans would vote for the greens in an election , up one percentage point from last week .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped two points to 23 percent .
the ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- picked up one more point with 31 percent , while their junior-partner free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took 5 percent .
the left party received 10 percent .
the results were based on responses from 2,501 german voters interviewed between sept .
27 and oct .
1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth and co-chief cem oezdemir have reason to celebrate gaining support by default forsa chief manfred guellner told stern that the spd was focusing on the wrong issues .
for example the criticism of the government 's minimal 5-euro increase in monthly welfare payments appears to be less important to former spd supporters in the middle class .
" the greens are profiting from weaknesses of the other parties , " he said .
" they 're gaining the deserters from the spd , but also from the cdu . "
he added that the greens have also benefitted from the leadership of renate kuenast and juergen tritten , chief and deputy chairs of the greens in parliament respectively .
several other opinion research institutions have found national support for the greens to be somewhat lower , just below the spd around 20 percent .
but many polls suggest the greens are ahead of the spd in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg and in berlin - where they appear to be the strongest party .
not an spd ' satellite or splinter group ' green party chief claudia roth pointed to the poll as evidence that the party has broken out of its previous role on the sidelines and is becoming a major player in german politics on par with the spd and cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens may have benefitted from anti-nuclear sentiment " the time of being the ' junior partners ' is over , " she told daily newspaper rheinische post .
" some former spd supporters still have not yet understood that we are not a satellite or splinter group from them . "
meanwhile the spd 's parliamentary chief thomas oppermann said the greens have benefitted from highly emotional issues for germans , like the government 's proposal to extend the lifespan of germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the anti-nuclear mobilization has paid off for the greens , " he said , even when the spd 's criticism of nuclear energy has been just as intense .

this year , bookworms can sample from tons of digital literature content and media . star authors like american jonathan franzen and briton ken follett , and not one , but two german nobel prize winners - guenter grass and herta mueller - are expected to attend this year 's frankfurt book fair , which runs from october 6-10 .
those names may be the literature fair 's trump card , but organizers say they also hope to showcase new concepts for the future of publishing .
" the biggest trend is that various media are merging , " said frankfurt book fair 's director , juergen boos .
" when people sit at their computers , they often have news pages open , as well as their e-mail and other programs .
that shows how dynamic things are . "
the worlds of film and publishing are coming closer together , he added .
" people load all their preferred media onto one device , or have several different devices that they jump back and forth from . "
bridging lit and tech in a program called " frankfurt sparks , " the fair is to showcase new technologies which demand fresh content .
with reading devices , apps , and internet platforms beginning to edge out or at least alter traditional printed books , the program 's intention in focusing on that trend is to spark debate .
" frankfurt storydrive " is a cross-media conference accompanying the fair , where publishers , technology and software developers , game representatives and media users can brainstorm about developing " worlds " for good stories and continue the debate about literature trends .
" device providers need content to arouse consumer interest in their devices , " said bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , a cooperation partner at the conference .
" the frankfurt book fair provides that content , so it is a typical win-win situation for both the fair and the technology sector , " he said .
bildunterschrift : not everything has gone digital growth in digital area rohleder anticipates growth of 20 percent in the next decade for the sector that merges literature and technology .
a new german reading device is slotted for debut at the fair , for instance , since internet book giant amazon has been hesitant to issue its kindle on the german market due to unclarified copyright issues .
another continued challenge for publishers is that many internet users do not want to pay for digital content , boos said , but it 's also a trend that offers potential for new developments .
" when ' avatar ' - the hugely successful movie - was created , the book , computer game and music were developed and marketed all at the same time , " boos stressed .
" that was a first , and it shows that people are thinking differently . "
good news and bad boos aims to tap into this cross-media market , but has a few hurdles to leap at this year 's fair .
bucking past years ' trends of record participation , this year sees a five percent drop in exhibitors , bringing the number to around 6,900 .
there are also 100,000 fewer new publications .
but there is some good news , too .
with argentinia as the focus this year , 216 new translations are coming out of the country .
the children 's literature market is likewise buzzing , and the education sector can boast 11 percent more exhibitors this year .
the book fair is advancing its campaign for literacy and human rights , while the literary agents center is bursting at the seams .
" that is the most significant record we can report - that the licensing sector is been growing steadily , with more agents than in previous years so that they do n't all fit into the hall intended for them .
that 's the growth to be proud of at this year 's fair and is its backbone , " boos said .

another continued challenge for publishers is that many internet users do not want to pay for digital content , boos said , but it 's also a trend that offers potential for new developments .
" when ' avatar ' - the hugely successful movie - was created , the book , computer game and music were developed and marketed all at the same time , " boos stressed .
" that was a first , and it shows that people are thinking differently . "
good news and bad boos aims to tap into this cross-media market , but has a few hurdles to leap at this year 's fair .
bucking past years ' trends of record participation , this year sees a five percent drop in exhibitors , bringing the number to around 6,900 .
there are also 100,000 fewer new publications .
but there is some good news , too .
with argentinia as the focus this year , 216 new translations are coming out of the country .
the children 's literature market is likewise buzzing , and the education sector can boast 11 percent more exhibitors this year .
the book fair is advancing its campaign for literacy and human rights , while the literary agents center is bursting at the seams .
" that is the most significant record we can report - that the licensing sector is been growing steadily , with more agents than in previous years so that they do n't all fit into the hall intended for them .
that 's the growth to be proud of at this year 's fair and is its backbone , " boos said .

this year , bookworms can sample from tons of digital literature content and media . star authors like american jonathan franzen and briton ken follett , and not one , but two german nobel prize winners - guenter grass and herta mueller - are expected to attend this year 's frankfurt book fair , which runs from october 6-10 .
those names may be the literature fair 's trump card , but organizers say they also hope to showcase new concepts for the future of publishing .
" the biggest trend is that various media are merging , " said frankfurt book fair 's director , juergen boos .
" when people sit at their computers , they often have news pages open , as well as their e-mail and other programs .
that shows how dynamic things are . "
the worlds of film and publishing are coming closer together , he added .
" people load all their preferred media onto one device , or have several different devices that they jump back and forth from . "
bridging lit and tech in a program called " frankfurt sparks , " the fair is to showcase new technologies which demand fresh content .
with reading devices , apps , and internet platforms beginning to edge out or at least alter traditional printed books , the program 's intention in focusing on that trend is to spark debate .
" frankfurt storydrive " is a cross-media conference accompanying the fair , where publishers , technology and software developers , game representatives and media users can brainstorm about developing " worlds " for good stories and continue the debate about literature trends .
" device providers need content to arouse consumer interest in their devices , " said bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , a cooperation partner at the conference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 06.10.2010 frankfurt book fair merges literature and technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina is this year 's guest of honor at the fair the frankfurt book fair is the biggest book show in the world , drawing hundreds of thousands of visitors .
this year , bookworms can sample from tons of digital literature content and media . star authors like american jonathan franzen and briton ken follett , and not one , but two german nobel prize winners - guenter grass and herta mueller - are expected to attend this year 's frankfurt book fair , which runs from october 6-10 .
those names may be the literature fair 's trump card , but organizers say they also hope to showcase new concepts for the future of publishing .
" the biggest trend is that various media are merging , " said frankfurt book fair 's director , juergen boos .
" when people sit at their computers , they often have news pages open , as well as their e-mail and other programs .
that shows how dynamic things are . "
the worlds of film and publishing are coming closer together , he added .
" people load all their preferred media onto one device , or have several different devices that they jump back and forth from . "
bridging lit and tech in a program called " frankfurt sparks , " the fair is to showcase new technologies which demand fresh content .
with reading devices , apps , and internet platforms beginning to edge out or at least alter traditional printed books , the program 's intention in focusing on that trend is to spark debate .
" frankfurt storydrive " is a cross-media conference accompanying the fair , where publishers , technology and software developers , game representatives and media users can brainstorm about developing " worlds " for good stories and continue the debate about literature trends .
" device providers need content to arouse consumer interest in their devices , " said bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , a cooperation partner at the conference .
" the frankfurt book fair provides that content , so it is a typical win-win situation for both the fair and the technology sector , " he said .
bildunterschrift : not everything has gone digital growth in digital area rohleder anticipates growth of 20 percent in the next decade for the sector that merges literature and technology .
a new german reading device is slotted for debut at the fair , for instance , since internet book giant amazon has been hesitant to issue its kindle on the german market due to unclarified copyright issues .
another continued challenge for publishers is that many internet users do not want to pay for digital content , boos said , but it 's also a trend that offers potential for new developments .
" when ' avatar ' - the hugely successful movie - was created , the book , computer game and music were developed and marketed all at the same time , " boos stressed .
" that was a first , and it shows that people are thinking differently . "
good news and bad boos aims to tap into this cross-media market , but has a few hurdles to leap at this year 's fair .
bucking past years ' trends of record participation , this year sees a five percent drop in exhibitors , bringing the number to around 6,900 .
there are also 100,000 fewer new publications .
but there is some good news , too .
with argentinia as the focus this year , 216 new translations are coming out of the country .
the children 's literature market is likewise buzzing , and the education sector can boast 11 percent more exhibitors this year .
the book fair is advancing its campaign for literacy and human rights , while the literary agents center is bursting at the seams .
" that is the most significant record we can report - that the licensing sector is been growing steadily , with more agents than in previous years so that they do n't all fit into the hall intended for them .
that 's the growth to be proud of at this year 's fair and is its backbone , " boos said .
author : ruthard staeblein -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen the fair is open to exhibitors and trade visitors from october 6-10 , and open to the general public from october 9-10 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 06.10.2010 israel does n't need reconciliation with wagner , says holocaust survivor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noah klieger survived several concentration camps during the holocaust richard wagner 's music has been boycotted in israel in light of the nazi pogroms of 1938 .
holocaust survivor and israeli journalist noah klieger explains why the ban is justified and does n't hinder reconciliation . the israel chamber orchestra has agreed to perform a work by anti-semitic composer richard wagner -lrb- 1813-1883 -rrb- at next year 's bayreuth festival , although an unofficial boycott of the composer 's music has been observed in israel for over 70 years .
prominent israeli journalist and holocaust survivor noah klieger -lrb- born in 1926 in strasbourg -rrb- explains how the unspoken wagner ban came about in israel and why he is opposed to an israeli orchestra performing wagner 's music . deutsche welle : why are you opposed to the israel chamber orchestra playing wagner at the bayreuth festival ? noah klieger : i 'm against it because i 'm against playing wagner in israel .
wagner was the father of the theory of the races ; he was the first one to claim that there was a master race - the germans - and a low-class race - the jews .
he was the first to explain this in writing .
in 1938 , the symphony orchestra of eretz israel , which later became the israeli philharmonic orchestra , was about to perform wagner in a concert in tel aviv directed by -lsb- arturo -rsb- toscanini .
bronislaw huberman , the man who founded it , decided that the orchestra could not play wagner .
november 8-9 , 1938 was the so-called night of broken glass where the synagogues were destroyed and burned all over germany and austria , thousands of shops were looted and destroyed , hundreds of jews were murdered and tens of thousands of jews were sent to concentration camps .
huberman then realized that -lsb- wagner 's -rsb- theory had been realized by the germans at that time .
so he decided not to play wagner .
then he decided , together with the bosses of the jewish community in palestine - there was no israeli government at that time - to boycott wagner .
this happened before the shoah .
so , of course it was taken over later , because during the shoah it became clear that hitler was a great admirer of wagner .
not only did he adopt his theories , but he adopted his music as well .
the boycott has never been lifted .
it 's true that sometimes directors have tried to perform wagner in israel .
a man who decided to do it was daniel barenboim who , in a concert with a german orchestra , performed wagner , claiming that it was done spontaneously .
but it 's not true - you can not perform spontaneously with an orchestra .
you would say , then , that if the holocaust had not happened , israel would still have a boycott against wagner ? yes , i think so , because the pogroms happened .
it was not decided after the holocaust , it was decided after the pogroms in 1938 . by the way , there is no official ban .

holocaust survivor and israeli journalist noah klieger explains why the ban is justified and does n't hinder reconciliation . the israel chamber orchestra has agreed to perform a work by anti-semitic composer richard wagner -lrb- 1813-1883 -rrb- at next year 's bayreuth festival , although an unofficial boycott of the composer 's music has been observed in israel for over 70 years .
prominent israeli journalist and holocaust survivor noah klieger -lrb- born in 1926 in strasbourg -rrb- explains how the unspoken wagner ban came about in israel and why he is opposed to an israeli orchestra performing wagner 's music . deutsche welle : why are you opposed to the israel chamber orchestra playing wagner at the bayreuth festival ? noah klieger : i 'm against it because i 'm against playing wagner in israel .
wagner was the father of the theory of the races ; he was the first one to claim that there was a master race - the germans - and a low-class race - the jews .
he was the first to explain this in writing .
in 1938 , the symphony orchestra of eretz israel , which later became the israeli philharmonic orchestra , was about to perform wagner in a concert in tel aviv directed by -lsb- arturo -rsb- toscanini .
bronislaw huberman , the man who founded it , decided that the orchestra could not play wagner .
november 8-9 , 1938 was the so-called night of broken glass where the synagogues were destroyed and burned all over germany and austria , thousands of shops were looted and destroyed , hundreds of jews were murdered and tens of thousands of jews were sent to concentration camps .
huberman then realized that -lsb- wagner 's -rsb- theory had been realized by the germans at that time .
so he decided not to play wagner .
then he decided , together with the bosses of the jewish community in palestine - there was no israeli government at that time - to boycott wagner .
this happened before the shoah .
so , of course it was taken over later , because during the shoah it became clear that hitler was a great admirer of wagner .
not only did he adopt his theories , but he adopted his music as well .
the boycott has never been lifted .
it 's true that sometimes directors have tried to perform wagner in israel .
a man who decided to do it was daniel barenboim who , in a concert with a german orchestra , performed wagner , claiming that it was done spontaneously .
but it 's not true - you can not perform spontaneously with an orchestra .
you would say , then , that if the holocaust had not happened , israel would still have a boycott against wagner ? yes , i think so , because the pogroms happened .
it was not decided after the holocaust , it was decided after the pogroms in 1938 . by the way , there is no official ban .
it 's a sentimental ban .
as long as some of us are still alive , people should refrain from imposing wagner on us .
but we 're the not only ones ; there are many , many israelis who were born after the holocaust who are also against wagner for the same reason . how does this younger generation view wagner ? i do n't even know whether the younger generation is very familiar with wagner .
i do n't think that many young people are fond of wagner .
i 'm convinced they 're not . do you think that the israeli orchestra playing in bayreuth could serve as an act of reconciliation ? we do n't need reconciliation with wagner .

he called on supporters and opponents to continue a dialogue , hoping to avoid more violent protests . in an effort to bridge the communication gap between supporters and opponents of stuttgart 's train station renovation project , the premier of baden-wuerttemberg , stefan mappus , has announced that he is bringing in a mediator to help facilitate dialogue between the two sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geissler is known as a neutral mediator in a speech to the state assembly in stuttgart , mappus announced the appointment of heiner geissler as a mediator between the state and opponents of the controversial project , which is known as stuttgart 21 .
geissler is a former secretary general of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . " i am confident that there is a way to reconcile , " mappus said , " and this way leads through an unbiased moderator who will involve all sides without preconditions . " although the 80-year-old geissler is a member of mappus ' cdu , in previous roles as an arbitrator he has been known for reaching across party lines . renewed invitation in addition to naming geissler as arbitrator , mappus issued a call for further discussion about the project . " today , i renew today my invitation to discussions for all critics of the project , " mappus said .
" my appeal is this : let 's achieve a forum together where dialogue is possible and that the factual arguments become the guiding force of our discussion . " demonstrations last week against the stuttgart 21 project turned violent as police used water cannon , tear gas and pepper spray to disperse protesters .
two demonstrators who were hit in the face with the water cannons are still recovering and may have suffered permanent eye damage . on wednesday , mappus repeated a previous statement that scenes of violence must not be repeated . opponents gain ground mappus ' speech comes a day after the state government agreed to delay further demolition work on the project until after state elections in march 2011 .
the announcement appeared to be a major turn in the government 's response to opponents of the project , which has been planned for more than a decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say their reaction was measured however , mappus has said repeatedly that stopping the construction project - which has been already underway for six months - was not an option , as contracts have already been signed and legislation passed . meanwhile public opposition to the project has become more organized and vocal - largely in response to the use of force by police at last week 's demonstration .
state police chief wolf hammann said the officers ' response was in line with the actions taken by some protesters , which included spraying pepper spray and throwing chestnuts , plastic bottles and fireworks at the police .
in berlin , the federal government was set to discuss the protests and the police reaction on wednesday .

fears have been raised that the sludge could pollute the nearby danube , an important european waterway . hungary declared a state of emergency on tuesday after a toxic sludge spill swamped seven villages in what officials called the worst chemical accident in the country 's history . up to 40 square kilometers -lrb- 15.5 square miles -rrb- of land have been affected , giving rise to fears that the sludge could eventually pollute the nearby danube river , which courses through three european capitals before flowing into the black sea . " the sludge could reach the -lsb- danube -rsb- in four or five days , " said the deputy chief of the water management company for western hungary , sandor toth , adding that " from the point of view of water management , it 's a catastrophe . " the two-meter -lrb- 6.6-foot -rrb- tide of red toxic sludge killed four people and injured 120 others on tuesday .
eight of the injured are in serious condition and six people remain missing .
officials said on wednesday that the death toll could rise . the european union would be willing to help hungarian authorities should they need assistance in cleaning up the toxic chemical spill , eu spokesman joe hennon said wednesday . further down the danube in romania , the country 's environment ministry said it was monitoring water quality round-the-clock and stressed that the level of pollutants had not crossed the acceptable limits . ' man-made catastrophe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toxic flood killed four people and injured 120 others the area around ajka , in western hungary , was inundated with the sludge after the walls of the ajkai aluminia refinery 's residue reservoir , about 160 kilometers -lrb- 100 miles -rrb- southwest of budapest , broke on monday .
the plant produces alumina , which is used in the smelting of aluminum . the red mud is a toxic residue left over from the plant 's aluminum production .
it is slightly radioactive , highly corrosive and contains toxic heavy metals such as lead , cadmium , arsenic and chromium .
it destroyed all vegetation other than trees and seeped into hundreds of houses in seven villages , leaving residents unsure of when they would be able to return to their homes . " this is an unprecedented incident that affects deeply the ecosystem , wetlands and surface water bodies of the region as well as pointing out the fragility of our drinking water reserves , " gabor figeczky , the deputy country officer of the environmental group wwf hungary , said in a statement . environment state secretary illes said there was suspicion that hungarian aluminum production and trade company -lrb- mal -rrb- , which owns the ajka reservoir , had stored more red sludge in the reservoir than was allowed , and that its walls had displayed stress fractures prior to the spill . mal chief zoltan bakonyi insisted , however , that the company had done nothing wrong , saying the company would suspend all production for the time being . prime minister viktor orban , in a message to the hungarian people on tuesday , sent condolences to the victims ' families and promised a thorough investigation to determine " who is responsible for this man-made catastrophe .

an investment company holding 150,000 postbank shares is prepared to file a legal complaint protesting deutsche bank ’ s offer . deutsche bank announced in september it would offer smaller postbank shareholders who hold what 's called the free float 25 euros per share as part of an effort to consolidate control over postbank by increasing its 29.95 percent stake .
now , one of those small shareholders , dusseldorf-based effecten-spiegel , is close to filing a legal complaint once the offer is made official .
germany 's financial regulator bafin had allowed for the shares to be sold at 25 euros , based on a three-month average .
deutsche bank intends to fund the purchase through 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.1bn -rrb- in capital , raised by issuing 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros each .
law circumvented ?
marlis weidtmann , executive director of effecten-spiegel , which holds 150,000 postbank shares , says deutsche bank is trying to circumvent laws regulating takeovers .
deutsche bank has had a multi-tiered agreement with postbank 's owner , deutsche post , since january 2009 , in which it agreed to buy the former parent company 's 27.4 percent stake for 45 euros a share .
but those shares wo n't actually change hands until 2012 , leaving deutsche bank with less than 30 percent ownership of postbank for now and thus free to buy shares for 25 euros each – their average value over the last three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and postbank have long gone hand-in-hand weidtmann added that the details of the agreement have never been made completely public , but that independent calculations based on widely available information show the shares would be worth at least 36 euros each , if it were to be legally acknowledged that deutsche bank has more than a 30 percent stake in postbank .
“ it makes us suspicious , because we have to ask ourselves , ‘ what 's written in there ? ' ”
weidtmann told deutsche welle .
“ what surprises me is that bafin has played along thus far . ”
a ‘ soap bubble ' bonn-based lawyer wienand meilicke , who co-authored the report published in the trade journal zip , which valued the postbank shares at 36 euros , says “ a whole lot of people ” will be short-changed through deutsche bank 's plans .
“ if someone sticks a needle in this thing the soap bubble will pop , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ i am of the opinion that there is a significant chance this case will be successful in court .
but that means fighting the german banking establishment . ”
according to weidtmann , deutsche bank has so far defended its plans by “ always pulling back and making the argument that the shares wo n't change hands until 2012 . ”
tight-lipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and deutsche bank have angered smaller shareholders a deutsche bank spokesman told deutsche welle the bank “ sees no legal grounds for the complaint . ”
he referred to the position taken by frankfurt-based law firm hengeler mueller which , in a january 2009 press release , spoke of having advised deutsche bank on an “ improved transaction structure ” for its acquisition of postbank shares .
a hengeler mueller spokesman , however , declined to comment .
postbank has 24 million retail clients – more than any other bank in germany – and deutsche bank has been working to increase its number of domestic customers .
also , banks will soon be required to hold more capital to safeguard against future financial crises under the new basel iii accord , which will come into force in 2012 .
acquiring postbank will likely help deutsche bank meet those requirements .

five were apparently german citizens .
in the past five weeks alone , the cia has launched 23 remote attacks in pakistan . just one click of the mouse at cia headquarters in the us state of virginia is all that is needed to crush a suspected al qaeda cell thousands of miles away in the border region between pakistan and afghanistan .
and to kill dozens of people in one strike . the unmanned aerial vehicles , which are equipped with high-resolution infrared cameras and hellfire rockets , have become us president barack obama ’ s weapon of choice in the so-called war on terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drone attacks on the border region between pakistan and afghanistan are launched from thousands of miles away however , critics argue that the drones are used to carry out extrajudicial executions . pentagon press secretary geoff morell dismisses such criticism : " oh come on you know the climate there as well as i do .
there are terrorists who exist and i would point out that it is in the pakistanis ’ interest to do this . " he argues that not only are the populations of the united states and europe at risk of terrorism but the government in islamabad too .
the pentagon and the cia , which functions almost like a secret paramilitary subcontractor , consider these drone attacks as obama ’ s most precise weapon in the fight against terror . hailed as great political achievement by some a year ago , the head of the pakistani taliban , baitullah mehsud , was killed in a missile attack launched by a predator drone . obama 's legal adviser harold koh agrees .
he does not think the drones are instruments of extrajudicial state murder but says that " a state that is engaged in armed conflict may use lethal force . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of drones has been stepped up under us president barack obama 's watch conservative media organizations in the us see the attacks as obama ’ s greatest political achievement so far .
" the obama administration deserves tremendous credit , " says bret stephens from the wall street journal , who thinks that top terrorists are now struggling to survive because of the steady rain of attacks . " human capital is your greatest resource , " he says , arguing that terrorist networks are losing good people fast . collateral damage seen as a necessary evil the fact that up to 321 civilians were killed in the 16 drone attacks launched against baitullah mehsud is seen as necessary collateral damage by the current administration . the cia is set to continue deciding which suspected terrorists are put on the list for the next killer drone attack . human rights activist cathy kelly , who organized the only demonstration that has taken place in the us against obama ’ s drone war , is outraged and says that " the united states is moving into robotic warfare at an alarming rate .

fears have been raised that the sludge could pollute the nearby danube , an important european waterway . hungary declared a state of emergency on tuesday after a toxic sludge spill swamped seven villages in what officials called the worst chemical accident in the country 's history . up to 40 square kilometers -lrb- 15.5 square miles -rrb- of land have been affected , giving rise to fears that the sludge could eventually pollute the nearby danube river , which courses through three european capitals before flowing into the black sea .

eight of the injured are in serious condition and six people remain missing .

fears have been raised that the sludge could pollute the nearby danube , an important european waterway . hungary declared a state of emergency on tuesday after a toxic sludge spill swamped seven villages in what officials called the worst chemical accident in the country 's history . up to 40 square kilometers -lrb- 15.5 square miles -rrb- of land have been affected , giving rise to fears that the sludge could eventually pollute the nearby danube river , which courses through three european capitals before flowing into the black sea . " the sludge could reach the -lsb- danube -rsb- in four or five days , " said the deputy chief of the water management company for western hungary , sandor toth , adding that " from the point of view of water management , it 's a catastrophe . " the two-meter -lrb- 6.6-foot -rrb- tide of red toxic sludge killed four people and injured 120 others on tuesday .
eight of the injured are in serious condition and six people remain missing .
officials said on wednesday that the death toll could rise . the european union would be willing to help hungarian authorities should they need assistance in cleaning up the toxic chemical spill , eu spokesman joe hennon said wednesday . further down the danube in romania , the country 's environment ministry said it was monitoring water quality round-the-clock and stressed that the level of pollutants had not crossed the acceptable limits .

the plant produces alumina , which is used in the smelting of aluminum . the red mud is a toxic residue left over from the plant 's aluminum production .
it is slightly radioactive , highly corrosive and contains toxic heavy metals such as lead , cadmium , arsenic and chromium .
it destroyed all vegetation other than trees and seeped into hundreds of houses in seven villages , leaving residents unsure of when they would be able to return to their homes . " this is an unprecedented incident that affects deeply the ecosystem , wetlands and surface water bodies of the region as well as pointing out the fragility of our drinking water reserves , " gabor figeczky , the deputy country officer of the environmental group wwf hungary , said in a statement . environment state secretary illes said there was suspicion that hungarian aluminum production and trade company -lrb- mal -rrb- , which owns the ajka reservoir , had stored more red sludge in the reservoir than was allowed , and that its walls had displayed stress fractures prior to the spill . mal chief zoltan bakonyi insisted , however , that the company had done nothing wrong , saying the company would suspend all production for the time being . prime minister viktor orban , in a message to the hungarian people on tuesday , sent condolences to the victims ' families and promised a thorough investigation to determine " who is responsible for this man-made catastrophe .

it 's set to start the ball rolling for similar agreements with other asian countries . the european union and south korea signed a record free-trade agreement in brussels on wednesday .
it 's expected to cut around 3 billion euros ' -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- worth of tariffs and lift administrative barriers and regulations on goods ranging from cars to whisky .
" this agreement is by far the most important trade deal ever concluded be the european union with one country and the first free trade deal with an asian country , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso .
the accord is set to take effect on july 1 , 2011 , once ratified by the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's luxury car industry may cash in on the deal the deal could double trade between europe and south korea by boosting business by 30 billion euros a year .
" the pact sends a strong signal that trade liberalization is a key element for recovery of the world economy , " said eu president herman van rompuy .
the eu runs a deficit with south korea in goods trade , although trends suggest the korean market offers significant growth potential for european firms .
expanding trade with asia the eu hopes that trade liberalization will broaden its influence in asia .
lifting customs duties on imported goods will make imported south korean products cheaper in the eu and eu goods cheaper in south korea .
europe 's spirits industry welcomed the deal for its potential in boosting sales of eu-produced drinks such as scotch whisky and french cognac .
the german luxury car and meat industries also hope to benefit from this arrangement .
italy was initially hesitant about the deal , fearing its national carmaker , fiat , could be outdone by south korea 's kia und hyundai car manufacturers .
but the country dropped its veto in return for delaying the treaty 's implementation until july 1 .
tariffs on some goods , such as small cars , will continue for up to five years thereafter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rompuy : free trade will help economic recovery the eu deal with south korea could trigger a rush among asian states to enter trade pacts with the 27-nation bloc . japan is keen to have better access to european markets .
on tuesday , japanese officials said that they hoped to start free-trade talks with the eu in the spring , partly in reaction to the korean agreement .
as japan and korea are competitors in several industries , japanese manufacturers stand to lose market share in europe 's automotive and electronics markets .
malaysian diplomats said that they , too , had agreed to open free-trade negotiations with the eu .

fears have been raised that the sludge could pollute the nearby danube , an important european waterway . hungary declared a state of emergency on tuesday after a toxic sludge spill swamped seven villages in what officials called the worst chemical accident in the country 's history . up to 40 square kilometers -lrb- 15.5 square miles -rrb- of land have been affected , giving rise to fears that the sludge could eventually pollute the nearby danube river , which courses through three european capitals before flowing into the black sea . " the sludge could reach the -lsb- danube -rsb- in four or five days , " said the deputy chief of the water management company for western hungary , sandor toth , adding that " from the point of view of water management , it 's a catastrophe . " the two-meter -lrb- 6.6-foot -rrb- tide of red toxic sludge killed four people and injured 120 others on tuesday .
eight of the injured are in serious condition and six people remain missing .

however , one venezuelan pianist who excels at playing off the cuff is an exception to the rule . gabriela montero -lrb- 1970- -rrb- improvisation on the song " guantanamera " gabriela montero -lrb- piano -rrb- mp3 recorded at the petersberg near bonn on september 25 , 2010 by deutsche welle -lrb- dw -rrb- improvisation has been called the well-spring of all music .
in the baroque and classical periods , it was standard practice .
the improvisational abilities of composers like bach , handel and mozart were legendary .
beethoven also showed a prodigious improvisational talent at the piano .
many of his piano sonatas , although precisely crafted compositions , reflect the freewheeling spirit of improvisational fantasy with their tempestuous runs and cascading successions of chords . today , the art of improvisation is widespread in jazz but rare within the realm of " classical " or " serious " music - with one exception being church organists who may improvise preludes or accompaniments to hymn tunes .
however , a talent of the caliber of venezuelan pianist gabriela montero is extremely rare .
montero , who says that she began improvising at age five , has been asked repeatedly " how she does it , " for which she has no answer . to demonstrate her gift for spur-of-the-moment invention , montero often begins a recital playing works from the repertory , but in the second half , improvises elaborate pieces based on melodies suggested by audience members .
the styles and rhythms can vary from romantic to rumba and from the toccata to the tango . we 've chosen a brief excerpt from her all-improvised recital at the petersberg hotel near bonn .
she begins by plucking out the melody of the song " guantanamera " and then builds an elaborate and cleverly crafted musical edifice from the song 's motifs .
experiencing gabriela montero live in concert reminds one of the fact that without improvisation , there would be no music . author : rick fulker editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

holocaust survivor and israeli journalist noah klieger explains why the ban is justified and does n't hinder reconciliation . the israel chamber orchestra has agreed to perform a work by anti-semitic composer richard wagner -lrb- 1813-1883 -rrb- at next year 's bayreuth festival , although an unofficial boycott of the composer 's music has been observed in israel for over 70 years .
prominent israeli journalist and holocaust survivor noah klieger -lrb- born in 1926 in strasbourg -rrb- explains how the unspoken wagner ban came about in israel and why he is opposed to an israeli orchestra performing wagner 's music . deutsche welle : why are you opposed to the israel chamber orchestra playing wagner at the bayreuth festival ? noah klieger : i 'm against it because i 'm against playing wagner in israel .
wagner was the father of the theory of the races ; he was the first one to claim that there was a master race - the germans - and a low-class race - the jews .
he was the first to explain this in writing .
in 1938 , the symphony orchestra of eretz israel , which later became the israeli philharmonic orchestra , was about to perform wagner in a concert in tel aviv directed by -lsb- arturo -rsb- toscanini .
bronislaw huberman , the man who founded it , decided that the orchestra could not play wagner .
november 8-9 , 1938 was the so-called night of broken glass where the synagogues were destroyed and burned all over germany and austria , thousands of shops were looted and destroyed , hundreds of jews were murdered and tens of thousands of jews were sent to concentration camps .
huberman then realized that -lsb- wagner 's -rsb- theory had been realized by the germans at that time .
so he decided not to play wagner .
then he decided , together with the bosses of the jewish community in palestine - there was no israeli government at that time - to boycott wagner .
this happened before the shoah .
so , of course it was taken over later , because during the shoah it became clear that hitler was a great admirer of wagner .
not only did he adopt his theories , but he adopted his music as well .
the boycott has never been lifted .
it 's true that sometimes directors have tried to perform wagner in israel .
a man who decided to do it was daniel barenboim who , in a concert with a german orchestra , performed wagner , claiming that it was done spontaneously .
but it 's not true - you can not perform spontaneously with an orchestra .
you would say , then , that if the holocaust had not happened , israel would still have a boycott against wagner ? yes , i think so , because the pogroms happened .
it was not decided after the holocaust , it was decided after the pogroms in 1938 . by the way , there is no official ban .
it 's a sentimental ban .
as long as some of us are still alive , people should refrain from imposing wagner on us .
but we 're the not only ones ; there are many , many israelis who were born after the holocaust who are also against wagner for the same reason . how does this younger generation view wagner ? i do n't even know whether the younger generation is very familiar with wagner .
i do n't think that many young people are fond of wagner .
i 'm convinced they 're not . do you think that the israeli orchestra playing in bayreuth could serve as an act of reconciliation ? we do n't need reconciliation with wagner .
we have reconciliation with germany .
we have nothing against the new german generations .
i go to germany very often ; i lecture in germany .
i lecture on the shoah , but this is a different story .
i have no problem whatsoever , because they 're not the same germans .
but wagner is the same wagner - whether it 's today or 100 years ago , it 's the same wagner with the same theory . does the ban apply to any other composers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 night of broken glass was evidence that the nazis 's anti-semitism had turned violent no .
richard strauss was at least as strong an anti-semite as wagner was , but we play strauss . why ? because he is not the father of this -lsb- racial -rsb- theory .
if we banned all anti-semites , we would n't have a lot of writers , poets and composers because most of them were anti-jewish .
i can give you a list of about a hundred .
but we have their books , we read their books , we study their books , we even teach from their books .
the same thing goes for music , but wagner is a different story . have you had the personal experience of listening to wagner 's music ? i know wagner 's music , but i really do n't like this music .
it 's too bombastic for me .
it 's only a joke of course -lsb- laughing -rsb- but it 's music where you can not even sleep in the opera because it 's much too loud . i personally do n't like his music , but i know that he 's a genius without any doubt .
he was one of the greatest composers ever , but this has nothing to do with his theories . interview : kate bowen / ma 'ayan yahbes editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , one venezuelan pianist who excels at playing off the cuff is an exception to the rule . gabriela montero -lrb- 1970- -rrb- improvisation on the song " guantanamera " gabriela montero -lrb- piano -rrb- mp3 recorded at the petersberg near bonn on september 25 , 2010 by deutsche welle -lrb- dw -rrb- improvisation has been called the well-spring of all music .
in the baroque and classical periods , it was standard practice .
the improvisational abilities of composers like bach , handel and mozart were legendary .
beethoven also showed a prodigious improvisational talent at the piano .
many of his piano sonatas , although precisely crafted compositions , reflect the freewheeling spirit of improvisational fantasy with their tempestuous runs and cascading successions of chords . today , the art of improvisation is widespread in jazz but rare within the realm of " classical " or " serious " music - with one exception being church organists who may improvise preludes or accompaniments to hymn tunes .
however , a talent of the caliber of venezuelan pianist gabriela montero is extremely rare .
montero , who says that she began improvising at age five , has been asked repeatedly " how she does it , " for which she has no answer . to demonstrate her gift for spur-of-the-moment invention , montero often begins a recital playing works from the repertory , but in the second half , improvises elaborate pieces based on melodies suggested by audience members .
the styles and rhythms can vary from romantic to rumba and from the toccata to the tango . we 've chosen a brief excerpt from her all-improvised recital at the petersberg hotel near bonn .
she begins by plucking out the melody of the song " guantanamera " and then builds an elaborate and cleverly crafted musical edifice from the song 's motifs .
experiencing gabriela montero live in concert reminds one of the fact that without improvisation , there would be no music . author : rick fulker editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an investment company holding 150,000 postbank shares is prepared to file a legal complaint protesting deutsche bank ’ s offer . deutsche bank announced in september it would offer smaller postbank shareholders who hold what 's called the free float 25 euros per share as part of an effort to consolidate control over postbank by increasing its 29.95 percent stake .
now , one of those small shareholders , dusseldorf-based effecten-spiegel , is close to filing a legal complaint once the offer is made official .
germany 's financial regulator bafin had allowed for the shares to be sold at 25 euros , based on a three-month average .
deutsche bank intends to fund the purchase through 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.1bn -rrb- in capital , raised by issuing 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros each .
law circumvented ?
marlis weidtmann , executive director of effecten-spiegel , which holds 150,000 postbank shares , says deutsche bank is trying to circumvent laws regulating takeovers .
deutsche bank has had a multi-tiered agreement with postbank 's owner , deutsche post , since january 2009 , in which it agreed to buy the former parent company 's 27.4 percent stake for 45 euros a share .
but those shares wo n't actually change hands until 2012 , leaving deutsche bank with less than 30 percent ownership of postbank for now and thus free to buy shares for 25 euros each – their average value over the last three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and postbank have long gone hand-in-hand weidtmann added that the details of the agreement have never been made completely public , but that independent calculations based on widely available information show the shares would be worth at least 36 euros each , if it were to be legally acknowledged that deutsche bank has more than a 30 percent stake in postbank .
“ it makes us suspicious , because we have to ask ourselves , ‘ what 's written in there ? ' ”
weidtmann told deutsche welle .
“ what surprises me is that bafin has played along thus far . ”
a ‘ soap bubble ' bonn-based lawyer wienand meilicke , who co-authored the report published in the trade journal zip , which valued the postbank shares at 36 euros , says “ a whole lot of people ” will be short-changed through deutsche bank 's plans .
“ if someone sticks a needle in this thing the soap bubble will pop , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ i am of the opinion that there is a significant chance this case will be successful in court .
but that means fighting the german banking establishment . ”
according to weidtmann , deutsche bank has so far defended its plans by “ always pulling back and making the argument that the shares wo n't change hands until 2012 . ”
tight-lipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and deutsche bank have angered smaller shareholders a deutsche bank spokesman told deutsche welle the bank “ sees no legal grounds for the complaint . ”
he referred to the position taken by frankfurt-based law firm hengeler mueller which , in a january 2009 press release , spoke of having advised deutsche bank on an “ improved transaction structure ” for its acquisition of postbank shares .
a hengeler mueller spokesman , however , declined to comment .
postbank has 24 million retail clients – more than any other bank in germany – and deutsche bank has been working to increase its number of domestic customers .
also , banks will soon be required to hold more capital to safeguard against future financial crises under the new basel iii accord , which will come into force in 2012 .
acquiring postbank will likely help deutsche bank meet those requirements .

tight-lipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and deutsche bank have angered smaller shareholders a deutsche bank spokesman told deutsche welle the bank “ sees no legal grounds for the complaint . ”
he referred to the position taken by frankfurt-based law firm hengeler mueller which , in a january 2009 press release , spoke of having advised deutsche bank on an “ improved transaction structure ” for its acquisition of postbank shares .
a hengeler mueller spokesman , however , declined to comment .
postbank has 24 million retail clients – more than any other bank in germany – and deutsche bank has been working to increase its number of domestic customers .
also , banks will soon be required to hold more capital to safeguard against future financial crises under the new basel iii accord , which will come into force in 2012 .
acquiring postbank will likely help deutsche bank meet those requirements .

holocaust survivor and israeli journalist noah klieger explains why the ban is justified and does n't hinder reconciliation . the israel chamber orchestra has agreed to perform a work by anti-semitic composer richard wagner -lrb- 1813-1883 -rrb- at next year 's bayreuth festival , although an unofficial boycott of the composer 's music has been observed in israel for over 70 years .
prominent israeli journalist and holocaust survivor noah klieger -lrb- born in 1926 in strasbourg -rrb- explains how the unspoken wagner ban came about in israel and why he is opposed to an israeli orchestra performing wagner 's music . deutsche welle : why are you opposed to the israel chamber orchestra playing wagner at the bayreuth festival ? noah klieger : i 'm against it because i 'm against playing wagner in israel .
wagner was the father of the theory of the races ; he was the first one to claim that there was a master race - the germans - and a low-class race - the jews .
he was the first to explain this in writing .
in 1938 , the symphony orchestra of eretz israel , which later became the israeli philharmonic orchestra , was about to perform wagner in a concert in tel aviv directed by -lsb- arturo -rsb- toscanini .
bronislaw huberman , the man who founded it , decided that the orchestra could not play wagner .
november 8-9 , 1938 was the so-called night of broken glass where the synagogues were destroyed and burned all over germany and austria , thousands of shops were looted and destroyed , hundreds of jews were murdered and tens of thousands of jews were sent to concentration camps .
huberman then realized that -lsb- wagner 's -rsb- theory had been realized by the germans at that time .
so he decided not to play wagner .
then he decided , together with the bosses of the jewish community in palestine - there was no israeli government at that time - to boycott wagner .
this happened before the shoah .
so , of course it was taken over later , because during the shoah it became clear that hitler was a great admirer of wagner .
not only did he adopt his theories , but he adopted his music as well .
the boycott has never been lifted .
it 's true that sometimes directors have tried to perform wagner in israel .
a man who decided to do it was daniel barenboim who , in a concert with a german orchestra , performed wagner , claiming that it was done spontaneously .
but it 's not true - you can not perform spontaneously with an orchestra .
you would say , then , that if the holocaust had not happened , israel would still have a boycott against wagner ? yes , i think so , because the pogroms happened .
it was not decided after the holocaust , it was decided after the pogroms in 1938 . by the way , there is no official ban .
it 's a sentimental ban .
as long as some of us are still alive , people should refrain from imposing wagner on us .
but we 're the not only ones ; there are many , many israelis who were born after the holocaust who are also against wagner for the same reason . how does this younger generation view wagner ? i do n't even know whether the younger generation is very familiar with wagner .
i do n't think that many young people are fond of wagner .
i 'm convinced they 're not . do you think that the israeli orchestra playing in bayreuth could serve as an act of reconciliation ? we do n't need reconciliation with wagner .
we have reconciliation with germany .
we have nothing against the new german generations .
i go to germany very often ; i lecture in germany .
i lecture on the shoah , but this is a different story .
i have no problem whatsoever , because they 're not the same germans .
but wagner is the same wagner - whether it 's today or 100 years ago , it 's the same wagner with the same theory . does the ban apply to any other composers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 night of broken glass was evidence that the nazis 's anti-semitism had turned violent no .
richard strauss was at least as strong an anti-semite as wagner was , but we play strauss . why ? because he is not the father of this -lsb- racial -rsb- theory .
if we banned all anti-semites , we would n't have a lot of writers , poets and composers because most of them were anti-jewish .
i can give you a list of about a hundred .
but we have their books , we read their books , we study their books , we even teach from their books .
the same thing goes for music , but wagner is a different story . have you had the personal experience of listening to wagner 's music ? i know wagner 's music , but i really do n't like this music .
it 's too bombastic for me .
it 's only a joke of course -lsb- laughing -rsb- but it 's music where you can not even sleep in the opera because it 's much too loud . i personally do n't like his music , but i know that he 's a genius without any doubt .

he called on supporters and opponents to continue a dialogue , hoping to avoid more violent protests . in an effort to bridge the communication gap between supporters and opponents of stuttgart 's train station renovation project , the premier of baden-wuerttemberg , stefan mappus , has announced that he is bringing in a mediator to help facilitate dialogue between the two sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geissler is known as a neutral mediator in a speech to the state assembly in stuttgart , mappus announced the appointment of heiner geissler as a mediator between the state and opponents of the controversial project , which is known as stuttgart 21 .
geissler is a former secretary general of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . " i am confident that there is a way to reconcile , " mappus said , " and this way leads through an unbiased moderator who will involve all sides without preconditions . " although the 80-year-old geissler is a member of mappus ' cdu , in previous roles as an arbitrator he has been known for reaching across party lines . renewed invitation in addition to naming geissler as arbitrator , mappus issued a call for further discussion about the project . " today , i renew today my invitation to discussions for all critics of the project , " mappus said .
" my appeal is this : let 's achieve a forum together where dialogue is possible and that the factual arguments become the guiding force of our discussion . " demonstrations last week against the stuttgart 21 project turned violent as police used water cannon , tear gas and pepper spray to disperse protesters .
two demonstrators who were hit in the face with the water cannons are still recovering and may have suffered permanent eye damage . on wednesday , mappus repeated a previous statement that scenes of violence must not be repeated . opponents gain ground mappus ' speech comes a day after the state government agreed to delay further demolition work on the project until after state elections in march 2011 .
the announcement appeared to be a major turn in the government 's response to opponents of the project , which has been planned for more than a decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say their reaction was measured however , mappus has said repeatedly that stopping the construction project - which has been already underway for six months - was not an option , as contracts have already been signed and legislation passed . meanwhile public opposition to the project has become more organized and vocal - largely in response to the use of force by police at last week 's demonstration .
state police chief wolf hammann said the officers ' response was in line with the actions taken by some protesters , which included spraying pepper spray and throwing chestnuts , plastic bottles and fireworks at the police .
in berlin , the federal government was set to discuss the protests and the police reaction on wednesday .
call for more transparency stuttgart 21 meant to make the city and the surrounding region part of a 1,500-kilometer -lrb- 932-mile -rrb- high-speed rail route across europe .
it also involves digging tunnels to create a new rail connection between stuttgart and the western city of ulm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tunnel project has been in the mix for years opponents say the money required for the project , an estimated seven billion euros -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- , would be better spent on updating the existing rail network .
the managers of the project , which include german rail company deutsche bahn , have been sharply criticized .

they help them find jobs , schools and kindergartens . cristina nastase stands in the dirty courtyard of a run-down grey tenement building in berlin 's tiergarten district at eight o 'clock in the morning , softly calling out two names under an open window .
curtains and clothing hung out to dry on clotheslines flap in the breeze .
many of the tenants here are roma from romania who entered germany with a tourist visa and would like to stay .
cristina nastase , 32 , is also romanian , an education welfare officer who helps roma and migrant workers .
angela and her two-year-old son , david , appear at the door , cristina greets them , and they all walk to the boy 's new kindergarten .
it 's a completely new experience for mother and son .
only the other day , they were out on the streets begging , like many of the roma here .
a chance for the children " attending kindergarten is important , " cristina says .
" it gives david a chance to have an untroubled childhood , and he can learn german . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cristina works on the streets of berlin , offering help cristina comforts the cranky child on the 20-minute walk to the kindergarten , she listens to angela 's problems and they discuss the cleaning job cristina has gotten her in her son 's kindergarten , which gives the single mother a chance to earn a little money and learn a bit german .
once they get to the kindergarten , david immediately runs off to play with the other children .
moved to tears , cristina watches him .
" in the streets , i often encounter families with children , " she says .
" it is really touching when a child gets the chance to enjoy his childhood . "
cultural mediators many roma are illiterate and speak little german .
they are not in a position to fill in school applications , proper rental contracts or health insurance forms - things they need to be able to stay in germany , even as eu citizens .
often , they end up on the streets , cleaning car windshields or begging for money .
but outreach workers may be able to help .
cristina nastase and one other co-worker were sent by the berlin-based organization " southeast europe culture " to do community outreach .
funding comes from local government .
kindergarten teacher barbara thorm accepted david under the condition that cristina accompanied mother and son during the first week , helping with translations and explaining , for instance , the importance of punctuality .
" things go wrong so often not because of the people involved but because there is no concept as to how to interact , " thorm says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : begging may be a thing of the past for some roma children in berlin photos to send home while david and his mother spend the day in the kindergarten , cristina 's next stop takes her to the city 's cathedral , a spot that not only draws many tourists , but beggars from romania as well .
cristina asks a roma woman carrying a small child whether she needs help .
in next to no time , the outreach worker is surrounded by roma women .
" they are very open , " cristina says .
" you only need to show an interest in their concerns . "
today the women clamor to have their pictures taken so they can send them home to romania .
for the next 15 minutes or so , they have fun taking photos - a regular part of cristina 's job .
but the regular requests for money , a job or an apartment are not as easy for cristina to fulfill - for lack of funds and time .
the project is scheduled to end in december , but she is hopeful that berlin 's roma outreach project will be extended .

they help them find jobs , schools and kindergartens . cristina nastase stands in the dirty courtyard of a run-down grey tenement building in berlin 's tiergarten district at eight o 'clock in the morning , softly calling out two names under an open window .
curtains and clothing hung out to dry on clotheslines flap in the breeze .
many of the tenants here are roma from romania who entered germany with a tourist visa and would like to stay .
cristina nastase , 32 , is also romanian , an education welfare officer who helps roma and migrant workers .
angela and her two-year-old son , david , appear at the door , cristina greets them , and they all walk to the boy 's new kindergarten .
it 's a completely new experience for mother and son .
only the other day , they were out on the streets begging , like many of the roma here .
a chance for the children " attending kindergarten is important , " cristina says .
" it gives david a chance to have an untroubled childhood , and he can learn german . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cristina works on the streets of berlin , offering help cristina comforts the cranky child on the 20-minute walk to the kindergarten , she listens to angela 's problems and they discuss the cleaning job cristina has gotten her in her son 's kindergarten , which gives the single mother a chance to earn a little money and learn a bit german .
once they get to the kindergarten , david immediately runs off to play with the other children .
moved to tears , cristina watches him .
" in the streets , i often encounter families with children , " she says .
" it is really touching when a child gets the chance to enjoy his childhood . "
cultural mediators many roma are illiterate and speak little german .
they are not in a position to fill in school applications , proper rental contracts or health insurance forms - things they need to be able to stay in germany , even as eu citizens .
often , they end up on the streets , cleaning car windshields or begging for money .
but outreach workers may be able to help .
cristina nastase and one other co-worker were sent by the berlin-based organization " southeast europe culture " to do community outreach .
funding comes from local government .
kindergarten teacher barbara thorm accepted david under the condition that cristina accompanied mother and son during the first week , helping with translations and explaining , for instance , the importance of punctuality .
" things go wrong so often not because of the people involved but because there is no concept as to how to interact , " thorm says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : begging may be a thing of the past for some roma children in berlin photos to send home while david and his mother spend the day in the kindergarten , cristina 's next stop takes her to the city 's cathedral , a spot that not only draws many tourists , but beggars from romania as well .
cristina asks a roma woman carrying a small child whether she needs help .
in next to no time , the outreach worker is surrounded by roma women .
" they are very open , " cristina says .
" you only need to show an interest in their concerns . "
today the women clamor to have their pictures taken so they can send them home to romania .
for the next 15 minutes or so , they have fun taking photos - a regular part of cristina 's job .
but the regular requests for money , a job or an apartment are not as easy for cristina to fulfill - for lack of funds and time .
the project is scheduled to end in december , but she is hopeful that berlin 's roma outreach project will be extended .

he called on supporters and opponents to continue a dialogue , hoping to avoid more violent protests . in an effort to bridge the communication gap between supporters and opponents of stuttgart 's train station renovation project , the premier of baden-wuerttemberg , stefan mappus , has announced that he is bringing in a mediator to help facilitate dialogue between the two sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geissler is known as a neutral mediator in a speech to the state assembly in stuttgart , mappus announced the appointment of heiner geissler as a mediator between the state and opponents of the controversial project , which is known as stuttgart 21 .
geissler is a former secretary general of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . " i am confident that there is a way to reconcile , " mappus said , " and this way leads through an unbiased moderator who will involve all sides without preconditions . " although the 80-year-old geissler is a member of mappus ' cdu , in previous roles as an arbitrator he has been known for reaching across party lines . renewed invitation in addition to naming geissler as arbitrator , mappus issued a call for further discussion about the project . " today , i renew today my invitation to discussions for all critics of the project , " mappus said .
" my appeal is this : let 's achieve a forum together where dialogue is possible and that the factual arguments become the guiding force of our discussion . " demonstrations last week against the stuttgart 21 project turned violent as police used water cannon , tear gas and pepper spray to disperse protesters .
two demonstrators who were hit in the face with the water cannons are still recovering and may have suffered permanent eye damage . on wednesday , mappus repeated a previous statement that scenes of violence must not be repeated . opponents gain ground mappus ' speech comes a day after the state government agreed to delay further demolition work on the project until after state elections in march 2011 .
the announcement appeared to be a major turn in the government 's response to opponents of the project , which has been planned for more than a decade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say their reaction was measured however , mappus has said repeatedly that stopping the construction project - which has been already underway for six months - was not an option , as contracts have already been signed and legislation passed . meanwhile public opposition to the project has become more organized and vocal - largely in response to the use of force by police at last week 's demonstration .
state police chief wolf hammann said the officers ' response was in line with the actions taken by some protesters , which included spraying pepper spray and throwing chestnuts , plastic bottles and fireworks at the police .
in berlin , the federal government was set to discuss the protests and the police reaction on wednesday .
call for more transparency stuttgart 21 meant to make the city and the surrounding region part of a 1,500-kilometer -lrb- 932-mile -rrb- high-speed rail route across europe .
it also involves digging tunnels to create a new rail connection between stuttgart and the western city of ulm .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tunnel project has been in the mix for years opponents say the money required for the project , an estimated seven billion euros -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- , would be better spent on updating the existing rail network .
the managers of the project , which include german rail company deutsche bahn , have been sharply criticized .

" they are very open , " cristina says .
" you only need to show an interest in their concerns . "
today the women clamor to have their pictures taken so they can send them home to romania .

the project is scheduled to end in december , but she is hopeful that berlin 's roma outreach project will be extended .

they help them find jobs , schools and kindergartens . cristina nastase stands in the dirty courtyard of a run-down grey tenement building in berlin 's tiergarten district at eight o 'clock in the morning , softly calling out two names under an open window .
curtains and clothing hung out to dry on clotheslines flap in the breeze .
many of the tenants here are roma from romania who entered germany with a tourist visa and would like to stay .
cristina nastase , 32 , is also romanian , an education welfare officer who helps roma and migrant workers .
angela and her two-year-old son , david , appear at the door , cristina greets them , and they all walk to the boy 's new kindergarten .
it 's a completely new experience for mother and son .
only the other day , they were out on the streets begging , like many of the roma here .
a chance for the children " attending kindergarten is important , " cristina says .
" it gives david a chance to have an untroubled childhood , and he can learn german . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cristina works on the streets of berlin , offering help cristina comforts the cranky child on the 20-minute walk to the kindergarten , she listens to angela 's problems and they discuss the cleaning job cristina has gotten her in her son 's kindergarten , which gives the single mother a chance to earn a little money and learn a bit german .
once they get to the kindergarten , david immediately runs off to play with the other children .
moved to tears , cristina watches him .
" in the streets , i often encounter families with children , " she says .
" it is really touching when a child gets the chance to enjoy his childhood . "
cultural mediators many roma are illiterate and speak little german .
they are not in a position to fill in school applications , proper rental contracts or health insurance forms - things they need to be able to stay in germany , even as eu citizens .
often , they end up on the streets , cleaning car windshields or begging for money .
but outreach workers may be able to help .
cristina nastase and one other co-worker were sent by the berlin-based organization " southeast europe culture " to do community outreach .
funding comes from local government .
kindergarten teacher barbara thorm accepted david under the condition that cristina accompanied mother and son during the first week , helping with translations and explaining , for instance , the importance of punctuality .
" things go wrong so often not because of the people involved but because there is no concept as to how to interact , " thorm says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : begging may be a thing of the past for some roma children in berlin photos to send home while david and his mother spend the day in the kindergarten , cristina 's next stop takes her to the city 's cathedral , a spot that not only draws many tourists , but beggars from romania as well .
cristina asks a roma woman carrying a small child whether she needs help .
in next to no time , the outreach worker is surrounded by roma women .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 06.10.2010 deutsche bank may face lawsuit over postbank takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank is after postbank 's 24 million retail clients deutsche bank ’ s takeover plans for postbank are likely to become more complicated .
an investment company holding 150,000 postbank shares is prepared to file a legal complaint protesting deutsche bank ’ s offer . deutsche bank announced in september it would offer smaller postbank shareholders who hold what 's called the free float 25 euros per share as part of an effort to consolidate control over postbank by increasing its 29.95 percent stake .
now , one of those small shareholders , dusseldorf-based effecten-spiegel , is close to filing a legal complaint once the offer is made official .
germany 's financial regulator bafin had allowed for the shares to be sold at 25 euros , based on a three-month average .
deutsche bank intends to fund the purchase through 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.1bn -rrb- in capital , raised by issuing 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros each .
law circumvented ?
marlis weidtmann , executive director of effecten-spiegel , which holds 150,000 postbank shares , says deutsche bank is trying to circumvent laws regulating takeovers .
deutsche bank has had a multi-tiered agreement with postbank 's owner , deutsche post , since january 2009 , in which it agreed to buy the former parent company 's 27.4 percent stake for 45 euros a share .
but those shares wo n't actually change hands until 2012 , leaving deutsche bank with less than 30 percent ownership of postbank for now and thus free to buy shares for 25 euros each – their average value over the last three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and postbank have long gone hand-in-hand weidtmann added that the details of the agreement have never been made completely public , but that independent calculations based on widely available information show the shares would be worth at least 36 euros each , if it were to be legally acknowledged that deutsche bank has more than a 30 percent stake in postbank .
“ it makes us suspicious , because we have to ask ourselves , ‘ what 's written in there ? ' ”
weidtmann told deutsche welle .
“ what surprises me is that bafin has played along thus far . ”
a ‘ soap bubble ' bonn-based lawyer wienand meilicke , who co-authored the report published in the trade journal zip , which valued the postbank shares at 36 euros , says “ a whole lot of people ” will be short-changed through deutsche bank 's plans .
“ if someone sticks a needle in this thing the soap bubble will pop , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ i am of the opinion that there is a significant chance this case will be successful in court .
but that means fighting the german banking establishment . ”
according to weidtmann , deutsche bank has so far defended its plans by “ always pulling back and making the argument that the shares wo n't change hands until 2012 . ”
tight-lipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and deutsche bank have angered smaller shareholders a deutsche bank spokesman told deutsche welle the bank “ sees no legal grounds for the complaint . ”
he referred to the position taken by frankfurt-based law firm hengeler mueller which , in a january 2009 press release , spoke of having advised deutsche bank on an “ improved transaction structure ” for its acquisition of postbank shares .
a hengeler mueller spokesman , however , declined to comment .
postbank has 24 million retail clients – more than any other bank in germany – and deutsche bank has been working to increase its number of domestic customers .
also , banks will soon be required to hold more capital to safeguard against future financial crises under the new basel iii accord , which will come into force in 2012 .
acquiring postbank will likely help deutsche bank meet those requirements .

however , one venezuelan pianist who excels at playing off the cuff is an exception to the rule . gabriela montero -lrb- 1970- -rrb- improvisation on the song " guantanamera " gabriela montero -lrb- piano -rrb- mp3 recorded at the petersberg near bonn on september 25 , 2010 by deutsche welle -lrb- dw -rrb- improvisation has been called the well-spring of all music .
in the baroque and classical periods , it was standard practice .
the improvisational abilities of composers like bach , handel and mozart were legendary .
beethoven also showed a prodigious improvisational talent at the piano .
many of his piano sonatas , although precisely crafted compositions , reflect the freewheeling spirit of improvisational fantasy with their tempestuous runs and cascading successions of chords . today , the art of improvisation is widespread in jazz but rare within the realm of " classical " or " serious " music - with one exception being church organists who may improvise preludes or accompaniments to hymn tunes .
however , a talent of the caliber of venezuelan pianist gabriela montero is extremely rare .
montero , who says that she began improvising at age five , has been asked repeatedly " how she does it , " for which she has no answer . to demonstrate her gift for spur-of-the-moment invention , montero often begins a recital playing works from the repertory , but in the second half , improvises elaborate pieces based on melodies suggested by audience members .
the styles and rhythms can vary from romantic to rumba and from the toccata to the tango . we 've chosen a brief excerpt from her all-improvised recital at the petersberg hotel near bonn .
she begins by plucking out the melody of the song " guantanamera " and then builds an elaborate and cleverly crafted musical edifice from the song 's motifs .
experiencing gabriela montero live in concert reminds one of the fact that without improvisation , there would be no music . author : rick fulker editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an investment company holding 150,000 postbank shares is prepared to file a legal complaint protesting deutsche bank ’ s offer . deutsche bank announced in september it would offer smaller postbank shareholders who hold what 's called the free float 25 euros per share as part of an effort to consolidate control over postbank by increasing its 29.95 percent stake .
now , one of those small shareholders , dusseldorf-based effecten-spiegel , is close to filing a legal complaint once the offer is made official .
germany 's financial regulator bafin had allowed for the shares to be sold at 25 euros , based on a three-month average .
deutsche bank intends to fund the purchase through 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.1bn -rrb- in capital , raised by issuing 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros each .
law circumvented ?
marlis weidtmann , executive director of effecten-spiegel , which holds 150,000 postbank shares , says deutsche bank is trying to circumvent laws regulating takeovers .
deutsche bank has had a multi-tiered agreement with postbank 's owner , deutsche post , since january 2009 , in which it agreed to buy the former parent company 's 27.4 percent stake for 45 euros a share .
but those shares wo n't actually change hands until 2012 , leaving deutsche bank with less than 30 percent ownership of postbank for now and thus free to buy shares for 25 euros each – their average value over the last three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and postbank have long gone hand-in-hand weidtmann added that the details of the agreement have never been made completely public , but that independent calculations based on widely available information show the shares would be worth at least 36 euros each , if it were to be legally acknowledged that deutsche bank has more than a 30 percent stake in postbank .
“ it makes us suspicious , because we have to ask ourselves , ‘ what 's written in there ? ' ”
weidtmann told deutsche welle .
“ what surprises me is that bafin has played along thus far . ”
a ‘ soap bubble ' bonn-based lawyer wienand meilicke , who co-authored the report published in the trade journal zip , which valued the postbank shares at 36 euros , says “ a whole lot of people ” will be short-changed through deutsche bank 's plans .
“ if someone sticks a needle in this thing the soap bubble will pop , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ i am of the opinion that there is a significant chance this case will be successful in court .
but that means fighting the german banking establishment . ”
according to weidtmann , deutsche bank has so far defended its plans by “ always pulling back and making the argument that the shares wo n't change hands until 2012 . ”
tight-lipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and deutsche bank have angered smaller shareholders a deutsche bank spokesman told deutsche welle the bank “ sees no legal grounds for the complaint . ”
he referred to the position taken by frankfurt-based law firm hengeler mueller which , in a january 2009 press release , spoke of having advised deutsche bank on an “ improved transaction structure ” for its acquisition of postbank shares .
a hengeler mueller spokesman , however , declined to comment .
postbank has 24 million retail clients – more than any other bank in germany – and deutsche bank has been working to increase its number of domestic customers .
also , banks will soon be required to hold more capital to safeguard against future financial crises under the new basel iii accord , which will come into force in 2012 .
acquiring postbank will likely help deutsche bank meet those requirements .

fears have been raised that the sludge could pollute the nearby danube , an important european waterway . hungary declared a state of emergency on tuesday after a toxic sludge spill swamped seven villages in what officials called the worst chemical accident in the country 's history . up to 40 square kilometers -lrb- 15.5 square miles -rrb- of land have been affected , giving rise to fears that the sludge could eventually pollute the nearby danube river , which courses through three european capitals before flowing into the black sea . " the sludge could reach the -lsb- danube -rsb- in four or five days , " said the deputy chief of the water management company for western hungary , sandor toth , adding that " from the point of view of water management , it 's a catastrophe . " the two-meter -lrb- 6.6-foot -rrb- tide of red toxic sludge killed four people and injured 120 others on tuesday .
eight of the injured are in serious condition and six people remain missing .
officials said on wednesday that the death toll could rise . the european union would be willing to help hungarian authorities should they need assistance in cleaning up the toxic chemical spill , eu spokesman joe hennon said wednesday . further down the danube in romania , the country 's environment ministry said it was monitoring water quality round-the-clock and stressed that the level of pollutants had not crossed the acceptable limits . ' man-made catastrophe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toxic flood killed four people and injured 120 others the area around ajka , in western hungary , was inundated with the sludge after the walls of the ajkai aluminia refinery 's residue reservoir , about 160 kilometers -lrb- 100 miles -rrb- southwest of budapest , broke on monday .
the plant produces alumina , which is used in the smelting of aluminum . the red mud is a toxic residue left over from the plant 's aluminum production .
it is slightly radioactive , highly corrosive and contains toxic heavy metals such as lead , cadmium , arsenic and chromium .
it destroyed all vegetation other than trees and seeped into hundreds of houses in seven villages , leaving residents unsure of when they would be able to return to their homes . " this is an unprecedented incident that affects deeply the ecosystem , wetlands and surface water bodies of the region as well as pointing out the fragility of our drinking water reserves , " gabor figeczky , the deputy country officer of the environmental group wwf hungary , said in a statement . environment state secretary illes said there was suspicion that hungarian aluminum production and trade company -lrb- mal -rrb- , which owns the ajka reservoir , had stored more red sludge in the reservoir than was allowed , and that its walls had displayed stress fractures prior to the spill . mal chief zoltan bakonyi insisted , however , that the company had done nothing wrong , saying the company would suspend all production for the time being . prime minister viktor orban , in a message to the hungarian people on tuesday , sent condolences to the victims ' families and promised a thorough investigation to determine " who is responsible for this man-made catastrophe .

holocaust survivor and israeli journalist noah klieger explains why the ban is justified and does n't hinder reconciliation . the israel chamber orchestra has agreed to perform a work by anti-semitic composer richard wagner -lrb- 1813-1883 -rrb- at next year 's bayreuth festival , although an unofficial boycott of the composer 's music has been observed in israel for over 70 years .
prominent israeli journalist and holocaust survivor noah klieger -lrb- born in 1926 in strasbourg -rrb- explains how the unspoken wagner ban came about in israel and why he is opposed to an israeli orchestra performing wagner 's music . deutsche welle : why are you opposed to the israel chamber orchestra playing wagner at the bayreuth festival ? noah klieger : i 'm against it because i 'm against playing wagner in israel .
wagner was the father of the theory of the races ; he was the first one to claim that there was a master race - the germans - and a low-class race - the jews .
he was the first to explain this in writing .
in 1938 , the symphony orchestra of eretz israel , which later became the israeli philharmonic orchestra , was about to perform wagner in a concert in tel aviv directed by -lsb- arturo -rsb- toscanini .
bronislaw huberman , the man who founded it , decided that the orchestra could not play wagner .
november 8-9 , 1938 was the so-called night of broken glass where the synagogues were destroyed and burned all over germany and austria , thousands of shops were looted and destroyed , hundreds of jews were murdered and tens of thousands of jews were sent to concentration camps .
huberman then realized that -lsb- wagner 's -rsb- theory had been realized by the germans at that time .
so he decided not to play wagner .
then he decided , together with the bosses of the jewish community in palestine - there was no israeli government at that time - to boycott wagner .
this happened before the shoah .
so , of course it was taken over later , because during the shoah it became clear that hitler was a great admirer of wagner .
not only did he adopt his theories , but he adopted his music as well .
the boycott has never been lifted .
it 's true that sometimes directors have tried to perform wagner in israel .
a man who decided to do it was daniel barenboim who , in a concert with a german orchestra , performed wagner , claiming that it was done spontaneously .
but it 's not true - you can not perform spontaneously with an orchestra .
you would say , then , that if the holocaust had not happened , israel would still have a boycott against wagner ? yes , i think so , because the pogroms happened .
it was not decided after the holocaust , it was decided after the pogroms in 1938 . by the way , there is no official ban .
it 's a sentimental ban .
as long as some of us are still alive , people should refrain from imposing wagner on us .
but we 're the not only ones ; there are many , many israelis who were born after the holocaust who are also against wagner for the same reason . how does this younger generation view wagner ? i do n't even know whether the younger generation is very familiar with wagner .
i do n't think that many young people are fond of wagner .
i 'm convinced they 're not . do you think that the israeli orchestra playing in bayreuth could serve as an act of reconciliation ? we do n't need reconciliation with wagner .
we have reconciliation with germany .
we have nothing against the new german generations .
i go to germany very often ; i lecture in germany .
i lecture on the shoah , but this is a different story .
i have no problem whatsoever , because they 're not the same germans .
but wagner is the same wagner - whether it 's today or 100 years ago , it 's the same wagner with the same theory . does the ban apply to any other composers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 night of broken glass was evidence that the nazis 's anti-semitism had turned violent no .
richard strauss was at least as strong an anti-semite as wagner was , but we play strauss . why ? because he is not the father of this -lsb- racial -rsb- theory .
if we banned all anti-semites , we would n't have a lot of writers , poets and composers because most of them were anti-jewish .
i can give you a list of about a hundred .
but we have their books , we read their books , we study their books , we even teach from their books .
the same thing goes for music , but wagner is a different story . have you had the personal experience of listening to wagner 's music ? i know wagner 's music , but i really do n't like this music .
it 's too bombastic for me .
it 's only a joke of course -lsb- laughing -rsb- but it 's music where you can not even sleep in the opera because it 's much too loud . i personally do n't like his music , but i know that he 's a genius without any doubt .
he was one of the greatest composers ever , but this has nothing to do with his theories . interview : kate bowen / ma 'ayan yahbes editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de israeli orchestra breaks boycott to perform at 2011 bayreuth festival in israel , there is an unspoken ban on performing the works of anti-semitic composer richard wagner .
the announcement that an israeli orchestra will perform at the wagner festival in bayreuth has caused a stir at home .
-lrb- 06.10.2010 -rrb- berlin 's jewish museum honors victims of nazis ' forced labor policy during the holocaust , more than 20 million people were subjected to forced labor - a crime that remained unspoken for many years .
this week , the jewish museum in berlin opened a comprehensive exhibition on the issue .

holocaust survivor and israeli journalist noah klieger explains why the ban is justified and does n't hinder reconciliation . the israel chamber orchestra has agreed to perform a work by anti-semitic composer richard wagner -lrb- 1813-1883 -rrb- at next year 's bayreuth festival , although an unofficial boycott of the composer 's music has been observed in israel for over 70 years .
prominent israeli journalist and holocaust survivor noah klieger -lrb- born in 1926 in strasbourg -rrb- explains how the unspoken wagner ban came about in israel and why he is opposed to an israeli orchestra performing wagner 's music . deutsche welle : why are you opposed to the israel chamber orchestra playing wagner at the bayreuth festival ? noah klieger : i 'm against it because i 'm against playing wagner in israel .
wagner was the father of the theory of the races ; he was the first one to claim that there was a master race - the germans - and a low-class race - the jews .
he was the first to explain this in writing .
in 1938 , the symphony orchestra of eretz israel , which later became the israeli philharmonic orchestra , was about to perform wagner in a concert in tel aviv directed by -lsb- arturo -rsb- toscanini .
bronislaw huberman , the man who founded it , decided that the orchestra could not play wagner .
november 8-9 , 1938 was the so-called night of broken glass where the synagogues were destroyed and burned all over germany and austria , thousands of shops were looted and destroyed , hundreds of jews were murdered and tens of thousands of jews were sent to concentration camps .
huberman then realized that -lsb- wagner 's -rsb- theory had been realized by the germans at that time .
so he decided not to play wagner .
then he decided , together with the bosses of the jewish community in palestine - there was no israeli government at that time - to boycott wagner .
this happened before the shoah .
so , of course it was taken over later , because during the shoah it became clear that hitler was a great admirer of wagner .
not only did he adopt his theories , but he adopted his music as well .
the boycott has never been lifted .
it 's true that sometimes directors have tried to perform wagner in israel .
a man who decided to do it was daniel barenboim who , in a concert with a german orchestra , performed wagner , claiming that it was done spontaneously .
but it 's not true - you can not perform spontaneously with an orchestra .
you would say , then , that if the holocaust had not happened , israel would still have a boycott against wagner ? yes , i think so , because the pogroms happened .
it was not decided after the holocaust , it was decided after the pogroms in 1938 . by the way , there is no official ban .
it 's a sentimental ban .
as long as some of us are still alive , people should refrain from imposing wagner on us .
but we 're the not only ones ; there are many , many israelis who were born after the holocaust who are also against wagner for the same reason . how does this younger generation view wagner ? i do n't even know whether the younger generation is very familiar with wagner .
i do n't think that many young people are fond of wagner .
i 'm convinced they 're not . do you think that the israeli orchestra playing in bayreuth could serve as an act of reconciliation ? we do n't need reconciliation with wagner .
we have reconciliation with germany .
we have nothing against the new german generations .
i go to germany very often ; i lecture in germany .
i lecture on the shoah , but this is a different story .
i have no problem whatsoever , because they 're not the same germans .
but wagner is the same wagner - whether it 's today or 100 years ago , it 's the same wagner with the same theory . does the ban apply to any other composers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 night of broken glass was evidence that the nazis 's anti-semitism had turned violent no .
richard strauss was at least as strong an anti-semite as wagner was , but we play strauss . why ? because he is not the father of this -lsb- racial -rsb- theory .
if we banned all anti-semites , we would n't have a lot of writers , poets and composers because most of them were anti-jewish .
i can give you a list of about a hundred .
but we have their books , we read their books , we study their books , we even teach from their books .
the same thing goes for music , but wagner is a different story . have you had the personal experience of listening to wagner 's music ? i know wagner 's music , but i really do n't like this music .
it 's too bombastic for me .
it 's only a joke of course -lsb- laughing -rsb- but it 's music where you can not even sleep in the opera because it 's much too loud . i personally do n't like his music , but i know that he 's a genius without any doubt .

holocaust survivor and israeli journalist noah klieger explains why the ban is justified and does n't hinder reconciliation . the israel chamber orchestra has agreed to perform a work by anti-semitic composer richard wagner -lrb- 1813-1883 -rrb- at next year 's bayreuth festival , although an unofficial boycott of the composer 's music has been observed in israel for over 70 years .
prominent israeli journalist and holocaust survivor noah klieger -lrb- born in 1926 in strasbourg -rrb- explains how the unspoken wagner ban came about in israel and why he is opposed to an israeli orchestra performing wagner 's music . deutsche welle : why are you opposed to the israel chamber orchestra playing wagner at the bayreuth festival ? noah klieger : i 'm against it because i 'm against playing wagner in israel .
wagner was the father of the theory of the races ; he was the first one to claim that there was a master race - the germans - and a low-class race - the jews .
he was the first to explain this in writing .
in 1938 , the symphony orchestra of eretz israel , which later became the israeli philharmonic orchestra , was about to perform wagner in a concert in tel aviv directed by -lsb- arturo -rsb- toscanini .
bronislaw huberman , the man who founded it , decided that the orchestra could not play wagner .
november 8-9 , 1938 was the so-called night of broken glass where the synagogues were destroyed and burned all over germany and austria , thousands of shops were looted and destroyed , hundreds of jews were murdered and tens of thousands of jews were sent to concentration camps .
huberman then realized that -lsb- wagner 's -rsb- theory had been realized by the germans at that time .
so he decided not to play wagner .
then he decided , together with the bosses of the jewish community in palestine - there was no israeli government at that time - to boycott wagner .
this happened before the shoah .
so , of course it was taken over later , because during the shoah it became clear that hitler was a great admirer of wagner .
not only did he adopt his theories , but he adopted his music as well .
the boycott has never been lifted .
it 's true that sometimes directors have tried to perform wagner in israel .
a man who decided to do it was daniel barenboim who , in a concert with a german orchestra , performed wagner , claiming that it was done spontaneously .
but it 's not true - you can not perform spontaneously with an orchestra .
you would say , then , that if the holocaust had not happened , israel would still have a boycott against wagner ? yes , i think so , because the pogroms happened .
it was not decided after the holocaust , it was decided after the pogroms in 1938 . by the way , there is no official ban .
it 's a sentimental ban .
as long as some of us are still alive , people should refrain from imposing wagner on us .
but we 're the not only ones ; there are many , many israelis who were born after the holocaust who are also against wagner for the same reason . how does this younger generation view wagner ? i do n't even know whether the younger generation is very familiar with wagner .
i do n't think that many young people are fond of wagner .
i 'm convinced they 're not . do you think that the israeli orchestra playing in bayreuth could serve as an act of reconciliation ? we do n't need reconciliation with wagner .
we have reconciliation with germany .
we have nothing against the new german generations .
i go to germany very often ; i lecture in germany .
i lecture on the shoah , but this is a different story .
i have no problem whatsoever , because they 're not the same germans .
but wagner is the same wagner - whether it 's today or 100 years ago , it 's the same wagner with the same theory . does the ban apply to any other composers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 night of broken glass was evidence that the nazis 's anti-semitism had turned violent no .
richard strauss was at least as strong an anti-semite as wagner was , but we play strauss . why ? because he is not the father of this -lsb- racial -rsb- theory .
if we banned all anti-semites , we would n't have a lot of writers , poets and composers because most of them were anti-jewish .
i can give you a list of about a hundred .
but we have their books , we read their books , we study their books , we even teach from their books .
the same thing goes for music , but wagner is a different story . have you had the personal experience of listening to wagner 's music ? i know wagner 's music , but i really do n't like this music .
it 's too bombastic for me .
it 's only a joke of course -lsb- laughing -rsb- but it 's music where you can not even sleep in the opera because it 's much too loud . i personally do n't like his music , but i know that he 's a genius without any doubt .

ít is expected to take effect as of july 1 , 2011 , after ratification by the parliaments .
most ambitious free trade deal ever for eu barroso called it " by far the most important trade deal ever concluded by the eu with one country . "
it is hoped that the fta will boost bilateral trade by as much as 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- annually .
import tariffs to the tune of three billion euros a year will be scrapped and after a transition period , almost no tariffs will remain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will soon be more korean cars like the hyundai ix35 on europe 's roads the car sector in particular is expected to profit from the deal , with european high-end cars and south korean small cars getting easier access to each other 's markets .
italy blocked the deal for months after it was negotiated last year , fearing a negative impact for its carmaker fiat .
but it was persuaded to drop its objections in september .
way around wto stalemate the agreement is particularly significant at a time when talks for further global trade liberalization under the wto umbrella have been stalled .
bilateral ftas are seen by many as an important path to higher growth to overcome the economic crisis .
the 27-member eu is hoping to conclude a number of ftas with other asian nations in the near future .
negotiations are already under way with india and singapore and are starting with malaysia .
at the asem summit in brussels this week , japan also expressed its interest in a similar agreement .

it came at a time when europe , too , was undergoing political change . ludwig van beethoven -lrb- 1770-1827 -rrb- symphony no. 3 in e-flat major , op .
55 -lrb- eroica -rrb- bamberg symphony orchestra conductor : jonathan nott mp3 recorded by deutschlandfunk on october 3 , 2010 in the beethoven hall , bonn . when napoleon bonaparte crowned himself emperor in paris ' notre dame cathedral in late 1804 , beethoven was in the process of composing his third symphony , in e-flat major .
the composer had been a supporter of napoleon and planned to dedicate the massive orchestral work to him .
but , as the story goes , when beethoven heard the news of the self-coronation , he was furious and scratched out the dedication . though the composer 's admiration for napoleon never completely dwindled , his great e-flat symphony was published with the title it is known under today : " sinfonia eroica - composed to celebrate the memory of a great man . " the symphony superseded all of beethoven 's previous orchestral works in length , complexity , form and virtuosity .
as with most ground-breaking works , the eroica symphony was initially pelted with criticism upon its premiere in vienna in 1805 . it is performed here by the bamberg symphony orchestra under the direction of their chief conductor , jonathan nott .
originally from the uk , nott has directed the bavarian orchestra since 2000 , bringing it to both national and international acclaim . author : kate bowen -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 06.10.2010 venice continues work on massive flood protection project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice scientists say high water events are increasing the mose flood gates aim to stave off potential disaster in the city and the larger venice lagoon when the adriatic sea surges .
local scientists say that such events are on the rise in recent years . last month , under the bright summer italian sun , tourists rolled up their trousers and waded through water in front of the centuries-old basilica on venice 's famous piazza san marco .
this was one of the most recent occurances of " acqua alta , " or " high water , " a term used in the veneto region for the exceptional tide peaks occurring in the adriatic sea , which reaching their maximum in the venetian lagoon , invade the foundations and inundate the older and lower parts of venice .
according to the technicians at the city 's tide monitoring and forecast center , these high water events are becoming more frequent and last a longer time .
" the worry is that the increase in the frequency of these high water events does n't show any sign of slowing down , " said paolo canestrelli , the center 's director said in a recent interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's increasing at an almost exponential rate . "
canestrelli cited various reasons for this , one of which he says is climate change .
he added that the fluctuating environment has caused rising sea levels and more frequent storm surges .
plus , he noted , the land the city sits on is also sinking - it 's estimated venice has sunk at least 23 centimeters -lrb- 9.05 inches -rrb- in the past century .
but whatever the reason , the data speaks for itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's tide monitoring and forecast center said that 2009 was a record year for high water a ' record ' year according to canestrelli , 2009 was a record flood year in venice - the worst in more than a century .
the tide reached 80 centimeters , flooding large parts of piazza san marco , more than 125 times .
it reached 110 centimeters , and so invaded large parts of city 16 times .
in the decades since venice began officially recording the " acqua alta " measurements in the early twentieth century , tides of greater than 110 centimeters occurred on an average three or four times a year .
this year , 2010 , canestrelli says , already promises to be worse .
" i think that this year we 'll reach a record higher than that of last year , " he warned in september .
" we 've already had 102 cases of water higher than 80 cm .
so already 102 times , piazza san marco has seen water and there 's still four months to go . "
a decades-old plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mose project encompasses 78 floodgates to block the inlets when the tide reaches over 110 centimeters that 's why now , more than ever , the city needs a huge barrier to protect itself .
the mose project , an italian acronym for " experimental electromechanical module " - and an allusion to moses , who parted the red sea - is intended to protect the city from exceptional high water events .
work has been underway on the project since 2003 and engineers recently estimated that it still wo n't be completed for a number of years to come .
mose provides for 78 floodgates that will rise and block the three inlets connecting venice with the adriatic sea , when a tide of 110 centimetres or more is forecast .
when the alarm sounds , compressed air will fill the gates and empty them of water .
they 'll rotate around their hinges , emerge from the depths and cut off the lagoon from the sea , stopping the tidal flow .
at the lido inlet , the widest of venice 's three entrances to the sea , workers are building the concrete " caissons " or containers that will house 20 of those floodgates , each larger than the wing of a 747 .
but it will be four more years before mose is able to protect venice – two years longer than originally expected , and venetians have been waiting for decades before that .
it was the great flood of 1966 , causing the lagoon to rise almost two meters above its normal levels , which focused attention on the danger to the city .
in 1987 , a consortium of italian companies , the consorzio venezia nuova , was entrusted with finding a solution .
but it was n't until 2003 that construction actually began . " two thirds of the work has been completed now and we 're waiting for remaining 25 percent of the money to do the remaining , " said giovanni cecconi , a consorzio hydrologist .
" from a technical point of view we are pretty much on schedule , and the only risk of delay can come from financing .
by the year 2014 , all the four barriers will start operation , if the money will come . " a multi-billion euro project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget of this massive construction project has ballooned to over 4.5 billion euros mose is the largest public works scheme in italian history , involving 3,000 workers spread over several sites .
its budget has blown out from three billion to more than four and half billion euros .
critics fear it could cost taxpayers close to double that in the end .
at the lido inlet construction site , cecconi is also keen to trumpet mose 's green credentials as the project has long been the target of conservationists .
they say the lagoon is one of the most important wetlands in western europe and the tidal exchange with the sea is essential to its well-being .
cecconi pointed out that the gates can be deployed just partially to minimise the effect on the environment .
" we leave the tidal flow in and out of the lagoon available all the time , but not during the storm surges , so -lrb- we 'll deploy them -rrb- just three to five times a year , for three to four hours , " he said . but cecconi 's comments do n't mollify guido ortalli of italia nostra , a group of citizens concerned to protect italy 's cultural heritage . he describes the project as " very heavy , very costly and technically complicated " and involving " really high maintenance costs . " whatever the objections , most people agree that something must be done , or one of civilization 's most beautiful locations may simply sink beneath the waves .
still , for many in venice , the work on defending the city ca n't finish soon enough .

local scientists say that such events are on the rise in recent years . last month , under the bright summer italian sun , tourists rolled up their trousers and waded through water in front of the centuries-old basilica on venice 's famous piazza san marco .
this was one of the most recent occurances of " acqua alta , " or " high water , " a term used in the veneto region for the exceptional tide peaks occurring in the adriatic sea , which reaching their maximum in the venetian lagoon , invade the foundations and inundate the older and lower parts of venice .
according to the technicians at the city 's tide monitoring and forecast center , these high water events are becoming more frequent and last a longer time .
" the worry is that the increase in the frequency of these high water events does n't show any sign of slowing down , " said paolo canestrelli , the center 's director said in a recent interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's increasing at an almost exponential rate . "
canestrelli cited various reasons for this , one of which he says is climate change .
he added that the fluctuating environment has caused rising sea levels and more frequent storm surges .

chinese premier wen jiabao was in berlin after an eu-asia summit produced mixed results . germany has agreed to forge closer economic ties with china and press beijing 's case to be recognized as a market economy by the european union .
chancellor angela merkel met chinese premier wen jiabao at the meseberg palace near berlin following an eu-asia summit in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and wen met to build on discussions in brussels a joint statement issued by the german and chinese delegations after the meeting said that both leaders supported " strengthening european-chinese economic relations and want to encourage them through consultation and building up cooperation . "
it said there was a need for china and the eu to strengthen mutual political confidence and deepen strategic co-operation . "
the statement said that germany would work to get the european union to recognize china as a market economy by 2016 , giving the country certain benefits under international trade rules .
leaders at the summit in brussels had earlier reached broad agreement on reforms to help stabilize the international economy .
however , efforts to gain concessions from china to allow a more rapid appreciation in the value of the yuan appear to have failed .
changes in global economy the biennial asia europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- brought together 27 eu and 19 asian leaders , with agreement that reforms were needed to keep pace with changes in the world economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 is to discuss issues such as financial regulation " the priority is now to reach agreement on a system of global financial , monetary and economic governance : we have to act together very closely on this , " said summit chairman and president of the european council herman van rompuy .
leaders from the nations represented , 12 of which are members of the g20 group of leading economies , agreed that the next g20 summit in the south korean capital , seoul , next month should address a range of issues .
issues up for discussion at that summit include ensuring better government spending control and tighter regulation of the financial industry .
states also moved closer to a firm deal on the redistribution of voting rights within international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , for which european states retain disproportionate power compared with asian states .
a broad agreement on the need for reform was reached , although disagreements remained on the precise details .
no movement on chinese currency european nations also pressed - without success - for a china to allow its currency , the yuan , to increase in value , amid charges that beijing is deliberately devaluing its money to aid its export industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western countries say the yuan is being kept artificially low the chairman of eurozone finance ministers , jean-claude juncker said euro nations had urged an " orderly , significant and broad-based appreciation " of the yuan .
when asked about the chinese response , juncker said .
" the chinese authorities do not share our view . "
leaders also pledged to seek an urgent , legally-binding deal on global warming at united nations climate talks in cancun , mexico , beginning next month .
the german and chinese negotiations also touched on climate change , with both countries saying that they hoped progress would be made at the talks .
recognition of china as a market economy would make it less vulnerable to charges that it is dumping products onto global markets against world trade organization rules .

it came at a time when europe , too , was undergoing political change . ludwig van beethoven -lrb- 1770-1827 -rrb- symphony no. 3 in e-flat major , op .
55 -lrb- eroica -rrb- bamberg symphony orchestra conductor : jonathan nott mp3 recorded by deutschlandfunk on october 3 , 2010 in the beethoven hall , bonn . when napoleon bonaparte crowned himself emperor in paris ' notre dame cathedral in late 1804 , beethoven was in the process of composing his third symphony , in e-flat major .
the composer had been a supporter of napoleon and planned to dedicate the massive orchestral work to him .
but , as the story goes , when beethoven heard the news of the self-coronation , he was furious and scratched out the dedication . though the composer 's admiration for napoleon never completely dwindled , his great e-flat symphony was published with the title it is known under today : " sinfonia eroica - composed to celebrate the memory of a great man . " the symphony superseded all of beethoven 's previous orchestral works in length , complexity , form and virtuosity .
as with most ground-breaking works , the eroica symphony was initially pelted with criticism upon its premiere in vienna in 1805 . it is performed here by the bamberg symphony orchestra under the direction of their chief conductor , jonathan nott .
originally from the uk , nott has directed the bavarian orchestra since 2000 , bringing it to both national and international acclaim . author : kate bowen -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fears have been raised that the sludge could pollute the nearby danube , an important european waterway . hungary declared a state of emergency on tuesday after a toxic sludge spill swamped seven villages in what officials called the worst chemical accident in the country 's history . up to 40 square kilometers -lrb- 15.5 square miles -rrb- of land have been affected , giving rise to fears that the sludge could eventually pollute the nearby danube river , which courses through three european capitals before flowing into the black sea . " the sludge could reach the -lsb- danube -rsb- in four or five days , " said the deputy chief of the water management company for western hungary , sandor toth , adding that " from the point of view of water management , it 's a catastrophe . " the two-meter -lrb- 6.6-foot -rrb- tide of red toxic sludge killed four people and injured 120 others on tuesday .
eight of the injured are in serious condition and six people remain missing .
officials said on wednesday that the death toll could rise . the european union would be willing to help hungarian authorities should they need assistance in cleaning up the toxic chemical spill , eu spokesman joe hennon said wednesday . further down the danube in romania , the country 's environment ministry said it was monitoring water quality round-the-clock and stressed that the level of pollutants had not crossed the acceptable limits . ' man-made catastrophe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toxic flood killed four people and injured 120 others the area around ajka , in western hungary , was inundated with the sludge after the walls of the ajkai aluminia refinery 's residue reservoir , about 160 kilometers -lrb- 100 miles -rrb- southwest of budapest , broke on monday .
the plant produces alumina , which is used in the smelting of aluminum . the red mud is a toxic residue left over from the plant 's aluminum production .
it is slightly radioactive , highly corrosive and contains toxic heavy metals such as lead , cadmium , arsenic and chromium .
it destroyed all vegetation other than trees and seeped into hundreds of houses in seven villages , leaving residents unsure of when they would be able to return to their homes . " this is an unprecedented incident that affects deeply the ecosystem , wetlands and surface water bodies of the region as well as pointing out the fragility of our drinking water reserves , " gabor figeczky , the deputy country officer of the environmental group wwf hungary , said in a statement . environment state secretary illes said there was suspicion that hungarian aluminum production and trade company -lrb- mal -rrb- , which owns the ajka reservoir , had stored more red sludge in the reservoir than was allowed , and that its walls had displayed stress fractures prior to the spill . mal chief zoltan bakonyi insisted , however , that the company had done nothing wrong , saying the company would suspend all production for the time being . prime minister viktor orban , in a message to the hungarian people on tuesday , sent condolences to the victims ' families and promised a thorough investigation to determine " who is responsible for this man-made catastrophe .

curtains and clothing hung out to dry on clotheslines flap in the breeze .
many of the tenants here are roma from romania who entered germany with a tourist visa and would like to stay .
cristina nastase , 32 , is also romanian , an education welfare officer who helps roma and migrant workers .
angela and her two-year-old son , david , appear at the door , cristina greets them , and they all walk to the boy 's new kindergarten .
it 's a completely new experience for mother and son .
only the other day , they were out on the streets begging , like many of the roma here .

cristina nastase and one other co-worker were sent by the berlin-based organization " southeast europe culture " to do community outreach .
funding comes from local government .
kindergarten teacher barbara thorm accepted david under the condition that cristina accompanied mother and son during the first week , helping with translations and explaining , for instance , the importance of punctuality .

cristina asks a roma woman carrying a small child whether she needs help .
in next to no time , the outreach worker is surrounded by roma women .
" they are very open , " cristina says .
" you only need to show an interest in their concerns . "
today the women clamor to have their pictures taken so they can send them home to romania .
for the next 15 minutes or so , they have fun taking photos - a regular part of cristina 's job .
but the regular requests for money , a job or an apartment are not as easy for cristina to fulfill - for lack of funds and time .
the project is scheduled to end in december , but she is hopeful that berlin 's roma outreach project will be extended .

an investment company holding 150,000 postbank shares is prepared to file a legal complaint protesting deutsche bank ’ s offer . deutsche bank announced in september it would offer smaller postbank shareholders who hold what 's called the free float 25 euros per share as part of an effort to consolidate control over postbank by increasing its 29.95 percent stake .
now , one of those small shareholders , dusseldorf-based effecten-spiegel , is close to filing a legal complaint once the offer is made official .
germany 's financial regulator bafin had allowed for the shares to be sold at 25 euros , based on a three-month average .
deutsche bank intends to fund the purchase through 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.1bn -rrb- in capital , raised by issuing 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros each .
law circumvented ?
marlis weidtmann , executive director of effecten-spiegel , which holds 150,000 postbank shares , says deutsche bank is trying to circumvent laws regulating takeovers .
deutsche bank has had a multi-tiered agreement with postbank 's owner , deutsche post , since january 2009 , in which it agreed to buy the former parent company 's 27.4 percent stake for 45 euros a share .
but those shares wo n't actually change hands until 2012 , leaving deutsche bank with less than 30 percent ownership of postbank for now and thus free to buy shares for 25 euros each – their average value over the last three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and postbank have long gone hand-in-hand weidtmann added that the details of the agreement have never been made completely public , but that independent calculations based on widely available information show the shares would be worth at least 36 euros each , if it were to be legally acknowledged that deutsche bank has more than a 30 percent stake in postbank .
“ it makes us suspicious , because we have to ask ourselves , ‘ what 's written in there ? ' ”
weidtmann told deutsche welle .
“ what surprises me is that bafin has played along thus far . ”
a ‘ soap bubble ' bonn-based lawyer wienand meilicke , who co-authored the report published in the trade journal zip , which valued the postbank shares at 36 euros , says “ a whole lot of people ” will be short-changed through deutsche bank 's plans .
“ if someone sticks a needle in this thing the soap bubble will pop , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ i am of the opinion that there is a significant chance this case will be successful in court .
but that means fighting the german banking establishment . ”
according to weidtmann , deutsche bank has so far defended its plans by “ always pulling back and making the argument that the shares wo n't change hands until 2012 . ”
tight-lipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and deutsche bank have angered smaller shareholders a deutsche bank spokesman told deutsche welle the bank “ sees no legal grounds for the complaint . ”
he referred to the position taken by frankfurt-based law firm hengeler mueller which , in a january 2009 press release , spoke of having advised deutsche bank on an “ improved transaction structure ” for its acquisition of postbank shares .
a hengeler mueller spokesman , however , declined to comment .
postbank has 24 million retail clients – more than any other bank in germany – and deutsche bank has been working to increase its number of domestic customers .
also , banks will soon be required to hold more capital to safeguard against future financial crises under the new basel iii accord , which will come into force in 2012 .
acquiring postbank will likely help deutsche bank meet those requirements .

a campaigner for west african integration , chambas said he would continue promoting good governance , peace and security . regarded as a campaigner for west african integration , a reformer and supporter of good governance on the continent , mohamed ibn chambas was awarded the german africa prize on wednesday . after serving abroad in the diplomatic corps , chambas returned to ghana in the 1980s and pushed for democracy to be established once the one-party system was done away with in 1992 . " i take it as an encouragement to continue to do the work that i have committed myself to , " he told deutsche welle .
" to improve the conditions in africa and to make a contribution to improve governance , peace and security on the continent .
to promote economic development , but especially to see what i can do to continue to work for the deepening of regional integration . " he would eventually become a member of parliament and move up the ranks to deputy minister for foreign policy and educational policy . west african integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecowas members agreed to good governance measures but do n't always meet their goals chambas was awarded the prize this year for his work while head of the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- .
it 's an organization that is growing in significance , he said . " this is an organization which has an important role to play in the region , " he said .
" it 's about good governance , peace and security .
we are talking about a borderless west africa and creating societies in which the democratic rights of the people are respected . " he said ecowas has become important in ensuring stability in the region and in setting minimum standards of governance - including respect for human rights and ensuring that governments are accountable . but it 's no easy task .
the 15 nations that make up the group run the gamut in economic terms from resource-rich nigeria with a population of 150 million to ivory coast , whose economy has been crippled by political crisis .
sierra leone and liberia as well as benin and togo are also members of the economic area . using the european union as one of its models , ecowas maintains its own peacekeeping force , a parliament and its own west african court .
the organization also works to deepen the region 's democratic culture and ensure elections meet certain minimum acceptable standards , chambas said . " let 's face it , the democracies are young .
they are young , growing democracies .
there are still many problems dealing with elections and good practices , " he said .

it says quieter ways of conducting business at sea are already at hand . underwater noise is more than just pollution – it 's a killer .
this is the message the whale and dolphin conservation society hopes to spread with " sonar sucks , " a campaign launched in germany this week to raise awareness of the impact of underwater noise on sea mammals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sound travels more effectively under water than above the whale and dolphin conservation society -lrb- wdcs -rrb- has called for a range of noise-fighting measures to be implemented , including an international moratorium on low- and medium-frequency military sonar equipment , and on oil and gas development of the arctic region , saying underwater noise pollution created by those activities is putting entire aquatic populations at risk .
" it 's the old fashioned out of sight , out of mind – the way that we used to talk about chemical pollution is now the way that we start to look at noise pollution , " mark simmonds , the wdcs international director of science , told deutsche welle .
seeing by hearing whales , dolphins and porpoises rely on hearing for most of their basic needs : they use sonar to communicate , to orient themselves , to find food and mates .
man-made noise can drown out the sounds the mammals rely on day to day with consequences ranging from loss of habitat to death – and according to the wdcs , that noise is increasing .
" the equivalent would be losing your sight and going blind for us … and worse , in some of the noisier areas , " simmonds said .
noise disturbances can cause marine mammals to alter their behavior and abandon breeding and feeding areas , cause injury and lead to whales and dolphins beaching .
in a statement released by the german branch of the wdcs , the organization said that military sonar , marine construction and development , seismic exploration by the oil and gas industry , and the increasing number of ships in the world ’ s oceans are all helping to create an increasingly disorienting environment for the world ’ s cetaceans .
government inaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : offshore wind parks generate noise during their construction , not operation animal welfare groups say the effect of noise on marine mammals has been well documented but that governments have taken little heed .
" as far back as 2004 an historic european parliamentary resolution called on the eu member states to restrict the use of high-intensity sonar but sadly too little has been done , " international fund for animal welfare european union director lesley o 'donnell said .
" eu member states have a clear obligation to protect whales and their habitats from ocean noise which can disturb , injure and even kill whales and other marine species even after it has travelled tremendous distances . "
human activities like construction and oil drilling can create noise levels over 260 decibels – louder than a rocket taking off – and because noise travels differently underwater than through the air , the effects can be felt even hundreds of kilometers from the source .
" low-frequency active sonar from the military can range in distance from 1000 to 1500 kilometers -lsb- through water -rsb- , " wdcs germany conservation manager karsten brenning said .
" that would mean that if you would switch on -lrb- an equivalent above-water -rrb- device in moscow , it would be difficult to have a conversation on german streets . "
problem of wind parks the wdcs pointed to increasing arctic development and a growing amount of energy-related construction at sea as particular areas of concern .
seismic studies , in which sound waves are used to provide information on potential gas and oil deposits on the ocean floor , are being undertaken in designated whale sanctuaries , including the dogger bank and the moray firth in the north sea .
the latter may become home to a major wind farm if a recent proposal from consortium moray offshore renewables goes ahead .
" there 's a lot of development going on in the seas of europe that hasn ’ t been going on before , " simmonds said .
" as people who are essentially environmentalists at heart we like renewable energy … but it ’ s the way that these things are being constructed and fixed into the seabed , the hammering , the pile-driving , this is a very loud source of noise . "
technical solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly stealthy submarines prove ships can be made quieter , says the wdcs the wdcs said new technologies and alternative methods could make industry more environmentally friendly at sea .
simmonds pointed to the use of " bubble curtains " or " jackets " to disrupt the spread of noise that occurs when hammering pylons into place .
he also pointed to the great advances in submarine stealth technology that have been made , saying that these offered great cross-over potential for reducing the impact of ship 's engines .
in terms of noise generated by surveys for resources beneath the seabed , karsten brenning suggested more focus on " passive " seismic surveying , which is more like listening to the seabed than bouncing sound off it .
" there are technological mechanisms coming along but we need more investment and more focus on those , " simmonds said .

it says quieter ways of conducting business at sea are already at hand . underwater noise is more than just pollution – it 's a killer .
this is the message the whale and dolphin conservation society hopes to spread with " sonar sucks , " a campaign launched in germany this week to raise awareness of the impact of underwater noise on sea mammals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sound travels more effectively under water than above the whale and dolphin conservation society -lrb- wdcs -rrb- has called for a range of noise-fighting measures to be implemented , including an international moratorium on low- and medium-frequency military sonar equipment , and on oil and gas development of the arctic region , saying underwater noise pollution created by those activities is putting entire aquatic populations at risk .
" it 's the old fashioned out of sight , out of mind – the way that we used to talk about chemical pollution is now the way that we start to look at noise pollution , " mark simmonds , the wdcs international director of science , told deutsche welle .
seeing by hearing whales , dolphins and porpoises rely on hearing for most of their basic needs : they use sonar to communicate , to orient themselves , to find food and mates .
man-made noise can drown out the sounds the mammals rely on day to day with consequences ranging from loss of habitat to death – and according to the wdcs , that noise is increasing .
" the equivalent would be losing your sight and going blind for us … and worse , in some of the noisier areas , " simmonds said .
noise disturbances can cause marine mammals to alter their behavior and abandon breeding and feeding areas , cause injury and lead to whales and dolphins beaching .
in a statement released by the german branch of the wdcs , the organization said that military sonar , marine construction and development , seismic exploration by the oil and gas industry , and the increasing number of ships in the world ’ s oceans are all helping to create an increasingly disorienting environment for the world ’ s cetaceans .
government inaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : offshore wind parks generate noise during their construction , not operation animal welfare groups say the effect of noise on marine mammals has been well documented but that governments have taken little heed .
" as far back as 2004 an historic european parliamentary resolution called on the eu member states to restrict the use of high-intensity sonar but sadly too little has been done , " international fund for animal welfare european union director lesley o 'donnell said .
" eu member states have a clear obligation to protect whales and their habitats from ocean noise which can disturb , injure and even kill whales and other marine species even after it has travelled tremendous distances . "
human activities like construction and oil drilling can create noise levels over 260 decibels – louder than a rocket taking off – and because noise travels differently underwater than through the air , the effects can be felt even hundreds of kilometers from the source .
" low-frequency active sonar from the military can range in distance from 1000 to 1500 kilometers -lsb- through water -rsb- , " wdcs germany conservation manager karsten brenning said .
" that would mean that if you would switch on -lrb- an equivalent above-water -rrb- device in moscow , it would be difficult to have a conversation on german streets . "
problem of wind parks the wdcs pointed to increasing arctic development and a growing amount of energy-related construction at sea as particular areas of concern .
seismic studies , in which sound waves are used to provide information on potential gas and oil deposits on the ocean floor , are being undertaken in designated whale sanctuaries , including the dogger bank and the moray firth in the north sea .
the latter may become home to a major wind farm if a recent proposal from consortium moray offshore renewables goes ahead .
" there 's a lot of development going on in the seas of europe that hasn ’ t been going on before , " simmonds said .
" as people who are essentially environmentalists at heart we like renewable energy … but it ’ s the way that these things are being constructed and fixed into the seabed , the hammering , the pile-driving , this is a very loud source of noise . "
technical solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly stealthy submarines prove ships can be made quieter , says the wdcs the wdcs said new technologies and alternative methods could make industry more environmentally friendly at sea .
simmonds pointed to the use of " bubble curtains " or " jackets " to disrupt the spread of noise that occurs when hammering pylons into place .
he also pointed to the great advances in submarine stealth technology that have been made , saying that these offered great cross-over potential for reducing the impact of ship 's engines .
in terms of noise generated by surveys for resources beneath the seabed , karsten brenning suggested more focus on " passive " seismic surveying , which is more like listening to the seabed than bouncing sound off it .
" there are technological mechanisms coming along but we need more investment and more focus on those , " simmonds said .

it 's set to start the ball rolling for similar agreements with other asian countries . the european union and south korea signed a record free-trade agreement in brussels on wednesday .
it 's expected to cut around 3 billion euros ' -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- worth of tariffs and lift administrative barriers and regulations on goods ranging from cars to whisky .
" this agreement is by far the most important trade deal ever concluded be the european union with one country and the first free trade deal with an asian country , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso .
the accord is set to take effect on july 1 , 2011 , once ratified by the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's luxury car industry may cash in on the deal the deal could double trade between europe and south korea by boosting business by 30 billion euros a year .
" the pact sends a strong signal that trade liberalization is a key element for recovery of the world economy , " said eu president herman van rompuy .
the eu runs a deficit with south korea in goods trade , although trends suggest the korean market offers significant growth potential for european firms .
expanding trade with asia the eu hopes that trade liberalization will broaden its influence in asia .
lifting customs duties on imported goods will make imported south korean products cheaper in the eu and eu goods cheaper in south korea .
europe 's spirits industry welcomed the deal for its potential in boosting sales of eu-produced drinks such as scotch whisky and french cognac .
the german luxury car and meat industries also hope to benefit from this arrangement .
italy was initially hesitant about the deal , fearing its national carmaker , fiat , could be outdone by south korea 's kia und hyundai car manufacturers .
but the country dropped its veto in return for delaying the treaty 's implementation until july 1 .
tariffs on some goods , such as small cars , will continue for up to five years thereafter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rompuy : free trade will help economic recovery the eu deal with south korea could trigger a rush among asian states to enter trade pacts with the 27-nation bloc . japan is keen to have better access to european markets .
on tuesday , japanese officials said that they hoped to start free-trade talks with the eu in the spring , partly in reaction to the korean agreement .
as japan and korea are competitors in several industries , japanese manufacturers stand to lose market share in europe 's automotive and electronics markets .
malaysian diplomats said that they , too , had agreed to open free-trade negotiations with the eu .

chinese premier wen jiabao was in berlin after an eu-asia summit produced mixed results . germany has agreed to forge closer economic ties with china and press beijing 's case to be recognized as a market economy by the european union .
chancellor angela merkel met chinese premier wen jiabao at the meseberg palace near berlin following an eu-asia summit in brussels .

"
it said there was a need for china and the eu to strengthen mutual political confidence and deepen strategic co-operation . "
the statement said that germany would work to get the european union to recognize china as a market economy by 2016 , giving the country certain benefits under international trade rules .
leaders at the summit in brussels had earlier reached broad agreement on reforms to help stabilize the international economy .
however , efforts to gain concessions from china to allow a more rapid appreciation in the value of the yuan appear to have failed .
changes in global economy the biennial asia europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- brought together 27 eu and 19 asian leaders , with agreement that reforms were needed to keep pace with changes in the world economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 is to discuss issues such as financial regulation " the priority is now to reach agreement on a system of global financial , monetary and economic governance : we have to act together very closely on this , " said summit chairman and president of the european council herman van rompuy .
leaders from the nations represented , 12 of which are members of the g20 group of leading economies , agreed that the next g20 summit in the south korean capital , seoul , next month should address a range of issues .
issues up for discussion at that summit include ensuring better government spending control and tighter regulation of the financial industry .
states also moved closer to a firm deal on the redistribution of voting rights within international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , for which european states retain disproportionate power compared with asian states .
a broad agreement on the need for reform was reached , although disagreements remained on the precise details .
no movement on chinese currency european nations also pressed - without success - for a china to allow its currency , the yuan , to increase in value , amid charges that beijing is deliberately devaluing its money to aid its export industry .

" the chinese authorities do not share our view . "
leaders also pledged to seek an urgent , legally-binding deal on global warming at united nations climate talks in cancun , mexico , beginning next month .
the german and chinese negotiations also touched on climate change , with both countries saying that they hoped progress would be made at the talks .
recognition of china as a market economy would make it less vulnerable to charges that it is dumping products onto global markets against world trade organization rules .

it 's set to start the ball rolling for similar agreements with other asian countries . the european union and south korea signed a record free-trade agreement in brussels on wednesday .
it 's expected to cut around 3 billion euros ' -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- worth of tariffs and lift administrative barriers and regulations on goods ranging from cars to whisky .
" this agreement is by far the most important trade deal ever concluded be the european union with one country and the first free trade deal with an asian country , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso .
the accord is set to take effect on july 1 , 2011 , once ratified by the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's luxury car industry may cash in on the deal the deal could double trade between europe and south korea by boosting business by 30 billion euros a year .
" the pact sends a strong signal that trade liberalization is a key element for recovery of the world economy , " said eu president herman van rompuy .
the eu runs a deficit with south korea in goods trade , although trends suggest the korean market offers significant growth potential for european firms .
expanding trade with asia the eu hopes that trade liberalization will broaden its influence in asia .
lifting customs duties on imported goods will make imported south korean products cheaper in the eu and eu goods cheaper in south korea .
europe 's spirits industry welcomed the deal for its potential in boosting sales of eu-produced drinks such as scotch whisky and french cognac .
the german luxury car and meat industries also hope to benefit from this arrangement .
italy was initially hesitant about the deal , fearing its national carmaker , fiat , could be outdone by south korea 's kia und hyundai car manufacturers .
but the country dropped its veto in return for delaying the treaty 's implementation until july 1 .
tariffs on some goods , such as small cars , will continue for up to five years thereafter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rompuy : free trade will help economic recovery the eu deal with south korea could trigger a rush among asian states to enter trade pacts with the 27-nation bloc . japan is keen to have better access to european markets .
on tuesday , japanese officials said that they hoped to start free-trade talks with the eu in the spring , partly in reaction to the korean agreement .
as japan and korea are competitors in several industries , japanese manufacturers stand to lose market share in europe 's automotive and electronics markets .
malaysian diplomats said that they , too , had agreed to open free-trade negotiations with the eu .

prominent israeli journalist and holocaust survivor noah klieger -lrb- born in 1926 in strasbourg -rrb- explains how the unspoken wagner ban came about in israel and why he is opposed to an israeli orchestra performing wagner 's music . deutsche welle : why are you opposed to the israel chamber orchestra playing wagner at the bayreuth festival ? noah klieger : i 'm against it because i 'm against playing wagner in israel .
wagner was the father of the theory of the races ; he was the first one to claim that there was a master race - the germans - and a low-class race - the jews .
he was the first to explain this in writing .
in 1938 , the symphony orchestra of eretz israel , which later became the israeli philharmonic orchestra , was about to perform wagner in a concert in tel aviv directed by -lsb- arturo -rsb- toscanini .
bronislaw huberman , the man who founded it , decided that the orchestra could not play wagner .
november 8-9 , 1938 was the so-called night of broken glass where the synagogues were destroyed and burned all over germany and austria , thousands of shops were looted and destroyed , hundreds of jews were murdered and tens of thousands of jews were sent to concentration camps .
huberman then realized that -lsb- wagner 's -rsb- theory had been realized by the germans at that time .
so he decided not to play wagner .
then he decided , together with the bosses of the jewish community in palestine - there was no israeli government at that time - to boycott wagner .
this happened before the shoah .
so , of course it was taken over later , because during the shoah it became clear that hitler was a great admirer of wagner .
not only did he adopt his theories , but he adopted his music as well .
the boycott has never been lifted .
it 's true that sometimes directors have tried to perform wagner in israel .
a man who decided to do it was daniel barenboim who , in a concert with a german orchestra , performed wagner , claiming that it was done spontaneously .
but it 's not true - you can not perform spontaneously with an orchestra .
you would say , then , that if the holocaust had not happened , israel would still have a boycott against wagner ? yes , i think so , because the pogroms happened .
it was not decided after the holocaust , it was decided after the pogroms in 1938 . by the way , there is no official ban .
it 's a sentimental ban .
as long as some of us are still alive , people should refrain from imposing wagner on us .
but we 're the not only ones ; there are many , many israelis who were born after the holocaust who are also against wagner for the same reason . how does this younger generation view wagner ? i do n't even know whether the younger generation is very familiar with wagner .
i do n't think that many young people are fond of wagner .
i 'm convinced they 're not . do you think that the israeli orchestra playing in bayreuth could serve as an act of reconciliation ? we do n't need reconciliation with wagner .
we have reconciliation with germany .
we have nothing against the new german generations .
i go to germany very often ; i lecture in germany .
i lecture on the shoah , but this is a different story .
i have no problem whatsoever , because they 're not the same germans .
but wagner is the same wagner - whether it 's today or 100 years ago , it 's the same wagner with the same theory . does the ban apply to any other composers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 night of broken glass was evidence that the nazis 's anti-semitism had turned violent no .
richard strauss was at least as strong an anti-semite as wagner was , but we play strauss . why ? because he is not the father of this -lsb- racial -rsb- theory .
if we banned all anti-semites , we would n't have a lot of writers , poets and composers because most of them were anti-jewish .
i can give you a list of about a hundred .
but we have their books , we read their books , we study their books , we even teach from their books .
the same thing goes for music , but wagner is a different story . have you had the personal experience of listening to wagner 's music ? i know wagner 's music , but i really do n't like this music .
it 's too bombastic for me .
it 's only a joke of course -lsb- laughing -rsb- but it 's music where you can not even sleep in the opera because it 's much too loud . i personally do n't like his music , but i know that he 's a genius without any doubt .
he was one of the greatest composers ever , but this has nothing to do with his theories . interview : kate bowen / ma 'ayan yahbes editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an investment company holding 150,000 postbank shares is prepared to file a legal complaint protesting deutsche bank ’ s offer . deutsche bank announced in september it would offer smaller postbank shareholders who hold what 's called the free float 25 euros per share as part of an effort to consolidate control over postbank by increasing its 29.95 percent stake .
now , one of those small shareholders , dusseldorf-based effecten-spiegel , is close to filing a legal complaint once the offer is made official .
germany 's financial regulator bafin had allowed for the shares to be sold at 25 euros , based on a three-month average .
deutsche bank intends to fund the purchase through 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.1bn -rrb- in capital , raised by issuing 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros each .
law circumvented ?
marlis weidtmann , executive director of effecten-spiegel , which holds 150,000 postbank shares , says deutsche bank is trying to circumvent laws regulating takeovers .
deutsche bank has had a multi-tiered agreement with postbank 's owner , deutsche post , since january 2009 , in which it agreed to buy the former parent company 's 27.4 percent stake for 45 euros a share .
but those shares wo n't actually change hands until 2012 , leaving deutsche bank with less than 30 percent ownership of postbank for now and thus free to buy shares for 25 euros each – their average value over the last three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and postbank have long gone hand-in-hand weidtmann added that the details of the agreement have never been made completely public , but that independent calculations based on widely available information show the shares would be worth at least 36 euros each , if it were to be legally acknowledged that deutsche bank has more than a 30 percent stake in postbank .
“ it makes us suspicious , because we have to ask ourselves , ‘ what 's written in there ? ' ”
weidtmann told deutsche welle .
“ what surprises me is that bafin has played along thus far . ”
a ‘ soap bubble ' bonn-based lawyer wienand meilicke , who co-authored the report published in the trade journal zip , which valued the postbank shares at 36 euros , says “ a whole lot of people ” will be short-changed through deutsche bank 's plans .
“ if someone sticks a needle in this thing the soap bubble will pop , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ i am of the opinion that there is a significant chance this case will be successful in court .
but that means fighting the german banking establishment . ”
according to weidtmann , deutsche bank has so far defended its plans by “ always pulling back and making the argument that the shares wo n't change hands until 2012 . ”
tight-lipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and deutsche bank have angered smaller shareholders a deutsche bank spokesman told deutsche welle the bank “ sees no legal grounds for the complaint . ”
he referred to the position taken by frankfurt-based law firm hengeler mueller which , in a january 2009 press release , spoke of having advised deutsche bank on an “ improved transaction structure ” for its acquisition of postbank shares .
a hengeler mueller spokesman , however , declined to comment .
postbank has 24 million retail clients – more than any other bank in germany – and deutsche bank has been working to increase its number of domestic customers .
also , banks will soon be required to hold more capital to safeguard against future financial crises under the new basel iii accord , which will come into force in 2012 .
acquiring postbank will likely help deutsche bank meet those requirements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 06.10.2010 frankfurt book fair merges literature and technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina is this year 's guest of honor at the fair the frankfurt book fair is the biggest book show in the world , drawing hundreds of thousands of visitors .
this year , bookworms can sample from tons of digital literature content and media . star authors like american jonathan franzen and briton ken follett , and not one , but two german nobel prize winners - guenter grass and herta mueller - are expected to attend this year 's frankfurt book fair , which runs from october 6-10 .
those names may be the literature fair 's trump card , but organizers say they also hope to showcase new concepts for the future of publishing .
" the biggest trend is that various media are merging , " said frankfurt book fair 's director , juergen boos .
" when people sit at their computers , they often have news pages open , as well as their e-mail and other programs .
that shows how dynamic things are . "
the worlds of film and publishing are coming closer together , he added .
" people load all their preferred media onto one device , or have several different devices that they jump back and forth from . "
bridging lit and tech in a program called " frankfurt sparks , " the fair is to showcase new technologies which demand fresh content .
with reading devices , apps , and internet platforms beginning to edge out or at least alter traditional printed books , the program 's intention in focusing on that trend is to spark debate .
" frankfurt storydrive " is a cross-media conference accompanying the fair , where publishers , technology and software developers , game representatives and media users can brainstorm about developing " worlds " for good stories and continue the debate about literature trends .
" device providers need content to arouse consumer interest in their devices , " said bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , a cooperation partner at the conference .
" the frankfurt book fair provides that content , so it is a typical win-win situation for both the fair and the technology sector , " he said .
bildunterschrift : not everything has gone digital growth in digital area rohleder anticipates growth of 20 percent in the next decade for the sector that merges literature and technology .
a new german reading device is slotted for debut at the fair , for instance , since internet book giant amazon has been hesitant to issue its kindle on the german market due to unclarified copyright issues .
another continued challenge for publishers is that many internet users do not want to pay for digital content , boos said , but it 's also a trend that offers potential for new developments .
" when ' avatar ' - the hugely successful movie - was created , the book , computer game and music were developed and marketed all at the same time , " boos stressed .
" that was a first , and it shows that people are thinking differently . "
good news and bad boos aims to tap into this cross-media market , but has a few hurdles to leap at this year 's fair .
bucking past years ' trends of record participation , this year sees a five percent drop in exhibitors , bringing the number to around 6,900 .

this year , bookworms can sample from tons of digital literature content and media . star authors like american jonathan franzen and briton ken follett , and not one , but two german nobel prize winners - guenter grass and herta mueller - are expected to attend this year 's frankfurt book fair , which runs from october 6-10 .
those names may be the literature fair 's trump card , but organizers say they also hope to showcase new concepts for the future of publishing .
" the biggest trend is that various media are merging , " said frankfurt book fair 's director , juergen boos .
" when people sit at their computers , they often have news pages open , as well as their e-mail and other programs .
that shows how dynamic things are . "
the worlds of film and publishing are coming closer together , he added .
" people load all their preferred media onto one device , or have several different devices that they jump back and forth from . "
bridging lit and tech in a program called " frankfurt sparks , " the fair is to showcase new technologies which demand fresh content .
with reading devices , apps , and internet platforms beginning to edge out or at least alter traditional printed books , the program 's intention in focusing on that trend is to spark debate .
" frankfurt storydrive " is a cross-media conference accompanying the fair , where publishers , technology and software developers , game representatives and media users can brainstorm about developing " worlds " for good stories and continue the debate about literature trends .
" device providers need content to arouse consumer interest in their devices , " said bernhard rohleder , managing director of the federal association for information technology , a cooperation partner at the conference .
" the frankfurt book fair provides that content , so it is a typical win-win situation for both the fair and the technology sector , " he said .
bildunterschrift : not everything has gone digital growth in digital area rohleder anticipates growth of 20 percent in the next decade for the sector that merges literature and technology .
a new german reading device is slotted for debut at the fair , for instance , since internet book giant amazon has been hesitant to issue its kindle on the german market due to unclarified copyright issues .
another continued challenge for publishers is that many internet users do not want to pay for digital content , boos said , but it 's also a trend that offers potential for new developments .
" when ' avatar ' - the hugely successful movie - was created , the book , computer game and music were developed and marketed all at the same time , " boos stressed .
" that was a first , and it shows that people are thinking differently . "
good news and bad boos aims to tap into this cross-media market , but has a few hurdles to leap at this year 's fair .
bucking past years ' trends of record participation , this year sees a five percent drop in exhibitors , bringing the number to around 6,900 .
there are also 100,000 fewer new publications .
but there is some good news , too .

the first performances in 1884 and 1885 were the breakthrough for the composer , who was painfully shy and often suffered from a lack of self-esteem . we 've chosen the adagio movement for you .
connections to a composer 's biography are relatively rare in symphonies , but this one is an exception : after bruckner heard of the death of richard wagner in early 1883 , he set the conclusion of the adagio as a funeral ode for wagner , whom he called his personal " master of all masters . " at this concert in the beethoven hall , american conductor kent nagano was honored with the wilhelm furtwaengler prize .
furtwaengler is considered one of the 20th century 's foremost conductors .
since 2008 , the prize has been awarded at the beethovenfest .
with this , writes ermano sens-grosholz , patron of the award , nagano is recognized as an " exemplary artist with standard-setting musical achievements and for his engagement for social causes and projects , in particular with regard to the education of musical youth .

however , one venezuelan pianist who excels at playing off the cuff is an exception to the rule . gabriela montero -lrb- 1970- -rrb- improvisation on the song " guantanamera " gabriela montero -lrb- piano -rrb- mp3 recorded at the petersberg near bonn on september 25 , 2010 by deutsche welle -lrb- dw -rrb- improvisation has been called the well-spring of all music .
in the baroque and classical periods , it was standard practice .
the improvisational abilities of composers like bach , handel and mozart were legendary .
beethoven also showed a prodigious improvisational talent at the piano .
many of his piano sonatas , although precisely crafted compositions , reflect the freewheeling spirit of improvisational fantasy with their tempestuous runs and cascading successions of chords . today , the art of improvisation is widespread in jazz but rare within the realm of " classical " or " serious " music - with one exception being church organists who may improvise preludes or accompaniments to hymn tunes .
however , a talent of the caliber of venezuelan pianist gabriela montero is extremely rare .
montero , who says that she began improvising at age five , has been asked repeatedly " how she does it , " for which she has no answer . to demonstrate her gift for spur-of-the-moment invention , montero often begins a recital playing works from the repertory , but in the second half , improvises elaborate pieces based on melodies suggested by audience members .
the styles and rhythms can vary from romantic to rumba and from the toccata to the tango . we 've chosen a brief excerpt from her all-improvised recital at the petersberg hotel near bonn .
she begins by plucking out the melody of the song " guantanamera " and then builds an elaborate and cleverly crafted musical edifice from the song 's motifs .
experiencing gabriela montero live in concert reminds one of the fact that without improvisation , there would be no music . author : rick fulker editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

holocaust survivor and israeli journalist noah klieger explains why the ban is justified and does n't hinder reconciliation . the israel chamber orchestra has agreed to perform a work by anti-semitic composer richard wagner -lrb- 1813-1883 -rrb- at next year 's bayreuth festival , although an unofficial boycott of the composer 's music has been observed in israel for over 70 years .
prominent israeli journalist and holocaust survivor noah klieger -lrb- born in 1926 in strasbourg -rrb- explains how the unspoken wagner ban came about in israel and why he is opposed to an israeli orchestra performing wagner 's music . deutsche welle : why are you opposed to the israel chamber orchestra playing wagner at the bayreuth festival ? noah klieger : i 'm against it because i 'm against playing wagner in israel .
wagner was the father of the theory of the races ; he was the first one to claim that there was a master race - the germans - and a low-class race - the jews .
he was the first to explain this in writing .
in 1938 , the symphony orchestra of eretz israel , which later became the israeli philharmonic orchestra , was about to perform wagner in a concert in tel aviv directed by -lsb- arturo -rsb- toscanini .
bronislaw huberman , the man who founded it , decided that the orchestra could not play wagner .
november 8-9 , 1938 was the so-called night of broken glass where the synagogues were destroyed and burned all over germany and austria , thousands of shops were looted and destroyed , hundreds of jews were murdered and tens of thousands of jews were sent to concentration camps .
huberman then realized that -lsb- wagner 's -rsb- theory had been realized by the germans at that time .
so he decided not to play wagner .
then he decided , together with the bosses of the jewish community in palestine - there was no israeli government at that time - to boycott wagner .
this happened before the shoah .
so , of course it was taken over later , because during the shoah it became clear that hitler was a great admirer of wagner .
not only did he adopt his theories , but he adopted his music as well .
the boycott has never been lifted .
it 's true that sometimes directors have tried to perform wagner in israel .
a man who decided to do it was daniel barenboim who , in a concert with a german orchestra , performed wagner , claiming that it was done spontaneously .
but it 's not true - you can not perform spontaneously with an orchestra .
you would say , then , that if the holocaust had not happened , israel would still have a boycott against wagner ? yes , i think so , because the pogroms happened .
it was not decided after the holocaust , it was decided after the pogroms in 1938 . by the way , there is no official ban .
it 's a sentimental ban .
as long as some of us are still alive , people should refrain from imposing wagner on us .
but we 're the not only ones ; there are many , many israelis who were born after the holocaust who are also against wagner for the same reason . how does this younger generation view wagner ? i do n't even know whether the younger generation is very familiar with wagner .
i do n't think that many young people are fond of wagner .
i 'm convinced they 're not . do you think that the israeli orchestra playing in bayreuth could serve as an act of reconciliation ? we do n't need reconciliation with wagner .
we have reconciliation with germany .
we have nothing against the new german generations .
i go to germany very often ; i lecture in germany .
i lecture on the shoah , but this is a different story .
i have no problem whatsoever , because they 're not the same germans .
but wagner is the same wagner - whether it 's today or 100 years ago , it 's the same wagner with the same theory . does the ban apply to any other composers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 night of broken glass was evidence that the nazis 's anti-semitism had turned violent no .
richard strauss was at least as strong an anti-semite as wagner was , but we play strauss . why ? because he is not the father of this -lsb- racial -rsb- theory .
if we banned all anti-semites , we would n't have a lot of writers , poets and composers because most of them were anti-jewish .
i can give you a list of about a hundred .
but we have their books , we read their books , we study their books , we even teach from their books .
the same thing goes for music , but wagner is a different story . have you had the personal experience of listening to wagner 's music ? i know wagner 's music , but i really do n't like this music .
it 's too bombastic for me .
it 's only a joke of course -lsb- laughing -rsb- but it 's music where you can not even sleep in the opera because it 's much too loud . i personally do n't like his music , but i know that he 's a genius without any doubt .
he was one of the greatest composers ever , but this has nothing to do with his theories . interview : kate bowen / ma 'ayan yahbes editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

55 -lrb- eroica -rrb- bamberg symphony orchestra conductor : jonathan nott mp3 recorded by deutschlandfunk on october 3 , 2010 in the beethoven hall , bonn . when napoleon bonaparte crowned himself emperor in paris ' notre dame cathedral in late 1804 , beethoven was in the process of composing his third symphony , in e-flat major .
the composer had been a supporter of napoleon and planned to dedicate the massive orchestral work to him .
but , as the story goes , when beethoven heard the news of the self-coronation , he was furious and scratched out the dedication . though the composer 's admiration for napoleon never completely dwindled , his great e-flat symphony was published with the title it is known under today : " sinfonia eroica - composed to celebrate the memory of a great man . " the symphony superseded all of beethoven 's previous orchestral works in length , complexity , form and virtuosity .
as with most ground-breaking works , the eroica symphony was initially pelted with criticism upon its premiere in vienna in 1805 . it is performed here by the bamberg symphony orchestra under the direction of their chief conductor , jonathan nott .
originally from the uk , nott has directed the bavarian orchestra since 2000 , bringing it to both national and international acclaim . author : kate bowen -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an investment company holding 150,000 postbank shares is prepared to file a legal complaint protesting deutsche bank ’ s offer . deutsche bank announced in september it would offer smaller postbank shareholders who hold what 's called the free float 25 euros per share as part of an effort to consolidate control over postbank by increasing its 29.95 percent stake .
now , one of those small shareholders , dusseldorf-based effecten-spiegel , is close to filing a legal complaint once the offer is made official .
germany 's financial regulator bafin had allowed for the shares to be sold at 25 euros , based on a three-month average .
deutsche bank intends to fund the purchase through 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.1bn -rrb- in capital , raised by issuing 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros each .
law circumvented ?
marlis weidtmann , executive director of effecten-spiegel , which holds 150,000 postbank shares , says deutsche bank is trying to circumvent laws regulating takeovers .
deutsche bank has had a multi-tiered agreement with postbank 's owner , deutsche post , since january 2009 , in which it agreed to buy the former parent company 's 27.4 percent stake for 45 euros a share .
but those shares wo n't actually change hands until 2012 , leaving deutsche bank with less than 30 percent ownership of postbank for now and thus free to buy shares for 25 euros each – their average value over the last three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and postbank have long gone hand-in-hand weidtmann added that the details of the agreement have never been made completely public , but that independent calculations based on widely available information show the shares would be worth at least 36 euros each , if it were to be legally acknowledged that deutsche bank has more than a 30 percent stake in postbank .
“ it makes us suspicious , because we have to ask ourselves , ‘ what 's written in there ? ' ”
weidtmann told deutsche welle .
“ what surprises me is that bafin has played along thus far . ”
a ‘ soap bubble ' bonn-based lawyer wienand meilicke , who co-authored the report published in the trade journal zip , which valued the postbank shares at 36 euros , says “ a whole lot of people ” will be short-changed through deutsche bank 's plans .
“ if someone sticks a needle in this thing the soap bubble will pop , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ i am of the opinion that there is a significant chance this case will be successful in court .
but that means fighting the german banking establishment . ”
according to weidtmann , deutsche bank has so far defended its plans by “ always pulling back and making the argument that the shares wo n't change hands until 2012 . ”
tight-lipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and deutsche bank have angered smaller shareholders a deutsche bank spokesman told deutsche welle the bank “ sees no legal grounds for the complaint . ”
he referred to the position taken by frankfurt-based law firm hengeler mueller which , in a january 2009 press release , spoke of having advised deutsche bank on an “ improved transaction structure ” for its acquisition of postbank shares .
a hengeler mueller spokesman , however , declined to comment .
postbank has 24 million retail clients – more than any other bank in germany – and deutsche bank has been working to increase its number of domestic customers .
also , banks will soon be required to hold more capital to safeguard against future financial crises under the new basel iii accord , which will come into force in 2012 .
acquiring postbank will likely help deutsche bank meet those requirements .

chinese premier wen jiabao was in berlin after an eu-asia summit produced mixed results . germany has agreed to forge closer economic ties with china and press beijing 's case to be recognized as a market economy by the european union .
chancellor angela merkel met chinese premier wen jiabao at the meseberg palace near berlin following an eu-asia summit in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and wen met to build on discussions in brussels a joint statement issued by the german and chinese delegations after the meeting said that both leaders supported " strengthening european-chinese economic relations and want to encourage them through consultation and building up cooperation . "
it said there was a need for china and the eu to strengthen mutual political confidence and deepen strategic co-operation . "
the statement said that germany would work to get the european union to recognize china as a market economy by 2016 , giving the country certain benefits under international trade rules .
leaders at the summit in brussels had earlier reached broad agreement on reforms to help stabilize the international economy .
however , efforts to gain concessions from china to allow a more rapid appreciation in the value of the yuan appear to have failed .
changes in global economy the biennial asia europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- brought together 27 eu and 19 asian leaders , with agreement that reforms were needed to keep pace with changes in the world economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 is to discuss issues such as financial regulation " the priority is now to reach agreement on a system of global financial , monetary and economic governance : we have to act together very closely on this , " said summit chairman and president of the european council herman van rompuy .
leaders from the nations represented , 12 of which are members of the g20 group of leading economies , agreed that the next g20 summit in the south korean capital , seoul , next month should address a range of issues .
issues up for discussion at that summit include ensuring better government spending control and tighter regulation of the financial industry .
states also moved closer to a firm deal on the redistribution of voting rights within international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , for which european states retain disproportionate power compared with asian states .
a broad agreement on the need for reform was reached , although disagreements remained on the precise details .
no movement on chinese currency european nations also pressed - without success - for a china to allow its currency , the yuan , to increase in value , amid charges that beijing is deliberately devaluing its money to aid its export industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western countries say the yuan is being kept artificially low the chairman of eurozone finance ministers , jean-claude juncker said euro nations had urged an " orderly , significant and broad-based appreciation " of the yuan .
when asked about the chinese response , juncker said .
" the chinese authorities do not share our view . "
leaders also pledged to seek an urgent , legally-binding deal on global warming at united nations climate talks in cancun , mexico , beginning next month .
the german and chinese negotiations also touched on climate change , with both countries saying that they hoped progress would be made at the talks .
recognition of china as a market economy would make it less vulnerable to charges that it is dumping products onto global markets against world trade organization rules .

holocaust survivor and israeli journalist noah klieger explains why the ban is justified and does n't hinder reconciliation . the israel chamber orchestra has agreed to perform a work by anti-semitic composer richard wagner -lrb- 1813-1883 -rrb- at next year 's bayreuth festival , although an unofficial boycott of the composer 's music has been observed in israel for over 70 years .
prominent israeli journalist and holocaust survivor noah klieger -lrb- born in 1926 in strasbourg -rrb- explains how the unspoken wagner ban came about in israel and why he is opposed to an israeli orchestra performing wagner 's music . deutsche welle : why are you opposed to the israel chamber orchestra playing wagner at the bayreuth festival ? noah klieger : i 'm against it because i 'm against playing wagner in israel .
wagner was the father of the theory of the races ; he was the first one to claim that there was a master race - the germans - and a low-class race - the jews .
he was the first to explain this in writing .
in 1938 , the symphony orchestra of eretz israel , which later became the israeli philharmonic orchestra , was about to perform wagner in a concert in tel aviv directed by -lsb- arturo -rsb- toscanini .
bronislaw huberman , the man who founded it , decided that the orchestra could not play wagner .
november 8-9 , 1938 was the so-called night of broken glass where the synagogues were destroyed and burned all over germany and austria , thousands of shops were looted and destroyed , hundreds of jews were murdered and tens of thousands of jews were sent to concentration camps .
huberman then realized that -lsb- wagner 's -rsb- theory had been realized by the germans at that time .
so he decided not to play wagner .
then he decided , together with the bosses of the jewish community in palestine - there was no israeli government at that time - to boycott wagner .
this happened before the shoah .
so , of course it was taken over later , because during the shoah it became clear that hitler was a great admirer of wagner .
not only did he adopt his theories , but he adopted his music as well .
the boycott has never been lifted .
it 's true that sometimes directors have tried to perform wagner in israel .
a man who decided to do it was daniel barenboim who , in a concert with a german orchestra , performed wagner , claiming that it was done spontaneously .
but it 's not true - you can not perform spontaneously with an orchestra .
you would say , then , that if the holocaust had not happened , israel would still have a boycott against wagner ? yes , i think so , because the pogroms happened .
it was not decided after the holocaust , it was decided after the pogroms in 1938 . by the way , there is no official ban .
it 's a sentimental ban .
as long as some of us are still alive , people should refrain from imposing wagner on us .
but we 're the not only ones ; there are many , many israelis who were born after the holocaust who are also against wagner for the same reason . how does this younger generation view wagner ? i do n't even know whether the younger generation is very familiar with wagner .
i do n't think that many young people are fond of wagner .
i 'm convinced they 're not . do you think that the israeli orchestra playing in bayreuth could serve as an act of reconciliation ? we do n't need reconciliation with wagner .
we have reconciliation with germany .
we have nothing against the new german generations .
i go to germany very often ; i lecture in germany .
i lecture on the shoah , but this is a different story .
i have no problem whatsoever , because they 're not the same germans .
but wagner is the same wagner - whether it 's today or 100 years ago , it 's the same wagner with the same theory . does the ban apply to any other composers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 night of broken glass was evidence that the nazis 's anti-semitism had turned violent no .
richard strauss was at least as strong an anti-semite as wagner was , but we play strauss . why ? because he is not the father of this -lsb- racial -rsb- theory .
if we banned all anti-semites , we would n't have a lot of writers , poets and composers because most of them were anti-jewish .
i can give you a list of about a hundred .
but we have their books , we read their books , we study their books , we even teach from their books .
the same thing goes for music , but wagner is a different story . have you had the personal experience of listening to wagner 's music ? i know wagner 's music , but i really do n't like this music .
it 's too bombastic for me .
it 's only a joke of course -lsb- laughing -rsb- but it 's music where you can not even sleep in the opera because it 's much too loud . i personally do n't like his music , but i know that he 's a genius without any doubt .
he was one of the greatest composers ever , but this has nothing to do with his theories . interview : kate bowen / ma 'ayan yahbes editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the poll , conducted by berlin-based pollster forsa and sponsored by stern magazine and private broadcaster rtl , found that 24 percent of germans would vote for the greens in an election , up one percentage point from last week .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped two points to 23 percent .
the ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- picked up one more point with 31 percent , while their junior-partner free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took 5 percent .
the left party received 10 percent .
the results were based on responses from 2,501 german voters interviewed between sept .
27 and oct .
1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth and co-chief cem oezdemir have reason to celebrate gaining support by default forsa chief manfred guellner told stern that the spd was focusing on the wrong issues .
for example the criticism of the government 's minimal 5-euro increase in monthly welfare payments appears to be less important to former spd supporters in the middle class .
" the greens are profiting from weaknesses of the other parties , " he said .
" they 're gaining the deserters from the spd , but also from the cdu . "
he added that the greens have also benefitted from the leadership of renate kuenast and juergen tritten , chief and deputy chairs of the greens in parliament respectively .
several other opinion research institutions have found national support for the greens to be somewhat lower , just below the spd around 20 percent .
but many polls suggest the greens are ahead of the spd in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg and in berlin - where they appear to be the strongest party .
not an spd ' satellite or splinter group ' green party chief claudia roth pointed to the poll as evidence that the party has broken out of its previous role on the sidelines and is becoming a major player in german politics on par with the spd and cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens may have benefitted from anti-nuclear sentiment " the time of being the ' junior partners ' is over , " she told daily newspaper rheinische post .
" some former spd supporters still have not yet understood that we are not a satellite or splinter group from them . "
meanwhile the spd 's parliamentary chief thomas oppermann said the greens have benefitted from highly emotional issues for germans , like the government 's proposal to extend the lifespan of germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the anti-nuclear mobilization has paid off for the greens , " he said , even when the spd 's criticism of nuclear energy has been just as intense .

it 's set to start the ball rolling for similar agreements with other asian countries . the european union and south korea signed a record free-trade agreement in brussels on wednesday .
it 's expected to cut around 3 billion euros ' -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- worth of tariffs and lift administrative barriers and regulations on goods ranging from cars to whisky .
" this agreement is by far the most important trade deal ever concluded be the european union with one country and the first free trade deal with an asian country , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso .
the accord is set to take effect on july 1 , 2011 , once ratified by the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's luxury car industry may cash in on the deal the deal could double trade between europe and south korea by boosting business by 30 billion euros a year .
" the pact sends a strong signal that trade liberalization is a key element for recovery of the world economy , " said eu president herman van rompuy .
the eu runs a deficit with south korea in goods trade , although trends suggest the korean market offers significant growth potential for european firms .
expanding trade with asia the eu hopes that trade liberalization will broaden its influence in asia .
lifting customs duties on imported goods will make imported south korean products cheaper in the eu and eu goods cheaper in south korea .
europe 's spirits industry welcomed the deal for its potential in boosting sales of eu-produced drinks such as scotch whisky and french cognac .
the german luxury car and meat industries also hope to benefit from this arrangement .
italy was initially hesitant about the deal , fearing its national carmaker , fiat , could be outdone by south korea 's kia und hyundai car manufacturers .
but the country dropped its veto in return for delaying the treaty 's implementation until july 1 .
tariffs on some goods , such as small cars , will continue for up to five years thereafter .

on tuesday , japanese officials said that they hoped to start free-trade talks with the eu in the spring , partly in reaction to the korean agreement .
as japan and korea are competitors in several industries , japanese manufacturers stand to lose market share in europe 's automotive and electronics markets .
malaysian diplomats said that they , too , had agreed to open free-trade negotiations with the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 06.10.2010 greens overtake spd as most popular opposition party , poll says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results were the best yet for the greens for the first time since its founding three decades ago , a poll suggests the german green party has overtaken the social democrats in popularity , bolstering the greens ' claim that they are the main opposition party . the 30-year-old green party in germany appeared to have broken a major barrier on wednesday as a poll suggested it has surpassed the older social democratics as the country 's most popular opposition party .
the poll , conducted by berlin-based pollster forsa and sponsored by stern magazine and private broadcaster rtl , found that 24 percent of germans would vote for the greens in an election , up one percentage point from last week .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped two points to 23 percent .
the ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- picked up one more point with 31 percent , while their junior-partner free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took 5 percent .
the left party received 10 percent .
the results were based on responses from 2,501 german voters interviewed between sept .
27 and oct .
1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth and co-chief cem oezdemir have reason to celebrate gaining support by default forsa chief manfred guellner told stern that the spd was focusing on the wrong issues .
for example the criticism of the government 's minimal 5-euro increase in monthly welfare payments appears to be less important to former spd supporters in the middle class .
" the greens are profiting from weaknesses of the other parties , " he said .
" they 're gaining the deserters from the spd , but also from the cdu . "
he added that the greens have also benefitted from the leadership of renate kuenast and juergen tritten , chief and deputy chairs of the greens in parliament respectively .
several other opinion research institutions have found national support for the greens to be somewhat lower , just below the spd around 20 percent .
but many polls suggest the greens are ahead of the spd in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg and in berlin - where they appear to be the strongest party .
not an spd ' satellite or splinter group ' green party chief claudia roth pointed to the poll as evidence that the party has broken out of its previous role on the sidelines and is becoming a major player in german politics on par with the spd and cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens may have benefitted from anti-nuclear sentiment " the time of being the ' junior partners ' is over , " she told daily newspaper rheinische post .
" some former spd supporters still have not yet understood that we are not a satellite or splinter group from them . "
meanwhile the spd 's parliamentary chief thomas oppermann said the greens have benefitted from highly emotional issues for germans , like the government 's proposal to extend the lifespan of germany 's nuclear power plants .
" the anti-nuclear mobilization has paid off for the greens , " he said , even when the spd 's criticism of nuclear energy has been just as intense .

an investment company holding 150,000 postbank shares is prepared to file a legal complaint protesting deutsche bank ’ s offer . deutsche bank announced in september it would offer smaller postbank shareholders who hold what 's called the free float 25 euros per share as part of an effort to consolidate control over postbank by increasing its 29.95 percent stake .
now , one of those small shareholders , dusseldorf-based effecten-spiegel , is close to filing a legal complaint once the offer is made official .
germany 's financial regulator bafin had allowed for the shares to be sold at 25 euros , based on a three-month average .
deutsche bank intends to fund the purchase through 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.1bn -rrb- in capital , raised by issuing 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros each .
law circumvented ?
marlis weidtmann , executive director of effecten-spiegel , which holds 150,000 postbank shares , says deutsche bank is trying to circumvent laws regulating takeovers .
deutsche bank has had a multi-tiered agreement with postbank 's owner , deutsche post , since january 2009 , in which it agreed to buy the former parent company 's 27.4 percent stake for 45 euros a share .
but those shares wo n't actually change hands until 2012 , leaving deutsche bank with less than 30 percent ownership of postbank for now and thus free to buy shares for 25 euros each – their average value over the last three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and postbank have long gone hand-in-hand weidtmann added that the details of the agreement have never been made completely public , but that independent calculations based on widely available information show the shares would be worth at least 36 euros each , if it were to be legally acknowledged that deutsche bank has more than a 30 percent stake in postbank .
“ it makes us suspicious , because we have to ask ourselves , ‘ what 's written in there ? ' ”
weidtmann told deutsche welle .
“ what surprises me is that bafin has played along thus far . ”
a ‘ soap bubble ' bonn-based lawyer wienand meilicke , who co-authored the report published in the trade journal zip , which valued the postbank shares at 36 euros , says “ a whole lot of people ” will be short-changed through deutsche bank 's plans .
“ if someone sticks a needle in this thing the soap bubble will pop , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ i am of the opinion that there is a significant chance this case will be successful in court .
but that means fighting the german banking establishment . ”
according to weidtmann , deutsche bank has so far defended its plans by “ always pulling back and making the argument that the shares wo n't change hands until 2012 . ”
tight-lipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and deutsche bank have angered smaller shareholders a deutsche bank spokesman told deutsche welle the bank “ sees no legal grounds for the complaint . ”
he referred to the position taken by frankfurt-based law firm hengeler mueller which , in a january 2009 press release , spoke of having advised deutsche bank on an “ improved transaction structure ” for its acquisition of postbank shares .
a hengeler mueller spokesman , however , declined to comment .
postbank has 24 million retail clients – more than any other bank in germany – and deutsche bank has been working to increase its number of domestic customers .
also , banks will soon be required to hold more capital to safeguard against future financial crises under the new basel iii accord , which will come into force in 2012 .
acquiring postbank will likely help deutsche bank meet those requirements .

a ‘ soap bubble ' bonn-based lawyer wienand meilicke , who co-authored the report published in the trade journal zip , which valued the postbank shares at 36 euros , says “ a whole lot of people ” will be short-changed through deutsche bank 's plans .
“ if someone sticks a needle in this thing the soap bubble will pop , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ i am of the opinion that there is a significant chance this case will be successful in court .

tight-lipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and deutsche bank have angered smaller shareholders a deutsche bank spokesman told deutsche welle the bank “ sees no legal grounds for the complaint . ”
he referred to the position taken by frankfurt-based law firm hengeler mueller which , in a january 2009 press release , spoke of having advised deutsche bank on an “ improved transaction structure ” for its acquisition of postbank shares .
a hengeler mueller spokesman , however , declined to comment .
postbank has 24 million retail clients – more than any other bank in germany – and deutsche bank has been working to increase its number of domestic customers .
also , banks will soon be required to hold more capital to safeguard against future financial crises under the new basel iii accord , which will come into force in 2012 .
acquiring postbank will likely help deutsche bank meet those requirements .

an investment company holding 150,000 postbank shares is prepared to file a legal complaint protesting deutsche bank ’ s offer . deutsche bank announced in september it would offer smaller postbank shareholders who hold what 's called the free float 25 euros per share as part of an effort to consolidate control over postbank by increasing its 29.95 percent stake .
now , one of those small shareholders , dusseldorf-based effecten-spiegel , is close to filing a legal complaint once the offer is made official .
germany 's financial regulator bafin had allowed for the shares to be sold at 25 euros , based on a three-month average .
deutsche bank intends to fund the purchase through 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.1bn -rrb- in capital , raised by issuing 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros each .
law circumvented ?
marlis weidtmann , executive director of effecten-spiegel , which holds 150,000 postbank shares , says deutsche bank is trying to circumvent laws regulating takeovers .
deutsche bank has had a multi-tiered agreement with postbank 's owner , deutsche post , since january 2009 , in which it agreed to buy the former parent company 's 27.4 percent stake for 45 euros a share .
but those shares wo n't actually change hands until 2012 , leaving deutsche bank with less than 30 percent ownership of postbank for now and thus free to buy shares for 25 euros each – their average value over the last three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post and postbank have long gone hand-in-hand weidtmann added that the details of the agreement have never been made completely public , but that independent calculations based on widely available information show the shares would be worth at least 36 euros each , if it were to be legally acknowledged that deutsche bank has more than a 30 percent stake in postbank .
“ it makes us suspicious , because we have to ask ourselves , ‘ what 's written in there ? ' ”
weidtmann told deutsche welle .

italy was initially hesitant about the deal , fearing its national carmaker , fiat , could be outdone by south korea 's kia und hyundai car manufacturers .
but the country dropped its veto in return for delaying the treaty 's implementation until july 1 .
tariffs on some goods , such as small cars , will continue for up to five years thereafter .

on tuesday , japanese officials said that they hoped to start free-trade talks with the eu in the spring , partly in reaction to the korean agreement .

malaysian diplomats said that they , too , had agreed to open free-trade negotiations with the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 06.10.2010 israel does n't need reconciliation with wagner , says holocaust survivor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noah klieger survived several concentration camps during the holocaust richard wagner 's music has been boycotted in israel in light of the nazi pogroms of 1938 .
holocaust survivor and israeli journalist noah klieger explains why the ban is justified and does n't hinder reconciliation . the israel chamber orchestra has agreed to perform a work by anti-semitic composer richard wagner -lrb- 1813-1883 -rrb- at next year 's bayreuth festival , although an unofficial boycott of the composer 's music has been observed in israel for over 70 years .
prominent israeli journalist and holocaust survivor noah klieger -lrb- born in 1926 in strasbourg -rrb- explains how the unspoken wagner ban came about in israel and why he is opposed to an israeli orchestra performing wagner 's music . deutsche welle : why are you opposed to the israel chamber orchestra playing wagner at the bayreuth festival ? noah klieger : i 'm against it because i 'm against playing wagner in israel .
wagner was the father of the theory of the races ; he was the first one to claim that there was a master race - the germans - and a low-class race - the jews .
he was the first to explain this in writing .
in 1938 , the symphony orchestra of eretz israel , which later became the israeli philharmonic orchestra , was about to perform wagner in a concert in tel aviv directed by -lsb- arturo -rsb- toscanini .
bronislaw huberman , the man who founded it , decided that the orchestra could not play wagner .
november 8-9 , 1938 was the so-called night of broken glass where the synagogues were destroyed and burned all over germany and austria , thousands of shops were looted and destroyed , hundreds of jews were murdered and tens of thousands of jews were sent to concentration camps .
huberman then realized that -lsb- wagner 's -rsb- theory had been realized by the germans at that time .
so he decided not to play wagner .
then he decided , together with the bosses of the jewish community in palestine - there was no israeli government at that time - to boycott wagner .
this happened before the shoah .
so , of course it was taken over later , because during the shoah it became clear that hitler was a great admirer of wagner .
not only did he adopt his theories , but he adopted his music as well .
the boycott has never been lifted .
it 's true that sometimes directors have tried to perform wagner in israel .
a man who decided to do it was daniel barenboim who , in a concert with a german orchestra , performed wagner , claiming that it was done spontaneously .
but it 's not true - you can not perform spontaneously with an orchestra .
you would say , then , that if the holocaust had not happened , israel would still have a boycott against wagner ? yes , i think so , because the pogroms happened .
it was not decided after the holocaust , it was decided after the pogroms in 1938 . by the way , there is no official ban .
it 's a sentimental ban .
as long as some of us are still alive , people should refrain from imposing wagner on us .
but we 're the not only ones ; there are many , many israelis who were born after the holocaust who are also against wagner for the same reason . how does this younger generation view wagner ? i do n't even know whether the younger generation is very familiar with wagner .
i do n't think that many young people are fond of wagner .
i 'm convinced they 're not . do you think that the israeli orchestra playing in bayreuth could serve as an act of reconciliation ? we do n't need reconciliation with wagner .
we have reconciliation with germany .
we have nothing against the new german generations .
i go to germany very often ; i lecture in germany .
i lecture on the shoah , but this is a different story .
i have no problem whatsoever , because they 're not the same germans .
but wagner is the same wagner - whether it 's today or 100 years ago , it 's the same wagner with the same theory . does the ban apply to any other composers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1938 night of broken glass was evidence that the nazis 's anti-semitism had turned violent no .
richard strauss was at least as strong an anti-semite as wagner was , but we play strauss . why ? because he is not the father of this -lsb- racial -rsb- theory .
if we banned all anti-semites , we would n't have a lot of writers , poets and composers because most of them were anti-jewish .
i can give you a list of about a hundred .
but we have their books , we read their books , we study their books , we even teach from their books .
the same thing goes for music , but wagner is a different story . have you had the personal experience of listening to wagner 's music ? i know wagner 's music , but i really do n't like this music .
it 's too bombastic for me .
it 's only a joke of course -lsb- laughing -rsb- but it 's music where you can not even sleep in the opera because it 's much too loud . i personally do n't like his music , but i know that he 's a genius without any doubt .
he was one of the greatest composers ever , but this has nothing to do with his theories . interview : kate bowen / ma 'ayan yahbes editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's set to start the ball rolling for similar agreements with other asian countries . the european union and south korea signed a record free-trade agreement in brussels on wednesday .
it 's expected to cut around 3 billion euros ' -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- worth of tariffs and lift administrative barriers and regulations on goods ranging from cars to whisky .
" this agreement is by far the most important trade deal ever concluded be the european union with one country and the first free trade deal with an asian country , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso .
the accord is set to take effect on july 1 , 2011 , once ratified by the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's luxury car industry may cash in on the deal the deal could double trade between europe and south korea by boosting business by 30 billion euros a year .
" the pact sends a strong signal that trade liberalization is a key element for recovery of the world economy , " said eu president herman van rompuy .
the eu runs a deficit with south korea in goods trade , although trends suggest the korean market offers significant growth potential for european firms .
expanding trade with asia the eu hopes that trade liberalization will broaden its influence in asia .
lifting customs duties on imported goods will make imported south korean products cheaper in the eu and eu goods cheaper in south korea .
europe 's spirits industry welcomed the deal for its potential in boosting sales of eu-produced drinks such as scotch whisky and french cognac .
the german luxury car and meat industries also hope to benefit from this arrangement .
italy was initially hesitant about the deal , fearing its national carmaker , fiat , could be outdone by south korea 's kia und hyundai car manufacturers .
but the country dropped its veto in return for delaying the treaty 's implementation until july 1 .
tariffs on some goods , such as small cars , will continue for up to five years thereafter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rompuy : free trade will help economic recovery the eu deal with south korea could trigger a rush among asian states to enter trade pacts with the 27-nation bloc . japan is keen to have better access to european markets .
on tuesday , japanese officials said that they hoped to start free-trade talks with the eu in the spring , partly in reaction to the korean agreement .
as japan and korea are competitors in several industries , japanese manufacturers stand to lose market share in europe 's automotive and electronics markets .
malaysian diplomats said that they , too , had agreed to open free-trade negotiations with the eu .

the two-week ceremony will soon be coming to an end and the spirits of the dead will be released back into hell . for the past dozen days , cambodia 's buddhist temples have been full each morning with people dressed in their finest silk clothes , and weighed down with offerings of food and flowers . people believe that during this annual festival the spirits of the dead are released from hell and able to visit this world . families take food and gifts to thousands of pagodas across the country , where monks chant prayers for the souls of those who died . the venerable hou sarith is a senior monk at wat langka , one of phnom penh ’ s most important temples . he says that pchum ben is a particularly poignant time for many cambodians because the khmer rouge , which ruled the country in the late 1970s under pol pot , caused so many deaths that hardly anyone was left unscathed . " many families in cambodia today who take part in pchum ben lost relatives under the pol pot regime . " the war crimes tribunal that is currently underway estimates that as many as 2.2 million people died under the khmer rouge from a population of around eight million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cambodia has moved on since the khmer rouge but the traumas of that era remain offerings for deceased relatives va kimchheang , a civil servant , has visited nine pagodas to pray and leave offerings for her deceased relatives . " i lost many relations under the pol pot regime , " she says .
" my aunt and my brothers , and there were others too .
i was very young at that time , so i don ’ t remember it well . " va kimchheang has come to wat langka with her two young children , who have both lit incense for family members they never had the chance to meet . upsetting though it is to talk about her loss , va kimchheang says that remembering the dead in this way makes her feel better . " the spirits get all of the food that we offer to the monks .
the young generation makes a wish that the spirits who are in a bad place go to a better place , and wishes for those who are unhappy to be happy . " during this 15-day ceremony , the temple gates open before dawn .
beggars gather at the gates to receive alms , and vendors sell garlands of flowers and incense sticks . taking part in the ceremonies online however , not everyone can get to the country ’ s temples .
many cambodians live overseas , in the united states , canada , europe and australia for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 2.2 million cambodians died under pol pot 's rule from 1975 to 1979 the venerable hou sarith has come up with a solution for them - they can join in online .
his laptop is logged in to a chat room that he set up last year .
some days he leads the services ; other days his colleagues in other countries do . he says the chat room has brought together buddhists from across the world to listen to the pchum ben sermons . away from his room , incense hangs heavy in the air and mixes with the sound of monks chanting prayers . it will be the same again tomorrow , with the monks ensuring that the spirits looking for food continue to get sustenance before they are recalled to hell for another year on october 9 . author : robert carmichael -lrb- phnom penh -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 06.10.2010 brazilian youth orchestra heads from the slums to international stages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sinfonica heliopolis stepped on stage in bonn to the sounds of a samba sinfonica heliopolis was founded by silvio baccarelli in one of latin america 's poorest districts .
today , it is among the world 's best youth orchestras and enjoyed an international debut at the beethovenfest . life in the orchestra seems a bit like in the barracks : getting up early , checking in with the superiors , repeating the same drills over and over , following commands - and being ready to shoulder the blame when something goes wrong .
maintaining that kind of discipline is especially hard when you 're a teenager from the land of sun and fun , as brazil likes to view itself .
but that 's just what the members of brazilian youth orchestra sinfonica heliopolis have been doing day in and day out for the last five years .
the 13 to 25-year-old musicians take pleasure in music through disciplined practice .
changing lives the orchestra began as an initiative of conductor silvio baccarelli .
he founded the center for music education in 1996 in heliopolis , located in the middle of sao paulo and latin america 's second largest slum .
establishing the center in an impoverished area did n't just change the perspectives of the young musicians involved , it changed the entire community .
22-year-old violinist pedro almeida andrade began his musical training at the instituto baccarelli in 2000 .
now , along with a young man named dan rafael lira tolomoni , he shares the position of first violin - the highest in the orchestra 's hierarchy .
as a heliopolis resident , pedro has seen stark changes in his community first hand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestra members range in age from 13 to 25 " culture and music - those things help people get through tough times .
when you see a bunch of kids wearing the institute 's t-shirt and rushing through the streets of the slum to go to practice , it 's impossible not to be moved .
the parents support them , and so does the community - it 's like everyone is pulling together . "
the tricky genius of villa-lobos in the second half of 2010 , sinfonica heliopolis is making its first appearances outside of brazil with performances in germany , england and the netherlands .
roberto tibirica , bacarelli 's successor , conducts during the tour .
one pillar of the orchestra 's repertoire is the work of brazilian composer heiter villa-lobos , particularly a piece titled bachianas brasileiras no. 4 .
tibirica explains why that work remains so difficult to play , 50 years after the composer 's death .
" villa-lobos was a genius and self-taught in everything : he played cello and guitar , he conducted and composed , but everything just seemed to flow forth from him naturally .
for us , that means technical difficulties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 06.10.2010 greens overtake spd as most popular opposition party , poll says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results were the best yet for the greens for the first time since its founding three decades ago , a poll suggests the german green party has overtaken the social democrats in popularity , bolstering the greens ' claim that they are the main opposition party . the 30-year-old green party in germany appeared to have broken a major barrier on wednesday as a poll suggested it has surpassed the older social democratics as the country 's most popular opposition party .
the poll , conducted by berlin-based pollster forsa and sponsored by stern magazine and private broadcaster rtl , found that 24 percent of germans would vote for the greens in an election , up one percentage point from last week .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped two points to 23 percent .
the ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- picked up one more point with 31 percent , while their junior-partner free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took 5 percent .
the left party received 10 percent .
the results were based on responses from 2,501 german voters interviewed between sept .
27 and oct .
1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth and co-chief cem oezdemir have reason to celebrate gaining support by default forsa chief manfred guellner told stern that the spd was focusing on the wrong issues .
for example the criticism of the government 's minimal 5-euro increase in monthly welfare payments appears to be less important to former spd supporters in the middle class .
" the greens are profiting from weaknesses of the other parties , " he said .
" they 're gaining the deserters from the spd , but also from the cdu . "
he added that the greens have also benefitted from the leadership of renate kuenast and juergen tritten , chief and deputy chairs of the greens in parliament respectively .
several other opinion research institutions have found national support for the greens to be somewhat lower , just below the spd around 20 percent .
but many polls suggest the greens are ahead of the spd in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg and in berlin - where they appear to be the strongest party .
not an spd ' satellite or splinter group ' green party chief claudia roth pointed to the poll as evidence that the party has broken out of its previous role on the sidelines and is becoming a major player in german politics on par with the spd and cdu .

the poll , conducted by berlin-based pollster forsa and sponsored by stern magazine and private broadcaster rtl , found that 24 percent of germans would vote for the greens in an election , up one percentage point from last week .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped two points to 23 percent .
the ruling christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- picked up one more point with 31 percent , while their junior-partner free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- took 5 percent .
the left party received 10 percent .
the results were based on responses from 2,501 german voters interviewed between sept .
27 and oct .
1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth and co-chief cem oezdemir have reason to celebrate gaining support by default forsa chief manfred guellner told stern that the spd was focusing on the wrong issues .
for example the criticism of the government 's minimal 5-euro increase in monthly welfare payments appears to be less important to former spd supporters in the middle class .
" the greens are profiting from weaknesses of the other parties , " he said .
" they 're gaining the deserters from the spd , but also from the cdu . "
he added that the greens have also benefitted from the leadership of renate kuenast and juergen tritten , chief and deputy chairs of the greens in parliament respectively .
several other opinion research institutions have found national support for the greens to be somewhat lower , just below the spd around 20 percent .
but many polls suggest the greens are ahead of the spd in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg and in berlin - where they appear to be the strongest party .
not an spd ' satellite or splinter group ' green party chief claudia roth pointed to the poll as evidence that the party has broken out of its previous role on the sidelines and is becoming a major player in german politics on par with the spd and cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens may have benefitted from anti-nuclear sentiment " the time of being the ' junior partners ' is over , " she told daily newspaper rheinische post .
" some former spd supporters still have not yet understood that we are not a satellite or splinter group from them . "

the two-week ceremony will soon be coming to an end and the spirits of the dead will be released back into hell . for the past dozen days , cambodia 's buddhist temples have been full each morning with people dressed in their finest silk clothes , and weighed down with offerings of food and flowers . people believe that during this annual festival the spirits of the dead are released from hell and able to visit this world . families take food and gifts to thousands of pagodas across the country , where monks chant prayers for the souls of those who died . the venerable hou sarith is a senior monk at wat langka , one of phnom penh ’ s most important temples . he says that pchum ben is a particularly poignant time for many cambodians because the khmer rouge , which ruled the country in the late 1970s under pol pot , caused so many deaths that hardly anyone was left unscathed . " many families in cambodia today who take part in pchum ben lost relatives under the pol pot regime . " the war crimes tribunal that is currently underway estimates that as many as 2.2 million people died under the khmer rouge from a population of around eight million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cambodia has moved on since the khmer rouge but the traumas of that era remain offerings for deceased relatives va kimchheang , a civil servant , has visited nine pagodas to pray and leave offerings for her deceased relatives . " i lost many relations under the pol pot regime , " she says .
" my aunt and my brothers , and there were others too .
i was very young at that time , so i don ’ t remember it well . " va kimchheang has come to wat langka with her two young children , who have both lit incense for family members they never had the chance to meet . upsetting though it is to talk about her loss , va kimchheang says that remembering the dead in this way makes her feel better . " the spirits get all of the food that we offer to the monks .
the young generation makes a wish that the spirits who are in a bad place go to a better place , and wishes for those who are unhappy to be happy . " during this 15-day ceremony , the temple gates open before dawn .
beggars gather at the gates to receive alms , and vendors sell garlands of flowers and incense sticks . taking part in the ceremonies online however , not everyone can get to the country ’ s temples .
many cambodians live overseas , in the united states , canada , europe and australia for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 2.2 million cambodians died under pol pot 's rule from 1975 to 1979 the venerable hou sarith has come up with a solution for them - they can join in online .
his laptop is logged in to a chat room that he set up last year .
some days he leads the services ; other days his colleagues in other countries do . he says the chat room has brought together buddhists from across the world to listen to the pchum ben sermons . away from his room , incense hangs heavy in the air and mixes with the sound of monks chanting prayers . it will be the same again tomorrow , with the monks ensuring that the spirits looking for food continue to get sustenance before they are recalled to hell for another year on october 9 . author : robert carmichael -lrb- phnom penh -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think there 's a lot like me that are embarrassed to ask because it makes you look stupid .
our generation just was n't bought up like that .
" it 's about going to places to learn , but thinking they are all going to be young people and then you 're going to feel embarrassed - but hopefully it 's not going to be like that - it 'll be more my age going and it could be like a little get together . "

" they can look up legal fees , they can see what the government are doing , it 's very helpful on the pension and also because i think that more and more and more of everything is going to go only online and i think it 's imperative that people of 55 now need to know what they 're doing so when they 're 70 or 80 they 're able to keep in touch with the real world " that 's what it does , i think it keeps you in touch with the real world .

its capital , quito , once a part of the inca empire , has some of the best-preserved early colonial architecture on the continent .
traditionally a farming country , ecuador 's economy was transformed after the 1960s by the growth of industry and the discovery of oil .
there was rapid growth and progress in health , education and housing .
overview overview facts leaders media please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
but by the end of the 20th century a combination of factors , including falling oil prices and damage caused by the weather phenomenon el nino , had driven the economy into recession .
at-a-glance politics : three presidents have been ousted since 1997 ; current leader rafael correa has pledged to introduce sweeping reforms economy : ecuador exports oil but many people live in poverty ; indigenous groups oppose free trade policies international : free trade talks with us are frozen over a dispute about a us oil firm ; ecuador has complained of border incursions by the colombian military timeline inflation , which had become the highest in the region , led the government to replace the national currency with the us dollar in an effort to curtail it .
not all ecuadorans have benefited equally from oil revenues .
the traditionally dominant spanish-descended elite gained far more than indigenous peoples and those of mixed descent .
steps to stabilise the economy , such as austerity measures and privatisation , have generated widespread unrest , particularly among the indigenous poor .
for a small country , ecuador has many faces .
they include andean peaks , tropical rainforests and - 1,000 km -lrb- 600 miles -rrb- off the coast - the volcanic galapagos islands , home to the animals and birds whose evolutionary adaptations shaped charles darwin 's theories .

president correa has mounted a nationalisation drive in ecuador profile : rafael correa family row hits ecuador 's president he took up his post in january 2007 , joining latin america 's club of left-leaning leaders , including venezuelan president hugo chavez and bolivian president evo morales , who have not been shy in their criticism of the us and who have led a south american nationalisation drive .
mr correa , an outsider with no political party backing , moved quickly to secure the support of voters in a referendum for a special assembly to rewrite the constitution .
he said the new constitution was designed to hand more power to the poor and reduce the role of the traditional parties , whom he blames for the country 's problems .
critics said it was solely aimed at increasing his powers .
despite resistance from the opposition-led congress , the revised constitution was approved by 64 % of voters in a referendum in september 2008 .
the new basic law also allowed mr correa to stand for re-election , enabling him to win a second term with a convincing election victory in april 2009 .
mr correa is against ecuador entering into a free trade pact with the us , saying it would hurt ecuador 's farmers .
talks on such a deal were frozen with his election .
he also refused to extend the us military 's use of the manta air base on the pacific coast for drug surveillance flights after the treaty governing its use expired in 2009 .
in 2010 , mr correa had tear gas fired at him and was trapped inside a hospital for more than 12 hours by protesting policemen before being freed by army forces .
he said the unrest , which started as as a protest against a law scrapping police bonuses , was a coup attempt against him and declared a state of emergency .
later , his government said it would rewrite parts of the law which sparked the protests .
he opposes colombia 's coca crop spraying along their common border as part of a drug eradication programme , saying the spray drifts into ecuador and kills crops - and reportedly also farmers .
rafael correa , centre , with venezuela 's hugo chavez -lrb- left -rrb- and bolivia 's evo morales he has been highly critical of ecuador 's media , which he accuses of trying to undermine his reform programme .
his opponents have accused him of seeking to silence criticism of his policies .
rafael correa obtained his doctorate in economics from the university of illinois in the us in 2001 and was professor at quito 's san francisco university .
he was appointed economy minister in april 2005 but was forced to resign after four months when he failed to consult the president before publicly lambasting the world bank for denying ecuador a loan .
born in 1963 , he spent a year as a volunteer in a poor indian village in the andes mountains and speaks french , english and some quechua .
he has three children with his belgian wife .
media overview facts leaders media private operators dominate the media scene .
radio is the most widely-available medium ; there are hundreds of stations .
some stations in rural areas broadcast in indigenous languages .
latin american soap operas and us series are staple fare on tv , although domestic programme production is on the increase .
the constitution provides for freedom of speech , and journalists are able to report without hindrance .
there have been moves to curb freedom of expression ecuador state seizes tv stations ecuador media moves create waves however , some self-censorship , especially regarding politically-sensitive issues and stories about the armed forces , is exercised .
also , defamation is a criminal offence punishable by up to three years in prison .
thus the media are generally non-confrontational and measured in tone .
under a law which requires the media to give the government free space or air time , governments can and have required tv and radio to broadcast programmes produced by the state .
internet use is limited by high access costs .

president correa has mounted a nationalisation drive in ecuador profile : rafael correa family row hits ecuador 's president he took up his post in january 2007 , joining latin america 's club of left-leaning leaders , including venezuelan president hugo chavez and bolivian president evo morales , who have not been shy in their criticism of the us and who have led a south american nationalisation drive .
mr correa , an outsider with no political party backing , moved quickly to secure the support of voters in a referendum for a special assembly to rewrite the constitution .
he said the new constitution was designed to hand more power to the poor and reduce the role of the traditional parties , whom he blames for the country 's problems .
critics said it was solely aimed at increasing his powers .
despite resistance from the opposition-led congress , the revised constitution was approved by 64 % of voters in a referendum in september 2008 .
the new basic law also allowed mr correa to stand for re-election , enabling him to win a second term with a convincing election victory in april 2009 .
mr correa is against ecuador entering into a free trade pact with the us , saying it would hurt ecuador 's farmers .
talks on such a deal were frozen with his election .
he also refused to extend the us military 's use of the manta air base on the pacific coast for drug surveillance flights after the treaty governing its use expired in 2009 .
in 2010 , mr correa had tear gas fired at him and was trapped inside a hospital for more than 12 hours by protesting policemen before being freed by army forces .
he said the unrest , which started as as a protest against a law scrapping police bonuses , was a coup attempt against him and declared a state of emergency .
later , his government said it would rewrite parts of the law which sparked the protests .
he opposes colombia 's coca crop spraying along their common border as part of a drug eradication programme , saying the spray drifts into ecuador and kills crops - and reportedly also farmers .
rafael correa , centre , with venezuela 's hugo chavez -lrb- left -rrb- and bolivia 's evo morales he has been highly critical of ecuador 's media , which he accuses of trying to undermine his reform programme .
his opponents have accused him of seeking to silence criticism of his policies .
rafael correa obtained his doctorate in economics from the university of illinois in the us in 2001 and was professor at quito 's san francisco university .
he was appointed economy minister in april 2005 but was forced to resign after four months when he failed to consult the president before publicly lambasting the world bank for denying ecuador a loan .
born in 1963 , he spent a year as a volunteer in a poor indian village in the andes mountains and speaks french , english and some quechua .
he has three children with his belgian wife .

president correa has mounted a nationalisation drive in ecuador profile : rafael correa family row hits ecuador 's president he took up his post in january 2007 , joining latin america 's club of left-leaning leaders , including venezuelan president hugo chavez and bolivian president evo morales , who have not been shy in their criticism of the us and who have led a south american nationalisation drive .
mr correa , an outsider with no political party backing , moved quickly to secure the support of voters in a referendum for a special assembly to rewrite the constitution .
he said the new constitution was designed to hand more power to the poor and reduce the role of the traditional parties , whom he blames for the country 's problems .
critics said it was solely aimed at increasing his powers .
despite resistance from the opposition-led congress , the revised constitution was approved by 64 % of voters in a referendum in september 2008 .
the new basic law also allowed mr correa to stand for re-election , enabling him to win a second term with a convincing election victory in april 2009 .
mr correa is against ecuador entering into a free trade pact with the us , saying it would hurt ecuador 's farmers .
talks on such a deal were frozen with his election .
he also refused to extend the us military 's use of the manta air base on the pacific coast for drug surveillance flights after the treaty governing its use expired in 2009 .
in 2010 , mr correa had tear gas fired at him and was trapped inside a hospital for more than 12 hours by protesting policemen before being freed by army forces .
he said the unrest , which started as as a protest against a law scrapping police bonuses , was a coup attempt against him and declared a state of emergency .
later , his government said it would rewrite parts of the law which sparked the protests .
he opposes colombia 's coca crop spraying along their common border as part of a drug eradication programme , saying the spray drifts into ecuador and kills crops - and reportedly also farmers .
rafael correa , centre , with venezuela 's hugo chavez -lrb- left -rrb- and bolivia 's evo morales he has been highly critical of ecuador 's media , which he accuses of trying to undermine his reform programme .
his opponents have accused him of seeking to silence criticism of his policies .
rafael correa obtained his doctorate in economics from the university of illinois in the us in 2001 and was professor at quito 's san francisco university .
he was appointed economy minister in april 2005 but was forced to resign after four months when he failed to consult the president before publicly lambasting the world bank for denying ecuador a loan .
born in 1963 , he spent a year as a volunteer in a poor indian village in the andes mountains and speaks french , english and some quechua .
he has three children with his belgian wife .
