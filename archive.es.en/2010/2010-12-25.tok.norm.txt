now theories that pair psychology with economics have everyone from us president barack obama to steve jobs taking heed . why do we spend 100 euros on a business shirt , but drive around an extra 20 minutes looking for gasoline that 's just a few cents cheaper ? why do we pay off our smallest debts first even if they have the lowest interest rates ? why is it so tough to save for retirement ?
all of these questions find answers in a growing field of research called behavioral economics . if standard economics makes basic assumptions about how people should behave , behavioral economics looks at what people actually do and extrapolates meaning from there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dan ariely outlined many of his theories in his book " predictably irrational " " standard economics assumes that people have ordered and complete preferences . based on those assumptions , we go ahead and make stories about how the world works , " says dan ariely , a professor of behavioral economics at duke university and the author of " predictably irrational " and " the upside of irrationality . " " behavioral economics is interested in the same topics that standard economics is interested in , but we are sort of agnostic to assumptions and instead we believe in data . "
cheat ?
everyone else is ...
researchers like ariely run tests in labs and conduct field experiments to see how people react when presented with different choices and incentives .
often , subjects do n't make the most efficient or rational choices .
for example , behavioral economists find that people will pay more for things when using a credit card because it delays the pain of paying . people cheat more when they think others are cheating too . and when put in different situations , people are willing to pay wildly different amounts for the same items - this goes for a cup of coffee to a new mortgage .
irrational risk-taking ariely says behavioral economics might have remained in the shadow of standard economic theory if it was n't for the financial crisis in 2008 - a massive demonstration of the irrationality of both consumers and wall street traders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis revealed that experts who were supposed to evaluate risk had failed " if we had to choose a marketing campaign for behavioral economics , this would be it , " says ariely . " because here is what happened : we had been doing this research for a long time . i would present it and people would say , ' this is so nice and cute . i will tell my wife about it when i go home for dinner , but clearly the argument would not apply with experts who are being paid lots of money to make really important decisions . and for sure it will never work in the competitive environment on the market . '
as an empirical person , i never had anything to say . "
but then ariely and other well known behavioral economists like cass r. sunstein and richard thaler , the authors of " nudge " , got their real life example . the same risk-taking behavior they saw demonstrated in experiments among university students was mirrored in wall street 's well trained and well paid experts .
what has the crisis taught us ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have we learnt anything ?
americans , for instance , still spend more than they save " i think the financial -lrb- failure -rrb- in such a magnificent way got people to think . that all of those people who were supposed to evaluate risk seem to have failed demonstrated that something very basic is wrong , " says ariely .
" so i think the final crisis has been very useful . now almost three years later , the question is : will we make enough changes ? "
it 's a relevant question . in the united states , the obama administration has embraced behavioral economics when designing new incentive programs for retirement saving and financial oversight , but the impact is unclear . americans are still spending more than they are saving .
wall street is playing the same risky game as ever . so what has changed ? a behavioral economist might say humans ' desire to take risks will never change . a better question might be : what kind of mechanism can we design to save us from our own destructive impulses ? author : caitlan carroll editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the presidents of benin , sierra leone and cape verde plan to travel to ivory coast on tuesday to tell gbagbo on behalf of ecowas " that he must step down as quickly as possible or face legitimate military force , " benin 's foreign minister jean marie ehouzou told reuters news agency on saturday .

"
the leaders said they were planning a meeting of defense chiefs of staff to develop plans for the possible use of force .
on thursday , ecowas announced that its central bank was blocking funds to gbagbo and that access would only be given to ouattara 's " legitimate government . "

the ecowas leaders expressed their " deep concern " for the death and warned " all those responsible that they will face international trials for human rights violations at the earliest opportunity .
there are concerns the country will slip back into conflict after suffering a civil war in 2002 and 2003 .
the united nations said saturday that about 14,000 people have already fled ivory coast for neighboring liberia .
the un , the us , the european union and the african union have all declared ouattara the winner of the elections and his proposed ambassador has been recognized by the un general assembly .

was it a comet ?
perhaps a supernova ?
today , astronomers and physicists still struggle to form a clear image of how the famed star came about . in the bible , only the gospel of the apostle matthew makes reference to the star above that guides the three wise men from the orient to the new-born baby jesus .
it was said to have been a bright , tailed star , and has become the subject of much speculation by scientists and artists alike . on many a canvas and nativity scene , this symbol is shown , beaming and brilliant .
in fact , the yuletide star has often been represented in such a dazzling fashion that many have come to the conclusion it must have been a meteor streaking across the sky . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas star is said to have led the three-wise-men to the baby jesus and why not ?
the sky is littered with such intergalactic objects .
the hale-bopp comet , last witnessed in winter skies back in 1997 , is one such example .
the comet has a diameter of around 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- and moves through space at speeds of more than 44,000 kilometers per second . " with its beautifully bright tail , it looked somewhat like a flying arrow , " says physicist sandra vogel from the olbers planetarium in the northern german city of bremen . despite their beauty , however , comets have been seen as the bearers of bad tidings since time immemorial , which is why many have said that such a dangerous ambassador could not have been chosen to signal the birth of the savior jesus . to cite an example from antiquity , the appearance of halley 's comet over rome in 12 b.c. was largely held responsible for the death of the statesman and general agrippa . stellar explanation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supernova emit enormous amounts of energy " another candidate -lsb- for the christmas star -rsb- would be an exploding star , a supernova , " explains vogel .
" the flash from such an explosion would have illuminated the night sky as bright as day .
and a luminous cloud around the cooling star would still be visible for weeks . " but the physicist counters her own thought : " astronomers have searched the skies in vain for traces of a 2,000-year-old supernova . " how then has this story of the glowing star with a tail in the sky developed ?
what are its origins ? modern astronomers and sky-watchers would tell you it was most likely a special planetary constellation .
the german astronomer johannes kepler -lrb- 1571-1630 -rrb- calculated that in the year 7 b.c. the planets jupiter and saturn where positioned rather uniquely in the solar system . " the classical star hunter kepler saw jupiter as the king of the planets .
saturn , with its characteristic rings , represented israel , " says vogel .
in december 7 b.c. , she explains , both planets seemingly fused together in the sky - as it would have appeared from earth - to form the zodiac of pisces .
" and this zodiac stood for palestine and for birth . " for astronomers and astrologers of that era , the interpretation of this constellation would have been undeniable : in palestine , the long-awaited king of the jews has been born .
they may have also had knowledge of the prophecies of the hebrew bible , which gave bethlehem , the birthplace of the legendary king david , as the birthplace of the new king . attention grabber bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare positioning of planets venus , top left , and jupiter , top right skeptics , however , have argued that two planets , side by side , would not be recognized by onlookers to be anything particularly special among the thousands of other stars in the sky . but for sandra vogel , this argument is weak .
she says that in february 1999 jupiter and venus appeared like a floodlight in the sky when they moved so close to one another that they seemed to touch . according to vogel , hundreds of calls were made to the fire service and the police by excited civilians who thought they 'd just witnessed a ufo . " two small points of light in the sky were enough to grab the attention of so many people , " vogel says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de people -pipe- 25.12.2010 on the road with berlin 's most senior santa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa claus is international , says berlin 's hu ping chen there are around 500 santas in berlin alone but hu ping chen is the most senior among them .
for more than 20 years he has spent christmas on the road handing out presents as santa claus . seven-year-old rhea is excited .
she was just about to go to bed , and now she 's getting to meet santa claus himself . there he stands in his red and white coat , his pointed hat and his big black boots . in fact , it 's not just any santa , it 's berlin 's most famous one .
hu ping chen has been working as a santa claus for the past years .
there are about 500 santas in berlin alone , but hu is the most senior among them .
he trains them , but he also still goes out on the road for handing out presents .
" i first started when a friend asked me if i could help her out .
she worked in a kindergarten and the man who was supposed to play santa claus had backed out , so they needed someone in a pinch , " he recalls .
" i was pretty nervous - i did n't really know what i was doing . but everyone had a good time .
if you 're santa claus , everyone is so happy to see you . everyone becomes a child , and that 's a pretty terrific feeling . "
santa claus is international bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hu is psychologist by day , and santa claus at christmas hu ping chen 's day job is as a psychologist in a hospital .
he was born in berlin to chinese parents , although he does n't speak any chinese himself . they were christians so they celebrated christmas , but the festival seems more like a nice tradition to him now than a religious duty .
" i may look chinese , but when i 'm dressed up as santa claus , nobody asks where i come from .
santa claus is international . "
but he does have to look authentic .
hu ping chen grows a real beard every year from the summer onwards , and he sprays it white for his job as santa .
he paints his cheeks red and fills his sack with golden chocolate coins . he has to be able to improvise and needs to know a lot of christmas songs .
with rhea he sits down to play the song " oh tannenbaum " on the piano .
the little girl tells him she ca n't play the tune perfectly , so hu simply tells her to play not very perfectly .
she works hard on the piano while every else is singing along .
different traditions around the world yet hu 's customers are not just children .
some of the children whom he visited 20 years ago book him for their company christmas party .
after all those years , he knows an awful lot about christmas and its traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 500 santa clauses in berlin alone he knows that americans want to see santa claus on december 25 , and that eastern europeans expect a visit from father frost on new years eve . there 's lots of food at russian gatherings , and you have to give presents to japanese people with two hands .
but he does notice some changes coming about - far more presents are bought and fewer of them are home-made . but one christmas party stands out for him " there was a woman who had inherited some money .
so we gave out presents in a hospice for children .
the woman bought the presents , and we gave them to the children at a beautiful party . it was very moving .
we enjoyed ourselves , but there was a strange feeling , because we knew that for some of the children , this would be their last christmas party . "
but , of course , the main job of a santa claus is not to let sad thoughts take over : children in broken families , where the parents are unemployed , poor children - for 30 minutes they can forget their real problems .
rhea is having a great time .
she 's got a stuffed animal from his bag and has got to sit on his lap . but even santa claus does have to leave eventually . there are still many more families to visit .

was it a comet ?
perhaps a supernova ?
today , astronomers and physicists still struggle to form a clear image of how the famed star came about . in the bible , only the gospel of the apostle matthew makes reference to the star above that guides the three wise men from the orient to the new-born baby jesus .
it was said to have been a bright , tailed star , and has become the subject of much speculation by scientists and artists alike . on many a canvas and nativity scene , this symbol is shown , beaming and brilliant .
in fact , the yuletide star has often been represented in such a dazzling fashion that many have come to the conclusion it must have been a meteor streaking across the sky . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas star is said to have led the three-wise-men to the baby jesus and why not ?
the sky is littered with such intergalactic objects .
the hale-bopp comet , last witnessed in winter skies back in 1997 , is one such example .
the comet has a diameter of around 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- and moves through space at speeds of more than 44,000 kilometers per second . " with its beautifully bright tail , it looked somewhat like a flying arrow , " says physicist sandra vogel from the olbers planetarium in the northern german city of bremen . despite their beauty , however , comets have been seen as the bearers of bad tidings since time immemorial , which is why many have said that such a dangerous ambassador could not have been chosen to signal the birth of the savior jesus . to cite an example from antiquity , the appearance of halley 's comet over rome in 12 b.c. was largely held responsible for the death of the statesman and general agrippa . stellar explanation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supernova emit enormous amounts of energy " another candidate -lsb- for the christmas star -rsb- would be an exploding star , a supernova , " explains vogel .
" the flash from such an explosion would have illuminated the night sky as bright as day .
and a luminous cloud around the cooling star would still be visible for weeks . " but the physicist counters her own thought : " astronomers have searched the skies in vain for traces of a 2,000-year-old supernova . " how then has this story of the glowing star with a tail in the sky developed ?
what are its origins ? modern astronomers and sky-watchers would tell you it was most likely a special planetary constellation .
the german astronomer johannes kepler -lrb- 1571-1630 -rrb- calculated that in the year 7 b.c. the planets jupiter and saturn where positioned rather uniquely in the solar system . " the classical star hunter kepler saw jupiter as the king of the planets .
saturn , with its characteristic rings , represented israel , " says vogel .
in december 7 b.c. , she explains , both planets seemingly fused together in the sky - as it would have appeared from earth - to form the zodiac of pisces .
" and this zodiac stood for palestine and for birth . " for astronomers and astrologers of that era , the interpretation of this constellation would have been undeniable : in palestine , the long-awaited king of the jews has been born .
they may have also had knowledge of the prophecies of the hebrew bible , which gave bethlehem , the birthplace of the legendary king david , as the birthplace of the new king . attention grabber bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare positioning of planets venus , top left , and jupiter , top right skeptics , however , have argued that two planets , side by side , would not be recognized by onlookers to be anything particularly special among the thousands of other stars in the sky . but for sandra vogel , this argument is weak .
she says that in february 1999 jupiter and venus appeared like a floodlight in the sky when they moved so close to one another that they seemed to touch . according to vogel , hundreds of calls were made to the fire service and the police by excited civilians who thought they 'd just witnessed a ufo . " two small points of light in the sky were enough to grab the attention of so many people , " vogel says .

he is appealing against his extradition . alleged serbian war criminal zoran obradovic is being held in germany and is fighting extradition for trial in serbia , the german justice ministry confirmed over the weekend .
" the regional court in frankfurt am main has approved the extradition to serbia , " a spokeswoman said .
but the suspect has lodged an appeal to the german constitutional court , she added .
obradovic was arrested several weeks ago on a serbian warrant , serbian prosecutor vladimir vukcevic said , adding that he expects german officials to hand him over to serbia soon .
obradovic belonged to a notorious paramilitary group called the sakali , or jackals .
he is suspected of taking part in the torture , killing , looting and expulsion of ethnic albanians from the village of cuska , near the western kosovo town of pec , on may 14 , 1999 .
nine other members of the group accused of the same crimes went on trial in belgrade on monday .
the conflict in kosovo , which unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in 2008 , cost the lives of some 13,000 people , mostly ethnic albanians .
serbia contests kosovo 's independence , but the country is now under pressure from the european union as it seeks to join the bloc .
in their bid for membership serbian leaders have increased their efforts to track down accused war criminals and deal with their country 's past .

hu ping chen has been working as a santa claus for the past years .
there are about 500 santas in berlin alone , but hu is the most senior among them .
he trains them , but he also still goes out on the road for handing out presents .
" i first started when a friend asked me if i could help her out .
she worked in a kindergarten and the man who was supposed to play santa claus had backed out , so they needed someone in a pinch , " he recalls .
" i was pretty nervous - i did n't really know what i was doing . but everyone had a good time .

she works hard on the piano while every else is singing along .

some of the children whom he visited 20 years ago book him for their company christmas party .
after all those years , he knows an awful lot about christmas and its traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 500 santa clauses in berlin alone he knows that americans want to see santa claus on december 25 , and that eastern europeans expect a visit from father frost on new years eve . there 's lots of food at russian gatherings , and you have to give presents to japanese people with two hands .
but he does notice some changes coming about - far more presents are bought and fewer of them are home-made . but one christmas party stands out for him " there was a woman who had inherited some money .
so we gave out presents in a hospice for children .
the woman bought the presents , and we gave them to the children at a beautiful party . it was very moving .
we enjoyed ourselves , but there was a strange feeling , because we knew that for some of the children , this would be their last christmas party . "
but , of course , the main job of a santa claus is not to let sad thoughts take over : children in broken families , where the parents are unemployed , poor children - for 30 minutes they can forget their real problems .
rhea is having a great time .
she 's got a stuffed animal from his bag and has got to sit on his lap . but even santa claus does have to leave eventually . there are still many more families to visit .

the leaders said they were planning a meeting of defense chiefs of staff to develop plans for the possible use of force .

she worked in a kindergarten and the man who was supposed to play santa claus had backed out , so they needed someone in a pinch , " he recalls .

but , of course , the main job of a santa claus is not to let sad thoughts take over : children in broken families , where the parents are unemployed , poor children - for 30 minutes they can forget their real problems .
rhea is having a great time .
she 's got a stuffed animal from his bag and has got to sit on his lap . but even santa claus does have to leave eventually . there are still many more families to visit .

for more than 20 years he has spent christmas on the road handing out presents as santa claus . seven-year-old rhea is excited .
she was just about to go to bed , and now she 's getting to meet santa claus himself . there he stands in his red and white coat , his pointed hat and his big black boots . in fact , it 's not just any santa , it 's berlin 's most famous one .
hu ping chen has been working as a santa claus for the past years .
there are about 500 santas in berlin alone , but hu is the most senior among them .
he trains them , but he also still goes out on the road for handing out presents .
" i first started when a friend asked me if i could help her out .
she worked in a kindergarten and the man who was supposed to play santa claus had backed out , so they needed someone in a pinch , " he recalls .
" i was pretty nervous - i did n't really know what i was doing . but everyone had a good time .
if you 're santa claus , everyone is so happy to see you . everyone becomes a child , and that 's a pretty terrific feeling . "
santa claus is international bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hu is psychologist by day , and santa claus at christmas hu ping chen 's day job is as a psychologist in a hospital .
he was born in berlin to chinese parents , although he does n't speak any chinese himself . they were christians so they celebrated christmas , but the festival seems more like a nice tradition to him now than a religious duty .
" i may look chinese , but when i 'm dressed up as santa claus , nobody asks where i come from .
santa claus is international . "
but he does have to look authentic .
hu ping chen grows a real beard every year from the summer onwards , and he sprays it white for his job as santa .
he paints his cheeks red and fills his sack with golden chocolate coins . he has to be able to improvise and needs to know a lot of christmas songs .
with rhea he sits down to play the song " oh tannenbaum " on the piano .
the little girl tells him she ca n't play the tune perfectly , so hu simply tells her to play not very perfectly .
she works hard on the piano while every else is singing along .
different traditions around the world yet hu 's customers are not just children .
some of the children whom he visited 20 years ago book him for their company christmas party .
after all those years , he knows an awful lot about christmas and its traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 500 santa clauses in berlin alone he knows that americans want to see santa claus on december 25 , and that eastern europeans expect a visit from father frost on new years eve . there 's lots of food at russian gatherings , and you have to give presents to japanese people with two hands .
but he does notice some changes coming about - far more presents are bought and fewer of them are home-made . but one christmas party stands out for him " there was a woman who had inherited some money .
so we gave out presents in a hospice for children .
the woman bought the presents , and we gave them to the children at a beautiful party . it was very moving .
we enjoyed ourselves , but there was a strange feeling , because we knew that for some of the children , this would be their last christmas party . "
but , of course , the main job of a santa claus is not to let sad thoughts take over : children in broken families , where the parents are unemployed , poor children - for 30 minutes they can forget their real problems .
rhea is having a great time .
she 's got a stuffed animal from his bag and has got to sit on his lap . but even santa claus does have to leave eventually . there are still many more families to visit .

both men were on the way to mazar-i-sharif and were involved in a project to build a road between the cities of kunduz and kholm . a local police chief confirmed details of the attack , adding that the man had been warned several times not to travel without security protection . " we had advised him several times not go alone and without bodyguards to the district but he did not pay attention , " abdul rauof taj , deputy police chief of balkh province , told the news agency afp . the taliban has claimed responsibility for the attack on their website . ' deeply saddened ' : merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel visited german troops in afghanistan last week german politicians denounced the attack on saturday , calling it cowardly and barbaric and sending their condolences to the family of the victim . " i am deeply saddened by the death of our aid worker and condemn this attack in the strongest terms , " said german chancellor angela merkel . a government spokesman said there are hundreds of german development workers in afghanistan , who merkel said were crucial to the reconstruction of the country . " this attack shows once again how unscrupulous the terrorists are , " said merkel .
" they are n't interested in a better future for the country , but instead want to restore an inhuman dictatorship . " merkel last week visited mazar-i-sharif , the main city in northern afghanistan , where she met with afghan president hamid karzai and general david petraeus , the us commander of the international forces fighting the taliban insurgents . echoing merkel 's comments , german development minister dirk niebel called the attack " cowardly , " saying it was " aimed at the interests of the local population that once again shows the dangers that face civilian reconstruction in afghanistan . " aid workers are increasingly coming under attack in afghanistan .
according to the united nations department of safety and security , the number of attacks on un workers went up 133 percent in 2010 compared to last year . germany has 4,800 troops in afghanistan , most of whom are serving in the north of the country and some in a base at mazar-i-sharif .

in rome , where there was no snow - but heightened security due to terrorist attacks on foreign embassies the day before - pope benedict xvi led the world 's catholics in christmas celebrations friday night , at the traditional midnight mass at st. peter 's basilica .

" unfortunately , weapons can still be heard in many places , " steryinsky said , adding that the arsenals of the world were too full .
in a video message released shortly after german consumers raced to do last-minute christmas shopping , the chairman of the german bishop 's conference , robert zollitsch , spoke out against the commercialization of holiday .
christmas , he said , was more that just " a celebration with a fir tree and the exchange of presents . "

however , zollitsch did stress that a giving spirit was analogous to christmas .
the real meaning of christmas , he said , was god 's love embodied by jesus .
" and we are allowed to pass this love along , " he added .

was it a comet ?
perhaps a supernova ?
today , astronomers and physicists still struggle to form a clear image of how the famed star came about . in the bible , only the gospel of the apostle matthew makes reference to the star above that guides the three wise men from the orient to the new-born baby jesus .
it was said to have been a bright , tailed star , and has become the subject of much speculation by scientists and artists alike . on many a canvas and nativity scene , this symbol is shown , beaming and brilliant .
in fact , the yuletide star has often been represented in such a dazzling fashion that many have come to the conclusion it must have been a meteor streaking across the sky . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas star is said to have led the three-wise-men to the baby jesus and why not ?
the sky is littered with such intergalactic objects .
the hale-bopp comet , last witnessed in winter skies back in 1997 , is one such example .
the comet has a diameter of around 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- and moves through space at speeds of more than 44,000 kilometers per second . " with its beautifully bright tail , it looked somewhat like a flying arrow , " says physicist sandra vogel from the olbers planetarium in the northern german city of bremen . despite their beauty , however , comets have been seen as the bearers of bad tidings since time immemorial , which is why many have said that such a dangerous ambassador could not have been chosen to signal the birth of the savior jesus . to cite an example from antiquity , the appearance of halley 's comet over rome in 12 b.c. was largely held responsible for the death of the statesman and general agrippa . stellar explanation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supernova emit enormous amounts of energy " another candidate -lsb- for the christmas star -rsb- would be an exploding star , a supernova , " explains vogel .
" the flash from such an explosion would have illuminated the night sky as bright as day .
and a luminous cloud around the cooling star would still be visible for weeks . " but the physicist counters her own thought : " astronomers have searched the skies in vain for traces of a 2,000-year-old supernova . " how then has this story of the glowing star with a tail in the sky developed ?
what are its origins ? modern astronomers and sky-watchers would tell you it was most likely a special planetary constellation .
the german astronomer johannes kepler -lrb- 1571-1630 -rrb- calculated that in the year 7 b.c. the planets jupiter and saturn where positioned rather uniquely in the solar system . " the classical star hunter kepler saw jupiter as the king of the planets .
saturn , with its characteristic rings , represented israel , " says vogel .
in december 7 b.c. , she explains , both planets seemingly fused together in the sky - as it would have appeared from earth - to form the zodiac of pisces .
" and this zodiac stood for palestine and for birth . " for astronomers and astrologers of that era , the interpretation of this constellation would have been undeniable : in palestine , the long-awaited king of the jews has been born .
they may have also had knowledge of the prophecies of the hebrew bible , which gave bethlehem , the birthplace of the legendary king david , as the birthplace of the new king . attention grabber bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare positioning of planets venus , top left , and jupiter , top right skeptics , however , have argued that two planets , side by side , would not be recognized by onlookers to be anything particularly special among the thousands of other stars in the sky . but for sandra vogel , this argument is weak .
she says that in february 1999 jupiter and venus appeared like a floodlight in the sky when they moved so close to one another that they seemed to touch . according to vogel , hundreds of calls were made to the fire service and the police by excited civilians who thought they 'd just witnessed a ufo . " two small points of light in the sky were enough to grab the attention of so many people , " vogel says .

" the flash from such an explosion would have illuminated the night sky as bright as day .
and a luminous cloud around the cooling star would still be visible for weeks . " but the physicist counters her own thought : " astronomers have searched the skies in vain for traces of a 2,000-year-old supernova . " how then has this story of the glowing star with a tail in the sky developed ?
what are its origins ? modern astronomers and sky-watchers would tell you it was most likely a special planetary constellation .
the german astronomer johannes kepler -lrb- 1571-1630 -rrb- calculated that in the year 7 b.c. the planets jupiter and saturn where positioned rather uniquely in the solar system . " the classical star hunter kepler saw jupiter as the king of the planets .
saturn , with its characteristic rings , represented israel , " says vogel .
in december 7 b.c. , she explains , both planets seemingly fused together in the sky - as it would have appeared from earth - to form the zodiac of pisces .
" and this zodiac stood for palestine and for birth . " for astronomers and astrologers of that era , the interpretation of this constellation would have been undeniable : in palestine , the long-awaited king of the jews has been born .
they may have also had knowledge of the prophecies of the hebrew bible , which gave bethlehem , the birthplace of the legendary king david , as the birthplace of the new king . attention grabber bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare positioning of planets venus , top left , and jupiter , top right skeptics , however , have argued that two planets , side by side , would not be recognized by onlookers to be anything particularly special among the thousands of other stars in the sky . but for sandra vogel , this argument is weak .
she says that in february 1999 jupiter and venus appeared like a floodlight in the sky when they moved so close to one another that they seemed to touch . according to vogel , hundreds of calls were made to the fire service and the police by excited civilians who thought they 'd just witnessed a ufo . " two small points of light in the sky were enough to grab the attention of so many people , " vogel says .
" why then would people 2,000 years ago have been any less attentive ? " author : andreas ziemons / dfm editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the regional court in frankfurt am main has approved the extradition to serbia , " a spokeswoman said .
but the suspect has lodged an appeal to the german constitutional court , she added .
obradovic was arrested several weeks ago on a serbian warrant , serbian prosecutor vladimir vukcevic said , adding that he expects german officials to hand him over to serbia soon .
obradovic belonged to a notorious paramilitary group called the sakali , or jackals .
he is suspected of taking part in the torture , killing , looting and expulsion of ethnic albanians from the village of cuska , near the western kosovo town of pec , on may 14 , 1999 .
nine other members of the group accused of the same crimes went on trial in belgrade on monday .
the conflict in kosovo , which unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in 2008 , cost the lives of some 13,000 people , mostly ethnic albanians .
serbia contests kosovo 's independence , but the country is now under pressure from the european union as it seeks to join the bloc .
in their bid for membership serbian leaders have increased their efforts to track down accused war criminals and deal with their country 's past .

" jihadists consider the netherlands as a legitimate target because of the dutch presence in afghanistan , even while our mission has ended , " a spokeswoman for the dutch counterterrorism unit nctb said .
" the tougher islam debate is also a factor that shapes jihadists ' view of the netherlands . "
officials did not say when or where the attack was allegedly planned to take place .

was it a comet ?
perhaps a supernova ?
today , astronomers and physicists still struggle to form a clear image of how the famed star came about . in the bible , only the gospel of the apostle matthew makes reference to the star above that guides the three wise men from the orient to the new-born baby jesus .
it was said to have been a bright , tailed star , and has become the subject of much speculation by scientists and artists alike . on many a canvas and nativity scene , this symbol is shown , beaming and brilliant .
in fact , the yuletide star has often been represented in such a dazzling fashion that many have come to the conclusion it must have been a meteor streaking across the sky . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas star is said to have led the three-wise-men to the baby jesus and why not ?
the sky is littered with such intergalactic objects .
the hale-bopp comet , last witnessed in winter skies back in 1997 , is one such example .
the comet has a diameter of around 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- and moves through space at speeds of more than 44,000 kilometers per second . " with its beautifully bright tail , it looked somewhat like a flying arrow , " says physicist sandra vogel from the olbers planetarium in the northern german city of bremen . despite their beauty , however , comets have been seen as the bearers of bad tidings since time immemorial , which is why many have said that such a dangerous ambassador could not have been chosen to signal the birth of the savior jesus . to cite an example from antiquity , the appearance of halley 's comet over rome in 12 b.c. was largely held responsible for the death of the statesman and general agrippa . stellar explanation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supernova emit enormous amounts of energy " another candidate -lsb- for the christmas star -rsb- would be an exploding star , a supernova , " explains vogel .
" the flash from such an explosion would have illuminated the night sky as bright as day .
and a luminous cloud around the cooling star would still be visible for weeks . " but the physicist counters her own thought : " astronomers have searched the skies in vain for traces of a 2,000-year-old supernova . " how then has this story of the glowing star with a tail in the sky developed ?
what are its origins ? modern astronomers and sky-watchers would tell you it was most likely a special planetary constellation .
the german astronomer johannes kepler -lrb- 1571-1630 -rrb- calculated that in the year 7 b.c. the planets jupiter and saturn where positioned rather uniquely in the solar system . " the classical star hunter kepler saw jupiter as the king of the planets .
saturn , with its characteristic rings , represented israel , " says vogel .
in december 7 b.c. , she explains , both planets seemingly fused together in the sky - as it would have appeared from earth - to form the zodiac of pisces .
" and this zodiac stood for palestine and for birth . " for astronomers and astrologers of that era , the interpretation of this constellation would have been undeniable : in palestine , the long-awaited king of the jews has been born .
they may have also had knowledge of the prophecies of the hebrew bible , which gave bethlehem , the birthplace of the legendary king david , as the birthplace of the new king . attention grabber bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare positioning of planets venus , top left , and jupiter , top right skeptics , however , have argued that two planets , side by side , would not be recognized by onlookers to be anything particularly special among the thousands of other stars in the sky . but for sandra vogel , this argument is weak .
she says that in february 1999 jupiter and venus appeared like a floodlight in the sky when they moved so close to one another that they seemed to touch . according to vogel , hundreds of calls were made to the fire service and the police by excited civilians who thought they 'd just witnessed a ufo .

it was said to have been a bright , tailed star , and has become the subject of much speculation by scientists and artists alike . on many a canvas and nativity scene , this symbol is shown , beaming and brilliant .
in fact , the yuletide star has often been represented in such a dazzling fashion that many have come to the conclusion it must have been a meteor streaking across the sky . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas star is said to have led the three-wise-men to the baby jesus and why not ?
the sky is littered with such intergalactic objects .
the hale-bopp comet , last witnessed in winter skies back in 1997 , is one such example .
the comet has a diameter of around 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- and moves through space at speeds of more than 44,000 kilometers per second . " with its beautifully bright tail , it looked somewhat like a flying arrow , " says physicist sandra vogel from the olbers planetarium in the northern german city of bremen . despite their beauty , however , comets have been seen as the bearers of bad tidings since time immemorial , which is why many have said that such a dangerous ambassador could not have been chosen to signal the birth of the savior jesus . to cite an example from antiquity , the appearance of halley 's comet over rome in 12 b.c. was largely held responsible for the death of the statesman and general agrippa . stellar explanation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supernova emit enormous amounts of energy " another candidate -lsb- for the christmas star -rsb- would be an exploding star , a supernova , " explains vogel .
" the flash from such an explosion would have illuminated the night sky as bright as day .
and a luminous cloud around the cooling star would still be visible for weeks . " but the physicist counters her own thought : " astronomers have searched the skies in vain for traces of a 2,000-year-old supernova . " how then has this story of the glowing star with a tail in the sky developed ?
what are its origins ? modern astronomers and sky-watchers would tell you it was most likely a special planetary constellation .
the german astronomer johannes kepler -lrb- 1571-1630 -rrb- calculated that in the year 7 b.c. the planets jupiter and saturn where positioned rather uniquely in the solar system . " the classical star hunter kepler saw jupiter as the king of the planets .
saturn , with its characteristic rings , represented israel , " says vogel .
in december 7 b.c. , she explains , both planets seemingly fused together in the sky - as it would have appeared from earth - to form the zodiac of pisces .
" and this zodiac stood for palestine and for birth . " for astronomers and astrologers of that era , the interpretation of this constellation would have been undeniable : in palestine , the long-awaited king of the jews has been born .
they may have also had knowledge of the prophecies of the hebrew bible , which gave bethlehem , the birthplace of the legendary king david , as the birthplace of the new king . attention grabber bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare positioning of planets venus , top left , and jupiter , top right skeptics , however , have argued that two planets , side by side , would not be recognized by onlookers to be anything particularly special among the thousands of other stars in the sky . but for sandra vogel , this argument is weak .
she says that in february 1999 jupiter and venus appeared like a floodlight in the sky when they moved so close to one another that they seemed to touch . according to vogel , hundreds of calls were made to the fire service and the police by excited civilians who thought they 'd just witnessed a ufo . " two small points of light in the sky were enough to grab the attention of so many people , " vogel says .

church leaders used the holiday as an occasion to call for peace and tolerance . though blizzards have been to blame for several days of traffic chaos across europe , they painted an idyllic backdrop for many who welcomed this year 's white christmas .
in rome , where there was no snow - but heightened security due to terrorist attacks on foreign embassies the day before - pope benedict xvi led the world 's catholics in christmas celebrations friday night , at the traditional midnight mass at st. peter 's basilica .
the ceremony took place under tight security , following parcel bomb attacks at two embassies in the italian capital , as well as the violent intrusion by a mentally disturbed woman at the pontiff 's midnight christmas mass last year .
in his address at the vatican city , the german-born pope prayed for god to punish the world 's " oppressors . "
" lord , make your promise finally come true , " he said . " break the rods of the oppressors .
burn the tramping boots . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was attacked by a swiss woman at a christmas mass last year " let the time of the garments rolled in blood come to an end , " added the pope , speaking exactly one year after a mentally unstable swiss-italian woman dragged him to the ground at the same mass .
the pope emerged unscathed from the incident , which resulted in a broken leg for a french cardinal .
the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics , who is scheduled to eat christmas dinner with some 350 of rome 's homeless , has had a troubled year , clouded by hundreds of accusations against paedophile priests around the world .
in an interview published last month , he likened the crisis to " a volcano out of which suddenly a tremendous cloud of filth came , darkening and soiling everything . "
the 83-year-old german pope has also said he could resign if he felt he was " no longer physically , psychologically and spiritually capable " of leading the catholic church .

catholic archbishop georg sterzinsky meanwhile called for world peace , which he called the " gift of bethlehem " during his address at berlin 's st. hedwig 's cathedral .
" unfortunately , weapons can still be heard in many places , " steryinsky said , adding that the arsenals of the world were too full .
in a video message released shortly after german consumers raced to do last-minute christmas shopping , the chairman of the german bishop 's conference , robert zollitsch , spoke out against the commercialization of holiday .
christmas , he said , was more that just " a celebration with a fir tree and the exchange of presents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the days leading to christmas , germans shopped at traditional markets he added that christians were more than " mere spectators at an idyllic program of festivities complete with good food , gleaming lights and presents . "
however , zollitsch did stress that a giving spirit was analogous to christmas .
the real meaning of christmas , he said , was god 's love embodied by jesus .
" and we are allowed to pass this love along , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de christmas -pipe- 25.12.2010 scientific mystery in the skies above old bethlehem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas star has held the attention of sky-watchers for centuries for centuries , myths have orbited the star of bethlehem .
was it a comet ?
perhaps a supernova ?
today , astronomers and physicists still struggle to form a clear image of how the famed star came about . in the bible , only the gospel of the apostle matthew makes reference to the star above that guides the three wise men from the orient to the new-born baby jesus .
it was said to have been a bright , tailed star , and has become the subject of much speculation by scientists and artists alike . on many a canvas and nativity scene , this symbol is shown , beaming and brilliant .
in fact , the yuletide star has often been represented in such a dazzling fashion that many have come to the conclusion it must have been a meteor streaking across the sky . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas star is said to have led the three-wise-men to the baby jesus and why not ?
the sky is littered with such intergalactic objects .
the hale-bopp comet , last witnessed in winter skies back in 1997 , is one such example .
the comet has a diameter of around 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- and moves through space at speeds of more than 44,000 kilometers per second . " with its beautifully bright tail , it looked somewhat like a flying arrow , " says physicist sandra vogel from the olbers planetarium in the northern german city of bremen . despite their beauty , however , comets have been seen as the bearers of bad tidings since time immemorial , which is why many have said that such a dangerous ambassador could not have been chosen to signal the birth of the savior jesus . to cite an example from antiquity , the appearance of halley 's comet over rome in 12 b.c. was largely held responsible for the death of the statesman and general agrippa . stellar explanation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supernova emit enormous amounts of energy " another candidate -lsb- for the christmas star -rsb- would be an exploding star , a supernova , " explains vogel .
" the flash from such an explosion would have illuminated the night sky as bright as day .
and a luminous cloud around the cooling star would still be visible for weeks . " but the physicist counters her own thought : " astronomers have searched the skies in vain for traces of a 2,000-year-old supernova . " how then has this story of the glowing star with a tail in the sky developed ?
what are its origins ? modern astronomers and sky-watchers would tell you it was most likely a special planetary constellation .
the german astronomer johannes kepler -lrb- 1571-1630 -rrb- calculated that in the year 7 b.c. the planets jupiter and saturn where positioned rather uniquely in the solar system . " the classical star hunter kepler saw jupiter as the king of the planets .
saturn , with its characteristic rings , represented israel , " says vogel .
in december 7 b.c. , she explains , both planets seemingly fused together in the sky - as it would have appeared from earth - to form the zodiac of pisces .
" and this zodiac stood for palestine and for birth . " for astronomers and astrologers of that era , the interpretation of this constellation would have been undeniable : in palestine , the long-awaited king of the jews has been born .
they may have also had knowledge of the prophecies of the hebrew bible , which gave bethlehem , the birthplace of the legendary king david , as the birthplace of the new king . attention grabber bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare positioning of planets venus , top left , and jupiter , top right skeptics , however , have argued that two planets , side by side , would not be recognized by onlookers to be anything particularly special among the thousands of other stars in the sky . but for sandra vogel , this argument is weak .
she says that in february 1999 jupiter and venus appeared like a floodlight in the sky when they moved so close to one another that they seemed to touch . according to vogel , hundreds of calls were made to the fire service and the police by excited civilians who thought they 'd just witnessed a ufo . " two small points of light in the sky were enough to grab the attention of so many people , " vogel says .
" why then would people 2,000 years ago have been any less attentive ? " author : andreas ziemons / dfm editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

church leaders used the holiday as an occasion to call for peace and tolerance . though blizzards have been to blame for several days of traffic chaos across europe , they painted an idyllic backdrop for many who welcomed this year 's white christmas .
in rome , where there was no snow - but heightened security due to terrorist attacks on foreign embassies the day before - pope benedict xvi led the world 's catholics in christmas celebrations friday night , at the traditional midnight mass at st. peter 's basilica .
the ceremony took place under tight security , following parcel bomb attacks at two embassies in the italian capital , as well as the violent intrusion by a mentally disturbed woman at the pontiff 's midnight christmas mass last year .
in his address at the vatican city , the german-born pope prayed for god to punish the world 's " oppressors . "
" lord , make your promise finally come true , " he said . " break the rods of the oppressors .
burn the tramping boots . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was attacked by a swiss woman at a christmas mass last year " let the time of the garments rolled in blood come to an end , " added the pope , speaking exactly one year after a mentally unstable swiss-italian woman dragged him to the ground at the same mass .
the pope emerged unscathed from the incident , which resulted in a broken leg for a french cardinal .
the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics , who is scheduled to eat christmas dinner with some 350 of rome 's homeless , has had a troubled year , clouded by hundreds of accusations against paedophile priests around the world .
in an interview published last month , he likened the crisis to " a volcano out of which suddenly a tremendous cloud of filth came , darkening and soiling everything . "
the 83-year-old german pope has also said he could resign if he felt he was " no longer physically , psychologically and spiritually capable " of leading the catholic church .
earnest messages from german churches church leaders in a snowy germany took a global political view in their christmas eve addresses to followers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch spoke out against the commercialization of christmas protestant bishop markus droege urged asylum for refugees and attention to the growing gap between rich and poor on friday at the berlin cathedral .
catholic archbishop georg sterzinsky meanwhile called for world peace , which he called the " gift of bethlehem " during his address at berlin 's st. hedwig 's cathedral .
" unfortunately , weapons can still be heard in many places , " steryinsky said , adding that the arsenals of the world were too full .
in a video message released shortly after german consumers raced to do last-minute christmas shopping , the chairman of the german bishop 's conference , robert zollitsch , spoke out against the commercialization of holiday .
christmas , he said , was more that just " a celebration with a fir tree and the exchange of presents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the days leading to christmas , germans shopped at traditional markets he added that christians were more than " mere spectators at an idyllic program of festivities complete with good food , gleaming lights and presents . "
however , zollitsch did stress that a giving spirit was analogous to christmas .
the real meaning of christmas , he said , was god 's love embodied by jesus .
" and we are allowed to pass this love along , " he added .

police were acting on a tip from the dutch intelligence and security service , the aivd , the public prosecutor said .
" the -lsb- aivd -rsb- message reports that a number of somalis wanted to make a terrorist attack in the netherlands soon , " the prosecutor said .
a telephone shop and four homes were searched in the terror raid , along with two motel rooms in the south of the country , but no weapons or explosives were found .
six of the 12 men , aged 19 to 48 , lived in rotterdam .
five others had no fixed address and one man had traveled to the netherlands from denmark .

wilders has described islam as a " fascist ideology " and called the prophet muhammad a " barbarian , mass murderer and a pedophile . "
on saturday , wilders said the arrests demonstrate " the enormous vulnerability of the netherlands and the entire free west " to acts of terrorism .
" we must not trivialise this , but fight it firmly with all available means , " he added .

" jihadists consider the netherlands as a legitimate target because of the dutch presence in afghanistan , even while our mission has ended , " a spokeswoman for the dutch counterterrorism unit nctb said .
" the tougher islam debate is also a factor that shapes jihadists ' view of the netherlands . "
officials did not say when or where the attack was allegedly planned to take place .
the men were still be interrogated on saturday .

he is appealing against his extradition . alleged serbian war criminal zoran obradovic is being held in germany and is fighting extradition for trial in serbia , the german justice ministry confirmed over the weekend .
" the regional court in frankfurt am main has approved the extradition to serbia , " a spokeswoman said .
but the suspect has lodged an appeal to the german constitutional court , she added .
obradovic was arrested several weeks ago on a serbian warrant , serbian prosecutor vladimir vukcevic said , adding that he expects german officials to hand him over to serbia soon .
obradovic belonged to a notorious paramilitary group called the sakali , or jackals .
he is suspected of taking part in the torture , killing , looting and expulsion of ethnic albanians from the village of cuska , near the western kosovo town of pec , on may 14 , 1999 .
nine other members of the group accused of the same crimes went on trial in belgrade on monday .
the conflict in kosovo , which unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in 2008 , cost the lives of some 13,000 people , mostly ethnic albanians .
serbia contests kosovo 's independence , but the country is now under pressure from the european union as it seeks to join the bloc .
in their bid for membership serbian leaders have increased their efforts to track down accused war criminals and deal with their country 's past .

he is appealing against his extradition . alleged serbian war criminal zoran obradovic is being held in germany and is fighting extradition for trial in serbia , the german justice ministry confirmed over the weekend .
" the regional court in frankfurt am main has approved the extradition to serbia , " a spokeswoman said .
but the suspect has lodged an appeal to the german constitutional court , she added .
obradovic was arrested several weeks ago on a serbian warrant , serbian prosecutor vladimir vukcevic said , adding that he expects german officials to hand him over to serbia soon .
obradovic belonged to a notorious paramilitary group called the sakali , or jackals .
he is suspected of taking part in the torture , killing , looting and expulsion of ethnic albanians from the village of cuska , near the western kosovo town of pec , on may 14 , 1999 .
nine other members of the group accused of the same crimes went on trial in belgrade on monday .
the conflict in kosovo , which unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in 2008 , cost the lives of some 13,000 people , mostly ethnic albanians .
serbia contests kosovo 's independence , but the country is now under pressure from the european union as it seeks to join the bloc .
in their bid for membership serbian leaders have increased their efforts to track down accused war criminals and deal with their country 's past .

was it a comet ?
perhaps a supernova ?
today , astronomers and physicists still struggle to form a clear image of how the famed star came about . in the bible , only the gospel of the apostle matthew makes reference to the star above that guides the three wise men from the orient to the new-born baby jesus .
it was said to have been a bright , tailed star , and has become the subject of much speculation by scientists and artists alike . on many a canvas and nativity scene , this symbol is shown , beaming and brilliant .
in fact , the yuletide star has often been represented in such a dazzling fashion that many have come to the conclusion it must have been a meteor streaking across the sky . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas star is said to have led the three-wise-men to the baby jesus and why not ?
the sky is littered with such intergalactic objects .
the hale-bopp comet , last witnessed in winter skies back in 1997 , is one such example .
the comet has a diameter of around 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- and moves through space at speeds of more than 44,000 kilometers per second . " with its beautifully bright tail , it looked somewhat like a flying arrow , " says physicist sandra vogel from the olbers planetarium in the northern german city of bremen . despite their beauty , however , comets have been seen as the bearers of bad tidings since time immemorial , which is why many have said that such a dangerous ambassador could not have been chosen to signal the birth of the savior jesus . to cite an example from antiquity , the appearance of halley 's comet over rome in 12 b.c. was largely held responsible for the death of the statesman and general agrippa . stellar explanation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supernova emit enormous amounts of energy " another candidate -lsb- for the christmas star -rsb- would be an exploding star , a supernova , " explains vogel .
" the flash from such an explosion would have illuminated the night sky as bright as day .
and a luminous cloud around the cooling star would still be visible for weeks . " but the physicist counters her own thought : " astronomers have searched the skies in vain for traces of a 2,000-year-old supernova . " how then has this story of the glowing star with a tail in the sky developed ?
what are its origins ? modern astronomers and sky-watchers would tell you it was most likely a special planetary constellation .
the german astronomer johannes kepler -lrb- 1571-1630 -rrb- calculated that in the year 7 b.c. the planets jupiter and saturn where positioned rather uniquely in the solar system . " the classical star hunter kepler saw jupiter as the king of the planets .
saturn , with its characteristic rings , represented israel , " says vogel .
in december 7 b.c. , she explains , both planets seemingly fused together in the sky - as it would have appeared from earth - to form the zodiac of pisces .
" and this zodiac stood for palestine and for birth . " for astronomers and astrologers of that era , the interpretation of this constellation would have been undeniable : in palestine , the long-awaited king of the jews has been born .
they may have also had knowledge of the prophecies of the hebrew bible , which gave bethlehem , the birthplace of the legendary king david , as the birthplace of the new king . attention grabber bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare positioning of planets venus , top left , and jupiter , top right skeptics , however , have argued that two planets , side by side , would not be recognized by onlookers to be anything particularly special among the thousands of other stars in the sky . but for sandra vogel , this argument is weak .
she says that in february 1999 jupiter and venus appeared like a floodlight in the sky when they moved so close to one another that they seemed to touch . according to vogel , hundreds of calls were made to the fire service and the police by excited civilians who thought they 'd just witnessed a ufo .

was it a comet ?
perhaps a supernova ?
today , astronomers and physicists still struggle to form a clear image of how the famed star came about . in the bible , only the gospel of the apostle matthew makes reference to the star above that guides the three wise men from the orient to the new-born baby jesus .
it was said to have been a bright , tailed star , and has become the subject of much speculation by scientists and artists alike . on many a canvas and nativity scene , this symbol is shown , beaming and brilliant .
in fact , the yuletide star has often been represented in such a dazzling fashion that many have come to the conclusion it must have been a meteor streaking across the sky . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas star is said to have led the three-wise-men to the baby jesus and why not ?
the sky is littered with such intergalactic objects .
the hale-bopp comet , last witnessed in winter skies back in 1997 , is one such example .
the comet has a diameter of around 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- and moves through space at speeds of more than 44,000 kilometers per second . " with its beautifully bright tail , it looked somewhat like a flying arrow , " says physicist sandra vogel from the olbers planetarium in the northern german city of bremen . despite their beauty , however , comets have been seen as the bearers of bad tidings since time immemorial , which is why many have said that such a dangerous ambassador could not have been chosen to signal the birth of the savior jesus . to cite an example from antiquity , the appearance of halley 's comet over rome in 12 b.c. was largely held responsible for the death of the statesman and general agrippa . stellar explanation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supernova emit enormous amounts of energy " another candidate -lsb- for the christmas star -rsb- would be an exploding star , a supernova , " explains vogel .
" the flash from such an explosion would have illuminated the night sky as bright as day .
and a luminous cloud around the cooling star would still be visible for weeks . " but the physicist counters her own thought : " astronomers have searched the skies in vain for traces of a 2,000-year-old supernova . " how then has this story of the glowing star with a tail in the sky developed ?
what are its origins ? modern astronomers and sky-watchers would tell you it was most likely a special planetary constellation .
the german astronomer johannes kepler -lrb- 1571-1630 -rrb- calculated that in the year 7 b.c. the planets jupiter and saturn where positioned rather uniquely in the solar system . " the classical star hunter kepler saw jupiter as the king of the planets .
saturn , with its characteristic rings , represented israel , " says vogel .
in december 7 b.c. , she explains , both planets seemingly fused together in the sky - as it would have appeared from earth - to form the zodiac of pisces .
" and this zodiac stood for palestine and for birth . " for astronomers and astrologers of that era , the interpretation of this constellation would have been undeniable : in palestine , the long-awaited king of the jews has been born .
they may have also had knowledge of the prophecies of the hebrew bible , which gave bethlehem , the birthplace of the legendary king david , as the birthplace of the new king . attention grabber bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare positioning of planets venus , top left , and jupiter , top right skeptics , however , have argued that two planets , side by side , would not be recognized by onlookers to be anything particularly special among the thousands of other stars in the sky . but for sandra vogel , this argument is weak .
she says that in february 1999 jupiter and venus appeared like a floodlight in the sky when they moved so close to one another that they seemed to touch . according to vogel , hundreds of calls were made to the fire service and the police by excited civilians who thought they 'd just witnessed a ufo . " two small points of light in the sky were enough to grab the attention of so many people , " vogel says .

both men were on the way to mazar-i-sharif and were involved in a project to build a road between the cities of kunduz and kholm . a local police chief confirmed details of the attack , adding that the man had been warned several times not to travel without security protection . " we had advised him several times not go alone and without bodyguards to the district but he did not pay attention , " abdul rauof taj , deputy police chief of balkh province , told the news agency afp . the taliban has claimed responsibility for the attack on their website .

" i am deeply saddened by the death of our aid worker and condemn this attack in the strongest terms , " said german chancellor angela merkel . a government spokesman said there are hundreds of german development workers in afghanistan , who merkel said were crucial to the reconstruction of the country . " this attack shows once again how unscrupulous the terrorists are , " said merkel .
" they are n't interested in a better future for the country , but instead want to restore an inhuman dictatorship . " merkel last week visited mazar-i-sharif , the main city in northern afghanistan , where she met with afghan president hamid karzai and general david petraeus , the us commander of the international forces fighting the taliban insurgents . echoing merkel 's comments , german development minister dirk niebel called the attack " cowardly , " saying it was " aimed at the interests of the local population that once again shows the dangers that face civilian reconstruction in afghanistan . " aid workers are increasingly coming under attack in afghanistan .
according to the united nations department of safety and security , the number of attacks on un workers went up 133 percent in 2010 compared to last year . germany has 4,800 troops in afghanistan , most of whom are serving in the north of the country and some in a base at mazar-i-sharif .

church leaders used the holiday as an occasion to call for peace and tolerance . though blizzards have been to blame for several days of traffic chaos across europe , they painted an idyllic backdrop for many who welcomed this year 's white christmas .
in rome , where there was no snow - but heightened security due to terrorist attacks on foreign embassies the day before - pope benedict xvi led the world 's catholics in christmas celebrations friday night , at the traditional midnight mass at st. peter 's basilica .
the ceremony took place under tight security , following parcel bomb attacks at two embassies in the italian capital , as well as the violent intrusion by a mentally disturbed woman at the pontiff 's midnight christmas mass last year .
in his address at the vatican city , the german-born pope prayed for god to punish the world 's " oppressors . "
" lord , make your promise finally come true , " he said . " break the rods of the oppressors .
burn the tramping boots . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was attacked by a swiss woman at a christmas mass last year " let the time of the garments rolled in blood come to an end , " added the pope , speaking exactly one year after a mentally unstable swiss-italian woman dragged him to the ground at the same mass .
the pope emerged unscathed from the incident , which resulted in a broken leg for a french cardinal .
the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics , who is scheduled to eat christmas dinner with some 350 of rome 's homeless , has had a troubled year , clouded by hundreds of accusations against paedophile priests around the world .
in an interview published last month , he likened the crisis to " a volcano out of which suddenly a tremendous cloud of filth came , darkening and soiling everything . "
the 83-year-old german pope has also said he could resign if he felt he was " no longer physically , psychologically and spiritually capable " of leading the catholic church .
earnest messages from german churches church leaders in a snowy germany took a global political view in their christmas eve addresses to followers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch spoke out against the commercialization of christmas protestant bishop markus droege urged asylum for refugees and attention to the growing gap between rich and poor on friday at the berlin cathedral .
catholic archbishop georg sterzinsky meanwhile called for world peace , which he called the " gift of bethlehem " during his address at berlin 's st. hedwig 's cathedral .
" unfortunately , weapons can still be heard in many places , " steryinsky said , adding that the arsenals of the world were too full .
in a video message released shortly after german consumers raced to do last-minute christmas shopping , the chairman of the german bishop 's conference , robert zollitsch , spoke out against the commercialization of holiday .
christmas , he said , was more that just " a celebration with a fir tree and the exchange of presents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the days leading to christmas , germans shopped at traditional markets he added that christians were more than " mere spectators at an idyllic program of festivities complete with good food , gleaming lights and presents . "
however , zollitsch did stress that a giving spirit was analogous to christmas .
the real meaning of christmas , he said , was god 's love embodied by jesus .
" and we are allowed to pass this love along , " he added .

church leaders used the holiday as an occasion to call for peace and tolerance . though blizzards have been to blame for several days of traffic chaos across europe , they painted an idyllic backdrop for many who welcomed this year 's white christmas .
in rome , where there was no snow - but heightened security due to terrorist attacks on foreign embassies the day before - pope benedict xvi led the world 's catholics in christmas celebrations friday night , at the traditional midnight mass at st. peter 's basilica .
the ceremony took place under tight security , following parcel bomb attacks at two embassies in the italian capital , as well as the violent intrusion by a mentally disturbed woman at the pontiff 's midnight christmas mass last year .
in his address at the vatican city , the german-born pope prayed for god to punish the world 's " oppressors . "
" lord , make your promise finally come true , " he said . " break the rods of the oppressors .
burn the tramping boots . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was attacked by a swiss woman at a christmas mass last year " let the time of the garments rolled in blood come to an end , " added the pope , speaking exactly one year after a mentally unstable swiss-italian woman dragged him to the ground at the same mass .
the pope emerged unscathed from the incident , which resulted in a broken leg for a french cardinal .
the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics , who is scheduled to eat christmas dinner with some 350 of rome 's homeless , has had a troubled year , clouded by hundreds of accusations against paedophile priests around the world .
in an interview published last month , he likened the crisis to " a volcano out of which suddenly a tremendous cloud of filth came , darkening and soiling everything . "
the 83-year-old german pope has also said he could resign if he felt he was " no longer physically , psychologically and spiritually capable " of leading the catholic church .

" unfortunately , weapons can still be heard in many places , " steryinsky said , adding that the arsenals of the world were too full .
in a video message released shortly after german consumers raced to do last-minute christmas shopping , the chairman of the german bishop 's conference , robert zollitsch , spoke out against the commercialization of holiday .
christmas , he said , was more that just " a celebration with a fir tree and the exchange of presents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the days leading to christmas , germans shopped at traditional markets he added that christians were more than " mere spectators at an idyllic program of festivities complete with good food , gleaming lights and presents . "
however , zollitsch did stress that a giving spirit was analogous to christmas .
the real meaning of christmas , he said , was god 's love embodied by jesus .
" and we are allowed to pass this love along , " he added .

church leaders used the holiday as an occasion to call for peace and tolerance . though blizzards have been to blame for several days of traffic chaos across europe , they painted an idyllic backdrop for many who welcomed this year 's white christmas .
in rome , where there was no snow - but heightened security due to terrorist attacks on foreign embassies the day before - pope benedict xvi led the world 's catholics in christmas celebrations friday night , at the traditional midnight mass at st. peter 's basilica .
the ceremony took place under tight security , following parcel bomb attacks at two embassies in the italian capital , as well as the violent intrusion by a mentally disturbed woman at the pontiff 's midnight christmas mass last year .
in his address at the vatican city , the german-born pope prayed for god to punish the world 's " oppressors . "
" lord , make your promise finally come true , " he said . " break the rods of the oppressors .
burn the tramping boots . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was attacked by a swiss woman at a christmas mass last year " let the time of the garments rolled in blood come to an end , " added the pope , speaking exactly one year after a mentally unstable swiss-italian woman dragged him to the ground at the same mass .
the pope emerged unscathed from the incident , which resulted in a broken leg for a french cardinal .
the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics , who is scheduled to eat christmas dinner with some 350 of rome 's homeless , has had a troubled year , clouded by hundreds of accusations against paedophile priests around the world .
in an interview published last month , he likened the crisis to " a volcano out of which suddenly a tremendous cloud of filth came , darkening and soiling everything . "
the 83-year-old german pope has also said he could resign if he felt he was " no longer physically , psychologically and spiritually capable " of leading the catholic church .
earnest messages from german churches church leaders in a snowy germany took a global political view in their christmas eve addresses to followers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch spoke out against the commercialization of christmas protestant bishop markus droege urged asylum for refugees and attention to the growing gap between rich and poor on friday at the berlin cathedral .
catholic archbishop georg sterzinsky meanwhile called for world peace , which he called the " gift of bethlehem " during his address at berlin 's st. hedwig 's cathedral .
" unfortunately , weapons can still be heard in many places , " steryinsky said , adding that the arsenals of the world were too full .
in a video message released shortly after german consumers raced to do last-minute christmas shopping , the chairman of the german bishop 's conference , robert zollitsch , spoke out against the commercialization of holiday .
christmas , he said , was more that just " a celebration with a fir tree and the exchange of presents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the days leading to christmas , germans shopped at traditional markets he added that christians were more than " mere spectators at an idyllic program of festivities complete with good food , gleaming lights and presents . "
however , zollitsch did stress that a giving spirit was analogous to christmas .
the real meaning of christmas , he said , was god 's love embodied by jesus .
" and we are allowed to pass this love along , " he added .

he is appealing against his extradition . alleged serbian war criminal zoran obradovic is being held in germany and is fighting extradition for trial in serbia , the german justice ministry confirmed over the weekend .
" the regional court in frankfurt am main has approved the extradition to serbia , " a spokeswoman said .
but the suspect has lodged an appeal to the german constitutional court , she added .
obradovic was arrested several weeks ago on a serbian warrant , serbian prosecutor vladimir vukcevic said , adding that he expects german officials to hand him over to serbia soon .
obradovic belonged to a notorious paramilitary group called the sakali , or jackals .
he is suspected of taking part in the torture , killing , looting and expulsion of ethnic albanians from the village of cuska , near the western kosovo town of pec , on may 14 , 1999 .
nine other members of the group accused of the same crimes went on trial in belgrade on monday .
the conflict in kosovo , which unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in 2008 , cost the lives of some 13,000 people , mostly ethnic albanians .
serbia contests kosovo 's independence , but the country is now under pressure from the european union as it seeks to join the bloc .
in their bid for membership serbian leaders have increased their efforts to track down accused war criminals and deal with their country 's past .

church leaders used the holiday as an occasion to call for peace and tolerance . though blizzards have been to blame for several days of traffic chaos across europe , they painted an idyllic backdrop for many who welcomed this year 's white christmas .
in rome , where there was no snow - but heightened security due to terrorist attacks on foreign embassies the day before - pope benedict xvi led the world 's catholics in christmas celebrations friday night , at the traditional midnight mass at st. peter 's basilica .
the ceremony took place under tight security , following parcel bomb attacks at two embassies in the italian capital , as well as the violent intrusion by a mentally disturbed woman at the pontiff 's midnight christmas mass last year .
in his address at the vatican city , the german-born pope prayed for god to punish the world 's " oppressors . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was attacked by a swiss woman at a christmas mass last year " let the time of the garments rolled in blood come to an end , " added the pope , speaking exactly one year after a mentally unstable swiss-italian woman dragged him to the ground at the same mass .
the pope emerged unscathed from the incident , which resulted in a broken leg for a french cardinal .
the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics , who is scheduled to eat christmas dinner with some 350 of rome 's homeless , has had a troubled year , clouded by hundreds of accusations against paedophile priests around the world .
in an interview published last month , he likened the crisis to " a volcano out of which suddenly a tremendous cloud of filth came , darkening and soiling everything . "
the 83-year-old german pope has also said he could resign if he felt he was " no longer physically , psychologically and spiritually capable " of leading the catholic church .

catholic archbishop georg sterzinsky meanwhile called for world peace , which he called the " gift of bethlehem " during his address at berlin 's st. hedwig 's cathedral .
" unfortunately , weapons can still be heard in many places , " steryinsky said , adding that the arsenals of the world were too full .
in a video message released shortly after german consumers raced to do last-minute christmas shopping , the chairman of the german bishop 's conference , robert zollitsch , spoke out against the commercialization of holiday .
christmas , he said , was more that just " a celebration with a fir tree and the exchange of presents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the days leading to christmas , germans shopped at traditional markets he added that christians were more than " mere spectators at an idyllic program of festivities complete with good food , gleaming lights and presents . "
however , zollitsch did stress that a giving spirit was analogous to christmas .
the real meaning of christmas , he said , was god 's love embodied by jesus .
" and we are allowed to pass this love along , " he added .

today , astronomers and physicists still struggle to form a clear image of how the famed star came about . in the bible , only the gospel of the apostle matthew makes reference to the star above that guides the three wise men from the orient to the new-born baby jesus .
it was said to have been a bright , tailed star , and has become the subject of much speculation by scientists and artists alike . on many a canvas and nativity scene , this symbol is shown , beaming and brilliant .
in fact , the yuletide star has often been represented in such a dazzling fashion that many have come to the conclusion it must have been a meteor streaking across the sky . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas star is said to have led the three-wise-men to the baby jesus and why not ?
the sky is littered with such intergalactic objects .
the hale-bopp comet , last witnessed in winter skies back in 1997 , is one such example .
the comet has a diameter of around 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- and moves through space at speeds of more than 44,000 kilometers per second . " with its beautifully bright tail , it looked somewhat like a flying arrow , " says physicist sandra vogel from the olbers planetarium in the northern german city of bremen . despite their beauty , however , comets have been seen as the bearers of bad tidings since time immemorial , which is why many have said that such a dangerous ambassador could not have been chosen to signal the birth of the savior jesus . to cite an example from antiquity , the appearance of halley 's comet over rome in 12 b.c. was largely held responsible for the death of the statesman and general agrippa . stellar explanation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supernova emit enormous amounts of energy " another candidate -lsb- for the christmas star -rsb- would be an exploding star , a supernova , " explains vogel .
" the flash from such an explosion would have illuminated the night sky as bright as day .
and a luminous cloud around the cooling star would still be visible for weeks . " but the physicist counters her own thought : " astronomers have searched the skies in vain for traces of a 2,000-year-old supernova . " how then has this story of the glowing star with a tail in the sky developed ?
what are its origins ? modern astronomers and sky-watchers would tell you it was most likely a special planetary constellation .
the german astronomer johannes kepler -lrb- 1571-1630 -rrb- calculated that in the year 7 b.c. the planets jupiter and saturn where positioned rather uniquely in the solar system . " the classical star hunter kepler saw jupiter as the king of the planets .
saturn , with its characteristic rings , represented israel , " says vogel .
in december 7 b.c. , she explains , both planets seemingly fused together in the sky - as it would have appeared from earth - to form the zodiac of pisces .
" and this zodiac stood for palestine and for birth . " for astronomers and astrologers of that era , the interpretation of this constellation would have been undeniable : in palestine , the long-awaited king of the jews has been born .
they may have also had knowledge of the prophecies of the hebrew bible , which gave bethlehem , the birthplace of the legendary king david , as the birthplace of the new king . attention grabber bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare positioning of planets venus , top left , and jupiter , top right skeptics , however , have argued that two planets , side by side , would not be recognized by onlookers to be anything particularly special among the thousands of other stars in the sky . but for sandra vogel , this argument is weak .
she says that in february 1999 jupiter and venus appeared like a floodlight in the sky when they moved so close to one another that they seemed to touch . according to vogel , hundreds of calls were made to the fire service and the police by excited civilians who thought they 'd just witnessed a ufo .

for more than 20 years he has spent christmas on the road handing out presents as santa claus . seven-year-old rhea is excited .
she was just about to go to bed , and now she 's getting to meet santa claus himself . there he stands in his red and white coat , his pointed hat and his big black boots . in fact , it 's not just any santa , it 's berlin 's most famous one .
hu ping chen has been working as a santa claus for the past years .
there are about 500 santas in berlin alone , but hu is the most senior among them .
he trains them , but he also still goes out on the road for handing out presents .
" i first started when a friend asked me if i could help her out .
she worked in a kindergarten and the man who was supposed to play santa claus had backed out , so they needed someone in a pinch , " he recalls .
" i was pretty nervous - i did n't really know what i was doing . but everyone had a good time .
if you 're santa claus , everyone is so happy to see you . everyone becomes a child , and that 's a pretty terrific feeling . "
santa claus is international bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hu is psychologist by day , and santa claus at christmas hu ping chen 's day job is as a psychologist in a hospital .
he was born in berlin to chinese parents , although he does n't speak any chinese himself . they were christians so they celebrated christmas , but the festival seems more like a nice tradition to him now than a religious duty .
" i may look chinese , but when i 'm dressed up as santa claus , nobody asks where i come from .
santa claus is international . "
but he does have to look authentic .
hu ping chen grows a real beard every year from the summer onwards , and he sprays it white for his job as santa .
he paints his cheeks red and fills his sack with golden chocolate coins . he has to be able to improvise and needs to know a lot of christmas songs .
with rhea he sits down to play the song " oh tannenbaum " on the piano .
the little girl tells him she ca n't play the tune perfectly , so hu simply tells her to play not very perfectly .
she works hard on the piano while every else is singing along .
different traditions around the world yet hu 's customers are not just children .
some of the children whom he visited 20 years ago book him for their company christmas party .
after all those years , he knows an awful lot about christmas and its traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 500 santa clauses in berlin alone he knows that americans want to see santa claus on december 25 , and that eastern europeans expect a visit from father frost on new years eve . there 's lots of food at russian gatherings , and you have to give presents to japanese people with two hands .
but he does notice some changes coming about - far more presents are bought and fewer of them are home-made . but one christmas party stands out for him " there was a woman who had inherited some money .
so we gave out presents in a hospice for children .
the woman bought the presents , and we gave them to the children at a beautiful party . it was very moving .
we enjoyed ourselves , but there was a strange feeling , because we knew that for some of the children , this would be their last christmas party . "
but , of course , the main job of a santa claus is not to let sad thoughts take over : children in broken families , where the parents are unemployed , poor children - for 30 minutes they can forget their real problems .
rhea is having a great time .
she 's got a stuffed animal from his bag and has got to sit on his lap . but even santa claus does have to leave eventually . there are still many more families to visit .

he is appealing against his extradition . alleged serbian war criminal zoran obradovic is being held in germany and is fighting extradition for trial in serbia , the german justice ministry confirmed over the weekend .
" the regional court in frankfurt am main has approved the extradition to serbia , " a spokeswoman said .
but the suspect has lodged an appeal to the german constitutional court , she added .
obradovic was arrested several weeks ago on a serbian warrant , serbian prosecutor vladimir vukcevic said , adding that he expects german officials to hand him over to serbia soon .
obradovic belonged to a notorious paramilitary group called the sakali , or jackals .
he is suspected of taking part in the torture , killing , looting and expulsion of ethnic albanians from the village of cuska , near the western kosovo town of pec , on may 14 , 1999 .
nine other members of the group accused of the same crimes went on trial in belgrade on monday .
the conflict in kosovo , which unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in 2008 , cost the lives of some 13,000 people , mostly ethnic albanians .
serbia contests kosovo 's independence , but the country is now under pressure from the european union as it seeks to join the bloc .
in their bid for membership serbian leaders have increased their efforts to track down accused war criminals and deal with their country 's past .

was it a comet ?
perhaps a supernova ?
today , astronomers and physicists still struggle to form a clear image of how the famed star came about . in the bible , only the gospel of the apostle matthew makes reference to the star above that guides the three wise men from the orient to the new-born baby jesus .
it was said to have been a bright , tailed star , and has become the subject of much speculation by scientists and artists alike . on many a canvas and nativity scene , this symbol is shown , beaming and brilliant .
in fact , the yuletide star has often been represented in such a dazzling fashion that many have come to the conclusion it must have been a meteor streaking across the sky . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas star is said to have led the three-wise-men to the baby jesus and why not ?
the sky is littered with such intergalactic objects .
the hale-bopp comet , last witnessed in winter skies back in 1997 , is one such example .
the comet has a diameter of around 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- and moves through space at speeds of more than 44,000 kilometers per second . " with its beautifully bright tail , it looked somewhat like a flying arrow , " says physicist sandra vogel from the olbers planetarium in the northern german city of bremen . despite their beauty , however , comets have been seen as the bearers of bad tidings since time immemorial , which is why many have said that such a dangerous ambassador could not have been chosen to signal the birth of the savior jesus . to cite an example from antiquity , the appearance of halley 's comet over rome in 12 b.c. was largely held responsible for the death of the statesman and general agrippa . stellar explanation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supernova emit enormous amounts of energy " another candidate -lsb- for the christmas star -rsb- would be an exploding star , a supernova , " explains vogel .
" the flash from such an explosion would have illuminated the night sky as bright as day .
and a luminous cloud around the cooling star would still be visible for weeks . " but the physicist counters her own thought : " astronomers have searched the skies in vain for traces of a 2,000-year-old supernova . " how then has this story of the glowing star with a tail in the sky developed ?
what are its origins ? modern astronomers and sky-watchers would tell you it was most likely a special planetary constellation .
the german astronomer johannes kepler -lrb- 1571-1630 -rrb- calculated that in the year 7 b.c. the planets jupiter and saturn where positioned rather uniquely in the solar system . " the classical star hunter kepler saw jupiter as the king of the planets .
saturn , with its characteristic rings , represented israel , " says vogel .
in december 7 b.c. , she explains , both planets seemingly fused together in the sky - as it would have appeared from earth - to form the zodiac of pisces .
" and this zodiac stood for palestine and for birth . " for astronomers and astrologers of that era , the interpretation of this constellation would have been undeniable : in palestine , the long-awaited king of the jews has been born .
they may have also had knowledge of the prophecies of the hebrew bible , which gave bethlehem , the birthplace of the legendary king david , as the birthplace of the new king . attention grabber bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare positioning of planets venus , top left , and jupiter , top right skeptics , however , have argued that two planets , side by side , would not be recognized by onlookers to be anything particularly special among the thousands of other stars in the sky . but for sandra vogel , this argument is weak .
she says that in february 1999 jupiter and venus appeared like a floodlight in the sky when they moved so close to one another that they seemed to touch . according to vogel , hundreds of calls were made to the fire service and the police by excited civilians who thought they 'd just witnessed a ufo . " two small points of light in the sky were enough to grab the attention of so many people , " vogel says .

was it a comet ?

today , astronomers and physicists still struggle to form a clear image of how the famed star came about . in the bible , only the gospel of the apostle matthew makes reference to the star above that guides the three wise men from the orient to the new-born baby jesus .
it was said to have been a bright , tailed star , and has become the subject of much speculation by scientists and artists alike . on many a canvas and nativity scene , this symbol is shown , beaming and brilliant .
in fact , the yuletide star has often been represented in such a dazzling fashion that many have come to the conclusion it must have been a meteor streaking across the sky . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas star is said to have led the three-wise-men to the baby jesus and why not ?
the sky is littered with such intergalactic objects .
the hale-bopp comet , last witnessed in winter skies back in 1997 , is one such example .
the comet has a diameter of around 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- and moves through space at speeds of more than 44,000 kilometers per second . " with its beautifully bright tail , it looked somewhat like a flying arrow , " says physicist sandra vogel from the olbers planetarium in the northern german city of bremen . despite their beauty , however , comets have been seen as the bearers of bad tidings since time immemorial , which is why many have said that such a dangerous ambassador could not have been chosen to signal the birth of the savior jesus . to cite an example from antiquity , the appearance of halley 's comet over rome in 12 b.c. was largely held responsible for the death of the statesman and general agrippa . stellar explanation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supernova emit enormous amounts of energy " another candidate -lsb- for the christmas star -rsb- would be an exploding star , a supernova , " explains vogel .
" the flash from such an explosion would have illuminated the night sky as bright as day .
and a luminous cloud around the cooling star would still be visible for weeks . " but the physicist counters her own thought : " astronomers have searched the skies in vain for traces of a 2,000-year-old supernova . " how then has this story of the glowing star with a tail in the sky developed ?
what are its origins ? modern astronomers and sky-watchers would tell you it was most likely a special planetary constellation .
the german astronomer johannes kepler -lrb- 1571-1630 -rrb- calculated that in the year 7 b.c. the planets jupiter and saturn where positioned rather uniquely in the solar system . " the classical star hunter kepler saw jupiter as the king of the planets .
saturn , with its characteristic rings , represented israel , " says vogel .
in december 7 b.c. , she explains , both planets seemingly fused together in the sky - as it would have appeared from earth - to form the zodiac of pisces .
" and this zodiac stood for palestine and for birth . " for astronomers and astrologers of that era , the interpretation of this constellation would have been undeniable : in palestine , the long-awaited king of the jews has been born .
they may have also had knowledge of the prophecies of the hebrew bible , which gave bethlehem , the birthplace of the legendary king david , as the birthplace of the new king . attention grabber bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare positioning of planets venus , top left , and jupiter , top right skeptics , however , have argued that two planets , side by side , would not be recognized by onlookers to be anything particularly special among the thousands of other stars in the sky . but for sandra vogel , this argument is weak .
she says that in february 1999 jupiter and venus appeared like a floodlight in the sky when they moved so close to one another that they seemed to touch . according to vogel , hundreds of calls were made to the fire service and the police by excited civilians who thought they 'd just witnessed a ufo .

he is appealing against his extradition . alleged serbian war criminal zoran obradovic is being held in germany and is fighting extradition for trial in serbia , the german justice ministry confirmed over the weekend .
" the regional court in frankfurt am main has approved the extradition to serbia , " a spokeswoman said .
but the suspect has lodged an appeal to the german constitutional court , she added .
obradovic was arrested several weeks ago on a serbian warrant , serbian prosecutor vladimir vukcevic said , adding that he expects german officials to hand him over to serbia soon .
obradovic belonged to a notorious paramilitary group called the sakali , or jackals .
he is suspected of taking part in the torture , killing , looting and expulsion of ethnic albanians from the village of cuska , near the western kosovo town of pec , on may 14 , 1999 .
nine other members of the group accused of the same crimes went on trial in belgrade on monday .
the conflict in kosovo , which unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in 2008 , cost the lives of some 13,000 people , mostly ethnic albanians .
serbia contests kosovo 's independence , but the country is now under pressure from the european union as it seeks to join the bloc .
in their bid for membership serbian leaders have increased their efforts to track down accused war criminals and deal with their country 's past .

for more than 20 years he has spent christmas on the road handing out presents as santa claus . seven-year-old rhea is excited .
she was just about to go to bed , and now she 's getting to meet santa claus himself . there he stands in his red and white coat , his pointed hat and his big black boots . in fact , it 's not just any santa , it 's berlin 's most famous one .
hu ping chen has been working as a santa claus for the past years .
there are about 500 santas in berlin alone , but hu is the most senior among them .
he trains them , but he also still goes out on the road for handing out presents .
" i first started when a friend asked me if i could help her out .
she worked in a kindergarten and the man who was supposed to play santa claus had backed out , so they needed someone in a pinch , " he recalls .
" i was pretty nervous - i did n't really know what i was doing . but everyone had a good time .
if you 're santa claus , everyone is so happy to see you . everyone becomes a child , and that 's a pretty terrific feeling . "
santa claus is international bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hu is psychologist by day , and santa claus at christmas hu ping chen 's day job is as a psychologist in a hospital .
he was born in berlin to chinese parents , although he does n't speak any chinese himself . they were christians so they celebrated christmas , but the festival seems more like a nice tradition to him now than a religious duty .
" i may look chinese , but when i 'm dressed up as santa claus , nobody asks where i come from .
santa claus is international . "
but he does have to look authentic .
hu ping chen grows a real beard every year from the summer onwards , and he sprays it white for his job as santa .
he paints his cheeks red and fills his sack with golden chocolate coins . he has to be able to improvise and needs to know a lot of christmas songs .
with rhea he sits down to play the song " oh tannenbaum " on the piano .
the little girl tells him she ca n't play the tune perfectly , so hu simply tells her to play not very perfectly .
she works hard on the piano while every else is singing along .
different traditions around the world yet hu 's customers are not just children .
some of the children whom he visited 20 years ago book him for their company christmas party .
after all those years , he knows an awful lot about christmas and its traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 500 santa clauses in berlin alone he knows that americans want to see santa claus on december 25 , and that eastern europeans expect a visit from father frost on new years eve . there 's lots of food at russian gatherings , and you have to give presents to japanese people with two hands .
but he does notice some changes coming about - far more presents are bought and fewer of them are home-made . but one christmas party stands out for him " there was a woman who had inherited some money .
so we gave out presents in a hospice for children .
the woman bought the presents , and we gave them to the children at a beautiful party . it was very moving .
we enjoyed ourselves , but there was a strange feeling , because we knew that for some of the children , this would be their last christmas party . "
but , of course , the main job of a santa claus is not to let sad thoughts take over : children in broken families , where the parents are unemployed , poor children - for 30 minutes they can forget their real problems .
rhea is having a great time .
she 's got a stuffed animal from his bag and has got to sit on his lap . but even santa claus does have to leave eventually . there are still many more families to visit .

he is appealing against his extradition . alleged serbian war criminal zoran obradovic is being held in germany and is fighting extradition for trial in serbia , the german justice ministry confirmed over the weekend .
" the regional court in frankfurt am main has approved the extradition to serbia , " a spokeswoman said .
but the suspect has lodged an appeal to the german constitutional court , she added .
obradovic was arrested several weeks ago on a serbian warrant , serbian prosecutor vladimir vukcevic said , adding that he expects german officials to hand him over to serbia soon .
obradovic belonged to a notorious paramilitary group called the sakali , or jackals .
he is suspected of taking part in the torture , killing , looting and expulsion of ethnic albanians from the village of cuska , near the western kosovo town of pec , on may 14 , 1999 .
nine other members of the group accused of the same crimes went on trial in belgrade on monday .
the conflict in kosovo , which unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in 2008 , cost the lives of some 13,000 people , mostly ethnic albanians .
serbia contests kosovo 's independence , but the country is now under pressure from the european union as it seeks to join the bloc .
in their bid for membership serbian leaders have increased their efforts to track down accused war criminals and deal with their country 's past .

church leaders used the holiday as an occasion to call for peace and tolerance . though blizzards have been to blame for several days of traffic chaos across europe , they painted an idyllic backdrop for many who welcomed this year 's white christmas .
in rome , where there was no snow - but heightened security due to terrorist attacks on foreign embassies the day before - pope benedict xvi led the world 's catholics in christmas celebrations friday night , at the traditional midnight mass at st. peter 's basilica .
the ceremony took place under tight security , following parcel bomb attacks at two embassies in the italian capital , as well as the violent intrusion by a mentally disturbed woman at the pontiff 's midnight christmas mass last year .
in his address at the vatican city , the german-born pope prayed for god to punish the world 's " oppressors . "
" lord , make your promise finally come true , " he said . " break the rods of the oppressors .
burn the tramping boots . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was attacked by a swiss woman at a christmas mass last year " let the time of the garments rolled in blood come to an end , " added the pope , speaking exactly one year after a mentally unstable swiss-italian woman dragged him to the ground at the same mass .
the pope emerged unscathed from the incident , which resulted in a broken leg for a french cardinal .
the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics , who is scheduled to eat christmas dinner with some 350 of rome 's homeless , has had a troubled year , clouded by hundreds of accusations against paedophile priests around the world .
in an interview published last month , he likened the crisis to " a volcano out of which suddenly a tremendous cloud of filth came , darkening and soiling everything . "
the 83-year-old german pope has also said he could resign if he felt he was " no longer physically , psychologically and spiritually capable " of leading the catholic church .
earnest messages from german churches church leaders in a snowy germany took a global political view in their christmas eve addresses to followers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch spoke out against the commercialization of christmas protestant bishop markus droege urged asylum for refugees and attention to the growing gap between rich and poor on friday at the berlin cathedral .
catholic archbishop georg sterzinsky meanwhile called for world peace , which he called the " gift of bethlehem " during his address at berlin 's st. hedwig 's cathedral .
" unfortunately , weapons can still be heard in many places , " steryinsky said , adding that the arsenals of the world were too full .
in a video message released shortly after german consumers raced to do last-minute christmas shopping , the chairman of the german bishop 's conference , robert zollitsch , spoke out against the commercialization of holiday .

church leaders used the holiday as an occasion to call for peace and tolerance . though blizzards have been to blame for several days of traffic chaos across europe , they painted an idyllic backdrop for many who welcomed this year 's white christmas .
in rome , where there was no snow - but heightened security due to terrorist attacks on foreign embassies the day before - pope benedict xvi led the world 's catholics in christmas celebrations friday night , at the traditional midnight mass at st. peter 's basilica .
the ceremony took place under tight security , following parcel bomb attacks at two embassies in the italian capital , as well as the violent intrusion by a mentally disturbed woman at the pontiff 's midnight christmas mass last year .
in his address at the vatican city , the german-born pope prayed for god to punish the world 's " oppressors . "
" lord , make your promise finally come true , " he said . " break the rods of the oppressors .
burn the tramping boots . "

the pope emerged unscathed from the incident , which resulted in a broken leg for a french cardinal .
the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion catholics , who is scheduled to eat christmas dinner with some 350 of rome 's homeless , has had a troubled year , clouded by hundreds of accusations against paedophile priests around the world .
in an interview published last month , he likened the crisis to " a volcano out of which suddenly a tremendous cloud of filth came , darkening and soiling everything . "
the 83-year-old german pope has also said he could resign if he felt he was " no longer physically , psychologically and spiritually capable " of leading the catholic church .
earnest messages from german churches church leaders in a snowy germany took a global political view in their christmas eve addresses to followers .

today , astronomers and physicists still struggle to form a clear image of how the famed star came about . in the bible , only the gospel of the apostle matthew makes reference to the star above that guides the three wise men from the orient to the new-born baby jesus .
it was said to have been a bright , tailed star , and has become the subject of much speculation by scientists and artists alike . on many a canvas and nativity scene , this symbol is shown , beaming and brilliant .
in fact , the yuletide star has often been represented in such a dazzling fashion that many have come to the conclusion it must have been a meteor streaking across the sky . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas star is said to have led the three-wise-men to the baby jesus and why not ?
the sky is littered with such intergalactic objects .
the hale-bopp comet , last witnessed in winter skies back in 1997 , is one such example .
the comet has a diameter of around 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- and moves through space at speeds of more than 44,000 kilometers per second . " with its beautifully bright tail , it looked somewhat like a flying arrow , " says physicist sandra vogel from the olbers planetarium in the northern german city of bremen . despite their beauty , however , comets have been seen as the bearers of bad tidings since time immemorial , which is why many have said that such a dangerous ambassador could not have been chosen to signal the birth of the savior jesus . to cite an example from antiquity , the appearance of halley 's comet over rome in 12 b.c. was largely held responsible for the death of the statesman and general agrippa . stellar explanation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supernova emit enormous amounts of energy " another candidate -lsb- for the christmas star -rsb- would be an exploding star , a supernova , " explains vogel .
" the flash from such an explosion would have illuminated the night sky as bright as day .
and a luminous cloud around the cooling star would still be visible for weeks . " but the physicist counters her own thought : " astronomers have searched the skies in vain for traces of a 2,000-year-old supernova . " how then has this story of the glowing star with a tail in the sky developed ?
what are its origins ? modern astronomers and sky-watchers would tell you it was most likely a special planetary constellation .
the german astronomer johannes kepler -lrb- 1571-1630 -rrb- calculated that in the year 7 b.c. the planets jupiter and saturn where positioned rather uniquely in the solar system . " the classical star hunter kepler saw jupiter as the king of the planets .
saturn , with its characteristic rings , represented israel , " says vogel .
in december 7 b.c. , she explains , both planets seemingly fused together in the sky - as it would have appeared from earth - to form the zodiac of pisces .
" and this zodiac stood for palestine and for birth . " for astronomers and astrologers of that era , the interpretation of this constellation would have been undeniable : in palestine , the long-awaited king of the jews has been born .
they may have also had knowledge of the prophecies of the hebrew bible , which gave bethlehem , the birthplace of the legendary king david , as the birthplace of the new king . attention grabber bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare positioning of planets venus , top left , and jupiter , top right skeptics , however , have argued that two planets , side by side , would not be recognized by onlookers to be anything particularly special among the thousands of other stars in the sky . but for sandra vogel , this argument is weak .
she says that in february 1999 jupiter and venus appeared like a floodlight in the sky when they moved so close to one another that they seemed to touch . according to vogel , hundreds of calls were made to the fire service and the police by excited civilians who thought they 'd just witnessed a ufo .

he is appealing against his extradition . alleged serbian war criminal zoran obradovic is being held in germany and is fighting extradition for trial in serbia , the german justice ministry confirmed over the weekend .
" the regional court in frankfurt am main has approved the extradition to serbia , " a spokeswoman said .
but the suspect has lodged an appeal to the german constitutional court , she added .
obradovic was arrested several weeks ago on a serbian warrant , serbian prosecutor vladimir vukcevic said , adding that he expects german officials to hand him over to serbia soon .
obradovic belonged to a notorious paramilitary group called the sakali , or jackals .
he is suspected of taking part in the torture , killing , looting and expulsion of ethnic albanians from the village of cuska , near the western kosovo town of pec , on may 14 , 1999 .
nine other members of the group accused of the same crimes went on trial in belgrade on monday .
the conflict in kosovo , which unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in 2008 , cost the lives of some 13,000 people , mostly ethnic albanians .
serbia contests kosovo 's independence , but the country is now under pressure from the european union as it seeks to join the bloc .
in their bid for membership serbian leaders have increased their efforts to track down accused war criminals and deal with their country 's past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de psychology -pipe- 25.12.2010 behavioral economics : the missing link in the financial crisis ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists are increasingly interested in human behavior and irrationality behavioral economics was once relegated to the fringe of academia .
now theories that pair psychology with economics have everyone from us president barack obama to steve jobs taking heed . why do we spend 100 euros on a business shirt , but drive around an extra 20 minutes looking for gasoline that 's just a few cents cheaper ? why do we pay off our smallest debts first even if they have the lowest interest rates ? why is it so tough to save for retirement ?
all of these questions find answers in a growing field of research called behavioral economics . if standard economics makes basic assumptions about how people should behave , behavioral economics looks at what people actually do and extrapolates meaning from there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dan ariely outlined many of his theories in his book " predictably irrational " " standard economics assumes that people have ordered and complete preferences . based on those assumptions , we go ahead and make stories about how the world works , " says dan ariely , a professor of behavioral economics at duke university and the author of " predictably irrational " and " the upside of irrationality . " " behavioral economics is interested in the same topics that standard economics is interested in , but we are sort of agnostic to assumptions and instead we believe in data . "
cheat ?
everyone else is ...
researchers like ariely run tests in labs and conduct field experiments to see how people react when presented with different choices and incentives .
often , subjects do n't make the most efficient or rational choices .
for example , behavioral economists find that people will pay more for things when using a credit card because it delays the pain of paying . people cheat more when they think others are cheating too . and when put in different situations , people are willing to pay wildly different amounts for the same items - this goes for a cup of coffee to a new mortgage .

now a group of west african leaders says it will use force if he wo n't resign . leaders from the west african regional bloc ecowas have upped the ante for ivory coast 's president laurent gbagbo , saying that if he does not peacefully step down and hand power over to the internationally recognized winner of november 's elections , alassane ouattara , they would have to intervene militarily .
the presidents of benin , sierra leone and cape verde plan to travel to ivory coast on tuesday to tell gbagbo on behalf of ecowas " that he must step down as quickly as possible or face legitimate military force , " benin 's foreign minister jean marie ehouzou told reuters news agency on saturday .

"
the leaders said they were planning a meeting of defense chiefs of staff to develop plans for the possible use of force .
on thursday , ecowas announced that its central bank was blocking funds to gbagbo and that access would only be given to ouattara 's " legitimate government . "
bildunterschrift : the un says 173 people have been killed in the last week in ivory coast post-election violence ivory coast has plunged into violence since the presidential election on november 28 .
the united nations unoci peacekeeping force has said at least 173 people have been killed in the past week and said gbagbo 's security forces were committing " massive human rights abuses . "
the ecowas leaders expressed their " deep concern " for the death and warned " all those responsible that they will face international trials for human rights violations at the earliest opportunity .
there are concerns the country will slip back into conflict after suffering a civil war in 2002 and 2003 .
the united nations said saturday that about 14,000 people have already fled ivory coast for neighboring liberia .
the un , the us , the european union and the african union have all declared ouattara the winner of the elections and his proposed ambassador has been recognized by the un general assembly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de psychology -pipe- 25.12.2010 behavioral economics : the missing link in the financial crisis ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists are increasingly interested in human behavior and irrationality behavioral economics was once relegated to the fringe of academia .
now theories that pair psychology with economics have everyone from us president barack obama to steve jobs taking heed . why do we spend 100 euros on a business shirt , but drive around an extra 20 minutes looking for gasoline that 's just a few cents cheaper ? why do we pay off our smallest debts first even if they have the lowest interest rates ? why is it so tough to save for retirement ?
all of these questions find answers in a growing field of research called behavioral economics . if standard economics makes basic assumptions about how people should behave , behavioral economics looks at what people actually do and extrapolates meaning from there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dan ariely outlined many of his theories in his book " predictably irrational " " standard economics assumes that people have ordered and complete preferences . based on those assumptions , we go ahead and make stories about how the world works , " says dan ariely , a professor of behavioral economics at duke university and the author of " predictably irrational " and " the upside of irrationality . " " behavioral economics is interested in the same topics that standard economics is interested in , but we are sort of agnostic to assumptions and instead we believe in data . "
cheat ?
everyone else is ...
researchers like ariely run tests in labs and conduct field experiments to see how people react when presented with different choices and incentives .
often , subjects do n't make the most efficient or rational choices .
for example , behavioral economists find that people will pay more for things when using a credit card because it delays the pain of paying . people cheat more when they think others are cheating too . and when put in different situations , people are willing to pay wildly different amounts for the same items - this goes for a cup of coffee to a new mortgage .
irrational risk-taking ariely says behavioral economics might have remained in the shadow of standard economic theory if it was n't for the financial crisis in 2008 - a massive demonstration of the irrationality of both consumers and wall street traders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis revealed that experts who were supposed to evaluate risk had failed " if we had to choose a marketing campaign for behavioral economics , this would be it , " says ariely . " because here is what happened : we had been doing this research for a long time . i would present it and people would say , ' this is so nice and cute . i will tell my wife about it when i go home for dinner , but clearly the argument would not apply with experts who are being paid lots of money to make really important decisions . and for sure it will never work in the competitive environment on the market . '
as an empirical person , i never had anything to say . "
but then ariely and other well known behavioral economists like cass r. sunstein and richard thaler , the authors of " nudge " , got their real life example . the same risk-taking behavior they saw demonstrated in experiments among university students was mirrored in wall street 's well trained and well paid experts .
what has the crisis taught us ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have we learnt anything ?
americans , for instance , still spend more than they save " i think the financial -lrb- failure -rrb- in such a magnificent way got people to think . that all of those people who were supposed to evaluate risk seem to have failed demonstrated that something very basic is wrong , " says ariely .
" so i think the final crisis has been very useful . now almost three years later , the question is : will we make enough changes ? "
it 's a relevant question . in the united states , the obama administration has embraced behavioral economics when designing new incentive programs for retirement saving and financial oversight , but the impact is unclear . americans are still spending more than they are saving .
wall street is playing the same risky game as ever . so what has changed ? a behavioral economist might say humans ' desire to take risks will never change . a better question might be : what kind of mechanism can we design to save us from our own destructive impulses ? author : caitlan carroll editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now theories that pair psychology with economics have everyone from us president barack obama to steve jobs taking heed . why do we spend 100 euros on a business shirt , but drive around an extra 20 minutes looking for gasoline that 's just a few cents cheaper ? why do we pay off our smallest debts first even if they have the lowest interest rates ? why is it so tough to save for retirement ?
all of these questions find answers in a growing field of research called behavioral economics . if standard economics makes basic assumptions about how people should behave , behavioral economics looks at what people actually do and extrapolates meaning from there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dan ariely outlined many of his theories in his book " predictably irrational " " standard economics assumes that people have ordered and complete preferences . based on those assumptions , we go ahead and make stories about how the world works , " says dan ariely , a professor of behavioral economics at duke university and the author of " predictably irrational " and " the upside of irrationality . " " behavioral economics is interested in the same topics that standard economics is interested in , but we are sort of agnostic to assumptions and instead we believe in data . "
cheat ?
everyone else is ...
researchers like ariely run tests in labs and conduct field experiments to see how people react when presented with different choices and incentives .
often , subjects do n't make the most efficient or rational choices .
for example , behavioral economists find that people will pay more for things when using a credit card because it delays the pain of paying . people cheat more when they think others are cheating too . and when put in different situations , people are willing to pay wildly different amounts for the same items - this goes for a cup of coffee to a new mortgage .
irrational risk-taking ariely says behavioral economics might have remained in the shadow of standard economic theory if it was n't for the financial crisis in 2008 - a massive demonstration of the irrationality of both consumers and wall street traders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis revealed that experts who were supposed to evaluate risk had failed " if we had to choose a marketing campaign for behavioral economics , this would be it , " says ariely . " because here is what happened : we had been doing this research for a long time . i would present it and people would say , ' this is so nice and cute . i will tell my wife about it when i go home for dinner , but clearly the argument would not apply with experts who are being paid lots of money to make really important decisions . and for sure it will never work in the competitive environment on the market . '
as an empirical person , i never had anything to say . "
but then ariely and other well known behavioral economists like cass r. sunstein and richard thaler , the authors of " nudge " , got their real life example . the same risk-taking behavior they saw demonstrated in experiments among university students was mirrored in wall street 's well trained and well paid experts .
what has the crisis taught us ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have we learnt anything ?
americans , for instance , still spend more than they save " i think the financial -lrb- failure -rrb- in such a magnificent way got people to think . that all of those people who were supposed to evaluate risk seem to have failed demonstrated that something very basic is wrong , " says ariely .
" so i think the final crisis has been very useful . now almost three years later , the question is : will we make enough changes ? "
it 's a relevant question . in the united states , the obama administration has embraced behavioral economics when designing new incentive programs for retirement saving and financial oversight , but the impact is unclear . americans are still spending more than they are saving .
wall street is playing the same risky game as ever . so what has changed ? a behavioral economist might say humans ' desire to take risks will never change . a better question might be : what kind of mechanism can we design to save us from our own destructive impulses ? author : caitlan carroll editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
