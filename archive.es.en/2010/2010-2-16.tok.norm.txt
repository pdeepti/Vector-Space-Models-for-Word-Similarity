the eu has joined the row on the swiss side but some countries may jump ship if trade ties with tripoli are threatened . on sunday , libya took the decision to stop issuing visas to citizens of the eu schengen free-travel zone - of which non-eu member switzerland is a signatory - escalating the spat caused by switzerland 's travel ban handed out to one of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's sons . the libyan leader 's son hannibal and his spouse joined 186 other libyan figures barred from visiting switzerland after an incident in july 2008 when two hotel servants in geneva complained hannibal had mistreated them . after hannibal and his pregnant wife aline were arrested in geneva , libya cut oil supplies to switzerland and withdrew more than $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.6 billlion euros -rrb- dollars in assets from swiss banks . libya then prevented two swiss businessmen from leaving the country , and subsequently tried them on visa violations . the row flared up again in november last year when switzerland asked the 25 schengen signatories to restrict visas to libyan passport holders . following that request , libyan prime minister baghadadi al-mahmoudi and other senior officials were denied schengen visas , a refusal that libya 's deputy prime minister khalid kaim blamed on the swiss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the libyan leader took his cash out of switzerland last year last week , a tripoli appeals court reduced an earlier , 16-month prison sentence against max goldi , one of the two swiss businessmen held in libya on visa violations , after a court on february 7 acquitted fellow swiss citizen rachid al-hamdani on the same charges . swiss trauma but the row erupted again at the weekend with libya taking steps which not only punish swiss citizens but those from switzerland 's fellow schengen area signatories . isabelle werenfels , senior associate at the middle east and africa research division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that the whole affair , from the start in 2008 to this week 's developments , has been traumatizing for the swiss . " the libyans have made it very hard for the swiss to get out of libya and it has felt at times like they were hostages there , " she said .
" the airlines are still not allowed to fly out of libya .
many people say that the libya situation is actually at the heart of the swiss attitude towards minarets and muslims .
it has been a very difficult time for switzerland . " while the libyan government has not publicly confirmed the reports , or given a public reason for the decision to ban entry to schengen area citizens , the country 's private daily newspaper oea , which is close to gadhafi 's family , carried the story , quoting a " high-ranking " unidentified official who mentioned both the arrest of hannibal gadhafi and the swiss ban on 188 libyan citizens . schengen countries suffer as libya punishes swiss the italian foreign ministry confirmed the ban on its web site soon after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss banned 188 libyans from crossing its borders " libyan authorities have confirmed the suspension of all types of visas for citizens of schengen states .
in addition , they have specified that citizens from schengen states will be denied entry into libya even if they are in possession of a visa , of whatever duration or type , " a statement on its web site read . the passport-free schengen zone comprises 25 nations , including switzerland , iceland , norway and most european union members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania . werenfels said that predicting the effects of the visa ban would be difficult as libya seemed to be employing an arbitrary ban at the moment .
" libya seems to be targeting high-level business people from europe but we 'll see how long that lasts , " she said .
" this would be damaging for libya too .
it remains to be seen if they ban anyone who works for the petrochemical industry , which is very important to libya .
chances are , in two or three days , gadhafi may find a way out of this while saving face . " strong words from eu but little chance of strong action meanwhile , the european commission declared the libyan decision as being " unilateral and disproportionate . " " the commission also regrets that travellers who legally obtained visas before the suspension measure were refused entry when arriving in libya " , said eu commissioner for home affairs , cecilia malmstrom . she added that the commission is set to discuss the issue " before the end of the week " with schengen countries , with a view to " consider the appropriate reaction . " experts believe that the eu 's show of unity towards switzerland will evaporate when important trade and business relations are put at risk by any further escalation on an eu-wide scale . " it is very important for the eu to speak with one voice .
the eu should use the tools that it has , " sawsan chebli , an associate fellow with the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the eu is libya ’ s greatest trade and export partner .
this is a leverage the eu could use .
however , italy and other eu member states with close relations with libya in the past have shown that they are not interested to spoil their relations with libya whatever gadhafi ’ s action may be .
that is not likely to change .
and the problem is that gadhafi knows that he is able to divide the eu . " italians urge swiss to resolve crisis and leave eu out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini told switzerland to leave europe out its row with libya chebli 's opinion was reinforced by a statement from italy which criticized switzerland and urged the swiss to sort out their differences with the north african country and its leadership . switzerland must " resolve this bi-lateral issue ... but not at the expense of everyone else , " italian foreign minister franco frattini said in a television interview , adding that he had stressed to bern the " sensitivity " of the situation . sawsan chebli believes that italy 's attitude highlights a disregard for european solidarity when business ties - which are strong between italy and libya - are concerned . " the italians care very little about the eu or other states when it comes to business relations , " she said . " solidarity is an unknown word in this regard .
frattini was very clear .
he accused switzerland of misusing the schengen agreement to exert pressure on gadhafi and said that bern would take its members ' hostage ' .

a heterosexual couple in austria has vowed to go to the country 's highest court - to be granted a civil partnership introduced for gay couples .
they argue that current legislation is discriminatory . a heterosexual couple in austria is fighting for the right to enter into a registered civil partnership - introduced for homosexual couples in january 2010 .
under current law the couple will be denied that right - but they have vowed to take the case to the country 's constitutional court to overturn what they says is a discriminatory legislation .
austria introduced civil unions for gay couples on january 1 , affording them some of the rights enjoyed by their heterosexual counterparts .
the new legislation , passed after weeks of wrangling between the ruling social democrats and their conservative coalition partner in government , gives same-sex couples a status similar to traditional marriage but different in a number of respects .
for instance , there are less strict rules in the event of a divorce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the issue is equality - nothing but equality , ' the couple argues the heterosexual couple in question argues that this is a more modern form of union - which simply suits them better than a traditional marriage .
and if it 's offered to gay couples , why should n't it be an option for them as well ?
the issue at stake , they argue , is standing up against discrimination .
" everyone should have the same rights , and there should n't be different rules for different people , " the couple 's lawyer , helmut graupner , told deutsche welle .
" regardless of how many different forms of union a state provides to couples , all of those forms should be available for everyone and must not be restricted on the basis of race , class or sex or gender or other criteria , which are traditionally the very criteria for discrimination , " graupner said .
can you be ' a little bit equal ' ?
at the end of february , the couple plans to officially apply for a civil partnership - they expect this to be rejected , in which case they plan to take their case to the constitutional court .
their goal is to force the government to rework the legislation so that both traditional marriage and registered partnership will be open to any couple - gay or straight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay and lesbian activists say the different forms of union are discriminatory " the issue is equality - nothing but equality , " graupner said .
" you can not be ' a little bit equal . '
just like you ca n't be ' a little bit pregnant ' or ' a little bit dead . '
unless you 're entitled to the same kind of institutions and forms of law you 're not being treated equally and that 's discriminatory .
that 's what we are fighting against - we 're fighting for the rights of both heterosexuals and homosexuals . "
graupner is not only trying to help the heterosexual couple to get a ' gay ' marriage .
he 's also representing gay couples who want a traditional marriage - rather than the registered civil partnership that lawmakers have agreed on .
the current legislation provides same-sex couples with equal rights to heterosexuals with regards to pensions and alimony - but the law for instance continues to ban adoption .
it also does not allow civil partnership ceremonies at the civil registry office , where heterosexual couples can marry .
yet graupner is up against strong resistance .
the country 's conservative party - the austrian peoples party - only reluctantly agreed to the civil partnership in the first place .
the conservatives insists that significant differences between the two forms of union must remain .
the catholic church is not amused another powerful opponent to the law is the roman catholic church - after all , austria is predominantly catholic and the church is a force to be reckoned with .
the country 's clergy is opposed to the existing law , and certainly against any further liberalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the church ' different things need to be treated differently ' " the austrian bishops have made their position quite clear , " professor erich leitenberger , spokesman for the vienna diocese told deutsche welle .
" they strongly support the fact that the law does not put the civil partnership and a traditional marriage on an equal footing . "
" but the bishops have expressed concerns that the new law could be the beginning of a trend which eventually will lead to putting the civil partnership on the same footing as the traditional marriage between a man and a woman . "
leitenberger said that the legislation in place before january 1 was sufficient to safeguard the rights of gay and lesbian couples .
families , he argued , were shouldering the task of raising children and therefore could not be put on the same level with same-sex couples .
" the bishops stick to their position that a traditional marriage , a family raising children simply is something different from a homosexual couple - and therefore should also be treated differently . "
however , should the appeal to the constitutional court be successful , soon both of the two forms of union , could be open to any couple - a situation that would place austria at the forefront in terms of homosexual rights in europe .
the decision by the court is expected by the end of this year .

a heterosexual couple in austria has vowed to go to the country 's highest court - to be granted a civil partnership introduced for gay couples .
they argue that current legislation is discriminatory . a heterosexual couple in austria is fighting for the right to enter into a registered civil partnership - introduced for homosexual couples in january 2010 .
under current law the couple will be denied that right - but they have vowed to take the case to the country 's constitutional court to overturn what they says is a discriminatory legislation .
austria introduced civil unions for gay couples on january 1 , affording them some of the rights enjoyed by their heterosexual counterparts .
the new legislation , passed after weeks of wrangling between the ruling social democrats and their conservative coalition partner in government , gives same-sex couples a status similar to traditional marriage but different in a number of respects .
for instance , there are less strict rules in the event of a divorce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the issue is equality - nothing but equality , ' the couple argues the heterosexual couple in question argues that this is a more modern form of union - which simply suits them better than a traditional marriage .
and if it 's offered to gay couples , why should n't it be an option for them as well ?
the issue at stake , they argue , is standing up against discrimination .
" everyone should have the same rights , and there should n't be different rules for different people , " the couple 's lawyer , helmut graupner , told deutsche welle .
" regardless of how many different forms of union a state provides to couples , all of those forms should be available for everyone and must not be restricted on the basis of race , class or sex or gender or other criteria , which are traditionally the very criteria for discrimination , " graupner said .
can you be ' a little bit equal ' ?
at the end of february , the couple plans to officially apply for a civil partnership - they expect this to be rejected , in which case they plan to take their case to the constitutional court .
their goal is to force the government to rework the legislation so that both traditional marriage and registered partnership will be open to any couple - gay or straight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay and lesbian activists say the different forms of union are discriminatory " the issue is equality - nothing but equality , " graupner said .
" you can not be ' a little bit equal . '
just like you ca n't be ' a little bit pregnant ' or ' a little bit dead . '
unless you 're entitled to the same kind of institutions and forms of law you 're not being treated equally and that 's discriminatory .
that 's what we are fighting against - we 're fighting for the rights of both heterosexuals and homosexuals . "
graupner is not only trying to help the heterosexual couple to get a ' gay ' marriage .
he 's also representing gay couples who want a traditional marriage - rather than the registered civil partnership that lawmakers have agreed on .
the current legislation provides same-sex couples with equal rights to heterosexuals with regards to pensions and alimony - but the law for instance continues to ban adoption .
it also does not allow civil partnership ceremonies at the civil registry office , where heterosexual couples can marry .
yet graupner is up against strong resistance .
the country 's conservative party - the austrian peoples party - only reluctantly agreed to the civil partnership in the first place .
the conservatives insists that significant differences between the two forms of union must remain .
the catholic church is not amused another powerful opponent to the law is the roman catholic church - after all , austria is predominantly catholic and the church is a force to be reckoned with .
the country 's clergy is opposed to the existing law , and certainly against any further liberalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the church ' different things need to be treated differently ' " the austrian bishops have made their position quite clear , " professor erich leitenberger , spokesman for the vienna diocese told deutsche welle .

that may be good news for germany 's axel weber , who hopes to make president . european union finance ministers on tuesday unanimously recommended portugal 's vitor constancio to be the next vice president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , an eu statement said .
if confirmed by the european parliament next month , constancio will succeed greece 's lucas papdemos in may .
" it was a unanimous choice , " said italian economics minister giulio tremonti .
" he is a very qualified and technically experienced person , so i think that he was the right choice for europe . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de greece -pipe- 16.02.2010 the evolution of greece 's financial woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is greece doomed to repeat its financial history ?
greece 's financial woes started decades ago when the country was ruled by one socialist regime after another .
now experts warn that unless greece learns from its financial history , it is bound to repeat it . who would have imagined it ?
greece could soon be bankrupt and there are some speculations that athens will begin refusing payment on its obligations .
due to massive debt and doctored data , greece has lost the trust of both the european union and the financial markets .
and it 's not looking good for athens , despite an eu security net .
greece currently owes foreign banks more than $ 300 billion -lrb- 219.8 billion euros -rrb- , which equals 115 percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
their current debt amounts to more then 12.7 percent of their economic output .
but how did it get this far ?
spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "
repeating history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overspending led to greece 's current situation this is not new territory for greece .
back in the 1980 's and 1990 's the country faced similar financial difficulties .
back then the socialist governments solved the problem by devaluing the country 's former currency , the drachma .
that way they were able to shrink imports and raise exports .
but economic expert babi papadimitriou said this option became unavailable when greece entered into the euro zone . over the past few years the political elite and the greek government have not really grasped what it means to be a member of the euro zone , the economist said .
" it goes without saying that you have to reduce your deficit as much as possible when you share your currency with other countries , " he said .
" but those in power have ignored this principle .
and the necessary reforms were never imposed . "
the state acted irresponsibly as costs began to mount and the ability for the economy to compete on an international level was reduced .
when added to the global financial crisis that hit back in 2008 , these structural weak points became a full-blown nightmare .
cutting costs the country 's biggest problem is the state itself and the services it offers .
according to professor paraskewopoulos , the largest share of savings could come from cutting the costs incurred by public employees : reducing tax exceptions , putting a hiring freeze on state offices and reducing employee salaries .
along with this , he said the government needs to tackle two other major hurdles : tax evasion and corruption . each year the greek government loses 20 billion euros in unpaid taxes , and it is estimated that the average greek family pays out some 1,600 euros annually in bribes .
notoriously , things rarely work in the country without a little money to grease the wheels .
bildunterschrift : greek prime minister george papandreou has some very unenviable choices to make " those in power have always rewarded those loyal to them with cushy jobs and now we have a bloated government that costs an inconceivable amount of money .
that 's where you have to start , " explained paraskewopoulos .
" of course that 's easy to say , but to really do it , you have to be prepared to deal with the people affected . "
and that is exactly what papandreou 's government is facing at the moment .
the public sector has gone on strike and indignant farmers are blocking the motorways and border crossings .
however , both experts agree that unless they get rid of the subsidies and begin to privatize state agencies , cleaning up the financial mess will be impossible .

greece 's financial woes started decades ago when the country was ruled by one socialist regime after another .
now experts warn that unless greece learns from its financial history , it is bound to repeat it . who would have imagined it ?
greece could soon be bankrupt and there are some speculations that athens will begin refusing payment on its obligations .
due to massive debt and doctored data , greece has lost the trust of both the european union and the financial markets .
and it 's not looking good for athens , despite an eu security net .
greece currently owes foreign banks more than $ 300 billion -lrb- 219.8 billion euros -rrb- , which equals 115 percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
their current debt amounts to more then 12.7 percent of their economic output .
but how did it get this far ?
spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "
repeating history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overspending led to greece 's current situation this is not new territory for greece .
back in the 1980 's and 1990 's the country faced similar financial difficulties .
back then the socialist governments solved the problem by devaluing the country 's former currency , the drachma .
that way they were able to shrink imports and raise exports .
but economic expert babi papadimitriou said this option became unavailable when greece entered into the euro zone . over the past few years the political elite and the greek government have not really grasped what it means to be a member of the euro zone , the economist said .
" it goes without saying that you have to reduce your deficit as much as possible when you share your currency with other countries , " he said .
" but those in power have ignored this principle .
and the necessary reforms were never imposed . "
the state acted irresponsibly as costs began to mount and the ability for the economy to compete on an international level was reduced .
when added to the global financial crisis that hit back in 2008 , these structural weak points became a full-blown nightmare .
cutting costs the country 's biggest problem is the state itself and the services it offers .
according to professor paraskewopoulos , the largest share of savings could come from cutting the costs incurred by public employees : reducing tax exceptions , putting a hiring freeze on state offices and reducing employee salaries .
along with this , he said the government needs to tackle two other major hurdles : tax evasion and corruption . each year the greek government loses 20 billion euros in unpaid taxes , and it is estimated that the average greek family pays out some 1,600 euros annually in bribes .
notoriously , things rarely work in the country without a little money to grease the wheels .
bildunterschrift : greek prime minister george papandreou has some very unenviable choices to make " those in power have always rewarded those loyal to them with cushy jobs and now we have a bloated government that costs an inconceivable amount of money .
that 's where you have to start , " explained paraskewopoulos .
" of course that 's easy to say , but to really do it , you have to be prepared to deal with the people affected . "
and that is exactly what papandreou 's government is facing at the moment .
the public sector has gone on strike and indignant farmers are blocking the motorways and border crossings .
however , both experts agree that unless they get rid of the subsidies and begin to privatize state agencies , cleaning up the financial mess will be impossible .

the eu offered its support , but no firm commitments on specific aid . at a european union meeting in brussels , finance ministers from germany , sweden and austria told greece it needs to do more to bring its runaway debt under control and calm worried financial markets .

" additional measures by greece are needed . "
a statement issued by the ministers after the meeting said although greece has until march 16 to prove it has taken initial steps towards reducing its budgetary deficit by four percent , they will likely demand more budget cuts or tax hikes to prevent wider financial troubles .
the four percent reduction is the first step in a plan to eventually reduce the deficit from 12.7 percent of gdp to less than three percent in 2012 .

the eu offered its support , but no firm commitments on specific aid . at a european union meeting in brussels , finance ministers from germany , sweden and austria told greece it needs to do more to bring its runaway debt under control and calm worried financial markets .
joerg asmussen , germany 's deputy finance minister , advised greece to follow the lead of ireland and latvia , eu countries which are slashing spending in an effort to rein in their financial troubles .
" we made it clear the ball is in greece 's court , " asmussen said .
" additional measures by greece are needed . "
a statement issued by the ministers after the meeting said although greece has until march 16 to prove it has taken initial steps towards reducing its budgetary deficit by four percent , they will likely demand more budget cuts or tax hikes to prevent wider financial troubles .
the four percent reduction is the first step in a plan to eventually reduce the deficit from 12.7 percent of gdp to less than three percent in 2012 .
" the pressure on greece to consider further measures by march 16 has clearly increased , " said austrian finance minister josef proell .
the euro-zone ministers did not elaborate on earlier talk of specific monetary aid , instead reaffirming thursday 's pledge to support greece if things got out of control .

" but this debate is not yet on . "
greek finance minister george papaconstantinou told reporters after the meeting that the country is already ahead of its deficit reduction goals , adding that a one-off tax on large companies had resulted in a january surplus .
papaconstantinou , who warned on monday that his government would need more than a day to turn things around , said the pledge of support should act as a deterrent if financial markets increased the pressure on greece or other euro zone countries .

the eu has joined the row on the swiss side but some countries may jump ship if trade ties with tripoli are threatened . on sunday , libya took the decision to stop issuing visas to citizens of the eu schengen free-travel zone - of which non-eu member switzerland is a signatory - escalating the spat caused by switzerland 's travel ban handed out to one of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's sons . the libyan leader 's son hannibal and his spouse joined 186 other libyan figures barred from visiting switzerland after an incident in july 2008 when two hotel servants in geneva complained hannibal had mistreated them . after hannibal and his pregnant wife aline were arrested in geneva , libya cut oil supplies to switzerland and withdrew more than $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.6 billlion euros -rrb- dollars in assets from swiss banks . libya then prevented two swiss businessmen from leaving the country , and subsequently tried them on visa violations . the row flared up again in november last year when switzerland asked the 25 schengen signatories to restrict visas to libyan passport holders . following that request , libyan prime minister baghadadi al-mahmoudi and other senior officials were denied schengen visas , a refusal that libya 's deputy prime minister khalid kaim blamed on the swiss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the libyan leader took his cash out of switzerland last year last week , a tripoli appeals court reduced an earlier , 16-month prison sentence against max goldi , one of the two swiss businessmen held in libya on visa violations , after a court on february 7 acquitted fellow swiss citizen rachid al-hamdani on the same charges . swiss trauma but the row erupted again at the weekend with libya taking steps which not only punish swiss citizens but those from switzerland 's fellow schengen area signatories . isabelle werenfels , senior associate at the middle east and africa research division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that the whole affair , from the start in 2008 to this week 's developments , has been traumatizing for the swiss . " the libyans have made it very hard for the swiss to get out of libya and it has felt at times like they were hostages there , " she said .
" the airlines are still not allowed to fly out of libya .
many people say that the libya situation is actually at the heart of the swiss attitude towards minarets and muslims .
it has been a very difficult time for switzerland . " while the libyan government has not publicly confirmed the reports , or given a public reason for the decision to ban entry to schengen area citizens , the country 's private daily newspaper oea , which is close to gadhafi 's family , carried the story , quoting a " high-ranking " unidentified official who mentioned both the arrest of hannibal gadhafi and the swiss ban on 188 libyan citizens . schengen countries suffer as libya punishes swiss the italian foreign ministry confirmed the ban on its web site soon after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss banned 188 libyans from crossing its borders " libyan authorities have confirmed the suspension of all types of visas for citizens of schengen states .
in addition , they have specified that citizens from schengen states will be denied entry into libya even if they are in possession of a visa , of whatever duration or type , " a statement on its web site read . the passport-free schengen zone comprises 25 nations , including switzerland , iceland , norway and most european union members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania . werenfels said that predicting the effects of the visa ban would be difficult as libya seemed to be employing an arbitrary ban at the moment .
" libya seems to be targeting high-level business people from europe but we 'll see how long that lasts , " she said .
" this would be damaging for libya too .
it remains to be seen if they ban anyone who works for the petrochemical industry , which is very important to libya .
chances are , in two or three days , gadhafi may find a way out of this while saving face . " strong words from eu but little chance of strong action meanwhile , the european commission declared the libyan decision as being " unilateral and disproportionate . " " the commission also regrets that travellers who legally obtained visas before the suspension measure were refused entry when arriving in libya " , said eu commissioner for home affairs , cecilia malmstrom . she added that the commission is set to discuss the issue " before the end of the week " with schengen countries , with a view to " consider the appropriate reaction .

the eu should use the tools that it has , " sawsan chebli , an associate fellow with the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .

this is a leverage the eu could use .
however , italy and other eu member states with close relations with libya in the past have shown that they are not interested to spoil their relations with libya whatever gadhafi ’ s action may be .
that is not likely to change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : europe without borders - 15 years of the schengen zone eu opens internal borders to long-stay visa holders , sparking security fears checkpoint-free europe confounds germany 's skeptics 15 years of visa-free travel in europe angered turkey demands visa-free travel to eu 's schengen area europe -pipe- 16.02.2010 europe 's unity with swiss in libya visa row tested by business links großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the high-profile arrest of hannibal ghadafi triggered a diplomatic crisis the spat between switzerland and libya over tit-for-tat visa bans has now spread across europe .
the eu has joined the row on the swiss side but some countries may jump ship if trade ties with tripoli are threatened . on sunday , libya took the decision to stop issuing visas to citizens of the eu schengen free-travel zone - of which non-eu member switzerland is a signatory - escalating the spat caused by switzerland 's travel ban handed out to one of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's sons . the libyan leader 's son hannibal and his spouse joined 186 other libyan figures barred from visiting switzerland after an incident in july 2008 when two hotel servants in geneva complained hannibal had mistreated them . after hannibal and his pregnant wife aline were arrested in geneva , libya cut oil supplies to switzerland and withdrew more than $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.6 billlion euros -rrb- dollars in assets from swiss banks . libya then prevented two swiss businessmen from leaving the country , and subsequently tried them on visa violations . the row flared up again in november last year when switzerland asked the 25 schengen signatories to restrict visas to libyan passport holders . following that request , libyan prime minister baghadadi al-mahmoudi and other senior officials were denied schengen visas , a refusal that libya 's deputy prime minister khalid kaim blamed on the swiss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the libyan leader took his cash out of switzerland last year last week , a tripoli appeals court reduced an earlier , 16-month prison sentence against max goldi , one of the two swiss businessmen held in libya on visa violations , after a court on february 7 acquitted fellow swiss citizen rachid al-hamdani on the same charges . swiss trauma but the row erupted again at the weekend with libya taking steps which not only punish swiss citizens but those from switzerland 's fellow schengen area signatories . isabelle werenfels , senior associate at the middle east and africa research division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that the whole affair , from the start in 2008 to this week 's developments , has been traumatizing for the swiss . " the libyans have made it very hard for the swiss to get out of libya and it has felt at times like they were hostages there , " she said .
" the airlines are still not allowed to fly out of libya .
many people say that the libya situation is actually at the heart of the swiss attitude towards minarets and muslims .
it has been a very difficult time for switzerland . " while the libyan government has not publicly confirmed the reports , or given a public reason for the decision to ban entry to schengen area citizens , the country 's private daily newspaper oea , which is close to gadhafi 's family , carried the story , quoting a " high-ranking " unidentified official who mentioned both the arrest of hannibal gadhafi and the swiss ban on 188 libyan citizens . schengen countries suffer as libya punishes swiss the italian foreign ministry confirmed the ban on its web site soon after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss banned 188 libyans from crossing its borders " libyan authorities have confirmed the suspension of all types of visas for citizens of schengen states .
in addition , they have specified that citizens from schengen states will be denied entry into libya even if they are in possession of a visa , of whatever duration or type , " a statement on its web site read . the passport-free schengen zone comprises 25 nations , including switzerland , iceland , norway and most european union members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania . werenfels said that predicting the effects of the visa ban would be difficult as libya seemed to be employing an arbitrary ban at the moment .
" libya seems to be targeting high-level business people from europe but we 'll see how long that lasts , " she said .
" this would be damaging for libya too .
it remains to be seen if they ban anyone who works for the petrochemical industry , which is very important to libya .
chances are , in two or three days , gadhafi may find a way out of this while saving face . " strong words from eu but little chance of strong action meanwhile , the european commission declared the libyan decision as being " unilateral and disproportionate . " " the commission also regrets that travellers who legally obtained visas before the suspension measure were refused entry when arriving in libya " , said eu commissioner for home affairs , cecilia malmstrom . she added that the commission is set to discuss the issue " before the end of the week " with schengen countries , with a view to " consider the appropriate reaction . " experts believe that the eu 's show of unity towards switzerland will evaporate when important trade and business relations are put at risk by any further escalation on an eu-wide scale . " it is very important for the eu to speak with one voice .
the eu should use the tools that it has , " sawsan chebli , an associate fellow with the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the eu is libya ’ s greatest trade and export partner .
this is a leverage the eu could use .
however , italy and other eu member states with close relations with libya in the past have shown that they are not interested to spoil their relations with libya whatever gadhafi ’ s action may be .
that is not likely to change .
and the problem is that gadhafi knows that he is able to divide the eu . " italians urge swiss to resolve crisis and leave eu out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini told switzerland to leave europe out its row with libya chebli 's opinion was reinforced by a statement from italy which criticized switzerland and urged the swiss to sort out their differences with the north african country and its leadership . switzerland must " resolve this bi-lateral issue ... but not at the expense of everyone else , " italian foreign minister franco frattini said in a television interview , adding that he had stressed to bern the " sensitivity " of the situation . sawsan chebli believes that italy 's attitude highlights a disregard for european solidarity when business ties - which are strong between italy and libya - are concerned .

a spokesman for the german foreign ministry said the decision by libya was " regrettable , " adding that the government expected the suspension to be cancelled .

citizens of great britain , ireland , cyprus , bulgaria and romania , which are eu members but not in the schengen zone , were exempt from the decision .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gaddafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .
that event led to libya halting oil exports to switzerland and withdrawing some $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- in assets from swiss banks .
the quarrel threatens to complicate business ties between libya and the eu .

juncker said the additional plan should focus on expenditure cuts and revenue-increasing measures .
athens has pledged to reduce its deficit , which was 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2009 , by four percentage points in 2010 .
greece hopes to reduce this further by 2012 to 3 percent - and thus come within the official maximum limit for countries using the euro .
large demands greek finance minister george papaconstantinou defended his country 's efforts to slash the deficit by 2012 .
he also defended the use of " derivated contracts , " used in the past to borrow money without increasing official debt levels , saying they were legal at the time of their use .
critics have said the measures hid the full extent of the country 's financial situation from brussels .
papaconstantinou said that although greece is willing to undertake additional fiscal measures to tackle its debt , urging the country to do more before its report in march is asking for too much .
" we 're trying to change the course of the titanic , it can not be done in a day , " he told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders say they are ready to take action to ensure financial stability papaconstantinou also suggested ministers of euro-zone countries should work on putting substance behind the pledges of support they made last week .
eu leaders did not specify how much they would help , but said they are ready to take " determined and coordinated " action to ensure financial stability in the euro zone if necessary .
the details of the plans are being withheld from the public by greece 's euro-zone partners , as representatives agreed it would be " unwise " to reveal possible measures .
a draft declaration including greece 's obligation to report its situation in march and undertake additional measures if necessary is to be adopted by all 27 eu finance ministers on tuesday. mk / afp / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , with debt mounting , an economic comeback in 2010 appears increasingly unlikely as the celtic tiger struggles to avoid the fate of greece . the economy of the republic of ireland , until the early 1990s , was rooted firmly in agriculture , largely relying on traditional , farm-based businesses .
but in 1994 , ireland began to experience economic growth that would transform one of europe 's poorest nations into one of its richest .
starting that year , ireland used its educated and under utilized english-speaking workforce , state policies that attracted large american corporations eager to make inroads into the european union market , tolerance towards low-skilled immigrant workers and generous corporate tax benefits to fuel expansive economic growth .
property prices soared as wages increased .
personal and public debt levels decreased dramatically .
the ' celtic tiger ' , as ireland came to be known , became a knowledge-based economy .
the 2007 global downturn ended ireland 's positive run , and the crisis of 2008 sent the country into an economic tailspin .
the government could no longer continue wage increases necessary for workers to pay high home prices , leading to widespread mortgage defaults .
ireland 's housing losses were devastating ; its real estate bubble had grown much faster than that in the rest of europe .
debt levels , at historical lows in 2006 , returned to unmanageable levels .
many of the gains made during the celtic tiger 's boom period have been lost in the last three years .
it could take decades to restore them . bildunterschrift : ireland 's construction sector collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis 2010 forecasts discouraging few economists believe ireland will recover this year .
an official forecast released by the irish government last month predicted an average unemployment rate of 13.2 percent in 2010 . the latest quarterly report from dublin-based economic and social research institute -lrb- esri -rrb- estimates an average jobless rate of 13.75 percent this year .
although much higher than european average , this is a significant downward revision from the institute 's spring 2009 forecast , which put unemployment at almost 17 percent by the end of 2010 .
like greece , spain and portugal , ireland 's biggest problem is debt .
tax revenue declines of 20 percent last year have left ireland operating 25 billion euros over budget this year .
meanwhile , homeowners still are forced to pay expensive mortgages on property which has lost significant value .
home prices fell nearly 20 percent last year , according to esri , and are down more than 30 percent since 2007 .
" it is just tragic when you look at the reversal in debt levels , " erik jones , a professor of european studies at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they worked so hard for so long just to be back where they were -lrb- when the economic revival began in the 1990s -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising debt levels have triggered protests in ireland the road forward the european union is not expected to allow ireland 's fiscal problems to become unmanageable .
the european commission last week made clear that while current action would be limited , greece would not be allowed to fail .
the same promise applies to ireland .
the irish government has helped itself by acting with more fiscal discipline than its greek counterpart .
dublin has made sizeable spending cuts in this year 's budget , and public workers , from low level bureaucrats to top public officials , are expected to earn less this year .
philip lane , a professor of international microeconomics at trinity college dublin attributed ireland 's ability to make difficult cuts to the nature of the irish crisis .
" ireland is feeling the pinch because of the burst of the real estate bubble , " he said .
" greece , meanwhile , has chronically overspent for years . "
" we made the cutbacks in ireland because we knew that wages were growing too quickly , that wages were too high , " lane told deutsche welle .
" we knew we needed to get sensible again . "
lane says that once the crisis passes , ireland should revert to the practices that made the early part of the celtic tiger years successful .
" the real celtic tiger was driven by an export boom .
we got diverted by a domestic construction bubble , " he said .
" we need to get back to international business . "

now , with debt mounting , an economic comeback in 2010 appears increasingly unlikely as the celtic tiger struggles to avoid the fate of greece . the economy of the republic of ireland , until the early 1990s , was rooted firmly in agriculture , largely relying on traditional , farm-based businesses .
but in 1994 , ireland began to experience economic growth that would transform one of europe 's poorest nations into one of its richest .
starting that year , ireland used its educated and under utilized english-speaking workforce , state policies that attracted large american corporations eager to make inroads into the european union market , tolerance towards low-skilled immigrant workers and generous corporate tax benefits to fuel expansive economic growth .
property prices soared as wages increased .
personal and public debt levels decreased dramatically .
the ' celtic tiger ' , as ireland came to be known , became a knowledge-based economy .
the 2007 global downturn ended ireland 's positive run , and the crisis of 2008 sent the country into an economic tailspin .
the government could no longer continue wage increases necessary for workers to pay high home prices , leading to widespread mortgage defaults .
ireland 's housing losses were devastating ; its real estate bubble had grown much faster than that in the rest of europe .
debt levels , at historical lows in 2006 , returned to unmanageable levels .
many of the gains made during the celtic tiger 's boom period have been lost in the last three years .
it could take decades to restore them . bildunterschrift : ireland 's construction sector collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis 2010 forecasts discouraging few economists believe ireland will recover this year .
an official forecast released by the irish government last month predicted an average unemployment rate of 13.2 percent in 2010 . the latest quarterly report from dublin-based economic and social research institute -lrb- esri -rrb- estimates an average jobless rate of 13.75 percent this year .
although much higher than european average , this is a significant downward revision from the institute 's spring 2009 forecast , which put unemployment at almost 17 percent by the end of 2010 .
like greece , spain and portugal , ireland 's biggest problem is debt .
tax revenue declines of 20 percent last year have left ireland operating 25 billion euros over budget this year .
meanwhile , homeowners still are forced to pay expensive mortgages on property which has lost significant value .
home prices fell nearly 20 percent last year , according to esri , and are down more than 30 percent since 2007 .
" it is just tragic when you look at the reversal in debt levels , " erik jones , a professor of european studies at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they worked so hard for so long just to be back where they were -lrb- when the economic revival began in the 1990s -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising debt levels have triggered protests in ireland the road forward the european union is not expected to allow ireland 's fiscal problems to become unmanageable .
the european commission last week made clear that while current action would be limited , greece would not be allowed to fail .
the same promise applies to ireland .
the irish government has helped itself by acting with more fiscal discipline than its greek counterpart .
dublin has made sizeable spending cuts in this year 's budget , and public workers , from low level bureaucrats to top public officials , are expected to earn less this year .
philip lane , a professor of international microeconomics at trinity college dublin attributed ireland 's ability to make difficult cuts to the nature of the irish crisis .

little was known about the soviet camps until after the fall of the east german regime . sixty years ago on monday , the last inmates were reported to have been released from the last of a total of 10 internment camps that the russians had set up in what was then the soviet zone of occupation in germany .
their existence had become a thorn in the side of the founding fathers of communist east germany , who were left to deal with requests from the inmates ' family members to tell them what had happened to the prisoners .
documents that became available only after german unification in 1990 indicate that up to 176,000 inmates were held in the soviets ' " special camps . "
thirty-five percent of the detainees are thought to have died there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst zander , here with his wife renate , is unable to forget some of those who survived the camp at buchenwald , which is now a memorial site , met with historians there on saturday to talk about their personal experiences and the latest scientific findings about the soviet camps .
eyewitnesses still able to tell their story ernst zander was a youngster when he was captured by the soviets after the war .
after doing time at a prison at jamlitz , he was sent on to buchenwald .
the nazis had used the site as a concentration camp , where an estimated 50,000 people were executed , starved or worked to death .
after world war ii , the soviets used the same facility for one of their biggest internment camps . zander ended up there , because the russians accused him of being a " wehrwolf " - the standard term back then for a german who tried to fight soviet tanks and machinery as the red army advanced toward berlin in the final stages of the war .
he denies these allegations , saying that he was imprisoned for no crime at all .
he says the conditions he and other prisoners faced at the buchenwald camp were harsh .
" our family did not know we were being held in the camp .
we could not write to anyone .
we were so alone , " zander told deutsche welle .
the director of the buchenwald memorial site foundation , volkhard knigge , hastens to add that all the war-time allies had their own internment camps in germany , emphasizing that of course the soviets too had the right to have such camps after all the cruelty they 'd experienced at the hands of nazi germany .
but he points out that the soviet internment camps differed from those of the western allies .
" buchenwald in particular was a 100 percent stalinist camp between 1945 and its closure in 1950 , " knigge said .
" inmates had no right to complain to anyone .
there was no examination of the facts to establish personal guilt , no case-by-case investigations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a section of the sachsenhausen museum is devoted to soviet special camp no. 7 out of the fire - into the frying pan the last three camps - buchenwald , sachsenhausen and bautzen - were only closed as soviet internment centers in 1950 , several months after the founding of the communist german democratic republic .
some of the inmates were sent on to soviet gulags such as the one at workuta .
others were sentenced to long prison terms after show trials .
others were freed .
" many youngsters were able to start a normal life again , " said knigge .
" but what was difficult for them all was that they could n't openly speak about their experiences in the camps , as east german leaders kept sweeping the issue under the carpet . "
renate zander , the wife of former buchenwald inmate ernst zander , says that even now , the fate of the former detainees is not well known among the general german population .
" teachers here usually do n't want to talk about the events after 1945 , " she said .
" we have seven grandchildren , and they say that they only hear about the holocaust period when talking about the history of the camps at buchenwald and elsewhere .
nobody asks about the later events , because they 're not in the teachers ' minds . "
she also said that she sees little hope that this will be added to school curriculums anytime soon .

little was known about the soviet camps until after the fall of the east german regime . sixty years ago on monday , the last inmates were reported to have been released from the last of a total of 10 internment camps that the russians had set up in what was then the soviet zone of occupation in germany .
their existence had become a thorn in the side of the founding fathers of communist east germany , who were left to deal with requests from the inmates ' family members to tell them what had happened to the prisoners .
documents that became available only after german unification in 1990 indicate that up to 176,000 inmates were held in the soviets ' " special camps . "
thirty-five percent of the detainees are thought to have died there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst zander , here with his wife renate , is unable to forget some of those who survived the camp at buchenwald , which is now a memorial site , met with historians there on saturday to talk about their personal experiences and the latest scientific findings about the soviet camps .
eyewitnesses still able to tell their story ernst zander was a youngster when he was captured by the soviets after the war .
after doing time at a prison at jamlitz , he was sent on to buchenwald .
the nazis had used the site as a concentration camp , where an estimated 50,000 people were executed , starved or worked to death .
after world war ii , the soviets used the same facility for one of their biggest internment camps . zander ended up there , because the russians accused him of being a " wehrwolf " - the standard term back then for a german who tried to fight soviet tanks and machinery as the red army advanced toward berlin in the final stages of the war .
he denies these allegations , saying that he was imprisoned for no crime at all .
he says the conditions he and other prisoners faced at the buchenwald camp were harsh .
" our family did not know we were being held in the camp .
we could not write to anyone .
we were so alone , " zander told deutsche welle .
the director of the buchenwald memorial site foundation , volkhard knigge , hastens to add that all the war-time allies had their own internment camps in germany , emphasizing that of course the soviets too had the right to have such camps after all the cruelty they 'd experienced at the hands of nazi germany .
but he points out that the soviet internment camps differed from those of the western allies .
" buchenwald in particular was a 100 percent stalinist camp between 1945 and its closure in 1950 , " knigge said .
" inmates had no right to complain to anyone .
there was no examination of the facts to establish personal guilt , no case-by-case investigations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a section of the sachsenhausen museum is devoted to soviet special camp no. 7 out of the fire - into the frying pan the last three camps - buchenwald , sachsenhausen and bautzen - were only closed as soviet internment centers in 1950 , several months after the founding of the communist german democratic republic .
some of the inmates were sent on to soviet gulags such as the one at workuta .
others were sentenced to long prison terms after show trials .
others were freed .
" many youngsters were able to start a normal life again , " said knigge .
" but what was difficult for them all was that they could n't openly speak about their experiences in the camps , as east german leaders kept sweeping the issue under the carpet . "
renate zander , the wife of former buchenwald inmate ernst zander , says that even now , the fate of the former detainees is not well known among the general german population .
" teachers here usually do n't want to talk about the events after 1945 , " she said .
" we have seven grandchildren , and they say that they only hear about the holocaust period when talking about the history of the camps at buchenwald and elsewhere .
nobody asks about the later events , because they 're not in the teachers ' minds . "
she also said that she sees little hope that this will be added to school curriculums anytime soon .

not so - in fact , they flourish . it took ruud van nistelrooy just 10 minutes on saturday to make the kind of impact hamburg were hoping for from the dutch striker when they bought him from real madrid in the january transfer window .

despite winning two league titles with madrid in his three-and-a-half seasons with them , and scoring 46 goals in 68 appearances for los blancos , the latest galacticos policy at the santiago bernabeu left van nistelrooy out in the cold and surplus to requirements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy showed he 's far from a washed-up has-been " depending on how he 's used , ruud can still be a sensation and will do very well in the bundesliga if he 's used smartly and is allowed his rest , " said jan roskott , dutch soccer correspondent for the offside.com . " his biggest strength - in my view - is his focus and his mental strength .
he 's a real killer .
the thing with ruud is , his scoring ratio is high .

in a statement from the vatican city on tuesday , benedict said such acts of abuse were " not only a heinous crime , but also a grave sin which offends god and wounds the dignity of the human person created in his image .
" -lsb- benedict -rsb- challenged the bishops to address the problems of the past with determination and resolve , and to face the present crisis with honesty and courage , " the statement added .
ireland 's 24 standing bishops , summoned to the vatican to address the crisis , told the pontiff of their " shame " at the scandal and vowed to cooperate with authorities in ireland .
in a statement of their own , they said " significant measures have now been taken to ensure the safety of children and young people " involved in church-led activities .
murphy commission the irish church is facing criticism from a commission headed by judge yvonne murphy , which in november accused it of mishandling more than 300 sex abuse claims in the archdiocese of dublin between 1975 and 2004 .
four irish bishops have already tendered their resignations as a consequence of the murphy commission 's revelations .
to date , the pope has accepted one of the resignations .
the vatican statement did not mention specific disciplinary measures to be taken against the remaining three clerics involved in the scandal .
the resignations of the clerics and other church officials in ireland " were not discussed , " said chief vatican spokesman father federico lombardi .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de greece -pipe- 16.02.2010 the evolution of greece 's financial woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is greece doomed to repeat its financial history ?
greece 's financial woes started decades ago when the country was ruled by one socialist regime after another .
now experts warn that unless greece learns from its financial history , it is bound to repeat it . who would have imagined it ?
greece could soon be bankrupt and there are some speculations that athens will begin refusing payment on its obligations .
due to massive debt and doctored data , greece has lost the trust of both the european union and the financial markets .
and it 's not looking good for athens , despite an eu security net .
greece currently owes foreign banks more than $ 300 billion -lrb- 219.8 billion euros -rrb- , which equals 115 percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
their current debt amounts to more then 12.7 percent of their economic output .
but how did it get this far ?
spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "
repeating history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overspending led to greece 's current situation this is not new territory for greece .
back in the 1980 's and 1990 's the country faced similar financial difficulties .
back then the socialist governments solved the problem by devaluing the country 's former currency , the drachma .
that way they were able to shrink imports and raise exports .
but economic expert babi papadimitriou said this option became unavailable when greece entered into the euro zone . over the past few years the political elite and the greek government have not really grasped what it means to be a member of the euro zone , the economist said .
" it goes without saying that you have to reduce your deficit as much as possible when you share your currency with other countries , " he said .
" but those in power have ignored this principle .
and the necessary reforms were never imposed . "
the state acted irresponsibly as costs began to mount and the ability for the economy to compete on an international level was reduced .
when added to the global financial crisis that hit back in 2008 , these structural weak points became a full-blown nightmare .
cutting costs the country 's biggest problem is the state itself and the services it offers .
according to professor paraskewopoulos , the largest share of savings could come from cutting the costs incurred by public employees : reducing tax exceptions , putting a hiring freeze on state offices and reducing employee salaries .
along with this , he said the government needs to tackle two other major hurdles : tax evasion and corruption . each year the greek government loses 20 billion euros in unpaid taxes , and it is estimated that the average greek family pays out some 1,600 euros annually in bribes .
notoriously , things rarely work in the country without a little money to grease the wheels .
bildunterschrift : greek prime minister george papandreou has some very unenviable choices to make " those in power have always rewarded those loyal to them with cushy jobs and now we have a bloated government that costs an inconceivable amount of money .
that 's where you have to start , " explained paraskewopoulos .
" of course that 's easy to say , but to really do it , you have to be prepared to deal with the people affected . "
and that is exactly what papandreou 's government is facing at the moment .
the public sector has gone on strike and indignant farmers are blocking the motorways and border crossings .
however , both experts agree that unless they get rid of the subsidies and begin to privatize state agencies , cleaning up the financial mess will be impossible .

greece 's financial woes started decades ago when the country was ruled by one socialist regime after another .
now experts warn that unless greece learns from its financial history , it is bound to repeat it . who would have imagined it ?
greece could soon be bankrupt and there are some speculations that athens will begin refusing payment on its obligations .
due to massive debt and doctored data , greece has lost the trust of both the european union and the financial markets .
and it 's not looking good for athens , despite an eu security net .
greece currently owes foreign banks more than $ 300 billion -lrb- 219.8 billion euros -rrb- , which equals 115 percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
their current debt amounts to more then 12.7 percent of their economic output .
but how did it get this far ?
spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "
repeating history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overspending led to greece 's current situation this is not new territory for greece .
back in the 1980 's and 1990 's the country faced similar financial difficulties .
back then the socialist governments solved the problem by devaluing the country 's former currency , the drachma .
that way they were able to shrink imports and raise exports .
but economic expert babi papadimitriou said this option became unavailable when greece entered into the euro zone . over the past few years the political elite and the greek government have not really grasped what it means to be a member of the euro zone , the economist said .
" it goes without saying that you have to reduce your deficit as much as possible when you share your currency with other countries , " he said .
" but those in power have ignored this principle .
and the necessary reforms were never imposed . "
the state acted irresponsibly as costs began to mount and the ability for the economy to compete on an international level was reduced .
when added to the global financial crisis that hit back in 2008 , these structural weak points became a full-blown nightmare .
cutting costs the country 's biggest problem is the state itself and the services it offers .
according to professor paraskewopoulos , the largest share of savings could come from cutting the costs incurred by public employees : reducing tax exceptions , putting a hiring freeze on state offices and reducing employee salaries .
along with this , he said the government needs to tackle two other major hurdles : tax evasion and corruption . each year the greek government loses 20 billion euros in unpaid taxes , and it is estimated that the average greek family pays out some 1,600 euros annually in bribes .
notoriously , things rarely work in the country without a little money to grease the wheels .
bildunterschrift : greek prime minister george papandreou has some very unenviable choices to make " those in power have always rewarded those loyal to them with cushy jobs and now we have a bloated government that costs an inconceivable amount of money .
that 's where you have to start , " explained paraskewopoulos .
" of course that 's easy to say , but to really do it , you have to be prepared to deal with the people affected . "
and that is exactly what papandreou 's government is facing at the moment .
the public sector has gone on strike and indignant farmers are blocking the motorways and border crossings .
however , both experts agree that unless they get rid of the subsidies and begin to privatize state agencies , cleaning up the financial mess will be impossible .

that may be good news for germany 's axel weber , who hopes to make president . european union finance ministers on tuesday unanimously recommended portugal 's vitor constancio to be the next vice president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , an eu statement said .
if confirmed by the european parliament next month , constancio will succeed greece 's lucas papdemos in may .

greece 's financial woes started decades ago when the country was ruled by one socialist regime after another .
now experts warn that unless greece learns from its financial history , it is bound to repeat it . who would have imagined it ?
greece could soon be bankrupt and there are some speculations that athens will begin refusing payment on its obligations .
due to massive debt and doctored data , greece has lost the trust of both the european union and the financial markets .
and it 's not looking good for athens , despite an eu security net .
greece currently owes foreign banks more than $ 300 billion -lrb- 219.8 billion euros -rrb- , which equals 115 percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
their current debt amounts to more then 12.7 percent of their economic output .
but how did it get this far ?
spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "
repeating history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overspending led to greece 's current situation this is not new territory for greece .
back in the 1980 's and 1990 's the country faced similar financial difficulties .
back then the socialist governments solved the problem by devaluing the country 's former currency , the drachma .
that way they were able to shrink imports and raise exports .
but economic expert babi papadimitriou said this option became unavailable when greece entered into the euro zone . over the past few years the political elite and the greek government have not really grasped what it means to be a member of the euro zone , the economist said .
" it goes without saying that you have to reduce your deficit as much as possible when you share your currency with other countries , " he said .
" but those in power have ignored this principle .
and the necessary reforms were never imposed . "
the state acted irresponsibly as costs began to mount and the ability for the economy to compete on an international level was reduced .
when added to the global financial crisis that hit back in 2008 , these structural weak points became a full-blown nightmare .
cutting costs the country 's biggest problem is the state itself and the services it offers .
according to professor paraskewopoulos , the largest share of savings could come from cutting the costs incurred by public employees : reducing tax exceptions , putting a hiring freeze on state offices and reducing employee salaries .
along with this , he said the government needs to tackle two other major hurdles : tax evasion and corruption . each year the greek government loses 20 billion euros in unpaid taxes , and it is estimated that the average greek family pays out some 1,600 euros annually in bribes .
notoriously , things rarely work in the country without a little money to grease the wheels .
bildunterschrift : greek prime minister george papandreou has some very unenviable choices to make " those in power have always rewarded those loyal to them with cushy jobs and now we have a bloated government that costs an inconceivable amount of money .
that 's where you have to start , " explained paraskewopoulos .
" of course that 's easy to say , but to really do it , you have to be prepared to deal with the people affected . "
and that is exactly what papandreou 's government is facing at the moment .
the public sector has gone on strike and indignant farmers are blocking the motorways and border crossings .
however , both experts agree that unless they get rid of the subsidies and begin to privatize state agencies , cleaning up the financial mess will be impossible .

a heterosexual couple in austria has vowed to go to the country 's highest court - to be granted a civil partnership introduced for gay couples .
they argue that current legislation is discriminatory . a heterosexual couple in austria is fighting for the right to enter into a registered civil partnership - introduced for homosexual couples in january 2010 .
under current law the couple will be denied that right - but they have vowed to take the case to the country 's constitutional court to overturn what they says is a discriminatory legislation .
austria introduced civil unions for gay couples on january 1 , affording them some of the rights enjoyed by their heterosexual counterparts .
the new legislation , passed after weeks of wrangling between the ruling social democrats and their conservative coalition partner in government , gives same-sex couples a status similar to traditional marriage but different in a number of respects .
for instance , there are less strict rules in the event of a divorce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the issue is equality - nothing but equality , ' the couple argues the heterosexual couple in question argues that this is a more modern form of union - which simply suits them better than a traditional marriage .
and if it 's offered to gay couples , why should n't it be an option for them as well ?
the issue at stake , they argue , is standing up against discrimination .
" everyone should have the same rights , and there should n't be different rules for different people , " the couple 's lawyer , helmut graupner , told deutsche welle .
" regardless of how many different forms of union a state provides to couples , all of those forms should be available for everyone and must not be restricted on the basis of race , class or sex or gender or other criteria , which are traditionally the very criteria for discrimination , " graupner said .
can you be ' a little bit equal ' ?
at the end of february , the couple plans to officially apply for a civil partnership - they expect this to be rejected , in which case they plan to take their case to the constitutional court .
their goal is to force the government to rework the legislation so that both traditional marriage and registered partnership will be open to any couple - gay or straight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay and lesbian activists say the different forms of union are discriminatory " the issue is equality - nothing but equality , " graupner said .
" you can not be ' a little bit equal . '
just like you ca n't be ' a little bit pregnant ' or ' a little bit dead . '
unless you 're entitled to the same kind of institutions and forms of law you 're not being treated equally and that 's discriminatory .
that 's what we are fighting against - we 're fighting for the rights of both heterosexuals and homosexuals . "
graupner is not only trying to help the heterosexual couple to get a ' gay ' marriage .
he 's also representing gay couples who want a traditional marriage - rather than the registered civil partnership that lawmakers have agreed on .
the current legislation provides same-sex couples with equal rights to heterosexuals with regards to pensions and alimony - but the law for instance continues to ban adoption .
it also does not allow civil partnership ceremonies at the civil registry office , where heterosexual couples can marry .
yet graupner is up against strong resistance .
the country 's conservative party - the austrian peoples party - only reluctantly agreed to the civil partnership in the first place .
the conservatives insists that significant differences between the two forms of union must remain .
the catholic church is not amused another powerful opponent to the law is the roman catholic church - after all , austria is predominantly catholic and the church is a force to be reckoned with .
the country 's clergy is opposed to the existing law , and certainly against any further liberalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the church ' different things need to be treated differently ' " the austrian bishops have made their position quite clear , " professor erich leitenberger , spokesman for the vienna diocese told deutsche welle .
" they strongly support the fact that the law does not put the civil partnership and a traditional marriage on an equal footing . "
" but the bishops have expressed concerns that the new law could be the beginning of a trend which eventually will lead to putting the civil partnership on the same footing as the traditional marriage between a man and a woman . "
leitenberger said that the legislation in place before january 1 was sufficient to safeguard the rights of gay and lesbian couples .
families , he argued , were shouldering the task of raising children and therefore could not be put on the same level with same-sex couples .
" the bishops stick to their position that a traditional marriage , a family raising children simply is something different from a homosexual couple - and therefore should also be treated differently . "
however , should the appeal to the constitutional court be successful , soon both of the two forms of union , could be open to any couple - a situation that would place austria at the forefront in terms of homosexual rights in europe .
the decision by the court is expected by the end of this year .

a heterosexual couple in austria has vowed to go to the country 's highest court - to be granted a civil partnership introduced for gay couples .
they argue that current legislation is discriminatory . a heterosexual couple in austria is fighting for the right to enter into a registered civil partnership - introduced for homosexual couples in january 2010 .
under current law the couple will be denied that right - but they have vowed to take the case to the country 's constitutional court to overturn what they says is a discriminatory legislation .
austria introduced civil unions for gay couples on january 1 , affording them some of the rights enjoyed by their heterosexual counterparts .
the new legislation , passed after weeks of wrangling between the ruling social democrats and their conservative coalition partner in government , gives same-sex couples a status similar to traditional marriage but different in a number of respects .
for instance , there are less strict rules in the event of a divorce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the issue is equality - nothing but equality , ' the couple argues the heterosexual couple in question argues that this is a more modern form of union - which simply suits them better than a traditional marriage .
and if it 's offered to gay couples , why should n't it be an option for them as well ?
the issue at stake , they argue , is standing up against discrimination .
" everyone should have the same rights , and there should n't be different rules for different people , " the couple 's lawyer , helmut graupner , told deutsche welle .
" regardless of how many different forms of union a state provides to couples , all of those forms should be available for everyone and must not be restricted on the basis of race , class or sex or gender or other criteria , which are traditionally the very criteria for discrimination , " graupner said .
can you be ' a little bit equal ' ?
at the end of february , the couple plans to officially apply for a civil partnership - they expect this to be rejected , in which case they plan to take their case to the constitutional court .
their goal is to force the government to rework the legislation so that both traditional marriage and registered partnership will be open to any couple - gay or straight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay and lesbian activists say the different forms of union are discriminatory " the issue is equality - nothing but equality , " graupner said .
" you can not be ' a little bit equal . '
just like you ca n't be ' a little bit pregnant ' or ' a little bit dead . '
unless you 're entitled to the same kind of institutions and forms of law you 're not being treated equally and that 's discriminatory .
that 's what we are fighting against - we 're fighting for the rights of both heterosexuals and homosexuals . "
graupner is not only trying to help the heterosexual couple to get a ' gay ' marriage .
he 's also representing gay couples who want a traditional marriage - rather than the registered civil partnership that lawmakers have agreed on .
the current legislation provides same-sex couples with equal rights to heterosexuals with regards to pensions and alimony - but the law for instance continues to ban adoption .
it also does not allow civil partnership ceremonies at the civil registry office , where heterosexual couples can marry .
yet graupner is up against strong resistance .
the country 's conservative party - the austrian peoples party - only reluctantly agreed to the civil partnership in the first place .
the conservatives insists that significant differences between the two forms of union must remain .
the catholic church is not amused another powerful opponent to the law is the roman catholic church - after all , austria is predominantly catholic and the church is a force to be reckoned with .
the country 's clergy is opposed to the existing law , and certainly against any further liberalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the church ' different things need to be treated differently ' " the austrian bishops have made their position quite clear , " professor erich leitenberger , spokesman for the vienna diocese told deutsche welle .

" but the bishops have expressed concerns that the new law could be the beginning of a trend which eventually will lead to putting the civil partnership on the same footing as the traditional marriage between a man and a woman . "

a heterosexual couple in austria has vowed to go to the country 's highest court - to be granted a civil partnership introduced for gay couples .
they argue that current legislation is discriminatory . a heterosexual couple in austria is fighting for the right to enter into a registered civil partnership - introduced for homosexual couples in january 2010 .
under current law the couple will be denied that right - but they have vowed to take the case to the country 's constitutional court to overturn what they says is a discriminatory legislation .
austria introduced civil unions for gay couples on january 1 , affording them some of the rights enjoyed by their heterosexual counterparts .
the new legislation , passed after weeks of wrangling between the ruling social democrats and their conservative coalition partner in government , gives same-sex couples a status similar to traditional marriage but different in a number of respects .
for instance , there are less strict rules in the event of a divorce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the issue is equality - nothing but equality , ' the couple argues the heterosexual couple in question argues that this is a more modern form of union - which simply suits them better than a traditional marriage .
and if it 's offered to gay couples , why should n't it be an option for them as well ?
the issue at stake , they argue , is standing up against discrimination .
" everyone should have the same rights , and there should n't be different rules for different people , " the couple 's lawyer , helmut graupner , told deutsche welle .
" regardless of how many different forms of union a state provides to couples , all of those forms should be available for everyone and must not be restricted on the basis of race , class or sex or gender or other criteria , which are traditionally the very criteria for discrimination , " graupner said .

greece 's financial woes started decades ago when the country was ruled by one socialist regime after another .
now experts warn that unless greece learns from its financial history , it is bound to repeat it . who would have imagined it ?
greece could soon be bankrupt and there are some speculations that athens will begin refusing payment on its obligations .
due to massive debt and doctored data , greece has lost the trust of both the european union and the financial markets .
and it 's not looking good for athens , despite an eu security net .
greece currently owes foreign banks more than $ 300 billion -lrb- 219.8 billion euros -rrb- , which equals 115 percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
their current debt amounts to more then 12.7 percent of their economic output .
but how did it get this far ?
spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "
repeating history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overspending led to greece 's current situation this is not new territory for greece .
back in the 1980 's and 1990 's the country faced similar financial difficulties .
back then the socialist governments solved the problem by devaluing the country 's former currency , the drachma .
that way they were able to shrink imports and raise exports .
but economic expert babi papadimitriou said this option became unavailable when greece entered into the euro zone . over the past few years the political elite and the greek government have not really grasped what it means to be a member of the euro zone , the economist said .
" it goes without saying that you have to reduce your deficit as much as possible when you share your currency with other countries , " he said .
" but those in power have ignored this principle .
and the necessary reforms were never imposed . "
the state acted irresponsibly as costs began to mount and the ability for the economy to compete on an international level was reduced .
when added to the global financial crisis that hit back in 2008 , these structural weak points became a full-blown nightmare .
cutting costs the country 's biggest problem is the state itself and the services it offers .
according to professor paraskewopoulos , the largest share of savings could come from cutting the costs incurred by public employees : reducing tax exceptions , putting a hiring freeze on state offices and reducing employee salaries .
along with this , he said the government needs to tackle two other major hurdles : tax evasion and corruption . each year the greek government loses 20 billion euros in unpaid taxes , and it is estimated that the average greek family pays out some 1,600 euros annually in bribes .
notoriously , things rarely work in the country without a little money to grease the wheels .
bildunterschrift : greek prime minister george papandreou has some very unenviable choices to make " those in power have always rewarded those loyal to them with cushy jobs and now we have a bloated government that costs an inconceivable amount of money .
that 's where you have to start , " explained paraskewopoulos .
" of course that 's easy to say , but to really do it , you have to be prepared to deal with the people affected . "
and that is exactly what papandreou 's government is facing at the moment .
the public sector has gone on strike and indignant farmers are blocking the motorways and border crossings .
however , both experts agree that unless they get rid of the subsidies and begin to privatize state agencies , cleaning up the financial mess will be impossible .

spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "
repeating history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overspending led to greece 's current situation this is not new territory for greece .
back in the 1980 's and 1990 's the country faced similar financial difficulties .
back then the socialist governments solved the problem by devaluing the country 's former currency , the drachma .
that way they were able to shrink imports and raise exports .
but economic expert babi papadimitriou said this option became unavailable when greece entered into the euro zone . over the past few years the political elite and the greek government have not really grasped what it means to be a member of the euro zone , the economist said .
" it goes without saying that you have to reduce your deficit as much as possible when you share your currency with other countries , " he said .
" but those in power have ignored this principle .
and the necessary reforms were never imposed . "
the state acted irresponsibly as costs began to mount and the ability for the economy to compete on an international level was reduced .
when added to the global financial crisis that hit back in 2008 , these structural weak points became a full-blown nightmare .
cutting costs the country 's biggest problem is the state itself and the services it offers .
according to professor paraskewopoulos , the largest share of savings could come from cutting the costs incurred by public employees : reducing tax exceptions , putting a hiring freeze on state offices and reducing employee salaries .
along with this , he said the government needs to tackle two other major hurdles : tax evasion and corruption . each year the greek government loses 20 billion euros in unpaid taxes , and it is estimated that the average greek family pays out some 1,600 euros annually in bribes .
notoriously , things rarely work in the country without a little money to grease the wheels .
bildunterschrift : greek prime minister george papandreou has some very unenviable choices to make " those in power have always rewarded those loyal to them with cushy jobs and now we have a bloated government that costs an inconceivable amount of money .
that 's where you have to start , " explained paraskewopoulos .
" of course that 's easy to say , but to really do it , you have to be prepared to deal with the people affected . "
and that is exactly what papandreou 's government is facing at the moment .
the public sector has gone on strike and indignant farmers are blocking the motorways and border crossings .
however , both experts agree that unless they get rid of the subsidies and begin to privatize state agencies , cleaning up the financial mess will be impossible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : gay rights as civil rights under international pressure , uganda mulls amending anti-gay bill china 's gays : still a long way to go pope criticizes british equality legislation portuguese mps vote in favor of legalization of gay marriage civil rights -pipe- 16.02.2010 austrian straight couple applies for gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marriage for heterosexuals -registered partnership for homosexuals ?
a heterosexual couple in austria has vowed to go to the country 's highest court - to be granted a civil partnership introduced for gay couples .
they argue that current legislation is discriminatory . a heterosexual couple in austria is fighting for the right to enter into a registered civil partnership - introduced for homosexual couples in january 2010 .
under current law the couple will be denied that right - but they have vowed to take the case to the country 's constitutional court to overturn what they says is a discriminatory legislation .
austria introduced civil unions for gay couples on january 1 , affording them some of the rights enjoyed by their heterosexual counterparts .
the new legislation , passed after weeks of wrangling between the ruling social democrats and their conservative coalition partner in government , gives same-sex couples a status similar to traditional marriage but different in a number of respects .
for instance , there are less strict rules in the event of a divorce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the issue is equality - nothing but equality , ' the couple argues the heterosexual couple in question argues that this is a more modern form of union - which simply suits them better than a traditional marriage .
and if it 's offered to gay couples , why should n't it be an option for them as well ?
the issue at stake , they argue , is standing up against discrimination .
" everyone should have the same rights , and there should n't be different rules for different people , " the couple 's lawyer , helmut graupner , told deutsche welle .
" regardless of how many different forms of union a state provides to couples , all of those forms should be available for everyone and must not be restricted on the basis of race , class or sex or gender or other criteria , which are traditionally the very criteria for discrimination , " graupner said .
can you be ' a little bit equal ' ?
at the end of february , the couple plans to officially apply for a civil partnership - they expect this to be rejected , in which case they plan to take their case to the constitutional court .
their goal is to force the government to rework the legislation so that both traditional marriage and registered partnership will be open to any couple - gay or straight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay and lesbian activists say the different forms of union are discriminatory " the issue is equality - nothing but equality , " graupner said .
" you can not be ' a little bit equal . '
just like you ca n't be ' a little bit pregnant ' or ' a little bit dead . '
unless you 're entitled to the same kind of institutions and forms of law you 're not being treated equally and that 's discriminatory .
that 's what we are fighting against - we 're fighting for the rights of both heterosexuals and homosexuals . "
graupner is not only trying to help the heterosexual couple to get a ' gay ' marriage .
he 's also representing gay couples who want a traditional marriage - rather than the registered civil partnership that lawmakers have agreed on .
the current legislation provides same-sex couples with equal rights to heterosexuals with regards to pensions and alimony - but the law for instance continues to ban adoption .
it also does not allow civil partnership ceremonies at the civil registry office , where heterosexual couples can marry .
yet graupner is up against strong resistance .
the country 's conservative party - the austrian peoples party - only reluctantly agreed to the civil partnership in the first place .
the conservatives insists that significant differences between the two forms of union must remain .
the catholic church is not amused another powerful opponent to the law is the roman catholic church - after all , austria is predominantly catholic and the church is a force to be reckoned with .
the country 's clergy is opposed to the existing law , and certainly against any further liberalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the church ' different things need to be treated differently ' " the austrian bishops have made their position quite clear , " professor erich leitenberger , spokesman for the vienna diocese told deutsche welle .
" they strongly support the fact that the law does not put the civil partnership and a traditional marriage on an equal footing . "
" but the bishops have expressed concerns that the new law could be the beginning of a trend which eventually will lead to putting the civil partnership on the same footing as the traditional marriage between a man and a woman . "
leitenberger said that the legislation in place before january 1 was sufficient to safeguard the rights of gay and lesbian couples .
families , he argued , were shouldering the task of raising children and therefore could not be put on the same level with same-sex couples .
" the bishops stick to their position that a traditional marriage , a family raising children simply is something different from a homosexual couple - and therefore should also be treated differently . "
however , should the appeal to the constitutional court be successful , soon both of the two forms of union , could be open to any couple - a situation that would place austria at the forefront in terms of homosexual rights in europe .
the decision by the court is expected by the end of this year .

greece 's financial woes started decades ago when the country was ruled by one socialist regime after another .
now experts warn that unless greece learns from its financial history , it is bound to repeat it . who would have imagined it ?
greece could soon be bankrupt and there are some speculations that athens will begin refusing payment on its obligations .
due to massive debt and doctored data , greece has lost the trust of both the european union and the financial markets .
and it 's not looking good for athens , despite an eu security net .
greece currently owes foreign banks more than $ 300 billion -lrb- 219.8 billion euros -rrb- , which equals 115 percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
their current debt amounts to more then 12.7 percent of their economic output .
but how did it get this far ?
spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "
repeating history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overspending led to greece 's current situation this is not new territory for greece .
back in the 1980 's and 1990 's the country faced similar financial difficulties .
back then the socialist governments solved the problem by devaluing the country 's former currency , the drachma .
that way they were able to shrink imports and raise exports .
but economic expert babi papadimitriou said this option became unavailable when greece entered into the euro zone . over the past few years the political elite and the greek government have not really grasped what it means to be a member of the euro zone , the economist said .
" it goes without saying that you have to reduce your deficit as much as possible when you share your currency with other countries , " he said .
" but those in power have ignored this principle .
and the necessary reforms were never imposed . "
the state acted irresponsibly as costs began to mount and the ability for the economy to compete on an international level was reduced .
when added to the global financial crisis that hit back in 2008 , these structural weak points became a full-blown nightmare .
cutting costs the country 's biggest problem is the state itself and the services it offers .
according to professor paraskewopoulos , the largest share of savings could come from cutting the costs incurred by public employees : reducing tax exceptions , putting a hiring freeze on state offices and reducing employee salaries .
along with this , he said the government needs to tackle two other major hurdles : tax evasion and corruption . each year the greek government loses 20 billion euros in unpaid taxes , and it is estimated that the average greek family pays out some 1,600 euros annually in bribes .
notoriously , things rarely work in the country without a little money to grease the wheels .
bildunterschrift : greek prime minister george papandreou has some very unenviable choices to make " those in power have always rewarded those loyal to them with cushy jobs and now we have a bloated government that costs an inconceivable amount of money .
that 's where you have to start , " explained paraskewopoulos .
" of course that 's easy to say , but to really do it , you have to be prepared to deal with the people affected . "
and that is exactly what papandreou 's government is facing at the moment .
the public sector has gone on strike and indignant farmers are blocking the motorways and border crossings .
however , both experts agree that unless they get rid of the subsidies and begin to privatize state agencies , cleaning up the financial mess will be impossible .

in a statement from the vatican city on tuesday , benedict said such acts of abuse were " not only a heinous crime , but also a grave sin which offends god and wounds the dignity of the human person created in his image .
" -lsb- benedict -rsb- challenged the bishops to address the problems of the past with determination and resolve , and to face the present crisis with honesty and courage , " the statement added .
ireland 's 24 standing bishops , summoned to the vatican to address the crisis , told the pontiff of their " shame " at the scandal and vowed to cooperate with authorities in ireland .

a heterosexual couple in austria has vowed to go to the country 's highest court - to be granted a civil partnership introduced for gay couples .
they argue that current legislation is discriminatory . a heterosexual couple in austria is fighting for the right to enter into a registered civil partnership - introduced for homosexual couples in january 2010 .
under current law the couple will be denied that right - but they have vowed to take the case to the country 's constitutional court to overturn what they says is a discriminatory legislation .
austria introduced civil unions for gay couples on january 1 , affording them some of the rights enjoyed by their heterosexual counterparts .
the new legislation , passed after weeks of wrangling between the ruling social democrats and their conservative coalition partner in government , gives same-sex couples a status similar to traditional marriage but different in a number of respects .
for instance , there are less strict rules in the event of a divorce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the issue is equality - nothing but equality , ' the couple argues the heterosexual couple in question argues that this is a more modern form of union - which simply suits them better than a traditional marriage .
and if it 's offered to gay couples , why should n't it be an option for them as well ?
the issue at stake , they argue , is standing up against discrimination .
" everyone should have the same rights , and there should n't be different rules for different people , " the couple 's lawyer , helmut graupner , told deutsche welle .
" regardless of how many different forms of union a state provides to couples , all of those forms should be available for everyone and must not be restricted on the basis of race , class or sex or gender or other criteria , which are traditionally the very criteria for discrimination , " graupner said .
can you be ' a little bit equal ' ?
at the end of february , the couple plans to officially apply for a civil partnership - they expect this to be rejected , in which case they plan to take their case to the constitutional court .
their goal is to force the government to rework the legislation so that both traditional marriage and registered partnership will be open to any couple - gay or straight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay and lesbian activists say the different forms of union are discriminatory " the issue is equality - nothing but equality , " graupner said .
" you can not be ' a little bit equal . '
just like you ca n't be ' a little bit pregnant ' or ' a little bit dead . '
unless you 're entitled to the same kind of institutions and forms of law you 're not being treated equally and that 's discriminatory .
that 's what we are fighting against - we 're fighting for the rights of both heterosexuals and homosexuals . "
graupner is not only trying to help the heterosexual couple to get a ' gay ' marriage .
he 's also representing gay couples who want a traditional marriage - rather than the registered civil partnership that lawmakers have agreed on .
the current legislation provides same-sex couples with equal rights to heterosexuals with regards to pensions and alimony - but the law for instance continues to ban adoption .
it also does not allow civil partnership ceremonies at the civil registry office , where heterosexual couples can marry .
yet graupner is up against strong resistance .
the country 's conservative party - the austrian peoples party - only reluctantly agreed to the civil partnership in the first place .
the conservatives insists that significant differences between the two forms of union must remain .
the catholic church is not amused another powerful opponent to the law is the roman catholic church - after all , austria is predominantly catholic and the church is a force to be reckoned with .
the country 's clergy is opposed to the existing law , and certainly against any further liberalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the church ' different things need to be treated differently ' " the austrian bishops have made their position quite clear , " professor erich leitenberger , spokesman for the vienna diocese told deutsche welle .
" they strongly support the fact that the law does not put the civil partnership and a traditional marriage on an equal footing . "
" but the bishops have expressed concerns that the new law could be the beginning of a trend which eventually will lead to putting the civil partnership on the same footing as the traditional marriage between a man and a woman . "
leitenberger said that the legislation in place before january 1 was sufficient to safeguard the rights of gay and lesbian couples .
families , he argued , were shouldering the task of raising children and therefore could not be put on the same level with same-sex couples .
" the bishops stick to their position that a traditional marriage , a family raising children simply is something different from a homosexual couple - and therefore should also be treated differently . "
however , should the appeal to the constitutional court be successful , soon both of the two forms of union , could be open to any couple - a situation that would place austria at the forefront in terms of homosexual rights in europe .
the decision by the court is expected by the end of this year .

now , with debt mounting , an economic comeback in 2010 appears increasingly unlikely as the celtic tiger struggles to avoid the fate of greece . the economy of the republic of ireland , until the early 1990s , was rooted firmly in agriculture , largely relying on traditional , farm-based businesses .
but in 1994 , ireland began to experience economic growth that would transform one of europe 's poorest nations into one of its richest .
starting that year , ireland used its educated and under utilized english-speaking workforce , state policies that attracted large american corporations eager to make inroads into the european union market , tolerance towards low-skilled immigrant workers and generous corporate tax benefits to fuel expansive economic growth .
property prices soared as wages increased .
personal and public debt levels decreased dramatically .
the ' celtic tiger ' , as ireland came to be known , became a knowledge-based economy .
the 2007 global downturn ended ireland 's positive run , and the crisis of 2008 sent the country into an economic tailspin .
the government could no longer continue wage increases necessary for workers to pay high home prices , leading to widespread mortgage defaults .
ireland 's housing losses were devastating ; its real estate bubble had grown much faster than that in the rest of europe .
debt levels , at historical lows in 2006 , returned to unmanageable levels .
many of the gains made during the celtic tiger 's boom period have been lost in the last three years .
it could take decades to restore them . bildunterschrift : ireland 's construction sector collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis 2010 forecasts discouraging few economists believe ireland will recover this year .
an official forecast released by the irish government last month predicted an average unemployment rate of 13.2 percent in 2010 . the latest quarterly report from dublin-based economic and social research institute -lrb- esri -rrb- estimates an average jobless rate of 13.75 percent this year .
although much higher than european average , this is a significant downward revision from the institute 's spring 2009 forecast , which put unemployment at almost 17 percent by the end of 2010 .
like greece , spain and portugal , ireland 's biggest problem is debt .
tax revenue declines of 20 percent last year have left ireland operating 25 billion euros over budget this year .
meanwhile , homeowners still are forced to pay expensive mortgages on property which has lost significant value .
home prices fell nearly 20 percent last year , according to esri , and are down more than 30 percent since 2007 .
" it is just tragic when you look at the reversal in debt levels , " erik jones , a professor of european studies at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they worked so hard for so long just to be back where they were -lrb- when the economic revival began in the 1990s -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising debt levels have triggered protests in ireland the road forward the european union is not expected to allow ireland 's fiscal problems to become unmanageable .
the european commission last week made clear that while current action would be limited , greece would not be allowed to fail .
the same promise applies to ireland .
the irish government has helped itself by acting with more fiscal discipline than its greek counterpart .
dublin has made sizeable spending cuts in this year 's budget , and public workers , from low level bureaucrats to top public officials , are expected to earn less this year .
philip lane , a professor of international microeconomics at trinity college dublin attributed ireland 's ability to make difficult cuts to the nature of the irish crisis .

" greece , meanwhile , has chronically overspent for years . "
" we made the cutbacks in ireland because we knew that wages were growing too quickly , that wages were too high , " lane told deutsche welle .
" we knew we needed to get sensible again . "
lane says that once the crisis passes , ireland should revert to the practices that made the early part of the celtic tiger years successful .
" the real celtic tiger was driven by an export boom .
we got diverted by a domestic construction bubble , " he said .
" we need to get back to international business . "

that may be good news for germany 's axel weber , who hopes to make president . european union finance ministers on tuesday unanimously recommended portugal 's vitor constancio to be the next vice president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , an eu statement said .
if confirmed by the european parliament next month , constancio will succeed greece 's lucas papdemos in may .
" it was a unanimous choice , " said italian economics minister giulio tremonti .
" he is a very qualified and technically experienced person , so i think that he was the right choice for europe . "
constancio , 66 , is a former socialist lawmaker and party leader .
he has governed portugal 's central bank since 2000 after an earlier appointment from 1985 to 1986 .
north-south balance european union tradition dictates that member states find a balance between northern and southern european leaders when filling high-level posts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are looking up for bundesbank president axel weber observers say the choice of a southern european for ecb vice president appears to leave the post of president open for northerner axel weber , current president of germany 's bundesbank , instead of italian rival mario draghi .
but while constancio 's nomination certainly does not hurt weber 's chances , the german 's appointment to the presidency is far from certain .
current ecb president jean-claude trichet , whose term expires in october 2011 , said the assumption that weber would succeed him was " short-sighted . "
" i would not automatically push for germany to get the post of ecb president , " trichet told german public radio station deutschlandfunk .

the eu offered its support , but no firm commitments on specific aid . at a european union meeting in brussels , finance ministers from germany , sweden and austria told greece it needs to do more to bring its runaway debt under control and calm worried financial markets .
joerg asmussen , germany 's deputy finance minister , advised greece to follow the lead of ireland and latvia , eu countries which are slashing spending in an effort to rein in their financial troubles .
" we made it clear the ball is in greece 's court , " asmussen said .
" additional measures by greece are needed . "
a statement issued by the ministers after the meeting said although greece has until march 16 to prove it has taken initial steps towards reducing its budgetary deficit by four percent , they will likely demand more budget cuts or tax hikes to prevent wider financial troubles .
the four percent reduction is the first step in a plan to eventually reduce the deficit from 12.7 percent of gdp to less than three percent in 2012 .
" the pressure on greece to consider further measures by march 16 has clearly increased , " said austrian finance minister josef proell .
the euro-zone ministers did not elaborate on earlier talk of specific monetary aid , instead reaffirming thursday 's pledge to support greece if things got out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet joined the finance ministers in brussels no firm commitments " germany , france and others - there -lsb- would -rsb- be a group of countries who can give this money to greece to stabilize the country and also the euro zone , " said proell in an interview with reuters television .
" but this debate is not yet on . "
greek finance minister george papaconstantinou told reporters after the meeting that the country is already ahead of its deficit reduction goals , adding that a one-off tax on large companies had resulted in a january surplus .
papaconstantinou , who warned on monday that his government would need more than a day to turn things around , said the pledge of support should act as a deterrent if financial markets increased the pressure on greece or other euro zone countries .
" today it is greece , tomorrow it could be another country , " he said .
greece 's mounting debts have tarnished the euro and increased bond yields , making debt servicing much more difficult .
the country has two sets of sovereign debt of more than eight billion euros each which it is to refinance in april and may .
extra interest required by investors for holding greek debt , compared to german bonds , increased to 3.35 percent on tuesday , its highest level in a week , before dropping back down to below 3.20. cmk / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move by tripoli was believed to have been caused by a spat with switzerland . the european commission , the eu 's executive body , has criticized libya 's decision to suspend issuing visas to citizens from the bloc 's schengen area as " unilateral and disproportionate . "

juncker said the additional plan should focus on expenditure cuts and revenue-increasing measures .
athens has pledged to reduce its deficit , which was 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2009 , by four percentage points in 2010 .
greece hopes to reduce this further by 2012 to 3 percent - and thus come within the official maximum limit for countries using the euro .
large demands greek finance minister george papaconstantinou defended his country 's efforts to slash the deficit by 2012 .
he also defended the use of " derivated contracts , " used in the past to borrow money without increasing official debt levels , saying they were legal at the time of their use .
critics have said the measures hid the full extent of the country 's financial situation from brussels .
papaconstantinou said that although greece is willing to undertake additional fiscal measures to tackle its debt , urging the country to do more before its report in march is asking for too much .
" we 're trying to change the course of the titanic , it can not be done in a day , " he told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders say they are ready to take action to ensure financial stability papaconstantinou also suggested ministers of euro-zone countries should work on putting substance behind the pledges of support they made last week .
eu leaders did not specify how much they would help , but said they are ready to take " determined and coordinated " action to ensure financial stability in the euro zone if necessary .
the details of the plans are being withheld from the public by greece 's euro-zone partners , as representatives agreed it would be " unwise " to reveal possible measures .
a draft declaration including greece 's obligation to report its situation in march and undertake additional measures if necessary is to be adopted by all 27 eu finance ministers on tuesday. mk / afp / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

little was known about the soviet camps until after the fall of the east german regime . sixty years ago on monday , the last inmates were reported to have been released from the last of a total of 10 internment camps that the russians had set up in what was then the soviet zone of occupation in germany .
their existence had become a thorn in the side of the founding fathers of communist east germany , who were left to deal with requests from the inmates ' family members to tell them what had happened to the prisoners .
documents that became available only after german unification in 1990 indicate that up to 176,000 inmates were held in the soviets ' " special camps . "
thirty-five percent of the detainees are thought to have died there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst zander , here with his wife renate , is unable to forget some of those who survived the camp at buchenwald , which is now a memorial site , met with historians there on saturday to talk about their personal experiences and the latest scientific findings about the soviet camps .
eyewitnesses still able to tell their story ernst zander was a youngster when he was captured by the soviets after the war .
after doing time at a prison at jamlitz , he was sent on to buchenwald .
the nazis had used the site as a concentration camp , where an estimated 50,000 people were executed , starved or worked to death .
after world war ii , the soviets used the same facility for one of their biggest internment camps . zander ended up there , because the russians accused him of being a " wehrwolf " - the standard term back then for a german who tried to fight soviet tanks and machinery as the red army advanced toward berlin in the final stages of the war .
he denies these allegations , saying that he was imprisoned for no crime at all .
he says the conditions he and other prisoners faced at the buchenwald camp were harsh .
" our family did not know we were being held in the camp .
we could not write to anyone .
we were so alone , " zander told deutsche welle .
the director of the buchenwald memorial site foundation , volkhard knigge , hastens to add that all the war-time allies had their own internment camps in germany , emphasizing that of course the soviets too had the right to have such camps after all the cruelty they 'd experienced at the hands of nazi germany .
but he points out that the soviet internment camps differed from those of the western allies .
" buchenwald in particular was a 100 percent stalinist camp between 1945 and its closure in 1950 , " knigge said .
" inmates had no right to complain to anyone .
there was no examination of the facts to establish personal guilt , no case-by-case investigations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a section of the sachsenhausen museum is devoted to soviet special camp no. 7 out of the fire - into the frying pan the last three camps - buchenwald , sachsenhausen and bautzen - were only closed as soviet internment centers in 1950 , several months after the founding of the communist german democratic republic .
some of the inmates were sent on to soviet gulags such as the one at workuta .
others were sentenced to long prison terms after show trials .
others were freed .
" many youngsters were able to start a normal life again , " said knigge .
" but what was difficult for them all was that they could n't openly speak about their experiences in the camps , as east german leaders kept sweeping the issue under the carpet . "
renate zander , the wife of former buchenwald inmate ernst zander , says that even now , the fate of the former detainees is not well known among the general german population .
" teachers here usually do n't want to talk about the events after 1945 , " she said .
" we have seven grandchildren , and they say that they only hear about the holocaust period when talking about the history of the camps at buchenwald and elsewhere .
nobody asks about the later events , because they 're not in the teachers ' minds . "
she also said that she sees little hope that this will be added to school curriculums anytime soon .

the eu has joined the row on the swiss side but some countries may jump ship if trade ties with tripoli are threatened . on sunday , libya took the decision to stop issuing visas to citizens of the eu schengen free-travel zone - of which non-eu member switzerland is a signatory - escalating the spat caused by switzerland 's travel ban handed out to one of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's sons . the libyan leader 's son hannibal and his spouse joined 186 other libyan figures barred from visiting switzerland after an incident in july 2008 when two hotel servants in geneva complained hannibal had mistreated them . after hannibal and his pregnant wife aline were arrested in geneva , libya cut oil supplies to switzerland and withdrew more than $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.6 billlion euros -rrb- dollars in assets from swiss banks . libya then prevented two swiss businessmen from leaving the country , and subsequently tried them on visa violations . the row flared up again in november last year when switzerland asked the 25 schengen signatories to restrict visas to libyan passport holders . following that request , libyan prime minister baghadadi al-mahmoudi and other senior officials were denied schengen visas , a refusal that libya 's deputy prime minister khalid kaim blamed on the swiss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the libyan leader took his cash out of switzerland last year last week , a tripoli appeals court reduced an earlier , 16-month prison sentence against max goldi , one of the two swiss businessmen held in libya on visa violations , after a court on february 7 acquitted fellow swiss citizen rachid al-hamdani on the same charges . swiss trauma but the row erupted again at the weekend with libya taking steps which not only punish swiss citizens but those from switzerland 's fellow schengen area signatories . isabelle werenfels , senior associate at the middle east and africa research division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that the whole affair , from the start in 2008 to this week 's developments , has been traumatizing for the swiss . " the libyans have made it very hard for the swiss to get out of libya and it has felt at times like they were hostages there , " she said .
" the airlines are still not allowed to fly out of libya .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 16.02.2010 uk mulls ' green bonds ' to spur infrastructure investment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed bonds are meant to help fund the renewable energy industry britain is reportedly examining the idea of launching green bonds to boost the renewable energy sector amid cash flow snags .
but will they have the desired effect of easing funding bottlenecks ? the economic secretary to the uk 's finance ministry , ian pearson , said in an interview published in the financial times newspaper on monday that the government was considering introducing so-called “ green bonds ” to the public to help fund the renewable energy industry .
pearson said that he had asked officials to examine a proposal that would see national savings and investments - a treasury-based unit - issue the bonds for sustainable infrastructure projects .
debt by any other name … dr. martin weale , director of the national institute of economic and social research -lrb- niesr -rrb- , an independent london-based think tank , told deutsche welle that such a move would basically amount to government borrowing , regardless of what name it ’ s given .
“ if it ’ s something that makes people happier about lending to the government – assuming the government is issuing them – or if it makes it possible for the government to borrow more cheaply than would otherwise be the case , then it seems to be it ’ s a good idea , ” dr. weale said .
“ fundamentally , what matters is actually paying for spending that ’ s done , whether it ’ s a green idea or anything else , and if you finance it by borrowing , it doesn ’ t matter too much what you call it , ” he said , adding that investors would need to look at the likely yields of such bonds .
proponents of the green bonds are describing them as a new way to finance infrastructure projects at a time when the government is struggling to balance its books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. weale says emotive captions persuaded people to invest in wartime bonds however , dr. weale points out that it won ’ t actually reduce the amount of government borrowing .
“ when we look at how much the government is borrowing and whether it can afford it , people will take green bonds into account just as much as anything else , ” he said .
he draws an analogy between last century ’ s wartime borrowing in britain and the current trends .
“ in many ways it ’ s rather similar to something we saw in the twentieth century : we had defense bonds and we had war loans .
and those were names given to government debt to make it easier or persuade people to buy it , ” he explained .
long-term contracts planned the finance ministry ’ s ian pearson was also quoted as saying the government was looking to offer long-term support to wind energy and green waste companies .
" we are thinking of going direct to companies looking to establish energy from waste and wind farm projects and offering them long-term contracts that would both get the public sector a good deal on price but also get the projects off the ground , " he told the financial times .
" if they had , say , a 15-year contract to supply the public sector , that should make it easier for them to raise finance to get the projects going , while tying in with the green agenda , " pearson added .
experts like dr. weale agree that there ’ s an argument for such long-term contracts .
“ we know that at current prices many so-called green schemes are highly uneconomic .
and since the government doesn ’ t want to do the obvious thing , which is to impose a proper charge for carbon emissions , what they are proposing seems to me the next best , ” he conceded .
kfw as a model ?
also under consideration is the idea of establishing a state-run infrastructure bank to help fund energy and other infrastructure projects in the country .
some analysts have pointed to the enormous amount of investments needed for energy infrastructure not only in britain but across europe .
however , there are doubts about how such projects can be financed at a time when credit flow remains a problem as the global economy slowly recovers from recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infrastructure bank on the lines of germany 's kfw bank has been mooted as a means of mobilizing capital for such purposes , some analysts in the uk have suggested setting up an infrastructure bank on the lines of germany ’ s state-owned development bank kfw .
competition for private banks some analysts say the proposal could set off alarm bells for private sector banks .
however , dr. weale from the niesr disagrees .
“ i think private sector banks aren ’ t terribly worried about competition .
they ’ re very short of capital .
they are not wanting to lend - as far as one can tell .
and if they ’ re not wanting to lend , they shouldn ’ t be upset that other people are doing the lending instead , ” he said .
dr. weale says that if the private sector banks were to raise more capital , perhaps they could compete for that sort of business as well .

the eu has joined the row on the swiss side but some countries may jump ship if trade ties with tripoli are threatened . on sunday , libya took the decision to stop issuing visas to citizens of the eu schengen free-travel zone - of which non-eu member switzerland is a signatory - escalating the spat caused by switzerland 's travel ban handed out to one of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's sons . the libyan leader 's son hannibal and his spouse joined 186 other libyan figures barred from visiting switzerland after an incident in july 2008 when two hotel servants in geneva complained hannibal had mistreated them . after hannibal and his pregnant wife aline were arrested in geneva , libya cut oil supplies to switzerland and withdrew more than $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.6 billlion euros -rrb- dollars in assets from swiss banks . libya then prevented two swiss businessmen from leaving the country , and subsequently tried them on visa violations . the row flared up again in november last year when switzerland asked the 25 schengen signatories to restrict visas to libyan passport holders . following that request , libyan prime minister baghadadi al-mahmoudi and other senior officials were denied schengen visas , a refusal that libya 's deputy prime minister khalid kaim blamed on the swiss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the libyan leader took his cash out of switzerland last year last week , a tripoli appeals court reduced an earlier , 16-month prison sentence against max goldi , one of the two swiss businessmen held in libya on visa violations , after a court on february 7 acquitted fellow swiss citizen rachid al-hamdani on the same charges . swiss trauma but the row erupted again at the weekend with libya taking steps which not only punish swiss citizens but those from switzerland 's fellow schengen area signatories . isabelle werenfels , senior associate at the middle east and africa research division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that the whole affair , from the start in 2008 to this week 's developments , has been traumatizing for the swiss .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de greece -pipe- 16.02.2010 the evolution of greece 's financial woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is greece doomed to repeat its financial history ?
greece 's financial woes started decades ago when the country was ruled by one socialist regime after another .
now experts warn that unless greece learns from its financial history , it is bound to repeat it . who would have imagined it ?
greece could soon be bankrupt and there are some speculations that athens will begin refusing payment on its obligations .
due to massive debt and doctored data , greece has lost the trust of both the european union and the financial markets .
and it 's not looking good for athens , despite an eu security net .
greece currently owes foreign banks more than $ 300 billion -lrb- 219.8 billion euros -rrb- , which equals 115 percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
their current debt amounts to more then 12.7 percent of their economic output .
but how did it get this far ?
spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "
repeating history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overspending led to greece 's current situation this is not new territory for greece .
back in the 1980 's and 1990 's the country faced similar financial difficulties .
back then the socialist governments solved the problem by devaluing the country 's former currency , the drachma .
that way they were able to shrink imports and raise exports .
but economic expert babi papadimitriou said this option became unavailable when greece entered into the euro zone . over the past few years the political elite and the greek government have not really grasped what it means to be a member of the euro zone , the economist said .
" it goes without saying that you have to reduce your deficit as much as possible when you share your currency with other countries , " he said .
" but those in power have ignored this principle .
and the necessary reforms were never imposed . "
the state acted irresponsibly as costs began to mount and the ability for the economy to compete on an international level was reduced .
when added to the global financial crisis that hit back in 2008 , these structural weak points became a full-blown nightmare .
cutting costs the country 's biggest problem is the state itself and the services it offers .
according to professor paraskewopoulos , the largest share of savings could come from cutting the costs incurred by public employees : reducing tax exceptions , putting a hiring freeze on state offices and reducing employee salaries .
along with this , he said the government needs to tackle two other major hurdles : tax evasion and corruption . each year the greek government loses 20 billion euros in unpaid taxes , and it is estimated that the average greek family pays out some 1,600 euros annually in bribes .
notoriously , things rarely work in the country without a little money to grease the wheels .
bildunterschrift : greek prime minister george papandreou has some very unenviable choices to make " those in power have always rewarded those loyal to them with cushy jobs and now we have a bloated government that costs an inconceivable amount of money .
that 's where you have to start , " explained paraskewopoulos .
" of course that 's easy to say , but to really do it , you have to be prepared to deal with the people affected . "
and that is exactly what papandreou 's government is facing at the moment .
the public sector has gone on strike and indignant farmers are blocking the motorways and border crossings .
however , both experts agree that unless they get rid of the subsidies and begin to privatize state agencies , cleaning up the financial mess will be impossible .

" -lsb- benedict -rsb- challenged the bishops to address the problems of the past with determination and resolve , and to face the present crisis with honesty and courage , " the statement added .

four irish bishops have already tendered their resignations as a consequence of the murphy commission 's revelations .
to date , the pope has accepted one of the resignations .
the vatican statement did not mention specific disciplinary measures to be taken against the remaining three clerics involved in the scandal .

a heterosexual couple in austria has vowed to go to the country 's highest court - to be granted a civil partnership introduced for gay couples .
they argue that current legislation is discriminatory . a heterosexual couple in austria is fighting for the right to enter into a registered civil partnership - introduced for homosexual couples in january 2010 .
under current law the couple will be denied that right - but they have vowed to take the case to the country 's constitutional court to overturn what they says is a discriminatory legislation .
austria introduced civil unions for gay couples on january 1 , affording them some of the rights enjoyed by their heterosexual counterparts .
the new legislation , passed after weeks of wrangling between the ruling social democrats and their conservative coalition partner in government , gives same-sex couples a status similar to traditional marriage but different in a number of respects .
for instance , there are less strict rules in the event of a divorce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the issue is equality - nothing but equality , ' the couple argues the heterosexual couple in question argues that this is a more modern form of union - which simply suits them better than a traditional marriage .
and if it 's offered to gay couples , why should n't it be an option for them as well ?
the issue at stake , they argue , is standing up against discrimination .
" everyone should have the same rights , and there should n't be different rules for different people , " the couple 's lawyer , helmut graupner , told deutsche welle .
" regardless of how many different forms of union a state provides to couples , all of those forms should be available for everyone and must not be restricted on the basis of race , class or sex or gender or other criteria , which are traditionally the very criteria for discrimination , " graupner said .
can you be ' a little bit equal ' ?
at the end of february , the couple plans to officially apply for a civil partnership - they expect this to be rejected , in which case they plan to take their case to the constitutional court .
their goal is to force the government to rework the legislation so that both traditional marriage and registered partnership will be open to any couple - gay or straight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay and lesbian activists say the different forms of union are discriminatory " the issue is equality - nothing but equality , " graupner said .
" you can not be ' a little bit equal . '
just like you ca n't be ' a little bit pregnant ' or ' a little bit dead . '
unless you 're entitled to the same kind of institutions and forms of law you 're not being treated equally and that 's discriminatory .
that 's what we are fighting against - we 're fighting for the rights of both heterosexuals and homosexuals . "
graupner is not only trying to help the heterosexual couple to get a ' gay ' marriage .
he 's also representing gay couples who want a traditional marriage - rather than the registered civil partnership that lawmakers have agreed on .
the current legislation provides same-sex couples with equal rights to heterosexuals with regards to pensions and alimony - but the law for instance continues to ban adoption .
it also does not allow civil partnership ceremonies at the civil registry office , where heterosexual couples can marry .
yet graupner is up against strong resistance .
the country 's conservative party - the austrian peoples party - only reluctantly agreed to the civil partnership in the first place .
the conservatives insists that significant differences between the two forms of union must remain .
the catholic church is not amused another powerful opponent to the law is the roman catholic church - after all , austria is predominantly catholic and the church is a force to be reckoned with .
the country 's clergy is opposed to the existing law , and certainly against any further liberalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the church ' different things need to be treated differently ' " the austrian bishops have made their position quite clear , " professor erich leitenberger , spokesman for the vienna diocese told deutsche welle .
" they strongly support the fact that the law does not put the civil partnership and a traditional marriage on an equal footing . "
" but the bishops have expressed concerns that the new law could be the beginning of a trend which eventually will lead to putting the civil partnership on the same footing as the traditional marriage between a man and a woman . "
leitenberger said that the legislation in place before january 1 was sufficient to safeguard the rights of gay and lesbian couples .
families , he argued , were shouldering the task of raising children and therefore could not be put on the same level with same-sex couples .
" the bishops stick to their position that a traditional marriage , a family raising children simply is something different from a homosexual couple - and therefore should also be treated differently . "
however , should the appeal to the constitutional court be successful , soon both of the two forms of union , could be open to any couple - a situation that would place austria at the forefront in terms of homosexual rights in europe .
the decision by the court is expected by the end of this year .

now , with debt mounting , an economic comeback in 2010 appears increasingly unlikely as the celtic tiger struggles to avoid the fate of greece . the economy of the republic of ireland , until the early 1990s , was rooted firmly in agriculture , largely relying on traditional , farm-based businesses .
but in 1994 , ireland began to experience economic growth that would transform one of europe 's poorest nations into one of its richest .
starting that year , ireland used its educated and under utilized english-speaking workforce , state policies that attracted large american corporations eager to make inroads into the european union market , tolerance towards low-skilled immigrant workers and generous corporate tax benefits to fuel expansive economic growth .
property prices soared as wages increased .
personal and public debt levels decreased dramatically .
the ' celtic tiger ' , as ireland came to be known , became a knowledge-based economy .
the 2007 global downturn ended ireland 's positive run , and the crisis of 2008 sent the country into an economic tailspin .
the government could no longer continue wage increases necessary for workers to pay high home prices , leading to widespread mortgage defaults .
ireland 's housing losses were devastating ; its real estate bubble had grown much faster than that in the rest of europe .
debt levels , at historical lows in 2006 , returned to unmanageable levels .
many of the gains made during the celtic tiger 's boom period have been lost in the last three years .
it could take decades to restore them . bildunterschrift : ireland 's construction sector collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis 2010 forecasts discouraging few economists believe ireland will recover this year .
an official forecast released by the irish government last month predicted an average unemployment rate of 13.2 percent in 2010 . the latest quarterly report from dublin-based economic and social research institute -lrb- esri -rrb- estimates an average jobless rate of 13.75 percent this year .
although much higher than european average , this is a significant downward revision from the institute 's spring 2009 forecast , which put unemployment at almost 17 percent by the end of 2010 .
like greece , spain and portugal , ireland 's biggest problem is debt .
tax revenue declines of 20 percent last year have left ireland operating 25 billion euros over budget this year .
meanwhile , homeowners still are forced to pay expensive mortgages on property which has lost significant value .
home prices fell nearly 20 percent last year , according to esri , and are down more than 30 percent since 2007 .
" it is just tragic when you look at the reversal in debt levels , " erik jones , a professor of european studies at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they worked so hard for so long just to be back where they were -lrb- when the economic revival began in the 1990s -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising debt levels have triggered protests in ireland the road forward the european union is not expected to allow ireland 's fiscal problems to become unmanageable .
the european commission last week made clear that while current action would be limited , greece would not be allowed to fail .
the same promise applies to ireland .
the irish government has helped itself by acting with more fiscal discipline than its greek counterpart .
dublin has made sizeable spending cuts in this year 's budget , and public workers , from low level bureaucrats to top public officials , are expected to earn less this year .
philip lane , a professor of international microeconomics at trinity college dublin attributed ireland 's ability to make difficult cuts to the nature of the irish crisis .
" ireland is feeling the pinch because of the burst of the real estate bubble , " he said .
" greece , meanwhile , has chronically overspent for years . "
" we made the cutbacks in ireland because we knew that wages were growing too quickly , that wages were too high , " lane told deutsche welle .
" we knew we needed to get sensible again . "
lane says that once the crisis passes , ireland should revert to the practices that made the early part of the celtic tiger years successful .
" the real celtic tiger was driven by an export boom .
we got diverted by a domestic construction bubble , " he said .
" we need to get back to international business . "

little was known about the soviet camps until after the fall of the east german regime . sixty years ago on monday , the last inmates were reported to have been released from the last of a total of 10 internment camps that the russians had set up in what was then the soviet zone of occupation in germany .
their existence had become a thorn in the side of the founding fathers of communist east germany , who were left to deal with requests from the inmates ' family members to tell them what had happened to the prisoners .
documents that became available only after german unification in 1990 indicate that up to 176,000 inmates were held in the soviets ' " special camps . "
thirty-five percent of the detainees are thought to have died there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst zander , here with his wife renate , is unable to forget some of those who survived the camp at buchenwald , which is now a memorial site , met with historians there on saturday to talk about their personal experiences and the latest scientific findings about the soviet camps .
eyewitnesses still able to tell their story ernst zander was a youngster when he was captured by the soviets after the war .
after doing time at a prison at jamlitz , he was sent on to buchenwald .
the nazis had used the site as a concentration camp , where an estimated 50,000 people were executed , starved or worked to death .
after world war ii , the soviets used the same facility for one of their biggest internment camps . zander ended up there , because the russians accused him of being a " wehrwolf " - the standard term back then for a german who tried to fight soviet tanks and machinery as the red army advanced toward berlin in the final stages of the war .
he denies these allegations , saying that he was imprisoned for no crime at all .
he says the conditions he and other prisoners faced at the buchenwald camp were harsh .
" our family did not know we were being held in the camp .
we could not write to anyone .
we were so alone , " zander told deutsche welle .
the director of the buchenwald memorial site foundation , volkhard knigge , hastens to add that all the war-time allies had their own internment camps in germany , emphasizing that of course the soviets too had the right to have such camps after all the cruelty they 'd experienced at the hands of nazi germany .
but he points out that the soviet internment camps differed from those of the western allies .
" buchenwald in particular was a 100 percent stalinist camp between 1945 and its closure in 1950 , " knigge said .
" inmates had no right to complain to anyone .
there was no examination of the facts to establish personal guilt , no case-by-case investigations . "

some of the inmates were sent on to soviet gulags such as the one at workuta .
others were sentenced to long prison terms after show trials .
others were freed .
" many youngsters were able to start a normal life again , " said knigge .
" but what was difficult for them all was that they could n't openly speak about their experiences in the camps , as east german leaders kept sweeping the issue under the carpet . "
renate zander , the wife of former buchenwald inmate ernst zander , says that even now , the fate of the former detainees is not well known among the general german population .
" teachers here usually do n't want to talk about the events after 1945 , " she said .
" we have seven grandchildren , and they say that they only hear about the holocaust period when talking about the history of the camps at buchenwald and elsewhere .
nobody asks about the later events , because they 're not in the teachers ' minds . "
she also said that she sees little hope that this will be added to school curriculums anytime soon .

little was known about the soviet camps until after the fall of the east german regime . sixty years ago on monday , the last inmates were reported to have been released from the last of a total of 10 internment camps that the russians had set up in what was then the soviet zone of occupation in germany .
their existence had become a thorn in the side of the founding fathers of communist east germany , who were left to deal with requests from the inmates ' family members to tell them what had happened to the prisoners .
documents that became available only after german unification in 1990 indicate that up to 176,000 inmates were held in the soviets ' " special camps . "
thirty-five percent of the detainees are thought to have died there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst zander , here with his wife renate , is unable to forget some of those who survived the camp at buchenwald , which is now a memorial site , met with historians there on saturday to talk about their personal experiences and the latest scientific findings about the soviet camps .
eyewitnesses still able to tell their story ernst zander was a youngster when he was captured by the soviets after the war .
after doing time at a prison at jamlitz , he was sent on to buchenwald .
the nazis had used the site as a concentration camp , where an estimated 50,000 people were executed , starved or worked to death .
after world war ii , the soviets used the same facility for one of their biggest internment camps . zander ended up there , because the russians accused him of being a " wehrwolf " - the standard term back then for a german who tried to fight soviet tanks and machinery as the red army advanced toward berlin in the final stages of the war .
he denies these allegations , saying that he was imprisoned for no crime at all .
he says the conditions he and other prisoners faced at the buchenwald camp were harsh .
" our family did not know we were being held in the camp .
we could not write to anyone .
we were so alone , " zander told deutsche welle .
the director of the buchenwald memorial site foundation , volkhard knigge , hastens to add that all the war-time allies had their own internment camps in germany , emphasizing that of course the soviets too had the right to have such camps after all the cruelty they 'd experienced at the hands of nazi germany .
but he points out that the soviet internment camps differed from those of the western allies .
" buchenwald in particular was a 100 percent stalinist camp between 1945 and its closure in 1950 , " knigge said .
" inmates had no right to complain to anyone .
there was no examination of the facts to establish personal guilt , no case-by-case investigations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a section of the sachsenhausen museum is devoted to soviet special camp no. 7 out of the fire - into the frying pan the last three camps - buchenwald , sachsenhausen and bautzen - were only closed as soviet internment centers in 1950 , several months after the founding of the communist german democratic republic .
some of the inmates were sent on to soviet gulags such as the one at workuta .
others were sentenced to long prison terms after show trials .
others were freed .
" many youngsters were able to start a normal life again , " said knigge .
" but what was difficult for them all was that they could n't openly speak about their experiences in the camps , as east german leaders kept sweeping the issue under the carpet . "
renate zander , the wife of former buchenwald inmate ernst zander , says that even now , the fate of the former detainees is not well known among the general german population .
" teachers here usually do n't want to talk about the events after 1945 , " she said .
" we have seven grandchildren , and they say that they only hear about the holocaust period when talking about the history of the camps at buchenwald and elsewhere .
nobody asks about the later events , because they 're not in the teachers ' minds . "
she also said that she sees little hope that this will be added to school curriculums anytime soon .

now , with debt mounting , an economic comeback in 2010 appears increasingly unlikely as the celtic tiger struggles to avoid the fate of greece . the economy of the republic of ireland , until the early 1990s , was rooted firmly in agriculture , largely relying on traditional , farm-based businesses .
but in 1994 , ireland began to experience economic growth that would transform one of europe 's poorest nations into one of its richest .
starting that year , ireland used its educated and under utilized english-speaking workforce , state policies that attracted large american corporations eager to make inroads into the european union market , tolerance towards low-skilled immigrant workers and generous corporate tax benefits to fuel expansive economic growth .
property prices soared as wages increased .
personal and public debt levels decreased dramatically .
the ' celtic tiger ' , as ireland came to be known , became a knowledge-based economy .
the 2007 global downturn ended ireland 's positive run , and the crisis of 2008 sent the country into an economic tailspin .
the government could no longer continue wage increases necessary for workers to pay high home prices , leading to widespread mortgage defaults .
ireland 's housing losses were devastating ; its real estate bubble had grown much faster than that in the rest of europe .
debt levels , at historical lows in 2006 , returned to unmanageable levels .
many of the gains made during the celtic tiger 's boom period have been lost in the last three years .
it could take decades to restore them . bildunterschrift : ireland 's construction sector collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis 2010 forecasts discouraging few economists believe ireland will recover this year .
an official forecast released by the irish government last month predicted an average unemployment rate of 13.2 percent in 2010 . the latest quarterly report from dublin-based economic and social research institute -lrb- esri -rrb- estimates an average jobless rate of 13.75 percent this year .
although much higher than european average , this is a significant downward revision from the institute 's spring 2009 forecast , which put unemployment at almost 17 percent by the end of 2010 .
like greece , spain and portugal , ireland 's biggest problem is debt .
tax revenue declines of 20 percent last year have left ireland operating 25 billion euros over budget this year .
meanwhile , homeowners still are forced to pay expensive mortgages on property which has lost significant value .
home prices fell nearly 20 percent last year , according to esri , and are down more than 30 percent since 2007 .
" it is just tragic when you look at the reversal in debt levels , " erik jones , a professor of european studies at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they worked so hard for so long just to be back where they were -lrb- when the economic revival began in the 1990s -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising debt levels have triggered protests in ireland the road forward the european union is not expected to allow ireland 's fiscal problems to become unmanageable .
the european commission last week made clear that while current action would be limited , greece would not be allowed to fail .
the same promise applies to ireland .
the irish government has helped itself by acting with more fiscal discipline than its greek counterpart .
dublin has made sizeable spending cuts in this year 's budget , and public workers , from low level bureaucrats to top public officials , are expected to earn less this year .
philip lane , a professor of international microeconomics at trinity college dublin attributed ireland 's ability to make difficult cuts to the nature of the irish crisis .
" ireland is feeling the pinch because of the burst of the real estate bubble , " he said .
" greece , meanwhile , has chronically overspent for years . "
" we made the cutbacks in ireland because we knew that wages were growing too quickly , that wages were too high , " lane told deutsche welle .
" we knew we needed to get sensible again . "
lane says that once the crisis passes , ireland should revert to the practices that made the early part of the celtic tiger years successful .
" the real celtic tiger was driven by an export boom .
we got diverted by a domestic construction bubble , " he said .
" we need to get back to international business . "

like greece , spain and portugal , ireland 's biggest problem is debt .
tax revenue declines of 20 percent last year have left ireland operating 25 billion euros over budget this year .
meanwhile , homeowners still are forced to pay expensive mortgages on property which has lost significant value .
home prices fell nearly 20 percent last year , according to esri , and are down more than 30 percent since 2007 .
" it is just tragic when you look at the reversal in debt levels , " erik jones , a professor of european studies at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they worked so hard for so long just to be back where they were -lrb- when the economic revival began in the 1990s -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising debt levels have triggered protests in ireland the road forward the european union is not expected to allow ireland 's fiscal problems to become unmanageable .
the european commission last week made clear that while current action would be limited , greece would not be allowed to fail .
the same promise applies to ireland .
the irish government has helped itself by acting with more fiscal discipline than its greek counterpart .
dublin has made sizeable spending cuts in this year 's budget , and public workers , from low level bureaucrats to top public officials , are expected to earn less this year .
philip lane , a professor of international microeconomics at trinity college dublin attributed ireland 's ability to make difficult cuts to the nature of the irish crisis .
" ireland is feeling the pinch because of the burst of the real estate bubble , " he said .
" greece , meanwhile , has chronically overspent for years . "
" we made the cutbacks in ireland because we knew that wages were growing too quickly , that wages were too high , " lane told deutsche welle .
" we knew we needed to get sensible again . "
lane says that once the crisis passes , ireland should revert to the practices that made the early part of the celtic tiger years successful .
" the real celtic tiger was driven by an export boom .
we got diverted by a domestic construction bubble , " he said .
" we need to get back to international business . "

now , with debt mounting , an economic comeback in 2010 appears increasingly unlikely as the celtic tiger struggles to avoid the fate of greece . the economy of the republic of ireland , until the early 1990s , was rooted firmly in agriculture , largely relying on traditional , farm-based businesses .
but in 1994 , ireland began to experience economic growth that would transform one of europe 's poorest nations into one of its richest .
starting that year , ireland used its educated and under utilized english-speaking workforce , state policies that attracted large american corporations eager to make inroads into the european union market , tolerance towards low-skilled immigrant workers and generous corporate tax benefits to fuel expansive economic growth .

but will they have the desired effect of easing funding bottlenecks ? the economic secretary to the uk 's finance ministry , ian pearson , said in an interview published in the financial times newspaper on monday that the government was considering introducing so-called “ green bonds ” to the public to help fund the renewable energy industry .
pearson said that he had asked officials to examine a proposal that would see national savings and investments - a treasury-based unit - issue the bonds for sustainable infrastructure projects .
debt by any other name … dr. martin weale , director of the national institute of economic and social research -lrb- niesr -rrb- , an independent london-based think tank , told deutsche welle that such a move would basically amount to government borrowing , regardless of what name it ’ s given .
“ if it ’ s something that makes people happier about lending to the government – assuming the government is issuing them – or if it makes it possible for the government to borrow more cheaply than would otherwise be the case , then it seems to be it ’ s a good idea , ” dr. weale said .
“ fundamentally , what matters is actually paying for spending that ’ s done , whether it ’ s a green idea or anything else , and if you finance it by borrowing , it doesn ’ t matter too much what you call it , ” he said , adding that investors would need to look at the likely yields of such bonds .
proponents of the green bonds are describing them as a new way to finance infrastructure projects at a time when the government is struggling to balance its books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. weale says emotive captions persuaded people to invest in wartime bonds however , dr. weale points out that it won ’ t actually reduce the amount of government borrowing .
“ when we look at how much the government is borrowing and whether it can afford it , people will take green bonds into account just as much as anything else , ” he said .
he draws an analogy between last century ’ s wartime borrowing in britain and the current trends .
“ in many ways it ’ s rather similar to something we saw in the twentieth century : we had defense bonds and we had war loans .
and those were names given to government debt to make it easier or persuade people to buy it , ” he explained .
long-term contracts planned the finance ministry ’ s ian pearson was also quoted as saying the government was looking to offer long-term support to wind energy and green waste companies .
" we are thinking of going direct to companies looking to establish energy from waste and wind farm projects and offering them long-term contracts that would both get the public sector a good deal on price but also get the projects off the ground , " he told the financial times .
" if they had , say , a 15-year contract to supply the public sector , that should make it easier for them to raise finance to get the projects going , while tying in with the green agenda , " pearson added .
experts like dr. weale agree that there ’ s an argument for such long-term contracts .
“ we know that at current prices many so-called green schemes are highly uneconomic .
and since the government doesn ’ t want to do the obvious thing , which is to impose a proper charge for carbon emissions , what they are proposing seems to me the next best , ” he conceded .

also under consideration is the idea of establishing a state-run infrastructure bank to help fund energy and other infrastructure projects in the country .
some analysts have pointed to the enormous amount of investments needed for energy infrastructure not only in britain but across europe .
however , there are doubts about how such projects can be financed at a time when credit flow remains a problem as the global economy slowly recovers from recession .

competition for private banks some analysts say the proposal could set off alarm bells for private sector banks .
however , dr. weale from the niesr disagrees .
“ i think private sector banks aren ’ t terribly worried about competition .
they ’ re very short of capital .
they are not wanting to lend - as far as one can tell .
and if they ’ re not wanting to lend , they shouldn ’ t be upset that other people are doing the lending instead , ” he said .
dr. weale says that if the private sector banks were to raise more capital , perhaps they could compete for that sort of business as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 16.02.2010 uk mulls ' green bonds ' to spur infrastructure investment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed bonds are meant to help fund the renewable energy industry britain is reportedly examining the idea of launching green bonds to boost the renewable energy sector amid cash flow snags .
but will they have the desired effect of easing funding bottlenecks ? the economic secretary to the uk 's finance ministry , ian pearson , said in an interview published in the financial times newspaper on monday that the government was considering introducing so-called “ green bonds ” to the public to help fund the renewable energy industry .
pearson said that he had asked officials to examine a proposal that would see national savings and investments - a treasury-based unit - issue the bonds for sustainable infrastructure projects .
debt by any other name … dr. martin weale , director of the national institute of economic and social research -lrb- niesr -rrb- , an independent london-based think tank , told deutsche welle that such a move would basically amount to government borrowing , regardless of what name it ’ s given .
“ if it ’ s something that makes people happier about lending to the government – assuming the government is issuing them – or if it makes it possible for the government to borrow more cheaply than would otherwise be the case , then it seems to be it ’ s a good idea , ” dr. weale said .
“ fundamentally , what matters is actually paying for spending that ’ s done , whether it ’ s a green idea or anything else , and if you finance it by borrowing , it doesn ’ t matter too much what you call it , ” he said , adding that investors would need to look at the likely yields of such bonds .
proponents of the green bonds are describing them as a new way to finance infrastructure projects at a time when the government is struggling to balance its books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. weale says emotive captions persuaded people to invest in wartime bonds however , dr. weale points out that it won ’ t actually reduce the amount of government borrowing .
“ when we look at how much the government is borrowing and whether it can afford it , people will take green bonds into account just as much as anything else , ” he said .
he draws an analogy between last century ’ s wartime borrowing in britain and the current trends .
“ in many ways it ’ s rather similar to something we saw in the twentieth century : we had defense bonds and we had war loans .
and those were names given to government debt to make it easier or persuade people to buy it , ” he explained .
long-term contracts planned the finance ministry ’ s ian pearson was also quoted as saying the government was looking to offer long-term support to wind energy and green waste companies .
" we are thinking of going direct to companies looking to establish energy from waste and wind farm projects and offering them long-term contracts that would both get the public sector a good deal on price but also get the projects off the ground , " he told the financial times .
" if they had , say , a 15-year contract to supply the public sector , that should make it easier for them to raise finance to get the projects going , while tying in with the green agenda , " pearson added .
experts like dr. weale agree that there ’ s an argument for such long-term contracts .
“ we know that at current prices many so-called green schemes are highly uneconomic .
and since the government doesn ’ t want to do the obvious thing , which is to impose a proper charge for carbon emissions , what they are proposing seems to me the next best , ” he conceded .
kfw as a model ?
also under consideration is the idea of establishing a state-run infrastructure bank to help fund energy and other infrastructure projects in the country .
some analysts have pointed to the enormous amount of investments needed for energy infrastructure not only in britain but across europe .
however , there are doubts about how such projects can be financed at a time when credit flow remains a problem as the global economy slowly recovers from recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infrastructure bank on the lines of germany 's kfw bank has been mooted as a means of mobilizing capital for such purposes , some analysts in the uk have suggested setting up an infrastructure bank on the lines of germany ’ s state-owned development bank kfw .
competition for private banks some analysts say the proposal could set off alarm bells for private sector banks .
however , dr. weale from the niesr disagrees .
“ i think private sector banks aren ’ t terribly worried about competition .
they ’ re very short of capital .
they are not wanting to lend - as far as one can tell .
and if they ’ re not wanting to lend , they shouldn ’ t be upset that other people are doing the lending instead , ” he said .
dr. weale says that if the private sector banks were to raise more capital , perhaps they could compete for that sort of business as well .

the move by tripoli was believed to have been caused by a spat with switzerland . the european commission , the eu 's executive body , has criticized libya 's decision to suspend issuing visas to citizens from the bloc 's schengen area as " unilateral and disproportionate . "
" the commission also regrets that travelers who legally obtained visas before the suspension measure were refused entry when arriving in libya , " said eu commissioner for home affairs cecilia malmstrom .
she added that eu and schengen countries would discuss the matter this week to " consider the appropriate reaction . "
a spokesman for the german foreign ministry said the decision by libya was " regrettable , " adding that the government expected the suspension to be cancelled .
tense ties the move by tripoli appears to be in response to an announcement by swiss authorities on sunday that 188 libyans , including leader moammar gadhafi and his family , are banned from visiting switzerland .
while switzerland is not a member of the eu , it is one of the 25 european countries in the border-free schengen area .
citizens of great britain , ireland , cyprus , bulgaria and romania , which are eu members but not in the schengen zone , were exempt from the decision .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gaddafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .
that event led to libya halting oil exports to switzerland and withdrawing some $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- in assets from swiss banks .
the quarrel threatens to complicate business ties between libya and the eu .

the move by tripoli was believed to have been caused by a spat with switzerland . the european commission , the eu 's executive body , has criticized libya 's decision to suspend issuing visas to citizens from the bloc 's schengen area as " unilateral and disproportionate . "
" the commission also regrets that travelers who legally obtained visas before the suspension measure were refused entry when arriving in libya , " said eu commissioner for home affairs cecilia malmstrom .

a spokesman for the german foreign ministry said the decision by libya was " regrettable , " adding that the government expected the suspension to be cancelled .

citizens of great britain , ireland , cyprus , bulgaria and romania , which are eu members but not in the schengen zone , were exempt from the decision .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gaddafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .

the eu has joined the row on the swiss side but some countries may jump ship if trade ties with tripoli are threatened . on sunday , libya took the decision to stop issuing visas to citizens of the eu schengen free-travel zone - of which non-eu member switzerland is a signatory - escalating the spat caused by switzerland 's travel ban handed out to one of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's sons . the libyan leader 's son hannibal and his spouse joined 186 other libyan figures barred from visiting switzerland after an incident in july 2008 when two hotel servants in geneva complained hannibal had mistreated them . after hannibal and his pregnant wife aline were arrested in geneva , libya cut oil supplies to switzerland and withdrew more than $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.6 billlion euros -rrb- dollars in assets from swiss banks . libya then prevented two swiss businessmen from leaving the country , and subsequently tried them on visa violations . the row flared up again in november last year when switzerland asked the 25 schengen signatories to restrict visas to libyan passport holders . following that request , libyan prime minister baghadadi al-mahmoudi and other senior officials were denied schengen visas , a refusal that libya 's deputy prime minister khalid kaim blamed on the swiss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the libyan leader took his cash out of switzerland last year last week , a tripoli appeals court reduced an earlier , 16-month prison sentence against max goldi , one of the two swiss businessmen held in libya on visa violations , after a court on february 7 acquitted fellow swiss citizen rachid al-hamdani on the same charges . swiss trauma but the row erupted again at the weekend with libya taking steps which not only punish swiss citizens but those from switzerland 's fellow schengen area signatories . isabelle werenfels , senior associate at the middle east and africa research division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that the whole affair , from the start in 2008 to this week 's developments , has been traumatizing for the swiss . " the libyans have made it very hard for the swiss to get out of libya and it has felt at times like they were hostages there , " she said .
" the airlines are still not allowed to fly out of libya .
many people say that the libya situation is actually at the heart of the swiss attitude towards minarets and muslims .
it has been a very difficult time for switzerland . " while the libyan government has not publicly confirmed the reports , or given a public reason for the decision to ban entry to schengen area citizens , the country 's private daily newspaper oea , which is close to gadhafi 's family , carried the story , quoting a " high-ranking " unidentified official who mentioned both the arrest of hannibal gadhafi and the swiss ban on 188 libyan citizens . schengen countries suffer as libya punishes swiss the italian foreign ministry confirmed the ban on its web site soon after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss banned 188 libyans from crossing its borders " libyan authorities have confirmed the suspension of all types of visas for citizens of schengen states .
in addition , they have specified that citizens from schengen states will be denied entry into libya even if they are in possession of a visa , of whatever duration or type , " a statement on its web site read . the passport-free schengen zone comprises 25 nations , including switzerland , iceland , norway and most european union members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania . werenfels said that predicting the effects of the visa ban would be difficult as libya seemed to be employing an arbitrary ban at the moment .
" libya seems to be targeting high-level business people from europe but we 'll see how long that lasts , " she said .
" this would be damaging for libya too .
it remains to be seen if they ban anyone who works for the petrochemical industry , which is very important to libya .
chances are , in two or three days , gadhafi may find a way out of this while saving face . " strong words from eu but little chance of strong action meanwhile , the european commission declared the libyan decision as being " unilateral and disproportionate . " " the commission also regrets that travellers who legally obtained visas before the suspension measure were refused entry when arriving in libya " , said eu commissioner for home affairs , cecilia malmstrom . she added that the commission is set to discuss the issue " before the end of the week " with schengen countries , with a view to " consider the appropriate reaction . " experts believe that the eu 's show of unity towards switzerland will evaporate when important trade and business relations are put at risk by any further escalation on an eu-wide scale . " it is very important for the eu to speak with one voice .
the eu should use the tools that it has , " sawsan chebli , an associate fellow with the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the eu is libya ’ s greatest trade and export partner .
this is a leverage the eu could use .
however , italy and other eu member states with close relations with libya in the past have shown that they are not interested to spoil their relations with libya whatever gadhafi ’ s action may be .
that is not likely to change .
and the problem is that gadhafi knows that he is able to divide the eu . " italians urge swiss to resolve crisis and leave eu out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini told switzerland to leave europe out its row with libya chebli 's opinion was reinforced by a statement from italy which criticized switzerland and urged the swiss to sort out their differences with the north african country and its leadership . switzerland must " resolve this bi-lateral issue ... but not at the expense of everyone else , " italian foreign minister franco frattini said in a television interview , adding that he had stressed to bern the " sensitivity " of the situation . sawsan chebli believes that italy 's attitude highlights a disregard for european solidarity when business ties - which are strong between italy and libya - are concerned . " the italians care very little about the eu or other states when it comes to business relations , " she said . " solidarity is an unknown word in this regard .
frattini was very clear .
he accused switzerland of misusing the schengen agreement to exert pressure on gadhafi and said that bern would take its members ' hostage ' .

the eu has joined the row on the swiss side but some countries may jump ship if trade ties with tripoli are threatened . on sunday , libya took the decision to stop issuing visas to citizens of the eu schengen free-travel zone - of which non-eu member switzerland is a signatory - escalating the spat caused by switzerland 's travel ban handed out to one of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's sons . the libyan leader 's son hannibal and his spouse joined 186 other libyan figures barred from visiting switzerland after an incident in july 2008 when two hotel servants in geneva complained hannibal had mistreated them . after hannibal and his pregnant wife aline were arrested in geneva , libya cut oil supplies to switzerland and withdrew more than $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.6 billlion euros -rrb- dollars in assets from swiss banks . libya then prevented two swiss businessmen from leaving the country , and subsequently tried them on visa violations . the row flared up again in november last year when switzerland asked the 25 schengen signatories to restrict visas to libyan passport holders . following that request , libyan prime minister baghadadi al-mahmoudi and other senior officials were denied schengen visas , a refusal that libya 's deputy prime minister khalid kaim blamed on the swiss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the libyan leader took his cash out of switzerland last year last week , a tripoli appeals court reduced an earlier , 16-month prison sentence against max goldi , one of the two swiss businessmen held in libya on visa violations , after a court on february 7 acquitted fellow swiss citizen rachid al-hamdani on the same charges . swiss trauma but the row erupted again at the weekend with libya taking steps which not only punish swiss citizens but those from switzerland 's fellow schengen area signatories . isabelle werenfels , senior associate at the middle east and africa research division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that the whole affair , from the start in 2008 to this week 's developments , has been traumatizing for the swiss . " the libyans have made it very hard for the swiss to get out of libya and it has felt at times like they were hostages there , " she said .
" the airlines are still not allowed to fly out of libya .
many people say that the libya situation is actually at the heart of the swiss attitude towards minarets and muslims .
it has been a very difficult time for switzerland . " while the libyan government has not publicly confirmed the reports , or given a public reason for the decision to ban entry to schengen area citizens , the country 's private daily newspaper oea , which is close to gadhafi 's family , carried the story , quoting a " high-ranking " unidentified official who mentioned both the arrest of hannibal gadhafi and the swiss ban on 188 libyan citizens . schengen countries suffer as libya punishes swiss the italian foreign ministry confirmed the ban on its web site soon after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss banned 188 libyans from crossing its borders " libyan authorities have confirmed the suspension of all types of visas for citizens of schengen states .
in addition , they have specified that citizens from schengen states will be denied entry into libya even if they are in possession of a visa , of whatever duration or type , " a statement on its web site read . the passport-free schengen zone comprises 25 nations , including switzerland , iceland , norway and most european union members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania . werenfels said that predicting the effects of the visa ban would be difficult as libya seemed to be employing an arbitrary ban at the moment .
" libya seems to be targeting high-level business people from europe but we 'll see how long that lasts , " she said .
" this would be damaging for libya too .
it remains to be seen if they ban anyone who works for the petrochemical industry , which is very important to libya .
chances are , in two or three days , gadhafi may find a way out of this while saving face . " strong words from eu but little chance of strong action meanwhile , the european commission declared the libyan decision as being " unilateral and disproportionate . " " the commission also regrets that travellers who legally obtained visas before the suspension measure were refused entry when arriving in libya " , said eu commissioner for home affairs , cecilia malmstrom . she added that the commission is set to discuss the issue " before the end of the week " with schengen countries , with a view to " consider the appropriate reaction . " experts believe that the eu 's show of unity towards switzerland will evaporate when important trade and business relations are put at risk by any further escalation on an eu-wide scale . " it is very important for the eu to speak with one voice .
the eu should use the tools that it has , " sawsan chebli , an associate fellow with the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the eu is libya ’ s greatest trade and export partner .
this is a leverage the eu could use .
however , italy and other eu member states with close relations with libya in the past have shown that they are not interested to spoil their relations with libya whatever gadhafi ’ s action may be .
that is not likely to change .
and the problem is that gadhafi knows that he is able to divide the eu . " italians urge swiss to resolve crisis and leave eu out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini told switzerland to leave europe out its row with libya chebli 's opinion was reinforced by a statement from italy which criticized switzerland and urged the swiss to sort out their differences with the north african country and its leadership . switzerland must " resolve this bi-lateral issue ... but not at the expense of everyone else , " italian foreign minister franco frattini said in a television interview , adding that he had stressed to bern the " sensitivity " of the situation . sawsan chebli believes that italy 's attitude highlights a disregard for european solidarity when business ties - which are strong between italy and libya - are concerned . " the italians care very little about the eu or other states when it comes to business relations , " she said . " solidarity is an unknown word in this regard .
frattini was very clear .
he accused switzerland of misusing the schengen agreement to exert pressure on gadhafi and said that bern would take its members ' hostage ' .

from here it is 2,840km to the sea .
green groups have welcomed a program to clean up and protect europe 's second-largest and much-hymned river , the danube .
but activists have also urged more action to preserve what they see as a " backbone of biodiversity . " environmentalists have warned that pressure to build new hydroelectric plants and to make the river more navigable for shipping continue to threaten the danube , which runs a staggering 2,860 kilometers from germany 's black forest to the black sea in romania .
additional water regulation measures threaten the dynamism of the river - one of the danube 's most-prized qualities , according to georg kestel , danube expert of the german arm of friends of the earth , bund .
bildunterschrift : this is close to where the danube ends - by lake razim in romania " what makes this river really special is that it crosses through such a great variety of landscapes in its journey from west to east .
it is a very important migratory route for numerous types of animals and plants .
the river is the backbone of biodiversity , " kestel told deutsche welle .
most international river bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : repeated flooding of the river has led to moves to restore flood plains environment ministers from 14 countries that either border the danube or belong to the river 's catchment area this week agreed to adopt a five-year plan to " improve the environmental condition of the danube and its tributaries " .
" the danube waters are shared by us all and therefore we also share the responsibility , " said mitja bricelj , president of the international commission for the protection of the danube river -lrb- icpdr -rrb- who hosted the meeting on tuesday -lrb- february 16 -rrb- in vienna .
" we meet to ensure that the resources of the danube basin are managed in an environmentally sustainable manner , " bricelj added . the plan includes a series of measures to be implemented by 2015 , including concrete efforts to reduce pollution and minimize the negative effects of man-made changes to the world 's most international river .
the re-naturalization of wetlands , the creation of natural flood barriers and the upgrading of dykes are also part of the program . more sustainable shipping bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist as well as freight ships frequent the danube environmental groups , such as bund and the world wildlife fund , generally welcomed the plan , but they also took the opportunity to present a petition with 100,000 signatures calling for greener and more sustainable shipping projects . in particular , green groups are campaigning against river regulation work in the upper danube between straubing and vilshofen in germany .
the planned construction of a dam and a canal would destroy the last significant free-flowing section of the river in germany .
" overall , we welcome it , but we do see some critical points , " said irene lucius , senioor policy coordinator of the wwf 's danube-carpathian program told afp news agency .
giving nature a helping hand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danube has a great symbolic significance in some countries bund expert georg kestel praised the moves to restore natural water meadows and to improve the continuity of the river by building fish ladders , for example , to allow their passage through dams and other man-made obstacles . kestel also backed the ministers ' call for the introduction of phosphate-free detergents - a problem in eastern europe .
however , he urged an eu-wide ban to make this effective .
although 10 member countries directly border the danube and there several more in its catchment area , international cooperation appears to be working well .
shared waters , different problems bildunterschrift : the danube delta in romania is a paradise for birds however , the river faces different problems in different places .
whereas in eastern europe the pollution of the river mainly stems from excessive levels of inadequately treated municipal sewage .
in the west , agriculture is the main culprit .
and whereas many free-flowing sections and water meadows have been lost in western europe , many remain intact further to the east .
for kestel , it is essential that the danube 's dynamic character is retained .
" the danube is classes better than the rhine .
shipping is very dominant there .
the problem is that there are number of projects hanging over the danube that would ruin its quality . "

the eu offered its support , but no firm commitments on specific aid . at a european union meeting in brussels , finance ministers from germany , sweden and austria told greece it needs to do more to bring its runaway debt under control and calm worried financial markets .
joerg asmussen , germany 's deputy finance minister , advised greece to follow the lead of ireland and latvia , eu countries which are slashing spending in an effort to rein in their financial troubles .
" we made it clear the ball is in greece 's court , " asmussen said .
" additional measures by greece are needed . "
a statement issued by the ministers after the meeting said although greece has until march 16 to prove it has taken initial steps towards reducing its budgetary deficit by four percent , they will likely demand more budget cuts or tax hikes to prevent wider financial troubles .
the four percent reduction is the first step in a plan to eventually reduce the deficit from 12.7 percent of gdp to less than three percent in 2012 .
" the pressure on greece to consider further measures by march 16 has clearly increased , " said austrian finance minister josef proell .
the euro-zone ministers did not elaborate on earlier talk of specific monetary aid , instead reaffirming thursday 's pledge to support greece if things got out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet joined the finance ministers in brussels no firm commitments " germany , france and others - there -lsb- would -rsb- be a group of countries who can give this money to greece to stabilize the country and also the euro zone , " said proell in an interview with reuters television .
" but this debate is not yet on . "
greek finance minister george papaconstantinou told reporters after the meeting that the country is already ahead of its deficit reduction goals , adding that a one-off tax on large companies had resulted in a january surplus .
papaconstantinou , who warned on monday that his government would need more than a day to turn things around , said the pledge of support should act as a deterrent if financial markets increased the pressure on greece or other euro zone countries .
" today it is greece , tomorrow it could be another country , " he said .
greece 's mounting debts have tarnished the euro and increased bond yields , making debt servicing much more difficult .
the country has two sets of sovereign debt of more than eight billion euros each which it is to refinance in april and may .
extra interest required by investors for holding greek debt , compared to german bonds , increased to 3.35 percent on tuesday , its highest level in a week , before dropping back down to below 3.20. cmk / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu offered its support , but no firm commitments on specific aid . at a european union meeting in brussels , finance ministers from germany , sweden and austria told greece it needs to do more to bring its runaway debt under control and calm worried financial markets .
joerg asmussen , germany 's deputy finance minister , advised greece to follow the lead of ireland and latvia , eu countries which are slashing spending in an effort to rein in their financial troubles .
" we made it clear the ball is in greece 's court , " asmussen said .
" additional measures by greece are needed . "
a statement issued by the ministers after the meeting said although greece has until march 16 to prove it has taken initial steps towards reducing its budgetary deficit by four percent , they will likely demand more budget cuts or tax hikes to prevent wider financial troubles .
the four percent reduction is the first step in a plan to eventually reduce the deficit from 12.7 percent of gdp to less than three percent in 2012 .
" the pressure on greece to consider further measures by march 16 has clearly increased , " said austrian finance minister josef proell .

the eu offered its support , but no firm commitments on specific aid . at a european union meeting in brussels , finance ministers from germany , sweden and austria told greece it needs to do more to bring its runaway debt under control and calm worried financial markets .
joerg asmussen , germany 's deputy finance minister , advised greece to follow the lead of ireland and latvia , eu countries which are slashing spending in an effort to rein in their financial troubles .
" we made it clear the ball is in greece 's court , " asmussen said .
" additional measures by greece are needed . "
a statement issued by the ministers after the meeting said although greece has until march 16 to prove it has taken initial steps towards reducing its budgetary deficit by four percent , they will likely demand more budget cuts or tax hikes to prevent wider financial troubles .
the four percent reduction is the first step in a plan to eventually reduce the deficit from 12.7 percent of gdp to less than three percent in 2012 .
" the pressure on greece to consider further measures by march 16 has clearly increased , " said austrian finance minister josef proell .
the euro-zone ministers did not elaborate on earlier talk of specific monetary aid , instead reaffirming thursday 's pledge to support greece if things got out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet joined the finance ministers in brussels no firm commitments " germany , france and others - there -lsb- would -rsb- be a group of countries who can give this money to greece to stabilize the country and also the euro zone , " said proell in an interview with reuters television .
" but this debate is not yet on . "
greek finance minister george papaconstantinou told reporters after the meeting that the country is already ahead of its deficit reduction goals , adding that a one-off tax on large companies had resulted in a january surplus .
papaconstantinou , who warned on monday that his government would need more than a day to turn things around , said the pledge of support should act as a deterrent if financial markets increased the pressure on greece or other euro zone countries .
" today it is greece , tomorrow it could be another country , " he said .
greece 's mounting debts have tarnished the euro and increased bond yields , making debt servicing much more difficult .
the country has two sets of sovereign debt of more than eight billion euros each which it is to refinance in april and may .
extra interest required by investors for holding greek debt , compared to german bonds , increased to 3.35 percent on tuesday , its highest level in a week , before dropping back down to below 3.20. cmk / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greece 's financial woes started decades ago when the country was ruled by one socialist regime after another .
now experts warn that unless greece learns from its financial history , it is bound to repeat it . who would have imagined it ?
greece could soon be bankrupt and there are some speculations that athens will begin refusing payment on its obligations .
due to massive debt and doctored data , greece has lost the trust of both the european union and the financial markets .
and it 's not looking good for athens , despite an eu security net .
greece currently owes foreign banks more than $ 300 billion -lrb- 219.8 billion euros -rrb- , which equals 115 percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
their current debt amounts to more then 12.7 percent of their economic output .
but how did it get this far ?
spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "
repeating history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overspending led to greece 's current situation this is not new territory for greece .
back in the 1980 's and 1990 's the country faced similar financial difficulties .
back then the socialist governments solved the problem by devaluing the country 's former currency , the drachma .
that way they were able to shrink imports and raise exports .
but economic expert babi papadimitriou said this option became unavailable when greece entered into the euro zone . over the past few years the political elite and the greek government have not really grasped what it means to be a member of the euro zone , the economist said .
" it goes without saying that you have to reduce your deficit as much as possible when you share your currency with other countries , " he said .
" but those in power have ignored this principle .
and the necessary reforms were never imposed . "
the state acted irresponsibly as costs began to mount and the ability for the economy to compete on an international level was reduced .
when added to the global financial crisis that hit back in 2008 , these structural weak points became a full-blown nightmare .
cutting costs the country 's biggest problem is the state itself and the services it offers .
according to professor paraskewopoulos , the largest share of savings could come from cutting the costs incurred by public employees : reducing tax exceptions , putting a hiring freeze on state offices and reducing employee salaries .
along with this , he said the government needs to tackle two other major hurdles : tax evasion and corruption . each year the greek government loses 20 billion euros in unpaid taxes , and it is estimated that the average greek family pays out some 1,600 euros annually in bribes .
notoriously , things rarely work in the country without a little money to grease the wheels .
bildunterschrift : greek prime minister george papandreou has some very unenviable choices to make " those in power have always rewarded those loyal to them with cushy jobs and now we have a bloated government that costs an inconceivable amount of money .
that 's where you have to start , " explained paraskewopoulos .
" of course that 's easy to say , but to really do it , you have to be prepared to deal with the people affected . "
and that is exactly what papandreou 's government is facing at the moment .
the public sector has gone on strike and indignant farmers are blocking the motorways and border crossings .
however , both experts agree that unless they get rid of the subsidies and begin to privatize state agencies , cleaning up the financial mess will be impossible .

greece 's financial woes started decades ago when the country was ruled by one socialist regime after another .
now experts warn that unless greece learns from its financial history , it is bound to repeat it . who would have imagined it ?
greece could soon be bankrupt and there are some speculations that athens will begin refusing payment on its obligations .
due to massive debt and doctored data , greece has lost the trust of both the european union and the financial markets .
and it 's not looking good for athens , despite an eu security net .
greece currently owes foreign banks more than $ 300 billion -lrb- 219.8 billion euros -rrb- , which equals 115 percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
their current debt amounts to more then 12.7 percent of their economic output .
but how did it get this far ?
spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "
repeating history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overspending led to greece 's current situation this is not new territory for greece .

that may be good news for germany 's axel weber , who hopes to make president . european union finance ministers on tuesday unanimously recommended portugal 's vitor constancio to be the next vice president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , an eu statement said .
if confirmed by the european parliament next month , constancio will succeed greece 's lucas papdemos in may .
" it was a unanimous choice , " said italian economics minister giulio tremonti .
" he is a very qualified and technically experienced person , so i think that he was the right choice for europe . "
constancio , 66 , is a former socialist lawmaker and party leader .
he has governed portugal 's central bank since 2000 after an earlier appointment from 1985 to 1986 .
north-south balance european union tradition dictates that member states find a balance between northern and southern european leaders when filling high-level posts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are looking up for bundesbank president axel weber observers say the choice of a southern european for ecb vice president appears to leave the post of president open for northerner axel weber , current president of germany 's bundesbank , instead of italian rival mario draghi .
but while constancio 's nomination certainly does not hurt weber 's chances , the german 's appointment to the presidency is far from certain .
current ecb president jean-claude trichet , whose term expires in october 2011 , said the assumption that weber would succeed him was " short-sighted . "
" i would not automatically push for germany to get the post of ecb president , " trichet told german public radio station deutschlandfunk .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : gay rights as civil rights under international pressure , uganda mulls amending anti-gay bill china 's gays : still a long way to go pope criticizes british equality legislation portuguese mps vote in favor of legalization of gay marriage civil rights -pipe- 16.02.2010 austrian straight couple applies for gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marriage for heterosexuals -registered partnership for homosexuals ?
a heterosexual couple in austria has vowed to go to the country 's highest court - to be granted a civil partnership introduced for gay couples .
they argue that current legislation is discriminatory . a heterosexual couple in austria is fighting for the right to enter into a registered civil partnership - introduced for homosexual couples in january 2010 .
under current law the couple will be denied that right - but they have vowed to take the case to the country 's constitutional court to overturn what they says is a discriminatory legislation .
austria introduced civil unions for gay couples on january 1 , affording them some of the rights enjoyed by their heterosexual counterparts .
the new legislation , passed after weeks of wrangling between the ruling social democrats and their conservative coalition partner in government , gives same-sex couples a status similar to traditional marriage but different in a number of respects .
for instance , there are less strict rules in the event of a divorce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the issue is equality - nothing but equality , ' the couple argues the heterosexual couple in question argues that this is a more modern form of union - which simply suits them better than a traditional marriage .
and if it 's offered to gay couples , why should n't it be an option for them as well ?
the issue at stake , they argue , is standing up against discrimination .
" everyone should have the same rights , and there should n't be different rules for different people , " the couple 's lawyer , helmut graupner , told deutsche welle .
" regardless of how many different forms of union a state provides to couples , all of those forms should be available for everyone and must not be restricted on the basis of race , class or sex or gender or other criteria , which are traditionally the very criteria for discrimination , " graupner said .
can you be ' a little bit equal ' ?
at the end of february , the couple plans to officially apply for a civil partnership - they expect this to be rejected , in which case they plan to take their case to the constitutional court .
their goal is to force the government to rework the legislation so that both traditional marriage and registered partnership will be open to any couple - gay or straight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay and lesbian activists say the different forms of union are discriminatory " the issue is equality - nothing but equality , " graupner said .
" you can not be ' a little bit equal . '
just like you ca n't be ' a little bit pregnant ' or ' a little bit dead . '
unless you 're entitled to the same kind of institutions and forms of law you 're not being treated equally and that 's discriminatory .
that 's what we are fighting against - we 're fighting for the rights of both heterosexuals and homosexuals . "
graupner is not only trying to help the heterosexual couple to get a ' gay ' marriage .
he 's also representing gay couples who want a traditional marriage - rather than the registered civil partnership that lawmakers have agreed on .
the current legislation provides same-sex couples with equal rights to heterosexuals with regards to pensions and alimony - but the law for instance continues to ban adoption .
it also does not allow civil partnership ceremonies at the civil registry office , where heterosexual couples can marry .
yet graupner is up against strong resistance .
the country 's conservative party - the austrian peoples party - only reluctantly agreed to the civil partnership in the first place .
the conservatives insists that significant differences between the two forms of union must remain .
the catholic church is not amused another powerful opponent to the law is the roman catholic church - after all , austria is predominantly catholic and the church is a force to be reckoned with .
the country 's clergy is opposed to the existing law , and certainly against any further liberalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the church ' different things need to be treated differently ' " the austrian bishops have made their position quite clear , " professor erich leitenberger , spokesman for the vienna diocese told deutsche welle .
" they strongly support the fact that the law does not put the civil partnership and a traditional marriage on an equal footing . "
" but the bishops have expressed concerns that the new law could be the beginning of a trend which eventually will lead to putting the civil partnership on the same footing as the traditional marriage between a man and a woman . "
leitenberger said that the legislation in place before january 1 was sufficient to safeguard the rights of gay and lesbian couples .
families , he argued , were shouldering the task of raising children and therefore could not be put on the same level with same-sex couples .
" the bishops stick to their position that a traditional marriage , a family raising children simply is something different from a homosexual couple - and therefore should also be treated differently . "
however , should the appeal to the constitutional court be successful , soon both of the two forms of union , could be open to any couple - a situation that would place austria at the forefront in terms of homosexual rights in europe .
the decision by the court is expected by the end of this year .

a heterosexual couple in austria has vowed to go to the country 's highest court - to be granted a civil partnership introduced for gay couples .
they argue that current legislation is discriminatory . a heterosexual couple in austria is fighting for the right to enter into a registered civil partnership - introduced for homosexual couples in january 2010 .
under current law the couple will be denied that right - but they have vowed to take the case to the country 's constitutional court to overturn what they says is a discriminatory legislation .
austria introduced civil unions for gay couples on january 1 , affording them some of the rights enjoyed by their heterosexual counterparts .
the new legislation , passed after weeks of wrangling between the ruling social democrats and their conservative coalition partner in government , gives same-sex couples a status similar to traditional marriage but different in a number of respects .

the issue at stake , they argue , is standing up against discrimination .
" everyone should have the same rights , and there should n't be different rules for different people , " the couple 's lawyer , helmut graupner , told deutsche welle .
" regardless of how many different forms of union a state provides to couples , all of those forms should be available for everyone and must not be restricted on the basis of race , class or sex or gender or other criteria , which are traditionally the very criteria for discrimination , " graupner said .
can you be ' a little bit equal ' ?
at the end of february , the couple plans to officially apply for a civil partnership - they expect this to be rejected , in which case they plan to take their case to the constitutional court .
their goal is to force the government to rework the legislation so that both traditional marriage and registered partnership will be open to any couple - gay or straight .

a heterosexual couple in austria has vowed to go to the country 's highest court - to be granted a civil partnership introduced for gay couples .
they argue that current legislation is discriminatory . a heterosexual couple in austria is fighting for the right to enter into a registered civil partnership - introduced for homosexual couples in january 2010 .
under current law the couple will be denied that right - but they have vowed to take the case to the country 's constitutional court to overturn what they says is a discriminatory legislation .
austria introduced civil unions for gay couples on january 1 , affording them some of the rights enjoyed by their heterosexual counterparts .
the new legislation , passed after weeks of wrangling between the ruling social democrats and their conservative coalition partner in government , gives same-sex couples a status similar to traditional marriage but different in a number of respects .
for instance , there are less strict rules in the event of a divorce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the issue is equality - nothing but equality , ' the couple argues the heterosexual couple in question argues that this is a more modern form of union - which simply suits them better than a traditional marriage .
and if it 's offered to gay couples , why should n't it be an option for them as well ?
the issue at stake , they argue , is standing up against discrimination .
" everyone should have the same rights , and there should n't be different rules for different people , " the couple 's lawyer , helmut graupner , told deutsche welle .
" regardless of how many different forms of union a state provides to couples , all of those forms should be available for everyone and must not be restricted on the basis of race , class or sex or gender or other criteria , which are traditionally the very criteria for discrimination , " graupner said .
can you be ' a little bit equal ' ?
at the end of february , the couple plans to officially apply for a civil partnership - they expect this to be rejected , in which case they plan to take their case to the constitutional court .
their goal is to force the government to rework the legislation so that both traditional marriage and registered partnership will be open to any couple - gay or straight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay and lesbian activists say the different forms of union are discriminatory " the issue is equality - nothing but equality , " graupner said .
" you can not be ' a little bit equal . '
just like you ca n't be ' a little bit pregnant ' or ' a little bit dead . '
unless you 're entitled to the same kind of institutions and forms of law you 're not being treated equally and that 's discriminatory .
that 's what we are fighting against - we 're fighting for the rights of both heterosexuals and homosexuals . "
graupner is not only trying to help the heterosexual couple to get a ' gay ' marriage .
he 's also representing gay couples who want a traditional marriage - rather than the registered civil partnership that lawmakers have agreed on .
the current legislation provides same-sex couples with equal rights to heterosexuals with regards to pensions and alimony - but the law for instance continues to ban adoption .
it also does not allow civil partnership ceremonies at the civil registry office , where heterosexual couples can marry .
yet graupner is up against strong resistance .
the country 's conservative party - the austrian peoples party - only reluctantly agreed to the civil partnership in the first place .
the conservatives insists that significant differences between the two forms of union must remain .
the catholic church is not amused another powerful opponent to the law is the roman catholic church - after all , austria is predominantly catholic and the church is a force to be reckoned with .
the country 's clergy is opposed to the existing law , and certainly against any further liberalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the church ' different things need to be treated differently ' " the austrian bishops have made their position quite clear , " professor erich leitenberger , spokesman for the vienna diocese told deutsche welle .
" they strongly support the fact that the law does not put the civil partnership and a traditional marriage on an equal footing . "
" but the bishops have expressed concerns that the new law could be the beginning of a trend which eventually will lead to putting the civil partnership on the same footing as the traditional marriage between a man and a woman . "
leitenberger said that the legislation in place before january 1 was sufficient to safeguard the rights of gay and lesbian couples .
families , he argued , were shouldering the task of raising children and therefore could not be put on the same level with same-sex couples .
" the bishops stick to their position that a traditional marriage , a family raising children simply is something different from a homosexual couple - and therefore should also be treated differently . "
however , should the appeal to the constitutional court be successful , soon both of the two forms of union , could be open to any couple - a situation that would place austria at the forefront in terms of homosexual rights in europe .

now , with debt mounting , an economic comeback in 2010 appears increasingly unlikely as the celtic tiger struggles to avoid the fate of greece . the economy of the republic of ireland , until the early 1990s , was rooted firmly in agriculture , largely relying on traditional , farm-based businesses .
but in 1994 , ireland began to experience economic growth that would transform one of europe 's poorest nations into one of its richest .
starting that year , ireland used its educated and under utilized english-speaking workforce , state policies that attracted large american corporations eager to make inroads into the european union market , tolerance towards low-skilled immigrant workers and generous corporate tax benefits to fuel expansive economic growth .
property prices soared as wages increased .
personal and public debt levels decreased dramatically .
the ' celtic tiger ' , as ireland came to be known , became a knowledge-based economy .
the 2007 global downturn ended ireland 's positive run , and the crisis of 2008 sent the country into an economic tailspin .
the government could no longer continue wage increases necessary for workers to pay high home prices , leading to widespread mortgage defaults .
ireland 's housing losses were devastating ; its real estate bubble had grown much faster than that in the rest of europe .
debt levels , at historical lows in 2006 , returned to unmanageable levels .
many of the gains made during the celtic tiger 's boom period have been lost in the last three years .
it could take decades to restore them . bildunterschrift : ireland 's construction sector collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis 2010 forecasts discouraging few economists believe ireland will recover this year .
an official forecast released by the irish government last month predicted an average unemployment rate of 13.2 percent in 2010 . the latest quarterly report from dublin-based economic and social research institute -lrb- esri -rrb- estimates an average jobless rate of 13.75 percent this year .
although much higher than european average , this is a significant downward revision from the institute 's spring 2009 forecast , which put unemployment at almost 17 percent by the end of 2010 .
like greece , spain and portugal , ireland 's biggest problem is debt .
tax revenue declines of 20 percent last year have left ireland operating 25 billion euros over budget this year .
meanwhile , homeowners still are forced to pay expensive mortgages on property which has lost significant value .
home prices fell nearly 20 percent last year , according to esri , and are down more than 30 percent since 2007 .
" it is just tragic when you look at the reversal in debt levels , " erik jones , a professor of european studies at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they worked so hard for so long just to be back where they were -lrb- when the economic revival began in the 1990s -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising debt levels have triggered protests in ireland the road forward the european union is not expected to allow ireland 's fiscal problems to become unmanageable .
the european commission last week made clear that while current action would be limited , greece would not be allowed to fail .
the same promise applies to ireland .
the irish government has helped itself by acting with more fiscal discipline than its greek counterpart .
dublin has made sizeable spending cuts in this year 's budget , and public workers , from low level bureaucrats to top public officials , are expected to earn less this year .
philip lane , a professor of international microeconomics at trinity college dublin attributed ireland 's ability to make difficult cuts to the nature of the irish crisis .
" ireland is feeling the pinch because of the burst of the real estate bubble , " he said .
" greece , meanwhile , has chronically overspent for years . "
" we made the cutbacks in ireland because we knew that wages were growing too quickly , that wages were too high , " lane told deutsche welle .
" we knew we needed to get sensible again . "
lane says that once the crisis passes , ireland should revert to the practices that made the early part of the celtic tiger years successful .
" the real celtic tiger was driven by an export boom .
we got diverted by a domestic construction bubble , " he said .
" we need to get back to international business . "

the eu has joined the row on the swiss side but some countries may jump ship if trade ties with tripoli are threatened . on sunday , libya took the decision to stop issuing visas to citizens of the eu schengen free-travel zone - of which non-eu member switzerland is a signatory - escalating the spat caused by switzerland 's travel ban handed out to one of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's sons . the libyan leader 's son hannibal and his spouse joined 186 other libyan figures barred from visiting switzerland after an incident in july 2008 when two hotel servants in geneva complained hannibal had mistreated them . after hannibal and his pregnant wife aline were arrested in geneva , libya cut oil supplies to switzerland and withdrew more than $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.6 billlion euros -rrb- dollars in assets from swiss banks . libya then prevented two swiss businessmen from leaving the country , and subsequently tried them on visa violations . the row flared up again in november last year when switzerland asked the 25 schengen signatories to restrict visas to libyan passport holders . following that request , libyan prime minister baghadadi al-mahmoudi and other senior officials were denied schengen visas , a refusal that libya 's deputy prime minister khalid kaim blamed on the swiss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the libyan leader took his cash out of switzerland last year last week , a tripoli appeals court reduced an earlier , 16-month prison sentence against max goldi , one of the two swiss businessmen held in libya on visa violations , after a court on february 7 acquitted fellow swiss citizen rachid al-hamdani on the same charges . swiss trauma but the row erupted again at the weekend with libya taking steps which not only punish swiss citizens but those from switzerland 's fellow schengen area signatories . isabelle werenfels , senior associate at the middle east and africa research division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that the whole affair , from the start in 2008 to this week 's developments , has been traumatizing for the swiss . " the libyans have made it very hard for the swiss to get out of libya and it has felt at times like they were hostages there , " she said .
" the airlines are still not allowed to fly out of libya .
many people say that the libya situation is actually at the heart of the swiss attitude towards minarets and muslims .

little was known about the soviet camps until after the fall of the east german regime . sixty years ago on monday , the last inmates were reported to have been released from the last of a total of 10 internment camps that the russians had set up in what was then the soviet zone of occupation in germany .
their existence had become a thorn in the side of the founding fathers of communist east germany , who were left to deal with requests from the inmates ' family members to tell them what had happened to the prisoners .
documents that became available only after german unification in 1990 indicate that up to 176,000 inmates were held in the soviets ' " special camps . "
thirty-five percent of the detainees are thought to have died there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst zander , here with his wife renate , is unable to forget some of those who survived the camp at buchenwald , which is now a memorial site , met with historians there on saturday to talk about their personal experiences and the latest scientific findings about the soviet camps .
eyewitnesses still able to tell their story ernst zander was a youngster when he was captured by the soviets after the war .
after doing time at a prison at jamlitz , he was sent on to buchenwald .
the nazis had used the site as a concentration camp , where an estimated 50,000 people were executed , starved or worked to death .
after world war ii , the soviets used the same facility for one of their biggest internment camps . zander ended up there , because the russians accused him of being a " wehrwolf " - the standard term back then for a german who tried to fight soviet tanks and machinery as the red army advanced toward berlin in the final stages of the war .
he denies these allegations , saying that he was imprisoned for no crime at all .
he says the conditions he and other prisoners faced at the buchenwald camp were harsh .
" our family did not know we were being held in the camp .
we could not write to anyone .
we were so alone , " zander told deutsche welle .
the director of the buchenwald memorial site foundation , volkhard knigge , hastens to add that all the war-time allies had their own internment camps in germany , emphasizing that of course the soviets too had the right to have such camps after all the cruelty they 'd experienced at the hands of nazi germany .
but he points out that the soviet internment camps differed from those of the western allies .
" buchenwald in particular was a 100 percent stalinist camp between 1945 and its closure in 1950 , " knigge said .
" inmates had no right to complain to anyone .
there was no examination of the facts to establish personal guilt , no case-by-case investigations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a section of the sachsenhausen museum is devoted to soviet special camp no. 7 out of the fire - into the frying pan the last three camps - buchenwald , sachsenhausen and bautzen - were only closed as soviet internment centers in 1950 , several months after the founding of the communist german democratic republic .
some of the inmates were sent on to soviet gulags such as the one at workuta .
others were sentenced to long prison terms after show trials .
others were freed .
" many youngsters were able to start a normal life again , " said knigge .
" but what was difficult for them all was that they could n't openly speak about their experiences in the camps , as east german leaders kept sweeping the issue under the carpet . "
renate zander , the wife of former buchenwald inmate ernst zander , says that even now , the fate of the former detainees is not well known among the general german population .
" teachers here usually do n't want to talk about the events after 1945 , " she said .
" we have seven grandchildren , and they say that they only hear about the holocaust period when talking about the history of the camps at buchenwald and elsewhere .
nobody asks about the later events , because they 're not in the teachers ' minds . "
she also said that she sees little hope that this will be added to school curriculums anytime soon .

not so - in fact , they flourish . it took ruud van nistelrooy just 10 minutes on saturday to make the kind of impact hamburg were hoping for from the dutch striker when they bought him from real madrid in the january transfer window .
the former manchester united star came on as a second half substitute in hamburg 's game against stuttgart and with the score at 1-1 , van nistelrooy struck in the 75th and 77th minutes to seal a 3-1 victory for his new team . the imposing dutch forward was supposed to be a spent force when hamburg rescued him from an increasingly frustrating spell with spanish giants real .
despite winning two league titles with madrid in his three-and-a-half seasons with them , and scoring 46 goals in 68 appearances for los blancos , the latest galacticos policy at the santiago bernabeu left van nistelrooy out in the cold and surplus to requirements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy showed he 's far from a washed-up has-been " depending on how he 's used , ruud can still be a sensation and will do very well in the bundesliga if he 's used smartly and is allowed his rest , " said jan roskott , dutch soccer correspondent for the offside.com . " his biggest strength - in my view - is his focus and his mental strength .
he 's a real killer .
the thing with ruud is , his scoring ratio is high .
hamburg play offensive football , so if ruud gets four chances to score , he 'll convert at least one of those chances .
he 's also a real team player and he allows others to play better .
i 'm not sure if he has 40 games or more in him , though , but if he remains fit , he could well have another good three years in him . " bundesliga helps robben rediscover frightening flair another dutchman who was frozen out at real madrid only to find a warmer welcome in germany is arjen robben .
the dutch winger struck again at the weekend in bayern 's 3-1 victory over borussia dortmund to bring his season total for bayern munich to eight goals in 14 games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben is a player reborn at bayern munich this season robben has been a player transformed in the bundesliga since arriving last summer .
he performed fitfully at real and rarely produced the kind of displays which convinced madrid to pay chelsea 25 million euros -lrb- $ 34 million -rrb- for his services in 2007 .

now , with debt mounting , an economic comeback in 2010 appears increasingly unlikely as the celtic tiger struggles to avoid the fate of greece . the economy of the republic of ireland , until the early 1990s , was rooted firmly in agriculture , largely relying on traditional , farm-based businesses .
but in 1994 , ireland began to experience economic growth that would transform one of europe 's poorest nations into one of its richest .
starting that year , ireland used its educated and under utilized english-speaking workforce , state policies that attracted large american corporations eager to make inroads into the european union market , tolerance towards low-skilled immigrant workers and generous corporate tax benefits to fuel expansive economic growth .
property prices soared as wages increased .
personal and public debt levels decreased dramatically .
the ' celtic tiger ' , as ireland came to be known , became a knowledge-based economy .
the 2007 global downturn ended ireland 's positive run , and the crisis of 2008 sent the country into an economic tailspin .
the government could no longer continue wage increases necessary for workers to pay high home prices , leading to widespread mortgage defaults .
ireland 's housing losses were devastating ; its real estate bubble had grown much faster than that in the rest of europe .
debt levels , at historical lows in 2006 , returned to unmanageable levels .
many of the gains made during the celtic tiger 's boom period have been lost in the last three years .
it could take decades to restore them . bildunterschrift : ireland 's construction sector collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis 2010 forecasts discouraging few economists believe ireland will recover this year .
an official forecast released by the irish government last month predicted an average unemployment rate of 13.2 percent in 2010 . the latest quarterly report from dublin-based economic and social research institute -lrb- esri -rrb- estimates an average jobless rate of 13.75 percent this year .
although much higher than european average , this is a significant downward revision from the institute 's spring 2009 forecast , which put unemployment at almost 17 percent by the end of 2010 .
like greece , spain and portugal , ireland 's biggest problem is debt .
tax revenue declines of 20 percent last year have left ireland operating 25 billion euros over budget this year .
meanwhile , homeowners still are forced to pay expensive mortgages on property which has lost significant value .
home prices fell nearly 20 percent last year , according to esri , and are down more than 30 percent since 2007 .
" it is just tragic when you look at the reversal in debt levels , " erik jones , a professor of european studies at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they worked so hard for so long just to be back where they were -lrb- when the economic revival began in the 1990s -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising debt levels have triggered protests in ireland the road forward the european union is not expected to allow ireland 's fiscal problems to become unmanageable .
the european commission last week made clear that while current action would be limited , greece would not be allowed to fail .
the same promise applies to ireland .
the irish government has helped itself by acting with more fiscal discipline than its greek counterpart .
dublin has made sizeable spending cuts in this year 's budget , and public workers , from low level bureaucrats to top public officials , are expected to earn less this year .
philip lane , a professor of international microeconomics at trinity college dublin attributed ireland 's ability to make difficult cuts to the nature of the irish crisis .
" ireland is feeling the pinch because of the burst of the real estate bubble , " he said .
" greece , meanwhile , has chronically overspent for years . "
" we made the cutbacks in ireland because we knew that wages were growing too quickly , that wages were too high , " lane told deutsche welle .
" we knew we needed to get sensible again . "
lane says that once the crisis passes , ireland should revert to the practices that made the early part of the celtic tiger years successful .
" the real celtic tiger was driven by an export boom .
we got diverted by a domestic construction bubble , " he said .
" we need to get back to international business . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 16.02.2010 survivors , academics recall dark episode in germany 's postwar history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands died in postwar soviet internment camps former inmates of internment camps set up by the soviets following world war ii met with academics at buchenwald on saturday .
little was known about the soviet camps until after the fall of the east german regime . sixty years ago on monday , the last inmates were reported to have been released from the last of a total of 10 internment camps that the russians had set up in what was then the soviet zone of occupation in germany .
their existence had become a thorn in the side of the founding fathers of communist east germany , who were left to deal with requests from the inmates ' family members to tell them what had happened to the prisoners .
documents that became available only after german unification in 1990 indicate that up to 176,000 inmates were held in the soviets ' " special camps . "
thirty-five percent of the detainees are thought to have died there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst zander , here with his wife renate , is unable to forget some of those who survived the camp at buchenwald , which is now a memorial site , met with historians there on saturday to talk about their personal experiences and the latest scientific findings about the soviet camps .
eyewitnesses still able to tell their story ernst zander was a youngster when he was captured by the soviets after the war .
after doing time at a prison at jamlitz , he was sent on to buchenwald .
the nazis had used the site as a concentration camp , where an estimated 50,000 people were executed , starved or worked to death .
after world war ii , the soviets used the same facility for one of their biggest internment camps . zander ended up there , because the russians accused him of being a " wehrwolf " - the standard term back then for a german who tried to fight soviet tanks and machinery as the red army advanced toward berlin in the final stages of the war .
he denies these allegations , saying that he was imprisoned for no crime at all .
he says the conditions he and other prisoners faced at the buchenwald camp were harsh .
" our family did not know we were being held in the camp .
we could not write to anyone .
we were so alone , " zander told deutsche welle .
the director of the buchenwald memorial site foundation , volkhard knigge , hastens to add that all the war-time allies had their own internment camps in germany , emphasizing that of course the soviets too had the right to have such camps after all the cruelty they 'd experienced at the hands of nazi germany .
but he points out that the soviet internment camps differed from those of the western allies .
" buchenwald in particular was a 100 percent stalinist camp between 1945 and its closure in 1950 , " knigge said .
" inmates had no right to complain to anyone .
there was no examination of the facts to establish personal guilt , no case-by-case investigations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a section of the sachsenhausen museum is devoted to soviet special camp no. 7 out of the fire - into the frying pan the last three camps - buchenwald , sachsenhausen and bautzen - were only closed as soviet internment centers in 1950 , several months after the founding of the communist german democratic republic .
some of the inmates were sent on to soviet gulags such as the one at workuta .
others were sentenced to long prison terms after show trials .
others were freed .
" many youngsters were able to start a normal life again , " said knigge .
" but what was difficult for them all was that they could n't openly speak about their experiences in the camps , as east german leaders kept sweeping the issue under the carpet . "
renate zander , the wife of former buchenwald inmate ernst zander , says that even now , the fate of the former detainees is not well known among the general german population .
" teachers here usually do n't want to talk about the events after 1945 , " she said .
" we have seven grandchildren , and they say that they only hear about the holocaust period when talking about the history of the camps at buchenwald and elsewhere .
nobody asks about the later events , because they 're not in the teachers ' minds . "
she also said that she sees little hope that this will be added to school curriculums anytime soon .

little was known about the soviet camps until after the fall of the east german regime . sixty years ago on monday , the last inmates were reported to have been released from the last of a total of 10 internment camps that the russians had set up in what was then the soviet zone of occupation in germany .
their existence had become a thorn in the side of the founding fathers of communist east germany , who were left to deal with requests from the inmates ' family members to tell them what had happened to the prisoners .
documents that became available only after german unification in 1990 indicate that up to 176,000 inmates were held in the soviets ' " special camps . "
thirty-five percent of the detainees are thought to have died there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst zander , here with his wife renate , is unable to forget some of those who survived the camp at buchenwald , which is now a memorial site , met with historians there on saturday to talk about their personal experiences and the latest scientific findings about the soviet camps .
eyewitnesses still able to tell their story ernst zander was a youngster when he was captured by the soviets after the war .
after doing time at a prison at jamlitz , he was sent on to buchenwald .
the nazis had used the site as a concentration camp , where an estimated 50,000 people were executed , starved or worked to death .
after world war ii , the soviets used the same facility for one of their biggest internment camps . zander ended up there , because the russians accused him of being a " wehrwolf " - the standard term back then for a german who tried to fight soviet tanks and machinery as the red army advanced toward berlin in the final stages of the war .
he denies these allegations , saying that he was imprisoned for no crime at all .
he says the conditions he and other prisoners faced at the buchenwald camp were harsh .
" our family did not know we were being held in the camp .
we could not write to anyone .
we were so alone , " zander told deutsche welle .
the director of the buchenwald memorial site foundation , volkhard knigge , hastens to add that all the war-time allies had their own internment camps in germany , emphasizing that of course the soviets too had the right to have such camps after all the cruelty they 'd experienced at the hands of nazi germany .
but he points out that the soviet internment camps differed from those of the western allies .
" buchenwald in particular was a 100 percent stalinist camp between 1945 and its closure in 1950 , " knigge said .
" inmates had no right to complain to anyone .
there was no examination of the facts to establish personal guilt , no case-by-case investigations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a section of the sachsenhausen museum is devoted to soviet special camp no. 7 out of the fire - into the frying pan the last three camps - buchenwald , sachsenhausen and bautzen - were only closed as soviet internment centers in 1950 , several months after the founding of the communist german democratic republic .
some of the inmates were sent on to soviet gulags such as the one at workuta .
others were sentenced to long prison terms after show trials .
others were freed .
" many youngsters were able to start a normal life again , " said knigge .
" but what was difficult for them all was that they could n't openly speak about their experiences in the camps , as east german leaders kept sweeping the issue under the carpet . "
renate zander , the wife of former buchenwald inmate ernst zander , says that even now , the fate of the former detainees is not well known among the general german population .
" teachers here usually do n't want to talk about the events after 1945 , " she said .
" we have seven grandchildren , and they say that they only hear about the holocaust period when talking about the history of the camps at buchenwald and elsewhere .
nobody asks about the later events , because they 're not in the teachers ' minds . "
she also said that she sees little hope that this will be added to school curriculums anytime soon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 16.02.2010 uk mulls ' green bonds ' to spur infrastructure investment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed bonds are meant to help fund the renewable energy industry britain is reportedly examining the idea of launching green bonds to boost the renewable energy sector amid cash flow snags .
but will they have the desired effect of easing funding bottlenecks ? the economic secretary to the uk 's finance ministry , ian pearson , said in an interview published in the financial times newspaper on monday that the government was considering introducing so-called “ green bonds ” to the public to help fund the renewable energy industry .
pearson said that he had asked officials to examine a proposal that would see national savings and investments - a treasury-based unit - issue the bonds for sustainable infrastructure projects .
debt by any other name … dr. martin weale , director of the national institute of economic and social research -lrb- niesr -rrb- , an independent london-based think tank , told deutsche welle that such a move would basically amount to government borrowing , regardless of what name it ’ s given .
“ if it ’ s something that makes people happier about lending to the government – assuming the government is issuing them – or if it makes it possible for the government to borrow more cheaply than would otherwise be the case , then it seems to be it ’ s a good idea , ” dr. weale said .
“ fundamentally , what matters is actually paying for spending that ’ s done , whether it ’ s a green idea or anything else , and if you finance it by borrowing , it doesn ’ t matter too much what you call it , ” he said , adding that investors would need to look at the likely yields of such bonds .
proponents of the green bonds are describing them as a new way to finance infrastructure projects at a time when the government is struggling to balance its books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. weale says emotive captions persuaded people to invest in wartime bonds however , dr. weale points out that it won ’ t actually reduce the amount of government borrowing .
“ when we look at how much the government is borrowing and whether it can afford it , people will take green bonds into account just as much as anything else , ” he said .
he draws an analogy between last century ’ s wartime borrowing in britain and the current trends .
“ in many ways it ’ s rather similar to something we saw in the twentieth century : we had defense bonds and we had war loans .
and those were names given to government debt to make it easier or persuade people to buy it , ” he explained .
long-term contracts planned the finance ministry ’ s ian pearson was also quoted as saying the government was looking to offer long-term support to wind energy and green waste companies .
" we are thinking of going direct to companies looking to establish energy from waste and wind farm projects and offering them long-term contracts that would both get the public sector a good deal on price but also get the projects off the ground , " he told the financial times .
" if they had , say , a 15-year contract to supply the public sector , that should make it easier for them to raise finance to get the projects going , while tying in with the green agenda , " pearson added .
experts like dr. weale agree that there ’ s an argument for such long-term contracts .
“ we know that at current prices many so-called green schemes are highly uneconomic .
and since the government doesn ’ t want to do the obvious thing , which is to impose a proper charge for carbon emissions , what they are proposing seems to me the next best , ” he conceded .
kfw as a model ?
also under consideration is the idea of establishing a state-run infrastructure bank to help fund energy and other infrastructure projects in the country .
some analysts have pointed to the enormous amount of investments needed for energy infrastructure not only in britain but across europe .
however , there are doubts about how such projects can be financed at a time when credit flow remains a problem as the global economy slowly recovers from recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infrastructure bank on the lines of germany 's kfw bank has been mooted as a means of mobilizing capital for such purposes , some analysts in the uk have suggested setting up an infrastructure bank on the lines of germany ’ s state-owned development bank kfw .
competition for private banks some analysts say the proposal could set off alarm bells for private sector banks .
however , dr. weale from the niesr disagrees .
“ i think private sector banks aren ’ t terribly worried about competition .
they ’ re very short of capital .
they are not wanting to lend - as far as one can tell .
and if they ’ re not wanting to lend , they shouldn ’ t be upset that other people are doing the lending instead , ” he said .
dr. weale says that if the private sector banks were to raise more capital , perhaps they could compete for that sort of business as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 16.02.2010 uk mulls ' green bonds ' to spur infrastructure investment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed bonds are meant to help fund the renewable energy industry britain is reportedly examining the idea of launching green bonds to boost the renewable energy sector amid cash flow snags .
but will they have the desired effect of easing funding bottlenecks ? the economic secretary to the uk 's finance ministry , ian pearson , said in an interview published in the financial times newspaper on monday that the government was considering introducing so-called “ green bonds ” to the public to help fund the renewable energy industry .
pearson said that he had asked officials to examine a proposal that would see national savings and investments - a treasury-based unit - issue the bonds for sustainable infrastructure projects .
debt by any other name … dr. martin weale , director of the national institute of economic and social research -lrb- niesr -rrb- , an independent london-based think tank , told deutsche welle that such a move would basically amount to government borrowing , regardless of what name it ’ s given .
“ if it ’ s something that makes people happier about lending to the government – assuming the government is issuing them – or if it makes it possible for the government to borrow more cheaply than would otherwise be the case , then it seems to be it ’ s a good idea , ” dr. weale said .
“ fundamentally , what matters is actually paying for spending that ’ s done , whether it ’ s a green idea or anything else , and if you finance it by borrowing , it doesn ’ t matter too much what you call it , ” he said , adding that investors would need to look at the likely yields of such bonds .
proponents of the green bonds are describing them as a new way to finance infrastructure projects at a time when the government is struggling to balance its books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. weale says emotive captions persuaded people to invest in wartime bonds however , dr. weale points out that it won ’ t actually reduce the amount of government borrowing .
“ when we look at how much the government is borrowing and whether it can afford it , people will take green bonds into account just as much as anything else , ” he said .
he draws an analogy between last century ’ s wartime borrowing in britain and the current trends .
“ in many ways it ’ s rather similar to something we saw in the twentieth century : we had defense bonds and we had war loans .
and those were names given to government debt to make it easier or persuade people to buy it , ” he explained .
long-term contracts planned the finance ministry ’ s ian pearson was also quoted as saying the government was looking to offer long-term support to wind energy and green waste companies .
" we are thinking of going direct to companies looking to establish energy from waste and wind farm projects and offering them long-term contracts that would both get the public sector a good deal on price but also get the projects off the ground , " he told the financial times .
" if they had , say , a 15-year contract to supply the public sector , that should make it easier for them to raise finance to get the projects going , while tying in with the green agenda , " pearson added .
experts like dr. weale agree that there ’ s an argument for such long-term contracts .
“ we know that at current prices many so-called green schemes are highly uneconomic .
and since the government doesn ’ t want to do the obvious thing , which is to impose a proper charge for carbon emissions , what they are proposing seems to me the next best , ” he conceded .
kfw as a model ?
also under consideration is the idea of establishing a state-run infrastructure bank to help fund energy and other infrastructure projects in the country .
some analysts have pointed to the enormous amount of investments needed for energy infrastructure not only in britain but across europe .
however , there are doubts about how such projects can be financed at a time when credit flow remains a problem as the global economy slowly recovers from recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infrastructure bank on the lines of germany 's kfw bank has been mooted as a means of mobilizing capital for such purposes , some analysts in the uk have suggested setting up an infrastructure bank on the lines of germany ’ s state-owned development bank kfw .
competition for private banks some analysts say the proposal could set off alarm bells for private sector banks .
however , dr. weale from the niesr disagrees .
“ i think private sector banks aren ’ t terribly worried about competition .
they ’ re very short of capital .
they are not wanting to lend - as far as one can tell .
and if they ’ re not wanting to lend , they shouldn ’ t be upset that other people are doing the lending instead , ” he said .
dr. weale says that if the private sector banks were to raise more capital , perhaps they could compete for that sort of business as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.02.2010 eu gives greece budget plan deadline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece will make further budget cuts if needed greece has assured its euro-zone partners it will present a plan for further budget cuts in march , if its current austerity measures are not adequate to rein in its massive deficit . after talks between greek politicians and european finance ministers , eurogroup president jean-claude juncker announced on monday that greece would come forth with further budget cuts when it reports on march 16 to euro-zone countries , should its current efforts prove insufficient .
juncker said the additional plan should focus on expenditure cuts and revenue-increasing measures .
athens has pledged to reduce its deficit , which was 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2009 , by four percentage points in 2010 .
greece hopes to reduce this further by 2012 to 3 percent - and thus come within the official maximum limit for countries using the euro .
large demands greek finance minister george papaconstantinou defended his country 's efforts to slash the deficit by 2012 .
he also defended the use of " derivated contracts , " used in the past to borrow money without increasing official debt levels , saying they were legal at the time of their use .
critics have said the measures hid the full extent of the country 's financial situation from brussels .
papaconstantinou said that although greece is willing to undertake additional fiscal measures to tackle its debt , urging the country to do more before its report in march is asking for too much .
" we 're trying to change the course of the titanic , it can not be done in a day , " he told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders say they are ready to take action to ensure financial stability papaconstantinou also suggested ministers of euro-zone countries should work on putting substance behind the pledges of support they made last week .
eu leaders did not specify how much they would help , but said they are ready to take " determined and coordinated " action to ensure financial stability in the euro zone if necessary .
the details of the plans are being withheld from the public by greece 's euro-zone partners , as representatives agreed it would be " unwise " to reveal possible measures .
a draft declaration including greece 's obligation to report its situation in march and undertake additional measures if necessary is to be adopted by all 27 eu finance ministers on tuesday. mk / afp / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

from here it is 2,840km to the sea .
green groups have welcomed a program to clean up and protect europe 's second-largest and much-hymned river , the danube .
but activists have also urged more action to preserve what they see as a " backbone of biodiversity . " environmentalists have warned that pressure to build new hydroelectric plants and to make the river more navigable for shipping continue to threaten the danube , which runs a staggering 2,860 kilometers from germany 's black forest to the black sea in romania .
additional water regulation measures threaten the dynamism of the river - one of the danube 's most-prized qualities , according to georg kestel , danube expert of the german arm of friends of the earth , bund .
bildunterschrift : this is close to where the danube ends - by lake razim in romania " what makes this river really special is that it crosses through such a great variety of landscapes in its journey from west to east .
it is a very important migratory route for numerous types of animals and plants .
the river is the backbone of biodiversity , " kestel told deutsche welle .
most international river bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : repeated flooding of the river has led to moves to restore flood plains environment ministers from 14 countries that either border the danube or belong to the river 's catchment area this week agreed to adopt a five-year plan to " improve the environmental condition of the danube and its tributaries " .
" the danube waters are shared by us all and therefore we also share the responsibility , " said mitja bricelj , president of the international commission for the protection of the danube river -lrb- icpdr -rrb- who hosted the meeting on tuesday -lrb- february 16 -rrb- in vienna .
" we meet to ensure that the resources of the danube basin are managed in an environmentally sustainable manner , " bricelj added . the plan includes a series of measures to be implemented by 2015 , including concrete efforts to reduce pollution and minimize the negative effects of man-made changes to the world 's most international river .
the re-naturalization of wetlands , the creation of natural flood barriers and the upgrading of dykes are also part of the program . more sustainable shipping bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist as well as freight ships frequent the danube environmental groups , such as bund and the world wildlife fund , generally welcomed the plan , but they also took the opportunity to present a petition with 100,000 signatures calling for greener and more sustainable shipping projects . in particular , green groups are campaigning against river regulation work in the upper danube between straubing and vilshofen in germany .
the planned construction of a dam and a canal would destroy the last significant free-flowing section of the river in germany .
" overall , we welcome it , but we do see some critical points , " said irene lucius , senioor policy coordinator of the wwf 's danube-carpathian program told afp news agency .
giving nature a helping hand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danube has a great symbolic significance in some countries bund expert georg kestel praised the moves to restore natural water meadows and to improve the continuity of the river by building fish ladders , for example , to allow their passage through dams and other man-made obstacles . kestel also backed the ministers ' call for the introduction of phosphate-free detergents - a problem in eastern europe .
however , he urged an eu-wide ban to make this effective .
although 10 member countries directly border the danube and there several more in its catchment area , international cooperation appears to be working well .
shared waters , different problems bildunterschrift : the danube delta in romania is a paradise for birds however , the river faces different problems in different places .
whereas in eastern europe the pollution of the river mainly stems from excessive levels of inadequately treated municipal sewage .
in the west , agriculture is the main culprit .
and whereas many free-flowing sections and water meadows have been lost in western europe , many remain intact further to the east .
for kestel , it is essential that the danube 's dynamic character is retained .
" the danube is classes better than the rhine .
shipping is very dominant there .
the problem is that there are number of projects hanging over the danube that would ruin its quality . "

little was known about the soviet camps until after the fall of the east german regime . sixty years ago on monday , the last inmates were reported to have been released from the last of a total of 10 internment camps that the russians had set up in what was then the soviet zone of occupation in germany .
their existence had become a thorn in the side of the founding fathers of communist east germany , who were left to deal with requests from the inmates ' family members to tell them what had happened to the prisoners .
documents that became available only after german unification in 1990 indicate that up to 176,000 inmates were held in the soviets ' " special camps . "
thirty-five percent of the detainees are thought to have died there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst zander , here with his wife renate , is unable to forget some of those who survived the camp at buchenwald , which is now a memorial site , met with historians there on saturday to talk about their personal experiences and the latest scientific findings about the soviet camps .
eyewitnesses still able to tell their story ernst zander was a youngster when he was captured by the soviets after the war .
after doing time at a prison at jamlitz , he was sent on to buchenwald .
the nazis had used the site as a concentration camp , where an estimated 50,000 people were executed , starved or worked to death .
after world war ii , the soviets used the same facility for one of their biggest internment camps . zander ended up there , because the russians accused him of being a " wehrwolf " - the standard term back then for a german who tried to fight soviet tanks and machinery as the red army advanced toward berlin in the final stages of the war .
he denies these allegations , saying that he was imprisoned for no crime at all .
he says the conditions he and other prisoners faced at the buchenwald camp were harsh .
" our family did not know we were being held in the camp .
we could not write to anyone .
we were so alone , " zander told deutsche welle .
the director of the buchenwald memorial site foundation , volkhard knigge , hastens to add that all the war-time allies had their own internment camps in germany , emphasizing that of course the soviets too had the right to have such camps after all the cruelty they 'd experienced at the hands of nazi germany .
but he points out that the soviet internment camps differed from those of the western allies .
" buchenwald in particular was a 100 percent stalinist camp between 1945 and its closure in 1950 , " knigge said .
" inmates had no right to complain to anyone .
there was no examination of the facts to establish personal guilt , no case-by-case investigations . "

some of the inmates were sent on to soviet gulags such as the one at workuta .
others were sentenced to long prison terms after show trials .
others were freed .
" many youngsters were able to start a normal life again , " said knigge .
" but what was difficult for them all was that they could n't openly speak about their experiences in the camps , as east german leaders kept sweeping the issue under the carpet . "
renate zander , the wife of former buchenwald inmate ernst zander , says that even now , the fate of the former detainees is not well known among the general german population .
" teachers here usually do n't want to talk about the events after 1945 , " she said .
" we have seven grandchildren , and they say that they only hear about the holocaust period when talking about the history of the camps at buchenwald and elsewhere .
nobody asks about the later events , because they 're not in the teachers ' minds . "
she also said that she sees little hope that this will be added to school curriculums anytime soon .

the director of the buchenwald memorial site foundation , volkhard knigge , hastens to add that all the war-time allies had their own internment camps in germany , emphasizing that of course the soviets too had the right to have such camps after all the cruelty they 'd experienced at the hands of nazi germany .
but he points out that the soviet internment camps differed from those of the western allies .
" buchenwald in particular was a 100 percent stalinist camp between 1945 and its closure in 1950 , " knigge said .
" inmates had no right to complain to anyone .
there was no examination of the facts to establish personal guilt , no case-by-case investigations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a section of the sachsenhausen museum is devoted to soviet special camp no. 7 out of the fire - into the frying pan the last three camps - buchenwald , sachsenhausen and bautzen - were only closed as soviet internment centers in 1950 , several months after the founding of the communist german democratic republic .
some of the inmates were sent on to soviet gulags such as the one at workuta .
others were sentenced to long prison terms after show trials .
others were freed .
" many youngsters were able to start a normal life again , " said knigge .
" but what was difficult for them all was that they could n't openly speak about their experiences in the camps , as east german leaders kept sweeping the issue under the carpet . "
renate zander , the wife of former buchenwald inmate ernst zander , says that even now , the fate of the former detainees is not well known among the general german population .
" teachers here usually do n't want to talk about the events after 1945 , " she said .
" we have seven grandchildren , and they say that they only hear about the holocaust period when talking about the history of the camps at buchenwald and elsewhere .
nobody asks about the later events , because they 're not in the teachers ' minds . "
she also said that she sees little hope that this will be added to school curriculums anytime soon .

now , with debt mounting , an economic comeback in 2010 appears increasingly unlikely as the celtic tiger struggles to avoid the fate of greece . the economy of the republic of ireland , until the early 1990s , was rooted firmly in agriculture , largely relying on traditional , farm-based businesses .
but in 1994 , ireland began to experience economic growth that would transform one of europe 's poorest nations into one of its richest .
starting that year , ireland used its educated and under utilized english-speaking workforce , state policies that attracted large american corporations eager to make inroads into the european union market , tolerance towards low-skilled immigrant workers and generous corporate tax benefits to fuel expansive economic growth .
property prices soared as wages increased .
personal and public debt levels decreased dramatically .
the ' celtic tiger ' , as ireland came to be known , became a knowledge-based economy .
the 2007 global downturn ended ireland 's positive run , and the crisis of 2008 sent the country into an economic tailspin .
the government could no longer continue wage increases necessary for workers to pay high home prices , leading to widespread mortgage defaults .
ireland 's housing losses were devastating ; its real estate bubble had grown much faster than that in the rest of europe .
debt levels , at historical lows in 2006 , returned to unmanageable levels .
many of the gains made during the celtic tiger 's boom period have been lost in the last three years .
it could take decades to restore them . bildunterschrift : ireland 's construction sector collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis 2010 forecasts discouraging few economists believe ireland will recover this year .
an official forecast released by the irish government last month predicted an average unemployment rate of 13.2 percent in 2010 . the latest quarterly report from dublin-based economic and social research institute -lrb- esri -rrb- estimates an average jobless rate of 13.75 percent this year .
although much higher than european average , this is a significant downward revision from the institute 's spring 2009 forecast , which put unemployment at almost 17 percent by the end of 2010 .
like greece , spain and portugal , ireland 's biggest problem is debt .
tax revenue declines of 20 percent last year have left ireland operating 25 billion euros over budget this year .
meanwhile , homeowners still are forced to pay expensive mortgages on property which has lost significant value .
home prices fell nearly 20 percent last year , according to esri , and are down more than 30 percent since 2007 .
" it is just tragic when you look at the reversal in debt levels , " erik jones , a professor of european studies at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they worked so hard for so long just to be back where they were -lrb- when the economic revival began in the 1990s -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising debt levels have triggered protests in ireland the road forward the european union is not expected to allow ireland 's fiscal problems to become unmanageable .
the european commission last week made clear that while current action would be limited , greece would not be allowed to fail .
the same promise applies to ireland .
the irish government has helped itself by acting with more fiscal discipline than its greek counterpart .
dublin has made sizeable spending cuts in this year 's budget , and public workers , from low level bureaucrats to top public officials , are expected to earn less this year .
philip lane , a professor of international microeconomics at trinity college dublin attributed ireland 's ability to make difficult cuts to the nature of the irish crisis .
" ireland is feeling the pinch because of the burst of the real estate bubble , " he said .
" greece , meanwhile , has chronically overspent for years . "
" we made the cutbacks in ireland because we knew that wages were growing too quickly , that wages were too high , " lane told deutsche welle .
" we knew we needed to get sensible again . "
lane says that once the crisis passes , ireland should revert to the practices that made the early part of the celtic tiger years successful .
" the real celtic tiger was driven by an export boom .
we got diverted by a domestic construction bubble , " he said .
" we need to get back to international business . "

not so - in fact , they flourish . it took ruud van nistelrooy just 10 minutes on saturday to make the kind of impact hamburg were hoping for from the dutch striker when they bought him from real madrid in the january transfer window .
the former manchester united star came on as a second half substitute in hamburg 's game against stuttgart and with the score at 1-1 , van nistelrooy struck in the 75th and 77th minutes to seal a 3-1 victory for his new team . the imposing dutch forward was supposed to be a spent force when hamburg rescued him from an increasingly frustrating spell with spanish giants real .
despite winning two league titles with madrid in his three-and-a-half seasons with them , and scoring 46 goals in 68 appearances for los blancos , the latest galacticos policy at the santiago bernabeu left van nistelrooy out in the cold and surplus to requirements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy showed he 's far from a washed-up has-been " depending on how he 's used , ruud can still be a sensation and will do very well in the bundesliga if he 's used smartly and is allowed his rest , " said jan roskott , dutch soccer correspondent for the offside.com . " his biggest strength - in my view - is his focus and his mental strength .
he 's a real killer .
the thing with ruud is , his scoring ratio is high .
hamburg play offensive football , so if ruud gets four chances to score , he 'll convert at least one of those chances .
he 's also a real team player and he allows others to play better .
i 'm not sure if he has 40 games or more in him , though , but if he remains fit , he could well have another good three years in him . " bundesliga helps robben rediscover frightening flair another dutchman who was frozen out at real madrid only to find a warmer welcome in germany is arjen robben .
the dutch winger struck again at the weekend in bayern 's 3-1 victory over borussia dortmund to bring his season total for bayern munich to eight goals in 14 games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben is a player reborn at bayern munich this season robben has been a player transformed in the bundesliga since arriving last summer .
he performed fitfully at real and rarely produced the kind of displays which convinced madrid to pay chelsea 25 million euros -lrb- $ 34 million -rrb- for his services in 2007 .
the former psv eindhoven flyer scared the living daylights out of english defenses in his three seasons in west london and the speed , directness and hunger for goals which punctuated his chelsea career seem to have been rediscovered at bayern . " dutch players have the benefit of being very familiar with german football , german culture and the german language , " said kai de graff from dutch soccer fanzine dagelijkse voetbal . " they fit in pretty seamlessly into the way of life which always makes the transition to a new club and league easier .
dutch players are very intelligent and have great knowledge of the game , which makes them adaptable .
although dutch football is a lot about finesse , they also thrive in physical leagues like germany .

the bundesliga is a league which gives such players space and time to be creative . " dutchmen flourish in their home from home this seamless integration into german soccer for dutch stars has seen a host of top players grace the bundesliga stage in recent years .
bayern fans will fondly remember the four seasons that roy makaay led the line , scoring 78 goals in 129 games for the bavarian giants and helping them to a number of titles . meanwhile , before the current crop of dutch stars at hamburg , hsv supporters may look back with misty eyes at the silky skills of rafael van der vaart , the obstinate defending of khalid boulahrouz -lrb- now at stuttgart -rrb- and the classy midfield marshalling of nigel de jong . players benefit despite lack of total football ethos in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch coach rinus michels developed total football the dutch became famous for developing and executing the concept of total football , a tactical approach in which any player who moves out of his position is replaced by another from his team .
with no player fixed in his nominal role ; anyone can be successively an attacker , a midfielder and a defender thus retaining the team 's intended organizational structure . while german teams find strength in the rigidity of roles within their tactical structures , this does n't seem to stifle dutch stars .
in fact they tend to excel by using their individual talents in their preferred role . jan roskett believes the dutch prosper mainly because of their desire to win and play good , attractive soccer .
systems and formations are just a means to an end . " for decades , the dutch school - ball possession , dominance , attacks via creative wingers , full backs pushing up , players taking over other positions - was synonymous with a 4-3-3 formation , " said roskott . " but a line-up system is just a series of numbers and does n't say anything about the intent .
the dutch school normally means : playing dominantly and determining the play .
this was how we played football for years .
the ultimate proof of a successful system is results .
the dutch are happy if they can get the result with good football , attractive attacking pass-and-move play which results in prizes - which is what the dutch school was all about anyway .

not so - in fact , they flourish . it took ruud van nistelrooy just 10 minutes on saturday to make the kind of impact hamburg were hoping for from the dutch striker when they bought him from real madrid in the january transfer window .
the former manchester united star came on as a second half substitute in hamburg 's game against stuttgart and with the score at 1-1 , van nistelrooy struck in the 75th and 77th minutes to seal a 3-1 victory for his new team . the imposing dutch forward was supposed to be a spent force when hamburg rescued him from an increasingly frustrating spell with spanish giants real .
despite winning two league titles with madrid in his three-and-a-half seasons with them , and scoring 46 goals in 68 appearances for los blancos , the latest galacticos policy at the santiago bernabeu left van nistelrooy out in the cold and surplus to requirements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy showed he 's far from a washed-up has-been " depending on how he 's used , ruud can still be a sensation and will do very well in the bundesliga if he 's used smartly and is allowed his rest , " said jan roskott , dutch soccer correspondent for the offside.com . " his biggest strength - in my view - is his focus and his mental strength .
he 's a real killer .
the thing with ruud is , his scoring ratio is high .
hamburg play offensive football , so if ruud gets four chances to score , he 'll convert at least one of those chances .
he 's also a real team player and he allows others to play better .
i 'm not sure if he has 40 games or more in him , though , but if he remains fit , he could well have another good three years in him . " bundesliga helps robben rediscover frightening flair another dutchman who was frozen out at real madrid only to find a warmer welcome in germany is arjen robben .
the dutch winger struck again at the weekend in bayern 's 3-1 victory over borussia dortmund to bring his season total for bayern munich to eight goals in 14 games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben is a player reborn at bayern munich this season robben has been a player transformed in the bundesliga since arriving last summer .
he performed fitfully at real and rarely produced the kind of displays which convinced madrid to pay chelsea 25 million euros -lrb- $ 34 million -rrb- for his services in 2007 .
the former psv eindhoven flyer scared the living daylights out of english defenses in his three seasons in west london and the speed , directness and hunger for goals which punctuated his chelsea career seem to have been rediscovered at bayern . " dutch players have the benefit of being very familiar with german football , german culture and the german language , " said kai de graff from dutch soccer fanzine dagelijkse voetbal . " they fit in pretty seamlessly into the way of life which always makes the transition to a new club and league easier .
dutch players are very intelligent and have great knowledge of the game , which makes them adaptable .
although dutch football is a lot about finesse , they also thrive in physical leagues like germany .
i think they 're also quite technically gifted and when allowed to play can show great skill .
the bundesliga is a league which gives such players space and time to be creative . " dutchmen flourish in their home from home this seamless integration into german soccer for dutch stars has seen a host of top players grace the bundesliga stage in recent years .

from here it is 2,840km to the sea .
green groups have welcomed a program to clean up and protect europe 's second-largest and much-hymned river , the danube .
but activists have also urged more action to preserve what they see as a " backbone of biodiversity . " environmentalists have warned that pressure to build new hydroelectric plants and to make the river more navigable for shipping continue to threaten the danube , which runs a staggering 2,860 kilometers from germany 's black forest to the black sea in romania .
additional water regulation measures threaten the dynamism of the river - one of the danube 's most-prized qualities , according to georg kestel , danube expert of the german arm of friends of the earth , bund .
bildunterschrift : this is close to where the danube ends - by lake razim in romania " what makes this river really special is that it crosses through such a great variety of landscapes in its journey from west to east .

" the danube waters are shared by us all and therefore we also share the responsibility , " said mitja bricelj , president of the international commission for the protection of the danube river -lrb- icpdr -rrb- who hosted the meeting on tuesday -lrb- february 16 -rrb- in vienna .
" we meet to ensure that the resources of the danube basin are managed in an environmentally sustainable manner , " bricelj added . the plan includes a series of measures to be implemented by 2015 , including concrete efforts to reduce pollution and minimize the negative effects of man-made changes to the world 's most international river .
the re-naturalization of wetlands , the creation of natural flood barriers and the upgrading of dykes are also part of the program . more sustainable shipping bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist as well as freight ships frequent the danube environmental groups , such as bund and the world wildlife fund , generally welcomed the plan , but they also took the opportunity to present a petition with 100,000 signatures calling for greener and more sustainable shipping projects . in particular , green groups are campaigning against river regulation work in the upper danube between straubing and vilshofen in germany .
the planned construction of a dam and a canal would destroy the last significant free-flowing section of the river in germany .
" overall , we welcome it , but we do see some critical points , " said irene lucius , senioor policy coordinator of the wwf 's danube-carpathian program told afp news agency .

however , he urged an eu-wide ban to make this effective .
although 10 member countries directly border the danube and there several more in its catchment area , international cooperation appears to be working well .

whereas in eastern europe the pollution of the river mainly stems from excessive levels of inadequately treated municipal sewage .
in the west , agriculture is the main culprit .
and whereas many free-flowing sections and water meadows have been lost in western europe , many remain intact further to the east .
for kestel , it is essential that the danube 's dynamic character is retained .

the problem is that there are number of projects hanging over the danube that would ruin its quality . "

the move by tripoli was believed to have been caused by a spat with switzerland . the european commission , the eu 's executive body , has criticized libya 's decision to suspend issuing visas to citizens from the bloc 's schengen area as " unilateral and disproportionate . "
" the commission also regrets that travelers who legally obtained visas before the suspension measure were refused entry when arriving in libya , " said eu commissioner for home affairs cecilia malmstrom .
she added that eu and schengen countries would discuss the matter this week to " consider the appropriate reaction . "
a spokesman for the german foreign ministry said the decision by libya was " regrettable , " adding that the government expected the suspension to be cancelled .
tense ties the move by tripoli appears to be in response to an announcement by swiss authorities on sunday that 188 libyans , including leader moammar gadhafi and his family , are banned from visiting switzerland .
while switzerland is not a member of the eu , it is one of the 25 european countries in the border-free schengen area .
citizens of great britain , ireland , cyprus , bulgaria and romania , which are eu members but not in the schengen zone , were exempt from the decision .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gaddafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .
that event led to libya halting oil exports to switzerland and withdrawing some $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- in assets from swiss banks .

joerg asmussen , germany 's deputy finance minister , advised greece to follow the lead of ireland and latvia , eu countries which are slashing spending in an effort to rein in their financial troubles .
" we made it clear the ball is in greece 's court , " asmussen said .
" additional measures by greece are needed . "
a statement issued by the ministers after the meeting said although greece has until march 16 to prove it has taken initial steps towards reducing its budgetary deficit by four percent , they will likely demand more budget cuts or tax hikes to prevent wider financial troubles .
the four percent reduction is the first step in a plan to eventually reduce the deficit from 12.7 percent of gdp to less than three percent in 2012 .
" the pressure on greece to consider further measures by march 16 has clearly increased , " said austrian finance minister josef proell .
the euro-zone ministers did not elaborate on earlier talk of specific monetary aid , instead reaffirming thursday 's pledge to support greece if things got out of control .

the four percent reduction is the first step in a plan to eventually reduce the deficit from 12.7 percent of gdp to less than three percent in 2012 .
" the pressure on greece to consider further measures by march 16 has clearly increased , " said austrian finance minister josef proell .
the euro-zone ministers did not elaborate on earlier talk of specific monetary aid , instead reaffirming thursday 's pledge to support greece if things got out of control .

" but this debate is not yet on . "
greek finance minister george papaconstantinou told reporters after the meeting that the country is already ahead of its deficit reduction goals , adding that a one-off tax on large companies had resulted in a january surplus .
papaconstantinou , who warned on monday that his government would need more than a day to turn things around , said the pledge of support should act as a deterrent if financial markets increased the pressure on greece or other euro zone countries .

the move by tripoli was believed to have been caused by a spat with switzerland . the european commission , the eu 's executive body , has criticized libya 's decision to suspend issuing visas to citizens from the bloc 's schengen area as " unilateral and disproportionate . "
" the commission also regrets that travelers who legally obtained visas before the suspension measure were refused entry when arriving in libya , " said eu commissioner for home affairs cecilia malmstrom .
she added that eu and schengen countries would discuss the matter this week to " consider the appropriate reaction . "
a spokesman for the german foreign ministry said the decision by libya was " regrettable , " adding that the government expected the suspension to be cancelled .
tense ties the move by tripoli appears to be in response to an announcement by swiss authorities on sunday that 188 libyans , including leader moammar gadhafi and his family , are banned from visiting switzerland .
while switzerland is not a member of the eu , it is one of the 25 european countries in the border-free schengen area .
citizens of great britain , ireland , cyprus , bulgaria and romania , which are eu members but not in the schengen zone , were exempt from the decision .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gaddafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .
that event led to libya halting oil exports to switzerland and withdrawing some $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- in assets from swiss banks .
the quarrel threatens to complicate business ties between libya and the eu .

juncker said the additional plan should focus on expenditure cuts and revenue-increasing measures .
athens has pledged to reduce its deficit , which was 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2009 , by four percentage points in 2010 .
greece hopes to reduce this further by 2012 to 3 percent - and thus come within the official maximum limit for countries using the euro .
large demands greek finance minister george papaconstantinou defended his country 's efforts to slash the deficit by 2012 .
he also defended the use of " derivated contracts , " used in the past to borrow money without increasing official debt levels , saying they were legal at the time of their use .
critics have said the measures hid the full extent of the country 's financial situation from brussels .
papaconstantinou said that although greece is willing to undertake additional fiscal measures to tackle its debt , urging the country to do more before its report in march is asking for too much .
" we 're trying to change the course of the titanic , it can not be done in a day , " he told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders say they are ready to take action to ensure financial stability papaconstantinou also suggested ministers of euro-zone countries should work on putting substance behind the pledges of support they made last week .
eu leaders did not specify how much they would help , but said they are ready to take " determined and coordinated " action to ensure financial stability in the euro zone if necessary .
the details of the plans are being withheld from the public by greece 's euro-zone partners , as representatives agreed it would be " unwise " to reveal possible measures .

the eu has joined the row on the swiss side but some countries may jump ship if trade ties with tripoli are threatened . on sunday , libya took the decision to stop issuing visas to citizens of the eu schengen free-travel zone - of which non-eu member switzerland is a signatory - escalating the spat caused by switzerland 's travel ban handed out to one of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's sons . the libyan leader 's son hannibal and his spouse joined 186 other libyan figures barred from visiting switzerland after an incident in july 2008 when two hotel servants in geneva complained hannibal had mistreated them . after hannibal and his pregnant wife aline were arrested in geneva , libya cut oil supplies to switzerland and withdrew more than $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.6 billlion euros -rrb- dollars in assets from swiss banks . libya then prevented two swiss businessmen from leaving the country , and subsequently tried them on visa violations . the row flared up again in november last year when switzerland asked the 25 schengen signatories to restrict visas to libyan passport holders . following that request , libyan prime minister baghadadi al-mahmoudi and other senior officials were denied schengen visas , a refusal that libya 's deputy prime minister khalid kaim blamed on the swiss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the libyan leader took his cash out of switzerland last year last week , a tripoli appeals court reduced an earlier , 16-month prison sentence against max goldi , one of the two swiss businessmen held in libya on visa violations , after a court on february 7 acquitted fellow swiss citizen rachid al-hamdani on the same charges . swiss trauma but the row erupted again at the weekend with libya taking steps which not only punish swiss citizens but those from switzerland 's fellow schengen area signatories . isabelle werenfels , senior associate at the middle east and africa research division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that the whole affair , from the start in 2008 to this week 's developments , has been traumatizing for the swiss . " the libyans have made it very hard for the swiss to get out of libya and it has felt at times like they were hostages there , " she said .
" the airlines are still not allowed to fly out of libya .
many people say that the libya situation is actually at the heart of the swiss attitude towards minarets and muslims .
it has been a very difficult time for switzerland . " while the libyan government has not publicly confirmed the reports , or given a public reason for the decision to ban entry to schengen area citizens , the country 's private daily newspaper oea , which is close to gadhafi 's family , carried the story , quoting a " high-ranking " unidentified official who mentioned both the arrest of hannibal gadhafi and the swiss ban on 188 libyan citizens . schengen countries suffer as libya punishes swiss the italian foreign ministry confirmed the ban on its web site soon after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss banned 188 libyans from crossing its borders " libyan authorities have confirmed the suspension of all types of visas for citizens of schengen states .
in addition , they have specified that citizens from schengen states will be denied entry into libya even if they are in possession of a visa , of whatever duration or type , " a statement on its web site read . the passport-free schengen zone comprises 25 nations , including switzerland , iceland , norway and most european union members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania . werenfels said that predicting the effects of the visa ban would be difficult as libya seemed to be employing an arbitrary ban at the moment .
" libya seems to be targeting high-level business people from europe but we 'll see how long that lasts , " she said .
" this would be damaging for libya too .
it remains to be seen if they ban anyone who works for the petrochemical industry , which is very important to libya .
chances are , in two or three days , gadhafi may find a way out of this while saving face . " strong words from eu but little chance of strong action meanwhile , the european commission declared the libyan decision as being " unilateral and disproportionate . " " the commission also regrets that travellers who legally obtained visas before the suspension measure were refused entry when arriving in libya " , said eu commissioner for home affairs , cecilia malmstrom . she added that the commission is set to discuss the issue " before the end of the week " with schengen countries , with a view to " consider the appropriate reaction . " experts believe that the eu 's show of unity towards switzerland will evaporate when important trade and business relations are put at risk by any further escalation on an eu-wide scale . " it is very important for the eu to speak with one voice .
the eu should use the tools that it has , " sawsan chebli , an associate fellow with the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the eu is libya ’ s greatest trade and export partner .
this is a leverage the eu could use .
however , italy and other eu member states with close relations with libya in the past have shown that they are not interested to spoil their relations with libya whatever gadhafi ’ s action may be .
that is not likely to change .
and the problem is that gadhafi knows that he is able to divide the eu . " italians urge swiss to resolve crisis and leave eu out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini told switzerland to leave europe out its row with libya chebli 's opinion was reinforced by a statement from italy which criticized switzerland and urged the swiss to sort out their differences with the north african country and its leadership . switzerland must " resolve this bi-lateral issue ... but not at the expense of everyone else , " italian foreign minister franco frattini said in a television interview , adding that he had stressed to bern the " sensitivity " of the situation . sawsan chebli believes that italy 's attitude highlights a disregard for european solidarity when business ties - which are strong between italy and libya - are concerned . " the italians care very little about the eu or other states when it comes to business relations , " she said . " solidarity is an unknown word in this regard .
frattini was very clear .
he accused switzerland of misusing the schengen agreement to exert pressure on gadhafi and said that bern would take its members ' hostage ' .

the eu has joined the row on the swiss side but some countries may jump ship if trade ties with tripoli are threatened . on sunday , libya took the decision to stop issuing visas to citizens of the eu schengen free-travel zone - of which non-eu member switzerland is a signatory - escalating the spat caused by switzerland 's travel ban handed out to one of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's sons . the libyan leader 's son hannibal and his spouse joined 186 other libyan figures barred from visiting switzerland after an incident in july 2008 when two hotel servants in geneva complained hannibal had mistreated them . after hannibal and his pregnant wife aline were arrested in geneva , libya cut oil supplies to switzerland and withdrew more than $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.6 billlion euros -rrb- dollars in assets from swiss banks . libya then prevented two swiss businessmen from leaving the country , and subsequently tried them on visa violations . the row flared up again in november last year when switzerland asked the 25 schengen signatories to restrict visas to libyan passport holders . following that request , libyan prime minister baghadadi al-mahmoudi and other senior officials were denied schengen visas , a refusal that libya 's deputy prime minister khalid kaim blamed on the swiss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the libyan leader took his cash out of switzerland last year last week , a tripoli appeals court reduced an earlier , 16-month prison sentence against max goldi , one of the two swiss businessmen held in libya on visa violations , after a court on february 7 acquitted fellow swiss citizen rachid al-hamdani on the same charges . swiss trauma but the row erupted again at the weekend with libya taking steps which not only punish swiss citizens but those from switzerland 's fellow schengen area signatories . isabelle werenfels , senior associate at the middle east and africa research division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that the whole affair , from the start in 2008 to this week 's developments , has been traumatizing for the swiss .

it has been a very difficult time for switzerland . " while the libyan government has not publicly confirmed the reports , or given a public reason for the decision to ban entry to schengen area citizens , the country 's private daily newspaper oea , which is close to gadhafi 's family , carried the story , quoting a " high-ranking " unidentified official who mentioned both the arrest of hannibal gadhafi and the swiss ban on 188 libyan citizens . schengen countries suffer as libya punishes swiss the italian foreign ministry confirmed the ban on its web site soon after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss banned 188 libyans from crossing its borders " libyan authorities have confirmed the suspension of all types of visas for citizens of schengen states .
in addition , they have specified that citizens from schengen states will be denied entry into libya even if they are in possession of a visa , of whatever duration or type , " a statement on its web site read . the passport-free schengen zone comprises 25 nations , including switzerland , iceland , norway and most european union members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania . werenfels said that predicting the effects of the visa ban would be difficult as libya seemed to be employing an arbitrary ban at the moment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 16.02.2010 survivors , academics recall dark episode in germany 's postwar history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands died in postwar soviet internment camps former inmates of internment camps set up by the soviets following world war ii met with academics at buchenwald on saturday .
little was known about the soviet camps until after the fall of the east german regime . sixty years ago on monday , the last inmates were reported to have been released from the last of a total of 10 internment camps that the russians had set up in what was then the soviet zone of occupation in germany .
their existence had become a thorn in the side of the founding fathers of communist east germany , who were left to deal with requests from the inmates ' family members to tell them what had happened to the prisoners .
documents that became available only after german unification in 1990 indicate that up to 176,000 inmates were held in the soviets ' " special camps . "
thirty-five percent of the detainees are thought to have died there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst zander , here with his wife renate , is unable to forget some of those who survived the camp at buchenwald , which is now a memorial site , met with historians there on saturday to talk about their personal experiences and the latest scientific findings about the soviet camps .
eyewitnesses still able to tell their story ernst zander was a youngster when he was captured by the soviets after the war .
after doing time at a prison at jamlitz , he was sent on to buchenwald .
the nazis had used the site as a concentration camp , where an estimated 50,000 people were executed , starved or worked to death .
after world war ii , the soviets used the same facility for one of their biggest internment camps . zander ended up there , because the russians accused him of being a " wehrwolf " - the standard term back then for a german who tried to fight soviet tanks and machinery as the red army advanced toward berlin in the final stages of the war .
he denies these allegations , saying that he was imprisoned for no crime at all .
he says the conditions he and other prisoners faced at the buchenwald camp were harsh .
" our family did not know we were being held in the camp .
we could not write to anyone .
we were so alone , " zander told deutsche welle .
the director of the buchenwald memorial site foundation , volkhard knigge , hastens to add that all the war-time allies had their own internment camps in germany , emphasizing that of course the soviets too had the right to have such camps after all the cruelty they 'd experienced at the hands of nazi germany .

little was known about the soviet camps until after the fall of the east german regime . sixty years ago on monday , the last inmates were reported to have been released from the last of a total of 10 internment camps that the russians had set up in what was then the soviet zone of occupation in germany .
their existence had become a thorn in the side of the founding fathers of communist east germany , who were left to deal with requests from the inmates ' family members to tell them what had happened to the prisoners .
documents that became available only after german unification in 1990 indicate that up to 176,000 inmates were held in the soviets ' " special camps . "
thirty-five percent of the detainees are thought to have died there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst zander , here with his wife renate , is unable to forget some of those who survived the camp at buchenwald , which is now a memorial site , met with historians there on saturday to talk about their personal experiences and the latest scientific findings about the soviet camps .
eyewitnesses still able to tell their story ernst zander was a youngster when he was captured by the soviets after the war .
after doing time at a prison at jamlitz , he was sent on to buchenwald .
the nazis had used the site as a concentration camp , where an estimated 50,000 people were executed , starved or worked to death .
after world war ii , the soviets used the same facility for one of their biggest internment camps . zander ended up there , because the russians accused him of being a " wehrwolf " - the standard term back then for a german who tried to fight soviet tanks and machinery as the red army advanced toward berlin in the final stages of the war .
he denies these allegations , saying that he was imprisoned for no crime at all .
he says the conditions he and other prisoners faced at the buchenwald camp were harsh .
" our family did not know we were being held in the camp .
we could not write to anyone .
we were so alone , " zander told deutsche welle .
the director of the buchenwald memorial site foundation , volkhard knigge , hastens to add that all the war-time allies had their own internment camps in germany , emphasizing that of course the soviets too had the right to have such camps after all the cruelty they 'd experienced at the hands of nazi germany .
but he points out that the soviet internment camps differed from those of the western allies .
" buchenwald in particular was a 100 percent stalinist camp between 1945 and its closure in 1950 , " knigge said .
" inmates had no right to complain to anyone .
there was no examination of the facts to establish personal guilt , no case-by-case investigations . "

now , with debt mounting , an economic comeback in 2010 appears increasingly unlikely as the celtic tiger struggles to avoid the fate of greece . the economy of the republic of ireland , until the early 1990s , was rooted firmly in agriculture , largely relying on traditional , farm-based businesses .
but in 1994 , ireland began to experience economic growth that would transform one of europe 's poorest nations into one of its richest .
starting that year , ireland used its educated and under utilized english-speaking workforce , state policies that attracted large american corporations eager to make inroads into the european union market , tolerance towards low-skilled immigrant workers and generous corporate tax benefits to fuel expansive economic growth .
property prices soared as wages increased .
personal and public debt levels decreased dramatically .
the ' celtic tiger ' , as ireland came to be known , became a knowledge-based economy .
the 2007 global downturn ended ireland 's positive run , and the crisis of 2008 sent the country into an economic tailspin .
the government could no longer continue wage increases necessary for workers to pay high home prices , leading to widespread mortgage defaults .
ireland 's housing losses were devastating ; its real estate bubble had grown much faster than that in the rest of europe .
debt levels , at historical lows in 2006 , returned to unmanageable levels .
many of the gains made during the celtic tiger 's boom period have been lost in the last three years .
it could take decades to restore them . bildunterschrift : ireland 's construction sector collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis 2010 forecasts discouraging few economists believe ireland will recover this year .
an official forecast released by the irish government last month predicted an average unemployment rate of 13.2 percent in 2010 . the latest quarterly report from dublin-based economic and social research institute -lrb- esri -rrb- estimates an average jobless rate of 13.75 percent this year .
although much higher than european average , this is a significant downward revision from the institute 's spring 2009 forecast , which put unemployment at almost 17 percent by the end of 2010 .
like greece , spain and portugal , ireland 's biggest problem is debt .
tax revenue declines of 20 percent last year have left ireland operating 25 billion euros over budget this year .
meanwhile , homeowners still are forced to pay expensive mortgages on property which has lost significant value .
home prices fell nearly 20 percent last year , according to esri , and are down more than 30 percent since 2007 .
" it is just tragic when you look at the reversal in debt levels , " erik jones , a professor of european studies at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they worked so hard for so long just to be back where they were -lrb- when the economic revival began in the 1990s -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising debt levels have triggered protests in ireland the road forward the european union is not expected to allow ireland 's fiscal problems to become unmanageable .
the european commission last week made clear that while current action would be limited , greece would not be allowed to fail .
the same promise applies to ireland .
the irish government has helped itself by acting with more fiscal discipline than its greek counterpart .
dublin has made sizeable spending cuts in this year 's budget , and public workers , from low level bureaucrats to top public officials , are expected to earn less this year .
philip lane , a professor of international microeconomics at trinity college dublin attributed ireland 's ability to make difficult cuts to the nature of the irish crisis .
" ireland is feeling the pinch because of the burst of the real estate bubble , " he said .
" greece , meanwhile , has chronically overspent for years . "
" we made the cutbacks in ireland because we knew that wages were growing too quickly , that wages were too high , " lane told deutsche welle .
" we knew we needed to get sensible again . "
lane says that once the crisis passes , ireland should revert to the practices that made the early part of the celtic tiger years successful .
" the real celtic tiger was driven by an export boom .
we got diverted by a domestic construction bubble , " he said .
" we need to get back to international business . "

the eu offered its support , but no firm commitments on specific aid . at a european union meeting in brussels , finance ministers from germany , sweden and austria told greece it needs to do more to bring its runaway debt under control and calm worried financial markets .
joerg asmussen , germany 's deputy finance minister , advised greece to follow the lead of ireland and latvia , eu countries which are slashing spending in an effort to rein in their financial troubles .
" we made it clear the ball is in greece 's court , " asmussen said .
" additional measures by greece are needed . "
a statement issued by the ministers after the meeting said although greece has until march 16 to prove it has taken initial steps towards reducing its budgetary deficit by four percent , they will likely demand more budget cuts or tax hikes to prevent wider financial troubles .
the four percent reduction is the first step in a plan to eventually reduce the deficit from 12.7 percent of gdp to less than three percent in 2012 .
" the pressure on greece to consider further measures by march 16 has clearly increased , " said austrian finance minister josef proell .
the euro-zone ministers did not elaborate on earlier talk of specific monetary aid , instead reaffirming thursday 's pledge to support greece if things got out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet joined the finance ministers in brussels no firm commitments " germany , france and others - there -lsb- would -rsb- be a group of countries who can give this money to greece to stabilize the country and also the euro zone , " said proell in an interview with reuters television .
" but this debate is not yet on . "
greek finance minister george papaconstantinou told reporters after the meeting that the country is already ahead of its deficit reduction goals , adding that a one-off tax on large companies had resulted in a january surplus .
papaconstantinou , who warned on monday that his government would need more than a day to turn things around , said the pledge of support should act as a deterrent if financial markets increased the pressure on greece or other euro zone countries .
" today it is greece , tomorrow it could be another country , " he said .
greece 's mounting debts have tarnished the euro and increased bond yields , making debt servicing much more difficult .
the country has two sets of sovereign debt of more than eight billion euros each which it is to refinance in april and may .
extra interest required by investors for holding greek debt , compared to german bonds , increased to 3.35 percent on tuesday , its highest level in a week , before dropping back down to below 3.20. cmk / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu offered its support , but no firm commitments on specific aid . at a european union meeting in brussels , finance ministers from germany , sweden and austria told greece it needs to do more to bring its runaway debt under control and calm worried financial markets .
joerg asmussen , germany 's deputy finance minister , advised greece to follow the lead of ireland and latvia , eu countries which are slashing spending in an effort to rein in their financial troubles .
" we made it clear the ball is in greece 's court , " asmussen said .
" additional measures by greece are needed . "
a statement issued by the ministers after the meeting said although greece has until march 16 to prove it has taken initial steps towards reducing its budgetary deficit by four percent , they will likely demand more budget cuts or tax hikes to prevent wider financial troubles .
the four percent reduction is the first step in a plan to eventually reduce the deficit from 12.7 percent of gdp to less than three percent in 2012 .
" the pressure on greece to consider further measures by march 16 has clearly increased , " said austrian finance minister josef proell .

a heterosexual couple in austria has vowed to go to the country 's highest court - to be granted a civil partnership introduced for gay couples .
they argue that current legislation is discriminatory . a heterosexual couple in austria is fighting for the right to enter into a registered civil partnership - introduced for homosexual couples in january 2010 .
under current law the couple will be denied that right - but they have vowed to take the case to the country 's constitutional court to overturn what they says is a discriminatory legislation .
austria introduced civil unions for gay couples on january 1 , affording them some of the rights enjoyed by their heterosexual counterparts .
the new legislation , passed after weeks of wrangling between the ruling social democrats and their conservative coalition partner in government , gives same-sex couples a status similar to traditional marriage but different in a number of respects .
for instance , there are less strict rules in the event of a divorce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the issue is equality - nothing but equality , ' the couple argues the heterosexual couple in question argues that this is a more modern form of union - which simply suits them better than a traditional marriage .
and if it 's offered to gay couples , why should n't it be an option for them as well ?
the issue at stake , they argue , is standing up against discrimination .
" everyone should have the same rights , and there should n't be different rules for different people , " the couple 's lawyer , helmut graupner , told deutsche welle .
" regardless of how many different forms of union a state provides to couples , all of those forms should be available for everyone and must not be restricted on the basis of race , class or sex or gender or other criteria , which are traditionally the very criteria for discrimination , " graupner said .
can you be ' a little bit equal ' ?
at the end of february , the couple plans to officially apply for a civil partnership - they expect this to be rejected , in which case they plan to take their case to the constitutional court .
their goal is to force the government to rework the legislation so that both traditional marriage and registered partnership will be open to any couple - gay or straight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay and lesbian activists say the different forms of union are discriminatory " the issue is equality - nothing but equality , " graupner said .
" you can not be ' a little bit equal . '
just like you ca n't be ' a little bit pregnant ' or ' a little bit dead . '
unless you 're entitled to the same kind of institutions and forms of law you 're not being treated equally and that 's discriminatory .
that 's what we are fighting against - we 're fighting for the rights of both heterosexuals and homosexuals . "
graupner is not only trying to help the heterosexual couple to get a ' gay ' marriage .
he 's also representing gay couples who want a traditional marriage - rather than the registered civil partnership that lawmakers have agreed on .
the current legislation provides same-sex couples with equal rights to heterosexuals with regards to pensions and alimony - but the law for instance continues to ban adoption .
it also does not allow civil partnership ceremonies at the civil registry office , where heterosexual couples can marry .
yet graupner is up against strong resistance .
the country 's conservative party - the austrian peoples party - only reluctantly agreed to the civil partnership in the first place .
the conservatives insists that significant differences between the two forms of union must remain .
the catholic church is not amused another powerful opponent to the law is the roman catholic church - after all , austria is predominantly catholic and the church is a force to be reckoned with .
the country 's clergy is opposed to the existing law , and certainly against any further liberalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the church ' different things need to be treated differently ' " the austrian bishops have made their position quite clear , " professor erich leitenberger , spokesman for the vienna diocese told deutsche welle .
" they strongly support the fact that the law does not put the civil partnership and a traditional marriage on an equal footing . "
" but the bishops have expressed concerns that the new law could be the beginning of a trend which eventually will lead to putting the civil partnership on the same footing as the traditional marriage between a man and a woman . "
leitenberger said that the legislation in place before january 1 was sufficient to safeguard the rights of gay and lesbian couples .
families , he argued , were shouldering the task of raising children and therefore could not be put on the same level with same-sex couples .
" the bishops stick to their position that a traditional marriage , a family raising children simply is something different from a homosexual couple - and therefore should also be treated differently . "
however , should the appeal to the constitutional court be successful , soon both of the two forms of union , could be open to any couple - a situation that would place austria at the forefront in terms of homosexual rights in europe .
the decision by the court is expected by the end of this year .

from here it is 2,840km to the sea .
green groups have welcomed a program to clean up and protect europe 's second-largest and much-hymned river , the danube .
but activists have also urged more action to preserve what they see as a " backbone of biodiversity . " environmentalists have warned that pressure to build new hydroelectric plants and to make the river more navigable for shipping continue to threaten the danube , which runs a staggering 2,860 kilometers from germany 's black forest to the black sea in romania .
additional water regulation measures threaten the dynamism of the river - one of the danube 's most-prized qualities , according to georg kestel , danube expert of the german arm of friends of the earth , bund .
bildunterschrift : this is close to where the danube ends - by lake razim in romania " what makes this river really special is that it crosses through such a great variety of landscapes in its journey from west to east .
it is a very important migratory route for numerous types of animals and plants .
the river is the backbone of biodiversity , " kestel told deutsche welle .
most international river bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : repeated flooding of the river has led to moves to restore flood plains environment ministers from 14 countries that either border the danube or belong to the river 's catchment area this week agreed to adopt a five-year plan to " improve the environmental condition of the danube and its tributaries " .
" the danube waters are shared by us all and therefore we also share the responsibility , " said mitja bricelj , president of the international commission for the protection of the danube river -lrb- icpdr -rrb- who hosted the meeting on tuesday -lrb- february 16 -rrb- in vienna .
" we meet to ensure that the resources of the danube basin are managed in an environmentally sustainable manner , " bricelj added . the plan includes a series of measures to be implemented by 2015 , including concrete efforts to reduce pollution and minimize the negative effects of man-made changes to the world 's most international river .
the re-naturalization of wetlands , the creation of natural flood barriers and the upgrading of dykes are also part of the program . more sustainable shipping bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist as well as freight ships frequent the danube environmental groups , such as bund and the world wildlife fund , generally welcomed the plan , but they also took the opportunity to present a petition with 100,000 signatures calling for greener and more sustainable shipping projects . in particular , green groups are campaigning against river regulation work in the upper danube between straubing and vilshofen in germany .
the planned construction of a dam and a canal would destroy the last significant free-flowing section of the river in germany .
" overall , we welcome it , but we do see some critical points , " said irene lucius , senioor policy coordinator of the wwf 's danube-carpathian program told afp news agency .
giving nature a helping hand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danube has a great symbolic significance in some countries bund expert georg kestel praised the moves to restore natural water meadows and to improve the continuity of the river by building fish ladders , for example , to allow their passage through dams and other man-made obstacles . kestel also backed the ministers ' call for the introduction of phosphate-free detergents - a problem in eastern europe .
however , he urged an eu-wide ban to make this effective .
although 10 member countries directly border the danube and there several more in its catchment area , international cooperation appears to be working well .
shared waters , different problems bildunterschrift : the danube delta in romania is a paradise for birds however , the river faces different problems in different places .
whereas in eastern europe the pollution of the river mainly stems from excessive levels of inadequately treated municipal sewage .
in the west , agriculture is the main culprit .
and whereas many free-flowing sections and water meadows have been lost in western europe , many remain intact further to the east .
for kestel , it is essential that the danube 's dynamic character is retained .
" the danube is classes better than the rhine .
shipping is very dominant there .
the problem is that there are number of projects hanging over the danube that would ruin its quality . "

greece 's financial woes started decades ago when the country was ruled by one socialist regime after another .
now experts warn that unless greece learns from its financial history , it is bound to repeat it . who would have imagined it ?
greece could soon be bankrupt and there are some speculations that athens will begin refusing payment on its obligations .
due to massive debt and doctored data , greece has lost the trust of both the european union and the financial markets .
and it 's not looking good for athens , despite an eu security net .
greece currently owes foreign banks more than $ 300 billion -lrb- 219.8 billion euros -rrb- , which equals 115 percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
their current debt amounts to more then 12.7 percent of their economic output .
but how did it get this far ?
spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "
repeating history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overspending led to greece 's current situation this is not new territory for greece .
back in the 1980 's and 1990 's the country faced similar financial difficulties .
back then the socialist governments solved the problem by devaluing the country 's former currency , the drachma .
that way they were able to shrink imports and raise exports .
but economic expert babi papadimitriou said this option became unavailable when greece entered into the euro zone . over the past few years the political elite and the greek government have not really grasped what it means to be a member of the euro zone , the economist said .
" it goes without saying that you have to reduce your deficit as much as possible when you share your currency with other countries , " he said .
" but those in power have ignored this principle .
and the necessary reforms were never imposed . "
the state acted irresponsibly as costs began to mount and the ability for the economy to compete on an international level was reduced .

greece 's financial woes started decades ago when the country was ruled by one socialist regime after another .
now experts warn that unless greece learns from its financial history , it is bound to repeat it . who would have imagined it ?
greece could soon be bankrupt and there are some speculations that athens will begin refusing payment on its obligations .
due to massive debt and doctored data , greece has lost the trust of both the european union and the financial markets .
and it 's not looking good for athens , despite an eu security net .
greece currently owes foreign banks more than $ 300 billion -lrb- 219.8 billion euros -rrb- , which equals 115 percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
their current debt amounts to more then 12.7 percent of their economic output .
but how did it get this far ?
spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "
repeating history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overspending led to greece 's current situation this is not new territory for greece .
back in the 1980 's and 1990 's the country faced similar financial difficulties .
back then the socialist governments solved the problem by devaluing the country 's former currency , the drachma .
that way they were able to shrink imports and raise exports .
but economic expert babi papadimitriou said this option became unavailable when greece entered into the euro zone . over the past few years the political elite and the greek government have not really grasped what it means to be a member of the euro zone , the economist said .
" it goes without saying that you have to reduce your deficit as much as possible when you share your currency with other countries , " he said .
" but those in power have ignored this principle .
and the necessary reforms were never imposed . "
the state acted irresponsibly as costs began to mount and the ability for the economy to compete on an international level was reduced .
when added to the global financial crisis that hit back in 2008 , these structural weak points became a full-blown nightmare .
cutting costs the country 's biggest problem is the state itself and the services it offers .

back in the 1980 's and 1990 's the country faced similar financial difficulties .
back then the socialist governments solved the problem by devaluing the country 's former currency , the drachma .
that way they were able to shrink imports and raise exports .
but economic expert babi papadimitriou said this option became unavailable when greece entered into the euro zone . over the past few years the political elite and the greek government have not really grasped what it means to be a member of the euro zone , the economist said .
" it goes without saying that you have to reduce your deficit as much as possible when you share your currency with other countries , " he said .
" but those in power have ignored this principle .
and the necessary reforms were never imposed . "

cutting costs the country 's biggest problem is the state itself and the services it offers .
according to professor paraskewopoulos , the largest share of savings could come from cutting the costs incurred by public employees : reducing tax exceptions , putting a hiring freeze on state offices and reducing employee salaries .
along with this , he said the government needs to tackle two other major hurdles : tax evasion and corruption . each year the greek government loses 20 billion euros in unpaid taxes , and it is estimated that the average greek family pays out some 1,600 euros annually in bribes .

" of course that 's easy to say , but to really do it , you have to be prepared to deal with the people affected . "
and that is exactly what papandreou 's government is facing at the moment .
the public sector has gone on strike and indignant farmers are blocking the motorways and border crossings .
however , both experts agree that unless they get rid of the subsidies and begin to privatize state agencies , cleaning up the financial mess will be impossible .

greece 's financial woes started decades ago when the country was ruled by one socialist regime after another .
now experts warn that unless greece learns from its financial history , it is bound to repeat it . who would have imagined it ?
greece could soon be bankrupt and there are some speculations that athens will begin refusing payment on its obligations .
due to massive debt and doctored data , greece has lost the trust of both the european union and the financial markets .
and it 's not looking good for athens , despite an eu security net .
greece currently owes foreign banks more than $ 300 billion -lrb- 219.8 billion euros -rrb- , which equals 115 percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
their current debt amounts to more then 12.7 percent of their economic output .
but how did it get this far ?
spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "

the move by tripoli was believed to have been caused by a spat with switzerland . the european commission , the eu 's executive body , has criticized libya 's decision to suspend issuing visas to citizens from the bloc 's schengen area as " unilateral and disproportionate . "
" the commission also regrets that travelers who legally obtained visas before the suspension measure were refused entry when arriving in libya , " said eu commissioner for home affairs cecilia malmstrom .

a spokesman for the german foreign ministry said the decision by libya was " regrettable , " adding that the government expected the suspension to be cancelled .

relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gaddafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .

the move by tripoli was believed to have been caused by a spat with switzerland . the european commission , the eu 's executive body , has criticized libya 's decision to suspend issuing visas to citizens from the bloc 's schengen area as " unilateral and disproportionate . "
" the commission also regrets that travelers who legally obtained visas before the suspension measure were refused entry when arriving in libya , " said eu commissioner for home affairs cecilia malmstrom .
she added that eu and schengen countries would discuss the matter this week to " consider the appropriate reaction . "
a spokesman for the german foreign ministry said the decision by libya was " regrettable , " adding that the government expected the suspension to be cancelled .
tense ties the move by tripoli appears to be in response to an announcement by swiss authorities on sunday that 188 libyans , including leader moammar gadhafi and his family , are banned from visiting switzerland .
while switzerland is not a member of the eu , it is one of the 25 european countries in the border-free schengen area .
citizens of great britain , ireland , cyprus , bulgaria and romania , which are eu members but not in the schengen zone , were exempt from the decision .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gaddafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .
that event led to libya halting oil exports to switzerland and withdrawing some $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- in assets from swiss banks .

little was known about the soviet camps until after the fall of the east german regime . sixty years ago on monday , the last inmates were reported to have been released from the last of a total of 10 internment camps that the russians had set up in what was then the soviet zone of occupation in germany .
their existence had become a thorn in the side of the founding fathers of communist east germany , who were left to deal with requests from the inmates ' family members to tell them what had happened to the prisoners .
documents that became available only after german unification in 1990 indicate that up to 176,000 inmates were held in the soviets ' " special camps . "
thirty-five percent of the detainees are thought to have died there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst zander , here with his wife renate , is unable to forget some of those who survived the camp at buchenwald , which is now a memorial site , met with historians there on saturday to talk about their personal experiences and the latest scientific findings about the soviet camps .
eyewitnesses still able to tell their story ernst zander was a youngster when he was captured by the soviets after the war .
after doing time at a prison at jamlitz , he was sent on to buchenwald .
the nazis had used the site as a concentration camp , where an estimated 50,000 people were executed , starved or worked to death .
after world war ii , the soviets used the same facility for one of their biggest internment camps . zander ended up there , because the russians accused him of being a " wehrwolf " - the standard term back then for a german who tried to fight soviet tanks and machinery as the red army advanced toward berlin in the final stages of the war .
he denies these allegations , saying that he was imprisoned for no crime at all .
he says the conditions he and other prisoners faced at the buchenwald camp were harsh .
" our family did not know we were being held in the camp .
we could not write to anyone .
we were so alone , " zander told deutsche welle .
the director of the buchenwald memorial site foundation , volkhard knigge , hastens to add that all the war-time allies had their own internment camps in germany , emphasizing that of course the soviets too had the right to have such camps after all the cruelty they 'd experienced at the hands of nazi germany .
but he points out that the soviet internment camps differed from those of the western allies .
" buchenwald in particular was a 100 percent stalinist camp between 1945 and its closure in 1950 , " knigge said .
" inmates had no right to complain to anyone .
there was no examination of the facts to establish personal guilt , no case-by-case investigations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a section of the sachsenhausen museum is devoted to soviet special camp no. 7 out of the fire - into the frying pan the last three camps - buchenwald , sachsenhausen and bautzen - were only closed as soviet internment centers in 1950 , several months after the founding of the communist german democratic republic .
some of the inmates were sent on to soviet gulags such as the one at workuta .
others were sentenced to long prison terms after show trials .
others were freed .
" many youngsters were able to start a normal life again , " said knigge .
" but what was difficult for them all was that they could n't openly speak about their experiences in the camps , as east german leaders kept sweeping the issue under the carpet . "
renate zander , the wife of former buchenwald inmate ernst zander , says that even now , the fate of the former detainees is not well known among the general german population .
" teachers here usually do n't want to talk about the events after 1945 , " she said .
" we have seven grandchildren , and they say that they only hear about the holocaust period when talking about the history of the camps at buchenwald and elsewhere .
nobody asks about the later events , because they 're not in the teachers ' minds . "
she also said that she sees little hope that this will be added to school curriculums anytime soon .

little was known about the soviet camps until after the fall of the east german regime . sixty years ago on monday , the last inmates were reported to have been released from the last of a total of 10 internment camps that the russians had set up in what was then the soviet zone of occupation in germany .
their existence had become a thorn in the side of the founding fathers of communist east germany , who were left to deal with requests from the inmates ' family members to tell them what had happened to the prisoners .
documents that became available only after german unification in 1990 indicate that up to 176,000 inmates were held in the soviets ' " special camps . "
thirty-five percent of the detainees are thought to have died there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst zander , here with his wife renate , is unable to forget some of those who survived the camp at buchenwald , which is now a memorial site , met with historians there on saturday to talk about their personal experiences and the latest scientific findings about the soviet camps .
eyewitnesses still able to tell their story ernst zander was a youngster when he was captured by the soviets after the war .
after doing time at a prison at jamlitz , he was sent on to buchenwald .
the nazis had used the site as a concentration camp , where an estimated 50,000 people were executed , starved or worked to death .
after world war ii , the soviets used the same facility for one of their biggest internment camps . zander ended up there , because the russians accused him of being a " wehrwolf " - the standard term back then for a german who tried to fight soviet tanks and machinery as the red army advanced toward berlin in the final stages of the war .
he denies these allegations , saying that he was imprisoned for no crime at all .
he says the conditions he and other prisoners faced at the buchenwald camp were harsh .
" our family did not know we were being held in the camp .
we could not write to anyone .
we were so alone , " zander told deutsche welle .
the director of the buchenwald memorial site foundation , volkhard knigge , hastens to add that all the war-time allies had their own internment camps in germany , emphasizing that of course the soviets too had the right to have such camps after all the cruelty they 'd experienced at the hands of nazi germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 16.02.2010 uk mulls ' green bonds ' to spur infrastructure investment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed bonds are meant to help fund the renewable energy industry britain is reportedly examining the idea of launching green bonds to boost the renewable energy sector amid cash flow snags .
but will they have the desired effect of easing funding bottlenecks ? the economic secretary to the uk 's finance ministry , ian pearson , said in an interview published in the financial times newspaper on monday that the government was considering introducing so-called “ green bonds ” to the public to help fund the renewable energy industry .
pearson said that he had asked officials to examine a proposal that would see national savings and investments - a treasury-based unit - issue the bonds for sustainable infrastructure projects .
debt by any other name … dr. martin weale , director of the national institute of economic and social research -lrb- niesr -rrb- , an independent london-based think tank , told deutsche welle that such a move would basically amount to government borrowing , regardless of what name it ’ s given .
“ if it ’ s something that makes people happier about lending to the government – assuming the government is issuing them – or if it makes it possible for the government to borrow more cheaply than would otherwise be the case , then it seems to be it ’ s a good idea , ” dr. weale said .
“ fundamentally , what matters is actually paying for spending that ’ s done , whether it ’ s a green idea or anything else , and if you finance it by borrowing , it doesn ’ t matter too much what you call it , ” he said , adding that investors would need to look at the likely yields of such bonds .
proponents of the green bonds are describing them as a new way to finance infrastructure projects at a time when the government is struggling to balance its books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. weale says emotive captions persuaded people to invest in wartime bonds however , dr. weale points out that it won ’ t actually reduce the amount of government borrowing .
“ when we look at how much the government is borrowing and whether it can afford it , people will take green bonds into account just as much as anything else , ” he said .
he draws an analogy between last century ’ s wartime borrowing in britain and the current trends .
“ in many ways it ’ s rather similar to something we saw in the twentieth century : we had defense bonds and we had war loans .
and those were names given to government debt to make it easier or persuade people to buy it , ” he explained .
long-term contracts planned the finance ministry ’ s ian pearson was also quoted as saying the government was looking to offer long-term support to wind energy and green waste companies .
" we are thinking of going direct to companies looking to establish energy from waste and wind farm projects and offering them long-term contracts that would both get the public sector a good deal on price but also get the projects off the ground , " he told the financial times .
" if they had , say , a 15-year contract to supply the public sector , that should make it easier for them to raise finance to get the projects going , while tying in with the green agenda , " pearson added .
experts like dr. weale agree that there ’ s an argument for such long-term contracts .
“ we know that at current prices many so-called green schemes are highly uneconomic .
and since the government doesn ’ t want to do the obvious thing , which is to impose a proper charge for carbon emissions , what they are proposing seems to me the next best , ” he conceded .
kfw as a model ?
also under consideration is the idea of establishing a state-run infrastructure bank to help fund energy and other infrastructure projects in the country .
some analysts have pointed to the enormous amount of investments needed for energy infrastructure not only in britain but across europe .
however , there are doubts about how such projects can be financed at a time when credit flow remains a problem as the global economy slowly recovers from recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infrastructure bank on the lines of germany 's kfw bank has been mooted as a means of mobilizing capital for such purposes , some analysts in the uk have suggested setting up an infrastructure bank on the lines of germany ’ s state-owned development bank kfw .
competition for private banks some analysts say the proposal could set off alarm bells for private sector banks .
however , dr. weale from the niesr disagrees .
“ i think private sector banks aren ’ t terribly worried about competition .
they ’ re very short of capital .
they are not wanting to lend - as far as one can tell .
and if they ’ re not wanting to lend , they shouldn ’ t be upset that other people are doing the lending instead , ” he said .
dr. weale says that if the private sector banks were to raise more capital , perhaps they could compete for that sort of business as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : europe without borders - 15 years of the schengen zone eu opens internal borders to long-stay visa holders , sparking security fears checkpoint-free europe confounds germany 's skeptics 15 years of visa-free travel in europe angered turkey demands visa-free travel to eu 's schengen area europe -pipe- 16.02.2010 europe 's unity with swiss in libya visa row tested by business links großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the high-profile arrest of hannibal ghadafi triggered a diplomatic crisis the spat between switzerland and libya over tit-for-tat visa bans has now spread across europe .
the eu has joined the row on the swiss side but some countries may jump ship if trade ties with tripoli are threatened . on sunday , libya took the decision to stop issuing visas to citizens of the eu schengen free-travel zone - of which non-eu member switzerland is a signatory - escalating the spat caused by switzerland 's travel ban handed out to one of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's sons . the libyan leader 's son hannibal and his spouse joined 186 other libyan figures barred from visiting switzerland after an incident in july 2008 when two hotel servants in geneva complained hannibal had mistreated them . after hannibal and his pregnant wife aline were arrested in geneva , libya cut oil supplies to switzerland and withdrew more than $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.6 billlion euros -rrb- dollars in assets from swiss banks . libya then prevented two swiss businessmen from leaving the country , and subsequently tried them on visa violations . the row flared up again in november last year when switzerland asked the 25 schengen signatories to restrict visas to libyan passport holders . following that request , libyan prime minister baghadadi al-mahmoudi and other senior officials were denied schengen visas , a refusal that libya 's deputy prime minister khalid kaim blamed on the swiss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the libyan leader took his cash out of switzerland last year last week , a tripoli appeals court reduced an earlier , 16-month prison sentence against max goldi , one of the two swiss businessmen held in libya on visa violations , after a court on february 7 acquitted fellow swiss citizen rachid al-hamdani on the same charges . swiss trauma but the row erupted again at the weekend with libya taking steps which not only punish swiss citizens but those from switzerland 's fellow schengen area signatories . isabelle werenfels , senior associate at the middle east and africa research division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that the whole affair , from the start in 2008 to this week 's developments , has been traumatizing for the swiss . " the libyans have made it very hard for the swiss to get out of libya and it has felt at times like they were hostages there , " she said .
" the airlines are still not allowed to fly out of libya .
many people say that the libya situation is actually at the heart of the swiss attitude towards minarets and muslims .
it has been a very difficult time for switzerland . " while the libyan government has not publicly confirmed the reports , or given a public reason for the decision to ban entry to schengen area citizens , the country 's private daily newspaper oea , which is close to gadhafi 's family , carried the story , quoting a " high-ranking " unidentified official who mentioned both the arrest of hannibal gadhafi and the swiss ban on 188 libyan citizens . schengen countries suffer as libya punishes swiss the italian foreign ministry confirmed the ban on its web site soon after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss banned 188 libyans from crossing its borders " libyan authorities have confirmed the suspension of all types of visas for citizens of schengen states .
in addition , they have specified that citizens from schengen states will be denied entry into libya even if they are in possession of a visa , of whatever duration or type , " a statement on its web site read . the passport-free schengen zone comprises 25 nations , including switzerland , iceland , norway and most european union members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania . werenfels said that predicting the effects of the visa ban would be difficult as libya seemed to be employing an arbitrary ban at the moment .
" libya seems to be targeting high-level business people from europe but we 'll see how long that lasts , " she said .
" this would be damaging for libya too .
it remains to be seen if they ban anyone who works for the petrochemical industry , which is very important to libya .
chances are , in two or three days , gadhafi may find a way out of this while saving face . " strong words from eu but little chance of strong action meanwhile , the european commission declared the libyan decision as being " unilateral and disproportionate . " " the commission also regrets that travellers who legally obtained visas before the suspension measure were refused entry when arriving in libya " , said eu commissioner for home affairs , cecilia malmstrom . she added that the commission is set to discuss the issue " before the end of the week " with schengen countries , with a view to " consider the appropriate reaction . " experts believe that the eu 's show of unity towards switzerland will evaporate when important trade and business relations are put at risk by any further escalation on an eu-wide scale . " it is very important for the eu to speak with one voice .
the eu should use the tools that it has , " sawsan chebli , an associate fellow with the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the eu is libya ’ s greatest trade and export partner .
this is a leverage the eu could use .
however , italy and other eu member states with close relations with libya in the past have shown that they are not interested to spoil their relations with libya whatever gadhafi ’ s action may be .
that is not likely to change .
and the problem is that gadhafi knows that he is able to divide the eu . " italians urge swiss to resolve crisis and leave eu out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini told switzerland to leave europe out its row with libya chebli 's opinion was reinforced by a statement from italy which criticized switzerland and urged the swiss to sort out their differences with the north african country and its leadership . switzerland must " resolve this bi-lateral issue ... but not at the expense of everyone else , " italian foreign minister franco frattini said in a television interview , adding that he had stressed to bern the " sensitivity " of the situation . sawsan chebli believes that italy 's attitude highlights a disregard for european solidarity when business ties - which are strong between italy and libya - are concerned . " the italians care very little about the eu or other states when it comes to business relations , " she said . " solidarity is an unknown word in this regard .
frattini was very clear .
he accused switzerland of misusing the schengen agreement to exert pressure on gadhafi and said that bern would take its members ' hostage ' .

the eu has joined the row on the swiss side but some countries may jump ship if trade ties with tripoli are threatened . on sunday , libya took the decision to stop issuing visas to citizens of the eu schengen free-travel zone - of which non-eu member switzerland is a signatory - escalating the spat caused by switzerland 's travel ban handed out to one of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's sons . the libyan leader 's son hannibal and his spouse joined 186 other libyan figures barred from visiting switzerland after an incident in july 2008 when two hotel servants in geneva complained hannibal had mistreated them . after hannibal and his pregnant wife aline were arrested in geneva , libya cut oil supplies to switzerland and withdrew more than $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.6 billlion euros -rrb- dollars in assets from swiss banks . libya then prevented two swiss businessmen from leaving the country , and subsequently tried them on visa violations . the row flared up again in november last year when switzerland asked the 25 schengen signatories to restrict visas to libyan passport holders . following that request , libyan prime minister baghadadi al-mahmoudi and other senior officials were denied schengen visas , a refusal that libya 's deputy prime minister khalid kaim blamed on the swiss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the libyan leader took his cash out of switzerland last year last week , a tripoli appeals court reduced an earlier , 16-month prison sentence against max goldi , one of the two swiss businessmen held in libya on visa violations , after a court on february 7 acquitted fellow swiss citizen rachid al-hamdani on the same charges . swiss trauma but the row erupted again at the weekend with libya taking steps which not only punish swiss citizens but those from switzerland 's fellow schengen area signatories . isabelle werenfels , senior associate at the middle east and africa research division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that the whole affair , from the start in 2008 to this week 's developments , has been traumatizing for the swiss . " the libyans have made it very hard for the swiss to get out of libya and it has felt at times like they were hostages there , " she said .
" the airlines are still not allowed to fly out of libya .
many people say that the libya situation is actually at the heart of the swiss attitude towards minarets and muslims .
it has been a very difficult time for switzerland . " while the libyan government has not publicly confirmed the reports , or given a public reason for the decision to ban entry to schengen area citizens , the country 's private daily newspaper oea , which is close to gadhafi 's family , carried the story , quoting a " high-ranking " unidentified official who mentioned both the arrest of hannibal gadhafi and the swiss ban on 188 libyan citizens . schengen countries suffer as libya punishes swiss the italian foreign ministry confirmed the ban on its web site soon after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss banned 188 libyans from crossing its borders " libyan authorities have confirmed the suspension of all types of visas for citizens of schengen states .
in addition , they have specified that citizens from schengen states will be denied entry into libya even if they are in possession of a visa , of whatever duration or type , " a statement on its web site read . the passport-free schengen zone comprises 25 nations , including switzerland , iceland , norway and most european union members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania . werenfels said that predicting the effects of the visa ban would be difficult as libya seemed to be employing an arbitrary ban at the moment .
" libya seems to be targeting high-level business people from europe but we 'll see how long that lasts , " she said .
" this would be damaging for libya too .
it remains to be seen if they ban anyone who works for the petrochemical industry , which is very important to libya .
chances are , in two or three days , gadhafi may find a way out of this while saving face . " strong words from eu but little chance of strong action meanwhile , the european commission declared the libyan decision as being " unilateral and disproportionate . " " the commission also regrets that travellers who legally obtained visas before the suspension measure were refused entry when arriving in libya " , said eu commissioner for home affairs , cecilia malmstrom . she added that the commission is set to discuss the issue " before the end of the week " with schengen countries , with a view to " consider the appropriate reaction . " experts believe that the eu 's show of unity towards switzerland will evaporate when important trade and business relations are put at risk by any further escalation on an eu-wide scale . " it is very important for the eu to speak with one voice .
the eu should use the tools that it has , " sawsan chebli , an associate fellow with the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the eu is libya ’ s greatest trade and export partner .
this is a leverage the eu could use .
however , italy and other eu member states with close relations with libya in the past have shown that they are not interested to spoil their relations with libya whatever gadhafi ’ s action may be .
that is not likely to change .
and the problem is that gadhafi knows that he is able to divide the eu .

" the italians care very little about the eu or other states when it comes to business relations , " she said . " solidarity is an unknown word in this regard .

the eu has joined the row on the swiss side but some countries may jump ship if trade ties with tripoli are threatened . on sunday , libya took the decision to stop issuing visas to citizens of the eu schengen free-travel zone - of which non-eu member switzerland is a signatory - escalating the spat caused by switzerland 's travel ban handed out to one of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's sons . the libyan leader 's son hannibal and his spouse joined 186 other libyan figures barred from visiting switzerland after an incident in july 2008 when two hotel servants in geneva complained hannibal had mistreated them . after hannibal and his pregnant wife aline were arrested in geneva , libya cut oil supplies to switzerland and withdrew more than $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.6 billlion euros -rrb- dollars in assets from swiss banks . libya then prevented two swiss businessmen from leaving the country , and subsequently tried them on visa violations . the row flared up again in november last year when switzerland asked the 25 schengen signatories to restrict visas to libyan passport holders . following that request , libyan prime minister baghadadi al-mahmoudi and other senior officials were denied schengen visas , a refusal that libya 's deputy prime minister khalid kaim blamed on the swiss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the libyan leader took his cash out of switzerland last year last week , a tripoli appeals court reduced an earlier , 16-month prison sentence against max goldi , one of the two swiss businessmen held in libya on visa violations , after a court on february 7 acquitted fellow swiss citizen rachid al-hamdani on the same charges . swiss trauma but the row erupted again at the weekend with libya taking steps which not only punish swiss citizens but those from switzerland 's fellow schengen area signatories . isabelle werenfels , senior associate at the middle east and africa research division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that the whole affair , from the start in 2008 to this week 's developments , has been traumatizing for the swiss . " the libyans have made it very hard for the swiss to get out of libya and it has felt at times like they were hostages there , " she said .
" the airlines are still not allowed to fly out of libya .
many people say that the libya situation is actually at the heart of the swiss attitude towards minarets and muslims .
it has been a very difficult time for switzerland . " while the libyan government has not publicly confirmed the reports , or given a public reason for the decision to ban entry to schengen area citizens , the country 's private daily newspaper oea , which is close to gadhafi 's family , carried the story , quoting a " high-ranking " unidentified official who mentioned both the arrest of hannibal gadhafi and the swiss ban on 188 libyan citizens . schengen countries suffer as libya punishes swiss the italian foreign ministry confirmed the ban on its web site soon after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss banned 188 libyans from crossing its borders " libyan authorities have confirmed the suspension of all types of visas for citizens of schengen states .
in addition , they have specified that citizens from schengen states will be denied entry into libya even if they are in possession of a visa , of whatever duration or type , " a statement on its web site read . the passport-free schengen zone comprises 25 nations , including switzerland , iceland , norway and most european union members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania . werenfels said that predicting the effects of the visa ban would be difficult as libya seemed to be employing an arbitrary ban at the moment .
" libya seems to be targeting high-level business people from europe but we 'll see how long that lasts , " she said .
" this would be damaging for libya too .
it remains to be seen if they ban anyone who works for the petrochemical industry , which is very important to libya .
chances are , in two or three days , gadhafi may find a way out of this while saving face . " strong words from eu but little chance of strong action meanwhile , the european commission declared the libyan decision as being " unilateral and disproportionate . " " the commission also regrets that travellers who legally obtained visas before the suspension measure were refused entry when arriving in libya " , said eu commissioner for home affairs , cecilia malmstrom . she added that the commission is set to discuss the issue " before the end of the week " with schengen countries , with a view to " consider the appropriate reaction . " experts believe that the eu 's show of unity towards switzerland will evaporate when important trade and business relations are put at risk by any further escalation on an eu-wide scale . " it is very important for the eu to speak with one voice .
the eu should use the tools that it has , " sawsan chebli , an associate fellow with the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the eu is libya ’ s greatest trade and export partner .
this is a leverage the eu could use .
however , italy and other eu member states with close relations with libya in the past have shown that they are not interested to spoil their relations with libya whatever gadhafi ’ s action may be .
that is not likely to change .
and the problem is that gadhafi knows that he is able to divide the eu . " italians urge swiss to resolve crisis and leave eu out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini told switzerland to leave europe out its row with libya chebli 's opinion was reinforced by a statement from italy which criticized switzerland and urged the swiss to sort out their differences with the north african country and its leadership . switzerland must " resolve this bi-lateral issue ... but not at the expense of everyone else , " italian foreign minister franco frattini said in a television interview , adding that he had stressed to bern the " sensitivity " of the situation . sawsan chebli believes that italy 's attitude highlights a disregard for european solidarity when business ties - which are strong between italy and libya - are concerned . " the italians care very little about the eu or other states when it comes to business relations , " she said . " solidarity is an unknown word in this regard .
frattini was very clear .
he accused switzerland of misusing the schengen agreement to exert pressure on gadhafi and said that bern would take its members ' hostage ' .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 16.02.2010 current stars continue dutch habit of taking bundesliga by storm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutchmen like robben and van nistelrooy now excite germany coming from the country that created " total football , " a fluid tactical approach with changing roles , one could think dutch soccer stars may feel stifled in germany 's disciplined systems .
not so - in fact , they flourish . it took ruud van nistelrooy just 10 minutes on saturday to make the kind of impact hamburg were hoping for from the dutch striker when they bought him from real madrid in the january transfer window .
the former manchester united star came on as a second half substitute in hamburg 's game against stuttgart and with the score at 1-1 , van nistelrooy struck in the 75th and 77th minutes to seal a 3-1 victory for his new team . the imposing dutch forward was supposed to be a spent force when hamburg rescued him from an increasingly frustrating spell with spanish giants real .
despite winning two league titles with madrid in his three-and-a-half seasons with them , and scoring 46 goals in 68 appearances for los blancos , the latest galacticos policy at the santiago bernabeu left van nistelrooy out in the cold and surplus to requirements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy showed he 's far from a washed-up has-been " depending on how he 's used , ruud can still be a sensation and will do very well in the bundesliga if he 's used smartly and is allowed his rest , " said jan roskott , dutch soccer correspondent for the offside.com . " his biggest strength - in my view - is his focus and his mental strength .
he 's a real killer .
the thing with ruud is , his scoring ratio is high .
hamburg play offensive football , so if ruud gets four chances to score , he 'll convert at least one of those chances .
he 's also a real team player and he allows others to play better .
i 'm not sure if he has 40 games or more in him , though , but if he remains fit , he could well have another good three years in him . " bundesliga helps robben rediscover frightening flair another dutchman who was frozen out at real madrid only to find a warmer welcome in germany is arjen robben .
the dutch winger struck again at the weekend in bayern 's 3-1 victory over borussia dortmund to bring his season total for bayern munich to eight goals in 14 games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben is a player reborn at bayern munich this season robben has been a player transformed in the bundesliga since arriving last summer .
he performed fitfully at real and rarely produced the kind of displays which convinced madrid to pay chelsea 25 million euros -lrb- $ 34 million -rrb- for his services in 2007 .
the former psv eindhoven flyer scared the living daylights out of english defenses in his three seasons in west london and the speed , directness and hunger for goals which punctuated his chelsea career seem to have been rediscovered at bayern . " dutch players have the benefit of being very familiar with german football , german culture and the german language , " said kai de graff from dutch soccer fanzine dagelijkse voetbal . " they fit in pretty seamlessly into the way of life which always makes the transition to a new club and league easier .
dutch players are very intelligent and have great knowledge of the game , which makes them adaptable .
although dutch football is a lot about finesse , they also thrive in physical leagues like germany .
i think they 're also quite technically gifted and when allowed to play can show great skill .
the bundesliga is a league which gives such players space and time to be creative . " dutchmen flourish in their home from home this seamless integration into german soccer for dutch stars has seen a host of top players grace the bundesliga stage in recent years .
bayern fans will fondly remember the four seasons that roy makaay led the line , scoring 78 goals in 129 games for the bavarian giants and helping them to a number of titles . meanwhile , before the current crop of dutch stars at hamburg , hsv supporters may look back with misty eyes at the silky skills of rafael van der vaart , the obstinate defending of khalid boulahrouz -lrb- now at stuttgart -rrb- and the classy midfield marshalling of nigel de jong . players benefit despite lack of total football ethos in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch coach rinus michels developed total football the dutch became famous for developing and executing the concept of total football , a tactical approach in which any player who moves out of his position is replaced by another from his team .
with no player fixed in his nominal role ; anyone can be successively an attacker , a midfielder and a defender thus retaining the team 's intended organizational structure . while german teams find strength in the rigidity of roles within their tactical structures , this does n't seem to stifle dutch stars .
in fact they tend to excel by using their individual talents in their preferred role . jan roskett believes the dutch prosper mainly because of their desire to win and play good , attractive soccer .
systems and formations are just a means to an end . " for decades , the dutch school - ball possession , dominance , attacks via creative wingers , full backs pushing up , players taking over other positions - was synonymous with a 4-3-3 formation , " said roskott . " but a line-up system is just a series of numbers and does n't say anything about the intent .
the dutch school normally means : playing dominantly and determining the play .
this was how we played football for years .
the ultimate proof of a successful system is results .
the dutch are happy if they can get the result with good football , attractive attacking pass-and-move play which results in prizes - which is what the dutch school was all about anyway .

a heterosexual couple in austria has vowed to go to the country 's highest court - to be granted a civil partnership introduced for gay couples .
they argue that current legislation is discriminatory . a heterosexual couple in austria is fighting for the right to enter into a registered civil partnership - introduced for homosexual couples in january 2010 .
under current law the couple will be denied that right - but they have vowed to take the case to the country 's constitutional court to overturn what they says is a discriminatory legislation .
austria introduced civil unions for gay couples on january 1 , affording them some of the rights enjoyed by their heterosexual counterparts .
the new legislation , passed after weeks of wrangling between the ruling social democrats and their conservative coalition partner in government , gives same-sex couples a status similar to traditional marriage but different in a number of respects .
for instance , there are less strict rules in the event of a divorce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the issue is equality - nothing but equality , ' the couple argues the heterosexual couple in question argues that this is a more modern form of union - which simply suits them better than a traditional marriage .
and if it 's offered to gay couples , why should n't it be an option for them as well ?
the issue at stake , they argue , is standing up against discrimination .
" everyone should have the same rights , and there should n't be different rules for different people , " the couple 's lawyer , helmut graupner , told deutsche welle .
" regardless of how many different forms of union a state provides to couples , all of those forms should be available for everyone and must not be restricted on the basis of race , class or sex or gender or other criteria , which are traditionally the very criteria for discrimination , " graupner said .
can you be ' a little bit equal ' ?
at the end of february , the couple plans to officially apply for a civil partnership - they expect this to be rejected , in which case they plan to take their case to the constitutional court .
their goal is to force the government to rework the legislation so that both traditional marriage and registered partnership will be open to any couple - gay or straight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay and lesbian activists say the different forms of union are discriminatory " the issue is equality - nothing but equality , " graupner said .

a heterosexual couple in austria has vowed to go to the country 's highest court - to be granted a civil partnership introduced for gay couples .
they argue that current legislation is discriminatory . a heterosexual couple in austria is fighting for the right to enter into a registered civil partnership - introduced for homosexual couples in january 2010 .
under current law the couple will be denied that right - but they have vowed to take the case to the country 's constitutional court to overturn what they says is a discriminatory legislation .
austria introduced civil unions for gay couples on january 1 , affording them some of the rights enjoyed by their heterosexual counterparts .
the new legislation , passed after weeks of wrangling between the ruling social democrats and their conservative coalition partner in government , gives same-sex couples a status similar to traditional marriage but different in a number of respects .
for instance , there are less strict rules in the event of a divorce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the issue is equality - nothing but equality , ' the couple argues the heterosexual couple in question argues that this is a more modern form of union - which simply suits them better than a traditional marriage .
and if it 's offered to gay couples , why should n't it be an option for them as well ?
the issue at stake , they argue , is standing up against discrimination .
" everyone should have the same rights , and there should n't be different rules for different people , " the couple 's lawyer , helmut graupner , told deutsche welle .
" regardless of how many different forms of union a state provides to couples , all of those forms should be available for everyone and must not be restricted on the basis of race , class or sex or gender or other criteria , which are traditionally the very criteria for discrimination , " graupner said .
can you be ' a little bit equal ' ?
at the end of february , the couple plans to officially apply for a civil partnership - they expect this to be rejected , in which case they plan to take their case to the constitutional court .
their goal is to force the government to rework the legislation so that both traditional marriage and registered partnership will be open to any couple - gay or straight .

not so - in fact , they flourish . it took ruud van nistelrooy just 10 minutes on saturday to make the kind of impact hamburg were hoping for from the dutch striker when they bought him from real madrid in the january transfer window .
the former manchester united star came on as a second half substitute in hamburg 's game against stuttgart and with the score at 1-1 , van nistelrooy struck in the 75th and 77th minutes to seal a 3-1 victory for his new team . the imposing dutch forward was supposed to be a spent force when hamburg rescued him from an increasingly frustrating spell with spanish giants real .
despite winning two league titles with madrid in his three-and-a-half seasons with them , and scoring 46 goals in 68 appearances for los blancos , the latest galacticos policy at the santiago bernabeu left van nistelrooy out in the cold and surplus to requirements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy showed he 's far from a washed-up has-been " depending on how he 's used , ruud can still be a sensation and will do very well in the bundesliga if he 's used smartly and is allowed his rest , " said jan roskott , dutch soccer correspondent for the offside.com . " his biggest strength - in my view - is his focus and his mental strength .
he 's a real killer .
the thing with ruud is , his scoring ratio is high .
hamburg play offensive football , so if ruud gets four chances to score , he 'll convert at least one of those chances .
he 's also a real team player and he allows others to play better .
i 'm not sure if he has 40 games or more in him , though , but if he remains fit , he could well have another good three years in him . " bundesliga helps robben rediscover frightening flair another dutchman who was frozen out at real madrid only to find a warmer welcome in germany is arjen robben .
the dutch winger struck again at the weekend in bayern 's 3-1 victory over borussia dortmund to bring his season total for bayern munich to eight goals in 14 games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben is a player reborn at bayern munich this season robben has been a player transformed in the bundesliga since arriving last summer .
he performed fitfully at real and rarely produced the kind of displays which convinced madrid to pay chelsea 25 million euros -lrb- $ 34 million -rrb- for his services in 2007 .
the former psv eindhoven flyer scared the living daylights out of english defenses in his three seasons in west london and the speed , directness and hunger for goals which punctuated his chelsea career seem to have been rediscovered at bayern . " dutch players have the benefit of being very familiar with german football , german culture and the german language , " said kai de graff from dutch soccer fanzine dagelijkse voetbal . " they fit in pretty seamlessly into the way of life which always makes the transition to a new club and league easier .
dutch players are very intelligent and have great knowledge of the game , which makes them adaptable .
although dutch football is a lot about finesse , they also thrive in physical leagues like germany .
i think they 're also quite technically gifted and when allowed to play can show great skill .
the bundesliga is a league which gives such players space and time to be creative . " dutchmen flourish in their home from home this seamless integration into german soccer for dutch stars has seen a host of top players grace the bundesliga stage in recent years .
bayern fans will fondly remember the four seasons that roy makaay led the line , scoring 78 goals in 129 games for the bavarian giants and helping them to a number of titles . meanwhile , before the current crop of dutch stars at hamburg , hsv supporters may look back with misty eyes at the silky skills of rafael van der vaart , the obstinate defending of khalid boulahrouz -lrb- now at stuttgart -rrb- and the classy midfield marshalling of nigel de jong . players benefit despite lack of total football ethos in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch coach rinus michels developed total football the dutch became famous for developing and executing the concept of total football , a tactical approach in which any player who moves out of his position is replaced by another from his team .
with no player fixed in his nominal role ; anyone can be successively an attacker , a midfielder and a defender thus retaining the team 's intended organizational structure . while german teams find strength in the rigidity of roles within their tactical structures , this does n't seem to stifle dutch stars .
in fact they tend to excel by using their individual talents in their preferred role . jan roskett believes the dutch prosper mainly because of their desire to win and play good , attractive soccer .
systems and formations are just a means to an end . " for decades , the dutch school - ball possession , dominance , attacks via creative wingers , full backs pushing up , players taking over other positions - was synonymous with a 4-3-3 formation , " said roskott . " but a line-up system is just a series of numbers and does n't say anything about the intent .
the dutch school normally means : playing dominantly and determining the play .
this was how we played football for years .
the ultimate proof of a successful system is results .
the dutch are happy if they can get the result with good football , attractive attacking pass-and-move play which results in prizes - which is what the dutch school was all about anyway .

not so - in fact , they flourish . it took ruud van nistelrooy just 10 minutes on saturday to make the kind of impact hamburg were hoping for from the dutch striker when they bought him from real madrid in the january transfer window .
the former manchester united star came on as a second half substitute in hamburg 's game against stuttgart and with the score at 1-1 , van nistelrooy struck in the 75th and 77th minutes to seal a 3-1 victory for his new team . the imposing dutch forward was supposed to be a spent force when hamburg rescued him from an increasingly frustrating spell with spanish giants real .
despite winning two league titles with madrid in his three-and-a-half seasons with them , and scoring 46 goals in 68 appearances for los blancos , the latest galacticos policy at the santiago bernabeu left van nistelrooy out in the cold and surplus to requirements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy showed he 's far from a washed-up has-been " depending on how he 's used , ruud can still be a sensation and will do very well in the bundesliga if he 's used smartly and is allowed his rest , " said jan roskott , dutch soccer correspondent for the offside.com . " his biggest strength - in my view - is his focus and his mental strength .
he 's a real killer .
the thing with ruud is , his scoring ratio is high .
hamburg play offensive football , so if ruud gets four chances to score , he 'll convert at least one of those chances .
he 's also a real team player and he allows others to play better .
i 'm not sure if he has 40 games or more in him , though , but if he remains fit , he could well have another good three years in him . " bundesliga helps robben rediscover frightening flair another dutchman who was frozen out at real madrid only to find a warmer welcome in germany is arjen robben .
the dutch winger struck again at the weekend in bayern 's 3-1 victory over borussia dortmund to bring his season total for bayern munich to eight goals in 14 games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben is a player reborn at bayern munich this season robben has been a player transformed in the bundesliga since arriving last summer .
he performed fitfully at real and rarely produced the kind of displays which convinced madrid to pay chelsea 25 million euros -lrb- $ 34 million -rrb- for his services in 2007 .
the former psv eindhoven flyer scared the living daylights out of english defenses in his three seasons in west london and the speed , directness and hunger for goals which punctuated his chelsea career seem to have been rediscovered at bayern . " dutch players have the benefit of being very familiar with german football , german culture and the german language , " said kai de graff from dutch soccer fanzine dagelijkse voetbal . " they fit in pretty seamlessly into the way of life which always makes the transition to a new club and league easier .
dutch players are very intelligent and have great knowledge of the game , which makes them adaptable .
although dutch football is a lot about finesse , they also thrive in physical leagues like germany .
i think they 're also quite technically gifted and when allowed to play can show great skill .
the bundesliga is a league which gives such players space and time to be creative . " dutchmen flourish in their home from home this seamless integration into german soccer for dutch stars has seen a host of top players grace the bundesliga stage in recent years .
bayern fans will fondly remember the four seasons that roy makaay led the line , scoring 78 goals in 129 games for the bavarian giants and helping them to a number of titles . meanwhile , before the current crop of dutch stars at hamburg , hsv supporters may look back with misty eyes at the silky skills of rafael van der vaart , the obstinate defending of khalid boulahrouz -lrb- now at stuttgart -rrb- and the classy midfield marshalling of nigel de jong . players benefit despite lack of total football ethos in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch coach rinus michels developed total football the dutch became famous for developing and executing the concept of total football , a tactical approach in which any player who moves out of his position is replaced by another from his team .
with no player fixed in his nominal role ; anyone can be successively an attacker , a midfielder and a defender thus retaining the team 's intended organizational structure . while german teams find strength in the rigidity of roles within their tactical structures , this does n't seem to stifle dutch stars .
in fact they tend to excel by using their individual talents in their preferred role . jan roskett believes the dutch prosper mainly because of their desire to win and play good , attractive soccer .
systems and formations are just a means to an end . " for decades , the dutch school - ball possession , dominance , attacks via creative wingers , full backs pushing up , players taking over other positions - was synonymous with a 4-3-3 formation , " said roskott . " but a line-up system is just a series of numbers and does n't say anything about the intent .
the dutch school normally means : playing dominantly and determining the play .
this was how we played football for years .
the ultimate proof of a successful system is results .
the dutch are happy if they can get the result with good football , attractive attacking pass-and-move play which results in prizes - which is what the dutch school was all about anyway .

a heterosexual couple in austria has vowed to go to the country 's highest court - to be granted a civil partnership introduced for gay couples .
they argue that current legislation is discriminatory . a heterosexual couple in austria is fighting for the right to enter into a registered civil partnership - introduced for homosexual couples in january 2010 .
under current law the couple will be denied that right - but they have vowed to take the case to the country 's constitutional court to overturn what they says is a discriminatory legislation .
austria introduced civil unions for gay couples on january 1 , affording them some of the rights enjoyed by their heterosexual counterparts .
the new legislation , passed after weeks of wrangling between the ruling social democrats and their conservative coalition partner in government , gives same-sex couples a status similar to traditional marriage but different in a number of respects .
for instance , there are less strict rules in the event of a divorce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the issue is equality - nothing but equality , ' the couple argues the heterosexual couple in question argues that this is a more modern form of union - which simply suits them better than a traditional marriage .
and if it 's offered to gay couples , why should n't it be an option for them as well ?
the issue at stake , they argue , is standing up against discrimination .
" everyone should have the same rights , and there should n't be different rules for different people , " the couple 's lawyer , helmut graupner , told deutsche welle .
" regardless of how many different forms of union a state provides to couples , all of those forms should be available for everyone and must not be restricted on the basis of race , class or sex or gender or other criteria , which are traditionally the very criteria for discrimination , " graupner said .
can you be ' a little bit equal ' ?
at the end of february , the couple plans to officially apply for a civil partnership - they expect this to be rejected , in which case they plan to take their case to the constitutional court .
their goal is to force the government to rework the legislation so that both traditional marriage and registered partnership will be open to any couple - gay or straight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay and lesbian activists say the different forms of union are discriminatory " the issue is equality - nothing but equality , " graupner said .
" you can not be ' a little bit equal . '
just like you ca n't be ' a little bit pregnant ' or ' a little bit dead . '
unless you 're entitled to the same kind of institutions and forms of law you 're not being treated equally and that 's discriminatory .
that 's what we are fighting against - we 're fighting for the rights of both heterosexuals and homosexuals . "
graupner is not only trying to help the heterosexual couple to get a ' gay ' marriage .
he 's also representing gay couples who want a traditional marriage - rather than the registered civil partnership that lawmakers have agreed on .
the current legislation provides same-sex couples with equal rights to heterosexuals with regards to pensions and alimony - but the law for instance continues to ban adoption .
it also does not allow civil partnership ceremonies at the civil registry office , where heterosexual couples can marry .
yet graupner is up against strong resistance .
the country 's conservative party - the austrian peoples party - only reluctantly agreed to the civil partnership in the first place .
the conservatives insists that significant differences between the two forms of union must remain .
the catholic church is not amused another powerful opponent to the law is the roman catholic church - after all , austria is predominantly catholic and the church is a force to be reckoned with .
the country 's clergy is opposed to the existing law , and certainly against any further liberalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the church ' different things need to be treated differently ' " the austrian bishops have made their position quite clear , " professor erich leitenberger , spokesman for the vienna diocese told deutsche welle .
" they strongly support the fact that the law does not put the civil partnership and a traditional marriage on an equal footing . "
" but the bishops have expressed concerns that the new law could be the beginning of a trend which eventually will lead to putting the civil partnership on the same footing as the traditional marriage between a man and a woman . "
leitenberger said that the legislation in place before january 1 was sufficient to safeguard the rights of gay and lesbian couples .
families , he argued , were shouldering the task of raising children and therefore could not be put on the same level with same-sex couples .
" the bishops stick to their position that a traditional marriage , a family raising children simply is something different from a homosexual couple - and therefore should also be treated differently . "
however , should the appeal to the constitutional court be successful , soon both of the two forms of union , could be open to any couple - a situation that would place austria at the forefront in terms of homosexual rights in europe .
the decision by the court is expected by the end of this year .

juncker said the additional plan should focus on expenditure cuts and revenue-increasing measures .
athens has pledged to reduce its deficit , which was 12.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2009 , by four percentage points in 2010 .
greece hopes to reduce this further by 2012 to 3 percent - and thus come within the official maximum limit for countries using the euro .
large demands greek finance minister george papaconstantinou defended his country 's efforts to slash the deficit by 2012 .
he also defended the use of " derivated contracts , " used in the past to borrow money without increasing official debt levels , saying they were legal at the time of their use .
critics have said the measures hid the full extent of the country 's financial situation from brussels .
papaconstantinou said that although greece is willing to undertake additional fiscal measures to tackle its debt , urging the country to do more before its report in march is asking for too much .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 16.02.2010 current stars continue dutch habit of taking bundesliga by storm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutchmen like robben and van nistelrooy now excite germany coming from the country that created " total football , " a fluid tactical approach with changing roles , one could think dutch soccer stars may feel stifled in germany 's disciplined systems .
not so - in fact , they flourish . it took ruud van nistelrooy just 10 minutes on saturday to make the kind of impact hamburg were hoping for from the dutch striker when they bought him from real madrid in the january transfer window .
the former manchester united star came on as a second half substitute in hamburg 's game against stuttgart and with the score at 1-1 , van nistelrooy struck in the 75th and 77th minutes to seal a 3-1 victory for his new team . the imposing dutch forward was supposed to be a spent force when hamburg rescued him from an increasingly frustrating spell with spanish giants real .
despite winning two league titles with madrid in his three-and-a-half seasons with them , and scoring 46 goals in 68 appearances for los blancos , the latest galacticos policy at the santiago bernabeu left van nistelrooy out in the cold and surplus to requirements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy showed he 's far from a washed-up has-been " depending on how he 's used , ruud can still be a sensation and will do very well in the bundesliga if he 's used smartly and is allowed his rest , " said jan roskott , dutch soccer correspondent for the offside.com . " his biggest strength - in my view - is his focus and his mental strength .
he 's a real killer .
the thing with ruud is , his scoring ratio is high .
hamburg play offensive football , so if ruud gets four chances to score , he 'll convert at least one of those chances .
he 's also a real team player and he allows others to play better .
i 'm not sure if he has 40 games or more in him , though , but if he remains fit , he could well have another good three years in him . " bundesliga helps robben rediscover frightening flair another dutchman who was frozen out at real madrid only to find a warmer welcome in germany is arjen robben .
the dutch winger struck again at the weekend in bayern 's 3-1 victory over borussia dortmund to bring his season total for bayern munich to eight goals in 14 games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben is a player reborn at bayern munich this season robben has been a player transformed in the bundesliga since arriving last summer .
he performed fitfully at real and rarely produced the kind of displays which convinced madrid to pay chelsea 25 million euros -lrb- $ 34 million -rrb- for his services in 2007 .
the former psv eindhoven flyer scared the living daylights out of english defenses in his three seasons in west london and the speed , directness and hunger for goals which punctuated his chelsea career seem to have been rediscovered at bayern . " dutch players have the benefit of being very familiar with german football , german culture and the german language , " said kai de graff from dutch soccer fanzine dagelijkse voetbal . " they fit in pretty seamlessly into the way of life which always makes the transition to a new club and league easier .
dutch players are very intelligent and have great knowledge of the game , which makes them adaptable .
although dutch football is a lot about finesse , they also thrive in physical leagues like germany .
i think they 're also quite technically gifted and when allowed to play can show great skill .
the bundesliga is a league which gives such players space and time to be creative . " dutchmen flourish in their home from home this seamless integration into german soccer for dutch stars has seen a host of top players grace the bundesliga stage in recent years .
bayern fans will fondly remember the four seasons that roy makaay led the line , scoring 78 goals in 129 games for the bavarian giants and helping them to a number of titles . meanwhile , before the current crop of dutch stars at hamburg , hsv supporters may look back with misty eyes at the silky skills of rafael van der vaart , the obstinate defending of khalid boulahrouz -lrb- now at stuttgart -rrb- and the classy midfield marshalling of nigel de jong . players benefit despite lack of total football ethos in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch coach rinus michels developed total football the dutch became famous for developing and executing the concept of total football , a tactical approach in which any player who moves out of his position is replaced by another from his team .
with no player fixed in his nominal role ; anyone can be successively an attacker , a midfielder and a defender thus retaining the team 's intended organizational structure . while german teams find strength in the rigidity of roles within their tactical structures , this does n't seem to stifle dutch stars .
in fact they tend to excel by using their individual talents in their preferred role . jan roskett believes the dutch prosper mainly because of their desire to win and play good , attractive soccer .
systems and formations are just a means to an end . " for decades , the dutch school - ball possession , dominance , attacks via creative wingers , full backs pushing up , players taking over other positions - was synonymous with a 4-3-3 formation , " said roskott . " but a line-up system is just a series of numbers and does n't say anything about the intent .
the dutch school normally means : playing dominantly and determining the play .
this was how we played football for years .
the ultimate proof of a successful system is results .
the dutch are happy if they can get the result with good football , attractive attacking pass-and-move play which results in prizes - which is what the dutch school was all about anyway .

now , with debt mounting , an economic comeback in 2010 appears increasingly unlikely as the celtic tiger struggles to avoid the fate of greece . the economy of the republic of ireland , until the early 1990s , was rooted firmly in agriculture , largely relying on traditional , farm-based businesses .
but in 1994 , ireland began to experience economic growth that would transform one of europe 's poorest nations into one of its richest .
starting that year , ireland used its educated and under utilized english-speaking workforce , state policies that attracted large american corporations eager to make inroads into the european union market , tolerance towards low-skilled immigrant workers and generous corporate tax benefits to fuel expansive economic growth .
property prices soared as wages increased .
personal and public debt levels decreased dramatically .
the ' celtic tiger ' , as ireland came to be known , became a knowledge-based economy .
the 2007 global downturn ended ireland 's positive run , and the crisis of 2008 sent the country into an economic tailspin .
the government could no longer continue wage increases necessary for workers to pay high home prices , leading to widespread mortgage defaults .
ireland 's housing losses were devastating ; its real estate bubble had grown much faster than that in the rest of europe .
debt levels , at historical lows in 2006 , returned to unmanageable levels .

it could take decades to restore them . bildunterschrift : ireland 's construction sector collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis 2010 forecasts discouraging few economists believe ireland will recover this year .
an official forecast released by the irish government last month predicted an average unemployment rate of 13.2 percent in 2010 . the latest quarterly report from dublin-based economic and social research institute -lrb- esri -rrb- estimates an average jobless rate of 13.75 percent this year .
although much higher than european average , this is a significant downward revision from the institute 's spring 2009 forecast , which put unemployment at almost 17 percent by the end of 2010 .
like greece , spain and portugal , ireland 's biggest problem is debt .
tax revenue declines of 20 percent last year have left ireland operating 25 billion euros over budget this year .
meanwhile , homeowners still are forced to pay expensive mortgages on property which has lost significant value .
home prices fell nearly 20 percent last year , according to esri , and are down more than 30 percent since 2007 .
" it is just tragic when you look at the reversal in debt levels , " erik jones , a professor of european studies at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies , told deutsche welle .

now , with debt mounting , an economic comeback in 2010 appears increasingly unlikely as the celtic tiger struggles to avoid the fate of greece . the economy of the republic of ireland , until the early 1990s , was rooted firmly in agriculture , largely relying on traditional , farm-based businesses .
but in 1994 , ireland began to experience economic growth that would transform one of europe 's poorest nations into one of its richest .
starting that year , ireland used its educated and under utilized english-speaking workforce , state policies that attracted large american corporations eager to make inroads into the european union market , tolerance towards low-skilled immigrant workers and generous corporate tax benefits to fuel expansive economic growth .
property prices soared as wages increased .
personal and public debt levels decreased dramatically .
the ' celtic tiger ' , as ireland came to be known , became a knowledge-based economy .
the 2007 global downturn ended ireland 's positive run , and the crisis of 2008 sent the country into an economic tailspin .
the government could no longer continue wage increases necessary for workers to pay high home prices , leading to widespread mortgage defaults .
ireland 's housing losses were devastating ; its real estate bubble had grown much faster than that in the rest of europe .
debt levels , at historical lows in 2006 , returned to unmanageable levels .
many of the gains made during the celtic tiger 's boom period have been lost in the last three years .
it could take decades to restore them . bildunterschrift : ireland 's construction sector collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis 2010 forecasts discouraging few economists believe ireland will recover this year .
an official forecast released by the irish government last month predicted an average unemployment rate of 13.2 percent in 2010 . the latest quarterly report from dublin-based economic and social research institute -lrb- esri -rrb- estimates an average jobless rate of 13.75 percent this year .
although much higher than european average , this is a significant downward revision from the institute 's spring 2009 forecast , which put unemployment at almost 17 percent by the end of 2010 .
like greece , spain and portugal , ireland 's biggest problem is debt .
tax revenue declines of 20 percent last year have left ireland operating 25 billion euros over budget this year .
meanwhile , homeowners still are forced to pay expensive mortgages on property which has lost significant value .
home prices fell nearly 20 percent last year , according to esri , and are down more than 30 percent since 2007 .
" it is just tragic when you look at the reversal in debt levels , " erik jones , a professor of european studies at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they worked so hard for so long just to be back where they were -lrb- when the economic revival began in the 1990s -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising debt levels have triggered protests in ireland the road forward the european union is not expected to allow ireland 's fiscal problems to become unmanageable .
the european commission last week made clear that while current action would be limited , greece would not be allowed to fail .
the same promise applies to ireland .
the irish government has helped itself by acting with more fiscal discipline than its greek counterpart .
dublin has made sizeable spending cuts in this year 's budget , and public workers , from low level bureaucrats to top public officials , are expected to earn less this year .
philip lane , a professor of international microeconomics at trinity college dublin attributed ireland 's ability to make difficult cuts to the nature of the irish crisis .
" ireland is feeling the pinch because of the burst of the real estate bubble , " he said .
" greece , meanwhile , has chronically overspent for years . "
" we made the cutbacks in ireland because we knew that wages were growing too quickly , that wages were too high , " lane told deutsche welle .
" we knew we needed to get sensible again . "
lane says that once the crisis passes , ireland should revert to the practices that made the early part of the celtic tiger years successful .
" the real celtic tiger was driven by an export boom .
we got diverted by a domestic construction bubble , " he said .
" we need to get back to international business . "

ireland 's 24 standing bishops , summoned to the vatican to address the crisis , told the pontiff of their " shame " at the scandal and vowed to cooperate with authorities in ireland .

to date , the pope has accepted one of the resignations .
the vatican statement did not mention specific disciplinary measures to be taken against the remaining three clerics involved in the scandal .

the eu offered its support , but no firm commitments on specific aid . at a european union meeting in brussels , finance ministers from germany , sweden and austria told greece it needs to do more to bring its runaway debt under control and calm worried financial markets .
joerg asmussen , germany 's deputy finance minister , advised greece to follow the lead of ireland and latvia , eu countries which are slashing spending in an effort to rein in their financial troubles .
" we made it clear the ball is in greece 's court , " asmussen said .
" additional measures by greece are needed . "
a statement issued by the ministers after the meeting said although greece has until march 16 to prove it has taken initial steps towards reducing its budgetary deficit by four percent , they will likely demand more budget cuts or tax hikes to prevent wider financial troubles .
the four percent reduction is the first step in a plan to eventually reduce the deficit from 12.7 percent of gdp to less than three percent in 2012 .
" the pressure on greece to consider further measures by march 16 has clearly increased , " said austrian finance minister josef proell .
the euro-zone ministers did not elaborate on earlier talk of specific monetary aid , instead reaffirming thursday 's pledge to support greece if things got out of control .

" but this debate is not yet on . "
greek finance minister george papaconstantinou told reporters after the meeting that the country is already ahead of its deficit reduction goals , adding that a one-off tax on large companies had resulted in a january surplus .
papaconstantinou , who warned on monday that his government would need more than a day to turn things around , said the pledge of support should act as a deterrent if financial markets increased the pressure on greece or other euro zone countries .
" today it is greece , tomorrow it could be another country , " he said .
greece 's mounting debts have tarnished the euro and increased bond yields , making debt servicing much more difficult .
the country has two sets of sovereign debt of more than eight billion euros each which it is to refinance in april and may .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 16.02.2010 uk mulls ' green bonds ' to spur infrastructure investment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed bonds are meant to help fund the renewable energy industry britain is reportedly examining the idea of launching green bonds to boost the renewable energy sector amid cash flow snags .
but will they have the desired effect of easing funding bottlenecks ? the economic secretary to the uk 's finance ministry , ian pearson , said in an interview published in the financial times newspaper on monday that the government was considering introducing so-called “ green bonds ” to the public to help fund the renewable energy industry .
pearson said that he had asked officials to examine a proposal that would see national savings and investments - a treasury-based unit - issue the bonds for sustainable infrastructure projects .
debt by any other name … dr. martin weale , director of the national institute of economic and social research -lrb- niesr -rrb- , an independent london-based think tank , told deutsche welle that such a move would basically amount to government borrowing , regardless of what name it ’ s given .
“ if it ’ s something that makes people happier about lending to the government – assuming the government is issuing them – or if it makes it possible for the government to borrow more cheaply than would otherwise be the case , then it seems to be it ’ s a good idea , ” dr. weale said .
“ fundamentally , what matters is actually paying for spending that ’ s done , whether it ’ s a green idea or anything else , and if you finance it by borrowing , it doesn ’ t matter too much what you call it , ” he said , adding that investors would need to look at the likely yields of such bonds .
proponents of the green bonds are describing them as a new way to finance infrastructure projects at a time when the government is struggling to balance its books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. weale says emotive captions persuaded people to invest in wartime bonds however , dr. weale points out that it won ’ t actually reduce the amount of government borrowing .
“ when we look at how much the government is borrowing and whether it can afford it , people will take green bonds into account just as much as anything else , ” he said .
he draws an analogy between last century ’ s wartime borrowing in britain and the current trends .
“ in many ways it ’ s rather similar to something we saw in the twentieth century : we had defense bonds and we had war loans .
and those were names given to government debt to make it easier or persuade people to buy it , ” he explained .
long-term contracts planned the finance ministry ’ s ian pearson was also quoted as saying the government was looking to offer long-term support to wind energy and green waste companies .
" we are thinking of going direct to companies looking to establish energy from waste and wind farm projects and offering them long-term contracts that would both get the public sector a good deal on price but also get the projects off the ground , " he told the financial times .
" if they had , say , a 15-year contract to supply the public sector , that should make it easier for them to raise finance to get the projects going , while tying in with the green agenda , " pearson added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 16.02.2010 uk mulls ' green bonds ' to spur infrastructure investment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed bonds are meant to help fund the renewable energy industry britain is reportedly examining the idea of launching green bonds to boost the renewable energy sector amid cash flow snags .
but will they have the desired effect of easing funding bottlenecks ? the economic secretary to the uk 's finance ministry , ian pearson , said in an interview published in the financial times newspaper on monday that the government was considering introducing so-called “ green bonds ” to the public to help fund the renewable energy industry .
pearson said that he had asked officials to examine a proposal that would see national savings and investments - a treasury-based unit - issue the bonds for sustainable infrastructure projects .
debt by any other name … dr. martin weale , director of the national institute of economic and social research -lrb- niesr -rrb- , an independent london-based think tank , told deutsche welle that such a move would basically amount to government borrowing , regardless of what name it ’ s given .
“ if it ’ s something that makes people happier about lending to the government – assuming the government is issuing them – or if it makes it possible for the government to borrow more cheaply than would otherwise be the case , then it seems to be it ’ s a good idea , ” dr. weale said .
“ fundamentally , what matters is actually paying for spending that ’ s done , whether it ’ s a green idea or anything else , and if you finance it by borrowing , it doesn ’ t matter too much what you call it , ” he said , adding that investors would need to look at the likely yields of such bonds .
proponents of the green bonds are describing them as a new way to finance infrastructure projects at a time when the government is struggling to balance its books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. weale says emotive captions persuaded people to invest in wartime bonds however , dr. weale points out that it won ’ t actually reduce the amount of government borrowing .
“ when we look at how much the government is borrowing and whether it can afford it , people will take green bonds into account just as much as anything else , ” he said .
he draws an analogy between last century ’ s wartime borrowing in britain and the current trends .
“ in many ways it ’ s rather similar to something we saw in the twentieth century : we had defense bonds and we had war loans .
and those were names given to government debt to make it easier or persuade people to buy it , ” he explained .
long-term contracts planned the finance ministry ’ s ian pearson was also quoted as saying the government was looking to offer long-term support to wind energy and green waste companies .
" we are thinking of going direct to companies looking to establish energy from waste and wind farm projects and offering them long-term contracts that would both get the public sector a good deal on price but also get the projects off the ground , " he told the financial times .
" if they had , say , a 15-year contract to supply the public sector , that should make it easier for them to raise finance to get the projects going , while tying in with the green agenda , " pearson added .
experts like dr. weale agree that there ’ s an argument for such long-term contracts .
“ we know that at current prices many so-called green schemes are highly uneconomic .
and since the government doesn ’ t want to do the obvious thing , which is to impose a proper charge for carbon emissions , what they are proposing seems to me the next best , ” he conceded .

little was known about the soviet camps until after the fall of the east german regime . sixty years ago on monday , the last inmates were reported to have been released from the last of a total of 10 internment camps that the russians had set up in what was then the soviet zone of occupation in germany .
their existence had become a thorn in the side of the founding fathers of communist east germany , who were left to deal with requests from the inmates ' family members to tell them what had happened to the prisoners .
documents that became available only after german unification in 1990 indicate that up to 176,000 inmates were held in the soviets ' " special camps . "
thirty-five percent of the detainees are thought to have died there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst zander , here with his wife renate , is unable to forget some of those who survived the camp at buchenwald , which is now a memorial site , met with historians there on saturday to talk about their personal experiences and the latest scientific findings about the soviet camps .
eyewitnesses still able to tell their story ernst zander was a youngster when he was captured by the soviets after the war .
after doing time at a prison at jamlitz , he was sent on to buchenwald .
the nazis had used the site as a concentration camp , where an estimated 50,000 people were executed , starved or worked to death .
after world war ii , the soviets used the same facility for one of their biggest internment camps . zander ended up there , because the russians accused him of being a " wehrwolf " - the standard term back then for a german who tried to fight soviet tanks and machinery as the red army advanced toward berlin in the final stages of the war .
he denies these allegations , saying that he was imprisoned for no crime at all .
he says the conditions he and other prisoners faced at the buchenwald camp were harsh .
" our family did not know we were being held in the camp .
we could not write to anyone .
we were so alone , " zander told deutsche welle .
the director of the buchenwald memorial site foundation , volkhard knigge , hastens to add that all the war-time allies had their own internment camps in germany , emphasizing that of course the soviets too had the right to have such camps after all the cruelty they 'd experienced at the hands of nazi germany .
but he points out that the soviet internment camps differed from those of the western allies .
" buchenwald in particular was a 100 percent stalinist camp between 1945 and its closure in 1950 , " knigge said .
" inmates had no right to complain to anyone .
there was no examination of the facts to establish personal guilt , no case-by-case investigations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a section of the sachsenhausen museum is devoted to soviet special camp no. 7 out of the fire - into the frying pan the last three camps - buchenwald , sachsenhausen and bautzen - were only closed as soviet internment centers in 1950 , several months after the founding of the communist german democratic republic .
some of the inmates were sent on to soviet gulags such as the one at workuta .
others were sentenced to long prison terms after show trials .
others were freed .
" many youngsters were able to start a normal life again , " said knigge .
" but what was difficult for them all was that they could n't openly speak about their experiences in the camps , as east german leaders kept sweeping the issue under the carpet . "
renate zander , the wife of former buchenwald inmate ernst zander , says that even now , the fate of the former detainees is not well known among the general german population .
" teachers here usually do n't want to talk about the events after 1945 , " she said .
" we have seven grandchildren , and they say that they only hear about the holocaust period when talking about the history of the camps at buchenwald and elsewhere .
nobody asks about the later events , because they 're not in the teachers ' minds . "
she also said that she sees little hope that this will be added to school curriculums anytime soon .

little was known about the soviet camps until after the fall of the east german regime . sixty years ago on monday , the last inmates were reported to have been released from the last of a total of 10 internment camps that the russians had set up in what was then the soviet zone of occupation in germany .
their existence had become a thorn in the side of the founding fathers of communist east germany , who were left to deal with requests from the inmates ' family members to tell them what had happened to the prisoners .
documents that became available only after german unification in 1990 indicate that up to 176,000 inmates were held in the soviets ' " special camps . "
thirty-five percent of the detainees are thought to have died there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst zander , here with his wife renate , is unable to forget some of those who survived the camp at buchenwald , which is now a memorial site , met with historians there on saturday to talk about their personal experiences and the latest scientific findings about the soviet camps .
eyewitnesses still able to tell their story ernst zander was a youngster when he was captured by the soviets after the war .
after doing time at a prison at jamlitz , he was sent on to buchenwald .
the nazis had used the site as a concentration camp , where an estimated 50,000 people were executed , starved or worked to death .
after world war ii , the soviets used the same facility for one of their biggest internment camps . zander ended up there , because the russians accused him of being a " wehrwolf " - the standard term back then for a german who tried to fight soviet tanks and machinery as the red army advanced toward berlin in the final stages of the war .
he denies these allegations , saying that he was imprisoned for no crime at all .
he says the conditions he and other prisoners faced at the buchenwald camp were harsh .
" our family did not know we were being held in the camp .
we could not write to anyone .
we were so alone , " zander told deutsche welle .
the director of the buchenwald memorial site foundation , volkhard knigge , hastens to add that all the war-time allies had their own internment camps in germany , emphasizing that of course the soviets too had the right to have such camps after all the cruelty they 'd experienced at the hands of nazi germany .
but he points out that the soviet internment camps differed from those of the western allies .
" buchenwald in particular was a 100 percent stalinist camp between 1945 and its closure in 1950 , " knigge said .
" inmates had no right to complain to anyone .
there was no examination of the facts to establish personal guilt , no case-by-case investigations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a section of the sachsenhausen museum is devoted to soviet special camp no. 7 out of the fire - into the frying pan the last three camps - buchenwald , sachsenhausen and bautzen - were only closed as soviet internment centers in 1950 , several months after the founding of the communist german democratic republic .
some of the inmates were sent on to soviet gulags such as the one at workuta .
others were sentenced to long prison terms after show trials .
others were freed .
" many youngsters were able to start a normal life again , " said knigge .
" but what was difficult for them all was that they could n't openly speak about their experiences in the camps , as east german leaders kept sweeping the issue under the carpet . "
renate zander , the wife of former buchenwald inmate ernst zander , says that even now , the fate of the former detainees is not well known among the general german population .
" teachers here usually do n't want to talk about the events after 1945 , " she said .
" we have seven grandchildren , and they say that they only hear about the holocaust period when talking about the history of the camps at buchenwald and elsewhere .
nobody asks about the later events , because they 're not in the teachers ' minds . "
she also said that she sees little hope that this will be added to school curriculums anytime soon .

renate zander , the wife of former buchenwald inmate ernst zander , says that even now , the fate of the former detainees is not well known among the general german population .
" teachers here usually do n't want to talk about the events after 1945 , " she said .

little was known about the soviet camps until after the fall of the east german regime . sixty years ago on monday , the last inmates were reported to have been released from the last of a total of 10 internment camps that the russians had set up in what was then the soviet zone of occupation in germany .
their existence had become a thorn in the side of the founding fathers of communist east germany , who were left to deal with requests from the inmates ' family members to tell them what had happened to the prisoners .
documents that became available only after german unification in 1990 indicate that up to 176,000 inmates were held in the soviets ' " special camps . "
thirty-five percent of the detainees are thought to have died there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst zander , here with his wife renate , is unable to forget some of those who survived the camp at buchenwald , which is now a memorial site , met with historians there on saturday to talk about their personal experiences and the latest scientific findings about the soviet camps .
eyewitnesses still able to tell their story ernst zander was a youngster when he was captured by the soviets after the war .
after doing time at a prison at jamlitz , he was sent on to buchenwald .
the nazis had used the site as a concentration camp , where an estimated 50,000 people were executed , starved or worked to death .
after world war ii , the soviets used the same facility for one of their biggest internment camps . zander ended up there , because the russians accused him of being a " wehrwolf " - the standard term back then for a german who tried to fight soviet tanks and machinery as the red army advanced toward berlin in the final stages of the war .
he denies these allegations , saying that he was imprisoned for no crime at all .
he says the conditions he and other prisoners faced at the buchenwald camp were harsh .
" our family did not know we were being held in the camp .
we could not write to anyone .
we were so alone , " zander told deutsche welle .
the director of the buchenwald memorial site foundation , volkhard knigge , hastens to add that all the war-time allies had their own internment camps in germany , emphasizing that of course the soviets too had the right to have such camps after all the cruelty they 'd experienced at the hands of nazi germany .
but he points out that the soviet internment camps differed from those of the western allies .
" buchenwald in particular was a 100 percent stalinist camp between 1945 and its closure in 1950 , " knigge said .
" inmates had no right to complain to anyone .
there was no examination of the facts to establish personal guilt , no case-by-case investigations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a section of the sachsenhausen museum is devoted to soviet special camp no. 7 out of the fire - into the frying pan the last three camps - buchenwald , sachsenhausen and bautzen - were only closed as soviet internment centers in 1950 , several months after the founding of the communist german democratic republic .
some of the inmates were sent on to soviet gulags such as the one at workuta .
others were sentenced to long prison terms after show trials .
others were freed .
" many youngsters were able to start a normal life again , " said knigge .
" but what was difficult for them all was that they could n't openly speak about their experiences in the camps , as east german leaders kept sweeping the issue under the carpet . "
renate zander , the wife of former buchenwald inmate ernst zander , says that even now , the fate of the former detainees is not well known among the general german population .

now , with debt mounting , an economic comeback in 2010 appears increasingly unlikely as the celtic tiger struggles to avoid the fate of greece . the economy of the republic of ireland , until the early 1990s , was rooted firmly in agriculture , largely relying on traditional , farm-based businesses .
but in 1994 , ireland began to experience economic growth that would transform one of europe 's poorest nations into one of its richest .
starting that year , ireland used its educated and under utilized english-speaking workforce , state policies that attracted large american corporations eager to make inroads into the european union market , tolerance towards low-skilled immigrant workers and generous corporate tax benefits to fuel expansive economic growth .
property prices soared as wages increased .
personal and public debt levels decreased dramatically .
the ' celtic tiger ' , as ireland came to be known , became a knowledge-based economy .
the 2007 global downturn ended ireland 's positive run , and the crisis of 2008 sent the country into an economic tailspin .
the government could no longer continue wage increases necessary for workers to pay high home prices , leading to widespread mortgage defaults .
ireland 's housing losses were devastating ; its real estate bubble had grown much faster than that in the rest of europe .
debt levels , at historical lows in 2006 , returned to unmanageable levels .
many of the gains made during the celtic tiger 's boom period have been lost in the last three years .
it could take decades to restore them . bildunterschrift : ireland 's construction sector collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis 2010 forecasts discouraging few economists believe ireland will recover this year .
an official forecast released by the irish government last month predicted an average unemployment rate of 13.2 percent in 2010 . the latest quarterly report from dublin-based economic and social research institute -lrb- esri -rrb- estimates an average jobless rate of 13.75 percent this year .
although much higher than european average , this is a significant downward revision from the institute 's spring 2009 forecast , which put unemployment at almost 17 percent by the end of 2010 .
like greece , spain and portugal , ireland 's biggest problem is debt .
tax revenue declines of 20 percent last year have left ireland operating 25 billion euros over budget this year .
meanwhile , homeowners still are forced to pay expensive mortgages on property which has lost significant value .
home prices fell nearly 20 percent last year , according to esri , and are down more than 30 percent since 2007 .
" it is just tragic when you look at the reversal in debt levels , " erik jones , a professor of european studies at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they worked so hard for so long just to be back where they were -lrb- when the economic revival began in the 1990s -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising debt levels have triggered protests in ireland the road forward the european union is not expected to allow ireland 's fiscal problems to become unmanageable .
the european commission last week made clear that while current action would be limited , greece would not be allowed to fail .
the same promise applies to ireland .
the irish government has helped itself by acting with more fiscal discipline than its greek counterpart .
dublin has made sizeable spending cuts in this year 's budget , and public workers , from low level bureaucrats to top public officials , are expected to earn less this year .
philip lane , a professor of international microeconomics at trinity college dublin attributed ireland 's ability to make difficult cuts to the nature of the irish crisis .
" ireland is feeling the pinch because of the burst of the real estate bubble , " he said .
" greece , meanwhile , has chronically overspent for years . "
" we made the cutbacks in ireland because we knew that wages were growing too quickly , that wages were too high , " lane told deutsche welle .
" we knew we needed to get sensible again . "
lane says that once the crisis passes , ireland should revert to the practices that made the early part of the celtic tiger years successful .
" the real celtic tiger was driven by an export boom .
we got diverted by a domestic construction bubble , " he said .
" we need to get back to international business . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 16.02.2010 tamed ' celtic tiger ' seeks economic comeback großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish government made bailout funds available to banks in 2008 ireland 's economy was once the envy of europe .
now , with debt mounting , an economic comeback in 2010 appears increasingly unlikely as the celtic tiger struggles to avoid the fate of greece . the economy of the republic of ireland , until the early 1990s , was rooted firmly in agriculture , largely relying on traditional , farm-based businesses .
but in 1994 , ireland began to experience economic growth that would transform one of europe 's poorest nations into one of its richest .
starting that year , ireland used its educated and under utilized english-speaking workforce , state policies that attracted large american corporations eager to make inroads into the european union market , tolerance towards low-skilled immigrant workers and generous corporate tax benefits to fuel expansive economic growth .
property prices soared as wages increased .
personal and public debt levels decreased dramatically .
the ' celtic tiger ' , as ireland came to be known , became a knowledge-based economy .
the 2007 global downturn ended ireland 's positive run , and the crisis of 2008 sent the country into an economic tailspin .
the government could no longer continue wage increases necessary for workers to pay high home prices , leading to widespread mortgage defaults .
ireland 's housing losses were devastating ; its real estate bubble had grown much faster than that in the rest of europe .
debt levels , at historical lows in 2006 , returned to unmanageable levels .
many of the gains made during the celtic tiger 's boom period have been lost in the last three years .
it could take decades to restore them . bildunterschrift : ireland 's construction sector collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis 2010 forecasts discouraging few economists believe ireland will recover this year .
an official forecast released by the irish government last month predicted an average unemployment rate of 13.2 percent in 2010 . the latest quarterly report from dublin-based economic and social research institute -lrb- esri -rrb- estimates an average jobless rate of 13.75 percent this year .
although much higher than european average , this is a significant downward revision from the institute 's spring 2009 forecast , which put unemployment at almost 17 percent by the end of 2010 .
like greece , spain and portugal , ireland 's biggest problem is debt .
tax revenue declines of 20 percent last year have left ireland operating 25 billion euros over budget this year .
meanwhile , homeowners still are forced to pay expensive mortgages on property which has lost significant value .
home prices fell nearly 20 percent last year , according to esri , and are down more than 30 percent since 2007 .
" it is just tragic when you look at the reversal in debt levels , " erik jones , a professor of european studies at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they worked so hard for so long just to be back where they were -lrb- when the economic revival began in the 1990s -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising debt levels have triggered protests in ireland the road forward the european union is not expected to allow ireland 's fiscal problems to become unmanageable .
the european commission last week made clear that while current action would be limited , greece would not be allowed to fail .
the same promise applies to ireland .
the irish government has helped itself by acting with more fiscal discipline than its greek counterpart .
dublin has made sizeable spending cuts in this year 's budget , and public workers , from low level bureaucrats to top public officials , are expected to earn less this year .
philip lane , a professor of international microeconomics at trinity college dublin attributed ireland 's ability to make difficult cuts to the nature of the irish crisis .
" ireland is feeling the pinch because of the burst of the real estate bubble , " he said .
" greece , meanwhile , has chronically overspent for years . "
" we made the cutbacks in ireland because we knew that wages were growing too quickly , that wages were too high , " lane told deutsche welle .
" we knew we needed to get sensible again . "
lane says that once the crisis passes , ireland should revert to the practices that made the early part of the celtic tiger years successful .
" the real celtic tiger was driven by an export boom .
we got diverted by a domestic construction bubble , " he said .
" we need to get back to international business . "

the move by tripoli was believed to have been caused by a spat with switzerland . the european commission , the eu 's executive body , has criticized libya 's decision to suspend issuing visas to citizens from the bloc 's schengen area as " unilateral and disproportionate . "
" the commission also regrets that travelers who legally obtained visas before the suspension measure were refused entry when arriving in libya , " said eu commissioner for home affairs cecilia malmstrom .
she added that eu and schengen countries would discuss the matter this week to " consider the appropriate reaction . "
a spokesman for the german foreign ministry said the decision by libya was " regrettable , " adding that the government expected the suspension to be cancelled .
tense ties the move by tripoli appears to be in response to an announcement by swiss authorities on sunday that 188 libyans , including leader moammar gadhafi and his family , are banned from visiting switzerland .
while switzerland is not a member of the eu , it is one of the 25 european countries in the border-free schengen area .
citizens of great britain , ireland , cyprus , bulgaria and romania , which are eu members but not in the schengen zone , were exempt from the decision .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gaddafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .
that event led to libya halting oil exports to switzerland and withdrawing some $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- in assets from swiss banks .
the quarrel threatens to complicate business ties between libya and the eu .

the eu has joined the row on the swiss side but some countries may jump ship if trade ties with tripoli are threatened . on sunday , libya took the decision to stop issuing visas to citizens of the eu schengen free-travel zone - of which non-eu member switzerland is a signatory - escalating the spat caused by switzerland 's travel ban handed out to one of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's sons . the libyan leader 's son hannibal and his spouse joined 186 other libyan figures barred from visiting switzerland after an incident in july 2008 when two hotel servants in geneva complained hannibal had mistreated them . after hannibal and his pregnant wife aline were arrested in geneva , libya cut oil supplies to switzerland and withdrew more than $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.6 billlion euros -rrb- dollars in assets from swiss banks . libya then prevented two swiss businessmen from leaving the country , and subsequently tried them on visa violations . the row flared up again in november last year when switzerland asked the 25 schengen signatories to restrict visas to libyan passport holders . following that request , libyan prime minister baghadadi al-mahmoudi and other senior officials were denied schengen visas , a refusal that libya 's deputy prime minister khalid kaim blamed on the swiss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the libyan leader took his cash out of switzerland last year last week , a tripoli appeals court reduced an earlier , 16-month prison sentence against max goldi , one of the two swiss businessmen held in libya on visa violations , after a court on february 7 acquitted fellow swiss citizen rachid al-hamdani on the same charges . swiss trauma but the row erupted again at the weekend with libya taking steps which not only punish swiss citizens but those from switzerland 's fellow schengen area signatories . isabelle werenfels , senior associate at the middle east and africa research division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that the whole affair , from the start in 2008 to this week 's developments , has been traumatizing for the swiss . " the libyans have made it very hard for the swiss to get out of libya and it has felt at times like they were hostages there , " she said .
" the airlines are still not allowed to fly out of libya .
many people say that the libya situation is actually at the heart of the swiss attitude towards minarets and muslims .
it has been a very difficult time for switzerland . " while the libyan government has not publicly confirmed the reports , or given a public reason for the decision to ban entry to schengen area citizens , the country 's private daily newspaper oea , which is close to gadhafi 's family , carried the story , quoting a " high-ranking " unidentified official who mentioned both the arrest of hannibal gadhafi and the swiss ban on 188 libyan citizens . schengen countries suffer as libya punishes swiss the italian foreign ministry confirmed the ban on its web site soon after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss banned 188 libyans from crossing its borders " libyan authorities have confirmed the suspension of all types of visas for citizens of schengen states .
in addition , they have specified that citizens from schengen states will be denied entry into libya even if they are in possession of a visa , of whatever duration or type , " a statement on its web site read . the passport-free schengen zone comprises 25 nations , including switzerland , iceland , norway and most european union members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania . werenfels said that predicting the effects of the visa ban would be difficult as libya seemed to be employing an arbitrary ban at the moment .
" libya seems to be targeting high-level business people from europe but we 'll see how long that lasts , " she said .
" this would be damaging for libya too .
it remains to be seen if they ban anyone who works for the petrochemical industry , which is very important to libya .
chances are , in two or three days , gadhafi may find a way out of this while saving face . " strong words from eu but little chance of strong action meanwhile , the european commission declared the libyan decision as being " unilateral and disproportionate . " " the commission also regrets that travellers who legally obtained visas before the suspension measure were refused entry when arriving in libya " , said eu commissioner for home affairs , cecilia malmstrom . she added that the commission is set to discuss the issue " before the end of the week " with schengen countries , with a view to " consider the appropriate reaction . " experts believe that the eu 's show of unity towards switzerland will evaporate when important trade and business relations are put at risk by any further escalation on an eu-wide scale . " it is very important for the eu to speak with one voice .
the eu should use the tools that it has , " sawsan chebli , an associate fellow with the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the eu is libya ’ s greatest trade and export partner .
this is a leverage the eu could use .
however , italy and other eu member states with close relations with libya in the past have shown that they are not interested to spoil their relations with libya whatever gadhafi ’ s action may be .
that is not likely to change .
and the problem is that gadhafi knows that he is able to divide the eu . " italians urge swiss to resolve crisis and leave eu out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini told switzerland to leave europe out its row with libya chebli 's opinion was reinforced by a statement from italy which criticized switzerland and urged the swiss to sort out their differences with the north african country and its leadership . switzerland must " resolve this bi-lateral issue ... but not at the expense of everyone else , " italian foreign minister franco frattini said in a television interview , adding that he had stressed to bern the " sensitivity " of the situation . sawsan chebli believes that italy 's attitude highlights a disregard for european solidarity when business ties - which are strong between italy and libya - are concerned . " the italians care very little about the eu or other states when it comes to business relations , " she said . " solidarity is an unknown word in this regard .
frattini was very clear .
he accused switzerland of misusing the schengen agreement to exert pressure on gadhafi and said that bern would take its members ' hostage ' .

the eu has joined the row on the swiss side but some countries may jump ship if trade ties with tripoli are threatened . on sunday , libya took the decision to stop issuing visas to citizens of the eu schengen free-travel zone - of which non-eu member switzerland is a signatory - escalating the spat caused by switzerland 's travel ban handed out to one of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's sons . the libyan leader 's son hannibal and his spouse joined 186 other libyan figures barred from visiting switzerland after an incident in july 2008 when two hotel servants in geneva complained hannibal had mistreated them . after hannibal and his pregnant wife aline were arrested in geneva , libya cut oil supplies to switzerland and withdrew more than $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.6 billlion euros -rrb- dollars in assets from swiss banks . libya then prevented two swiss businessmen from leaving the country , and subsequently tried them on visa violations . the row flared up again in november last year when switzerland asked the 25 schengen signatories to restrict visas to libyan passport holders . following that request , libyan prime minister baghadadi al-mahmoudi and other senior officials were denied schengen visas , a refusal that libya 's deputy prime minister khalid kaim blamed on the swiss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the libyan leader took his cash out of switzerland last year last week , a tripoli appeals court reduced an earlier , 16-month prison sentence against max goldi , one of the two swiss businessmen held in libya on visa violations , after a court on february 7 acquitted fellow swiss citizen rachid al-hamdani on the same charges . swiss trauma but the row erupted again at the weekend with libya taking steps which not only punish swiss citizens but those from switzerland 's fellow schengen area signatories . isabelle werenfels , senior associate at the middle east and africa research division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that the whole affair , from the start in 2008 to this week 's developments , has been traumatizing for the swiss . " the libyans have made it very hard for the swiss to get out of libya and it has felt at times like they were hostages there , " she said .
" the airlines are still not allowed to fly out of libya .
many people say that the libya situation is actually at the heart of the swiss attitude towards minarets and muslims .
it has been a very difficult time for switzerland . " while the libyan government has not publicly confirmed the reports , or given a public reason for the decision to ban entry to schengen area citizens , the country 's private daily newspaper oea , which is close to gadhafi 's family , carried the story , quoting a " high-ranking " unidentified official who mentioned both the arrest of hannibal gadhafi and the swiss ban on 188 libyan citizens . schengen countries suffer as libya punishes swiss the italian foreign ministry confirmed the ban on its web site soon after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss banned 188 libyans from crossing its borders " libyan authorities have confirmed the suspension of all types of visas for citizens of schengen states .
in addition , they have specified that citizens from schengen states will be denied entry into libya even if they are in possession of a visa , of whatever duration or type , " a statement on its web site read . the passport-free schengen zone comprises 25 nations , including switzerland , iceland , norway and most european union members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania . werenfels said that predicting the effects of the visa ban would be difficult as libya seemed to be employing an arbitrary ban at the moment .
" libya seems to be targeting high-level business people from europe but we 'll see how long that lasts , " she said .
" this would be damaging for libya too .
it remains to be seen if they ban anyone who works for the petrochemical industry , which is very important to libya .
chances are , in two or three days , gadhafi may find a way out of this while saving face . " strong words from eu but little chance of strong action meanwhile , the european commission declared the libyan decision as being " unilateral and disproportionate . " " the commission also regrets that travellers who legally obtained visas before the suspension measure were refused entry when arriving in libya " , said eu commissioner for home affairs , cecilia malmstrom . she added that the commission is set to discuss the issue " before the end of the week " with schengen countries , with a view to " consider the appropriate reaction . " experts believe that the eu 's show of unity towards switzerland will evaporate when important trade and business relations are put at risk by any further escalation on an eu-wide scale . " it is very important for the eu to speak with one voice .
the eu should use the tools that it has , " sawsan chebli , an associate fellow with the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" the eu is libya ’ s greatest trade and export partner .
this is a leverage the eu could use .
however , italy and other eu member states with close relations with libya in the past have shown that they are not interested to spoil their relations with libya whatever gadhafi ’ s action may be .
that is not likely to change .
and the problem is that gadhafi knows that he is able to divide the eu .

" the italians care very little about the eu or other states when it comes to business relations , " she said . " solidarity is an unknown word in this regard .

the eu has joined the row on the swiss side but some countries may jump ship if trade ties with tripoli are threatened . on sunday , libya took the decision to stop issuing visas to citizens of the eu schengen free-travel zone - of which non-eu member switzerland is a signatory - escalating the spat caused by switzerland 's travel ban handed out to one of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's sons . the libyan leader 's son hannibal and his spouse joined 186 other libyan figures barred from visiting switzerland after an incident in july 2008 when two hotel servants in geneva complained hannibal had mistreated them . after hannibal and his pregnant wife aline were arrested in geneva , libya cut oil supplies to switzerland and withdrew more than $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.6 billlion euros -rrb- dollars in assets from swiss banks . libya then prevented two swiss businessmen from leaving the country , and subsequently tried them on visa violations . the row flared up again in november last year when switzerland asked the 25 schengen signatories to restrict visas to libyan passport holders . following that request , libyan prime minister baghadadi al-mahmoudi and other senior officials were denied schengen visas , a refusal that libya 's deputy prime minister khalid kaim blamed on the swiss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the libyan leader took his cash out of switzerland last year last week , a tripoli appeals court reduced an earlier , 16-month prison sentence against max goldi , one of the two swiss businessmen held in libya on visa violations , after a court on february 7 acquitted fellow swiss citizen rachid al-hamdani on the same charges . swiss trauma but the row erupted again at the weekend with libya taking steps which not only punish swiss citizens but those from switzerland 's fellow schengen area signatories . isabelle werenfels , senior associate at the middle east and africa research division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that the whole affair , from the start in 2008 to this week 's developments , has been traumatizing for the swiss .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 16.02.2010 uk mulls ' green bonds ' to spur infrastructure investment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed bonds are meant to help fund the renewable energy industry britain is reportedly examining the idea of launching green bonds to boost the renewable energy sector amid cash flow snags .
but will they have the desired effect of easing funding bottlenecks ? the economic secretary to the uk 's finance ministry , ian pearson , said in an interview published in the financial times newspaper on monday that the government was considering introducing so-called “ green bonds ” to the public to help fund the renewable energy industry .
pearson said that he had asked officials to examine a proposal that would see national savings and investments - a treasury-based unit - issue the bonds for sustainable infrastructure projects .
debt by any other name … dr. martin weale , director of the national institute of economic and social research -lrb- niesr -rrb- , an independent london-based think tank , told deutsche welle that such a move would basically amount to government borrowing , regardless of what name it ’ s given .
“ if it ’ s something that makes people happier about lending to the government – assuming the government is issuing them – or if it makes it possible for the government to borrow more cheaply than would otherwise be the case , then it seems to be it ’ s a good idea , ” dr. weale said .
“ fundamentally , what matters is actually paying for spending that ’ s done , whether it ’ s a green idea or anything else , and if you finance it by borrowing , it doesn ’ t matter too much what you call it , ” he said , adding that investors would need to look at the likely yields of such bonds .
proponents of the green bonds are describing them as a new way to finance infrastructure projects at a time when the government is struggling to balance its books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. weale says emotive captions persuaded people to invest in wartime bonds however , dr. weale points out that it won ’ t actually reduce the amount of government borrowing .
“ when we look at how much the government is borrowing and whether it can afford it , people will take green bonds into account just as much as anything else , ” he said .
he draws an analogy between last century ’ s wartime borrowing in britain and the current trends .
“ in many ways it ’ s rather similar to something we saw in the twentieth century : we had defense bonds and we had war loans .
and those were names given to government debt to make it easier or persuade people to buy it , ” he explained .
long-term contracts planned the finance ministry ’ s ian pearson was also quoted as saying the government was looking to offer long-term support to wind energy and green waste companies .
" we are thinking of going direct to companies looking to establish energy from waste and wind farm projects and offering them long-term contracts that would both get the public sector a good deal on price but also get the projects off the ground , " he told the financial times .
" if they had , say , a 15-year contract to supply the public sector , that should make it easier for them to raise finance to get the projects going , while tying in with the green agenda , " pearson added .
experts like dr. weale agree that there ’ s an argument for such long-term contracts .
“ we know that at current prices many so-called green schemes are highly uneconomic .
and since the government doesn ’ t want to do the obvious thing , which is to impose a proper charge for carbon emissions , what they are proposing seems to me the next best , ” he conceded .
kfw as a model ?
also under consideration is the idea of establishing a state-run infrastructure bank to help fund energy and other infrastructure projects in the country .
some analysts have pointed to the enormous amount of investments needed for energy infrastructure not only in britain but across europe .
however , there are doubts about how such projects can be financed at a time when credit flow remains a problem as the global economy slowly recovers from recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infrastructure bank on the lines of germany 's kfw bank has been mooted as a means of mobilizing capital for such purposes , some analysts in the uk have suggested setting up an infrastructure bank on the lines of germany ’ s state-owned development bank kfw .
competition for private banks some analysts say the proposal could set off alarm bells for private sector banks .
however , dr. weale from the niesr disagrees .
“ i think private sector banks aren ’ t terribly worried about competition .
they ’ re very short of capital .
they are not wanting to lend - as far as one can tell .
and if they ’ re not wanting to lend , they shouldn ’ t be upset that other people are doing the lending instead , ” he said .
dr. weale says that if the private sector banks were to raise more capital , perhaps they could compete for that sort of business as well .

the move by tripoli was believed to have been caused by a spat with switzerland . the european commission , the eu 's executive body , has criticized libya 's decision to suspend issuing visas to citizens from the bloc 's schengen area as " unilateral and disproportionate . "
" the commission also regrets that travelers who legally obtained visas before the suspension measure were refused entry when arriving in libya , " said eu commissioner for home affairs cecilia malmstrom .
she added that eu and schengen countries would discuss the matter this week to " consider the appropriate reaction . "
a spokesman for the german foreign ministry said the decision by libya was " regrettable , " adding that the government expected the suspension to be cancelled .
tense ties the move by tripoli appears to be in response to an announcement by swiss authorities on sunday that 188 libyans , including leader moammar gadhafi and his family , are banned from visiting switzerland .
while switzerland is not a member of the eu , it is one of the 25 european countries in the border-free schengen area .
citizens of great britain , ireland , cyprus , bulgaria and romania , which are eu members but not in the schengen zone , were exempt from the decision .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gaddafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .
that event led to libya halting oil exports to switzerland and withdrawing some $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- in assets from swiss banks .
the quarrel threatens to complicate business ties between libya and the eu .

bayern fans will fondly remember the four seasons that roy makaay led the line , scoring 78 goals in 129 games for the bavarian giants and helping them to a number of titles . meanwhile , before the current crop of dutch stars at hamburg , hsv supporters may look back with misty eyes at the silky skills of rafael van der vaart , the obstinate defending of khalid boulahrouz -lrb- now at stuttgart -rrb- and the classy midfield marshalling of nigel de jong . players benefit despite lack of total football ethos in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch coach rinus michels developed total football the dutch became famous for developing and executing the concept of total football , a tactical approach in which any player who moves out of his position is replaced by another from his team .
with no player fixed in his nominal role ; anyone can be successively an attacker , a midfielder and a defender thus retaining the team 's intended organizational structure . while german teams find strength in the rigidity of roles within their tactical structures , this does n't seem to stifle dutch stars .
in fact they tend to excel by using their individual talents in their preferred role . jan roskett believes the dutch prosper mainly because of their desire to win and play good , attractive soccer .
systems and formations are just a means to an end . " for decades , the dutch school - ball possession , dominance , attacks via creative wingers , full backs pushing up , players taking over other positions - was synonymous with a 4-3-3 formation , " said roskott . " but a line-up system is just a series of numbers and does n't say anything about the intent .
the dutch school normally means : playing dominantly and determining the play .
this was how we played football for years .
the ultimate proof of a successful system is results .
the dutch are happy if they can get the result with good football , attractive attacking pass-and-move play which results in prizes - which is what the dutch school was all about anyway .

personal and public debt levels decreased dramatically .
the ' celtic tiger ' , as ireland came to be known , became a knowledge-based economy .
the 2007 global downturn ended ireland 's positive run , and the crisis of 2008 sent the country into an economic tailspin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 16.02.2010 current stars continue dutch habit of taking bundesliga by storm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutchmen like robben and van nistelrooy now excite germany coming from the country that created " total football , " a fluid tactical approach with changing roles , one could think dutch soccer stars may feel stifled in germany 's disciplined systems .
not so - in fact , they flourish . it took ruud van nistelrooy just 10 minutes on saturday to make the kind of impact hamburg were hoping for from the dutch striker when they bought him from real madrid in the january transfer window .
the former manchester united star came on as a second half substitute in hamburg 's game against stuttgart and with the score at 1-1 , van nistelrooy struck in the 75th and 77th minutes to seal a 3-1 victory for his new team . the imposing dutch forward was supposed to be a spent force when hamburg rescued him from an increasingly frustrating spell with spanish giants real .
despite winning two league titles with madrid in his three-and-a-half seasons with them , and scoring 46 goals in 68 appearances for los blancos , the latest galacticos policy at the santiago bernabeu left van nistelrooy out in the cold and surplus to requirements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy showed he 's far from a washed-up has-been " depending on how he 's used , ruud can still be a sensation and will do very well in the bundesliga if he 's used smartly and is allowed his rest , " said jan roskott , dutch soccer correspondent for the offside.com . " his biggest strength - in my view - is his focus and his mental strength .
he 's a real killer .
the thing with ruud is , his scoring ratio is high .
hamburg play offensive football , so if ruud gets four chances to score , he 'll convert at least one of those chances .
he 's also a real team player and he allows others to play better .
i 'm not sure if he has 40 games or more in him , though , but if he remains fit , he could well have another good three years in him . " bundesliga helps robben rediscover frightening flair another dutchman who was frozen out at real madrid only to find a warmer welcome in germany is arjen robben .
the dutch winger struck again at the weekend in bayern 's 3-1 victory over borussia dortmund to bring his season total for bayern munich to eight goals in 14 games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben is a player reborn at bayern munich this season robben has been a player transformed in the bundesliga since arriving last summer .
he performed fitfully at real and rarely produced the kind of displays which convinced madrid to pay chelsea 25 million euros -lrb- $ 34 million -rrb- for his services in 2007 .
the former psv eindhoven flyer scared the living daylights out of english defenses in his three seasons in west london and the speed , directness and hunger for goals which punctuated his chelsea career seem to have been rediscovered at bayern . " dutch players have the benefit of being very familiar with german football , german culture and the german language , " said kai de graff from dutch soccer fanzine dagelijkse voetbal . " they fit in pretty seamlessly into the way of life which always makes the transition to a new club and league easier .
dutch players are very intelligent and have great knowledge of the game , which makes them adaptable .
although dutch football is a lot about finesse , they also thrive in physical leagues like germany .
i think they 're also quite technically gifted and when allowed to play can show great skill .
the bundesliga is a league which gives such players space and time to be creative . " dutchmen flourish in their home from home this seamless integration into german soccer for dutch stars has seen a host of top players grace the bundesliga stage in recent years .
bayern fans will fondly remember the four seasons that roy makaay led the line , scoring 78 goals in 129 games for the bavarian giants and helping them to a number of titles . meanwhile , before the current crop of dutch stars at hamburg , hsv supporters may look back with misty eyes at the silky skills of rafael van der vaart , the obstinate defending of khalid boulahrouz -lrb- now at stuttgart -rrb- and the classy midfield marshalling of nigel de jong . players benefit despite lack of total football ethos in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch coach rinus michels developed total football the dutch became famous for developing and executing the concept of total football , a tactical approach in which any player who moves out of his position is replaced by another from his team .

systems and formations are just a means to an end . " for decades , the dutch school - ball possession , dominance , attacks via creative wingers , full backs pushing up , players taking over other positions - was synonymous with a 4-3-3 formation , " said roskott . " but a line-up system is just a series of numbers and does n't say anything about the intent .
the dutch school normally means : playing dominantly and determining the play .
this was how we played football for years .
the ultimate proof of a successful system is results .
the dutch are happy if they can get the result with good football , attractive attacking pass-and-move play which results in prizes - which is what the dutch school was all about anyway .

not so - in fact , they flourish . it took ruud van nistelrooy just 10 minutes on saturday to make the kind of impact hamburg were hoping for from the dutch striker when they bought him from real madrid in the january transfer window .
the former manchester united star came on as a second half substitute in hamburg 's game against stuttgart and with the score at 1-1 , van nistelrooy struck in the 75th and 77th minutes to seal a 3-1 victory for his new team . the imposing dutch forward was supposed to be a spent force when hamburg rescued him from an increasingly frustrating spell with spanish giants real .
despite winning two league titles with madrid in his three-and-a-half seasons with them , and scoring 46 goals in 68 appearances for los blancos , the latest galacticos policy at the santiago bernabeu left van nistelrooy out in the cold and surplus to requirements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy showed he 's far from a washed-up has-been " depending on how he 's used , ruud can still be a sensation and will do very well in the bundesliga if he 's used smartly and is allowed his rest , " said jan roskott , dutch soccer correspondent for the offside.com . " his biggest strength - in my view - is his focus and his mental strength .
he 's a real killer .
the thing with ruud is , his scoring ratio is high .
hamburg play offensive football , so if ruud gets four chances to score , he 'll convert at least one of those chances .
he 's also a real team player and he allows others to play better .
i 'm not sure if he has 40 games or more in him , though , but if he remains fit , he could well have another good three years in him . " bundesliga helps robben rediscover frightening flair another dutchman who was frozen out at real madrid only to find a warmer welcome in germany is arjen robben .
the dutch winger struck again at the weekend in bayern 's 3-1 victory over borussia dortmund to bring his season total for bayern munich to eight goals in 14 games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben is a player reborn at bayern munich this season robben has been a player transformed in the bundesliga since arriving last summer .
he performed fitfully at real and rarely produced the kind of displays which convinced madrid to pay chelsea 25 million euros -lrb- $ 34 million -rrb- for his services in 2007 .
the former psv eindhoven flyer scared the living daylights out of english defenses in his three seasons in west london and the speed , directness and hunger for goals which punctuated his chelsea career seem to have been rediscovered at bayern . " dutch players have the benefit of being very familiar with german football , german culture and the german language , " said kai de graff from dutch soccer fanzine dagelijkse voetbal . " they fit in pretty seamlessly into the way of life which always makes the transition to a new club and league easier .
dutch players are very intelligent and have great knowledge of the game , which makes them adaptable .
although dutch football is a lot about finesse , they also thrive in physical leagues like germany .
i think they 're also quite technically gifted and when allowed to play can show great skill .
the bundesliga is a league which gives such players space and time to be creative . " dutchmen flourish in their home from home this seamless integration into german soccer for dutch stars has seen a host of top players grace the bundesliga stage in recent years .
bayern fans will fondly remember the four seasons that roy makaay led the line , scoring 78 goals in 129 games for the bavarian giants and helping them to a number of titles . meanwhile , before the current crop of dutch stars at hamburg , hsv supporters may look back with misty eyes at the silky skills of rafael van der vaart , the obstinate defending of khalid boulahrouz -lrb- now at stuttgart -rrb- and the classy midfield marshalling of nigel de jong . players benefit despite lack of total football ethos in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch coach rinus michels developed total football the dutch became famous for developing and executing the concept of total football , a tactical approach in which any player who moves out of his position is replaced by another from his team .
with no player fixed in his nominal role ; anyone can be successively an attacker , a midfielder and a defender thus retaining the team 's intended organizational structure . while german teams find strength in the rigidity of roles within their tactical structures , this does n't seem to stifle dutch stars .
in fact they tend to excel by using their individual talents in their preferred role . jan roskett believes the dutch prosper mainly because of their desire to win and play good , attractive soccer .
systems and formations are just a means to an end . " for decades , the dutch school - ball possession , dominance , attacks via creative wingers , full backs pushing up , players taking over other positions - was synonymous with a 4-3-3 formation , " said roskott . " but a line-up system is just a series of numbers and does n't say anything about the intent .
the dutch school normally means : playing dominantly and determining the play .
this was how we played football for years .
the ultimate proof of a successful system is results .
the dutch are happy if they can get the result with good football , attractive attacking pass-and-move play which results in prizes - which is what the dutch school was all about anyway .

i think they 're also quite technically gifted and when allowed to play can show great skill .
the bundesliga is a league which gives such players space and time to be creative . " dutchmen flourish in their home from home this seamless integration into german soccer for dutch stars has seen a host of top players grace the bundesliga stage in recent years .
bayern fans will fondly remember the four seasons that roy makaay led the line , scoring 78 goals in 129 games for the bavarian giants and helping them to a number of titles . meanwhile , before the current crop of dutch stars at hamburg , hsv supporters may look back with misty eyes at the silky skills of rafael van der vaart , the obstinate defending of khalid boulahrouz -lrb- now at stuttgart -rrb- and the classy midfield marshalling of nigel de jong . players benefit despite lack of total football ethos in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch coach rinus michels developed total football the dutch became famous for developing and executing the concept of total football , a tactical approach in which any player who moves out of his position is replaced by another from his team .
with no player fixed in his nominal role ; anyone can be successively an attacker , a midfielder and a defender thus retaining the team 's intended organizational structure . while german teams find strength in the rigidity of roles within their tactical structures , this does n't seem to stifle dutch stars .
in fact they tend to excel by using their individual talents in their preferred role . jan roskett believes the dutch prosper mainly because of their desire to win and play good , attractive soccer .
systems and formations are just a means to an end . " for decades , the dutch school - ball possession , dominance , attacks via creative wingers , full backs pushing up , players taking over other positions - was synonymous with a 4-3-3 formation , " said roskott . " but a line-up system is just a series of numbers and does n't say anything about the intent .
the dutch school normally means : playing dominantly and determining the play .
this was how we played football for years .
the ultimate proof of a successful system is results .
the dutch are happy if they can get the result with good football , attractive attacking pass-and-move play which results in prizes - which is what the dutch school was all about anyway .

the eu has joined the row on the swiss side but some countries may jump ship if trade ties with tripoli are threatened . on sunday , libya took the decision to stop issuing visas to citizens of the eu schengen free-travel zone - of which non-eu member switzerland is a signatory - escalating the spat caused by switzerland 's travel ban handed out to one of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's sons . the libyan leader 's son hannibal and his spouse joined 186 other libyan figures barred from visiting switzerland after an incident in july 2008 when two hotel servants in geneva complained hannibal had mistreated them . after hannibal and his pregnant wife aline were arrested in geneva , libya cut oil supplies to switzerland and withdrew more than $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.6 billlion euros -rrb- dollars in assets from swiss banks . libya then prevented two swiss businessmen from leaving the country , and subsequently tried them on visa violations . the row flared up again in november last year when switzerland asked the 25 schengen signatories to restrict visas to libyan passport holders . following that request , libyan prime minister baghadadi al-mahmoudi and other senior officials were denied schengen visas , a refusal that libya 's deputy prime minister khalid kaim blamed on the swiss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the libyan leader took his cash out of switzerland last year last week , a tripoli appeals court reduced an earlier , 16-month prison sentence against max goldi , one of the two swiss businessmen held in libya on visa violations , after a court on february 7 acquitted fellow swiss citizen rachid al-hamdani on the same charges . swiss trauma but the row erupted again at the weekend with libya taking steps which not only punish swiss citizens but those from switzerland 's fellow schengen area signatories . isabelle werenfels , senior associate at the middle east and africa research division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that the whole affair , from the start in 2008 to this week 's developments , has been traumatizing for the swiss . " the libyans have made it very hard for the swiss to get out of libya and it has felt at times like they were hostages there , " she said .
" the airlines are still not allowed to fly out of libya .
many people say that the libya situation is actually at the heart of the swiss attitude towards minarets and muslims .
it has been a very difficult time for switzerland . " while the libyan government has not publicly confirmed the reports , or given a public reason for the decision to ban entry to schengen area citizens , the country 's private daily newspaper oea , which is close to gadhafi 's family , carried the story , quoting a " high-ranking " unidentified official who mentioned both the arrest of hannibal gadhafi and the swiss ban on 188 libyan citizens . schengen countries suffer as libya punishes swiss the italian foreign ministry confirmed the ban on its web site soon after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss banned 188 libyans from crossing its borders " libyan authorities have confirmed the suspension of all types of visas for citizens of schengen states .
in addition , they have specified that citizens from schengen states will be denied entry into libya even if they are in possession of a visa , of whatever duration or type , " a statement on its web site read . the passport-free schengen zone comprises 25 nations , including switzerland , iceland , norway and most european union members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania . werenfels said that predicting the effects of the visa ban would be difficult as libya seemed to be employing an arbitrary ban at the moment .
" libya seems to be targeting high-level business people from europe but we 'll see how long that lasts , " she said .
" this would be damaging for libya too .
it remains to be seen if they ban anyone who works for the petrochemical industry , which is very important to libya .
chances are , in two or three days , gadhafi may find a way out of this while saving face . " strong words from eu but little chance of strong action meanwhile , the european commission declared the libyan decision as being " unilateral and disproportionate . " " the commission also regrets that travellers who legally obtained visas before the suspension measure were refused entry when arriving in libya " , said eu commissioner for home affairs , cecilia malmstrom . she added that the commission is set to discuss the issue " before the end of the week " with schengen countries , with a view to " consider the appropriate reaction .

this is a leverage the eu could use .
however , italy and other eu member states with close relations with libya in the past have shown that they are not interested to spoil their relations with libya whatever gadhafi ’ s action may be .

the eu has joined the row on the swiss side but some countries may jump ship if trade ties with tripoli are threatened . on sunday , libya took the decision to stop issuing visas to citizens of the eu schengen free-travel zone - of which non-eu member switzerland is a signatory - escalating the spat caused by switzerland 's travel ban handed out to one of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's sons . the libyan leader 's son hannibal and his spouse joined 186 other libyan figures barred from visiting switzerland after an incident in july 2008 when two hotel servants in geneva complained hannibal had mistreated them . after hannibal and his pregnant wife aline were arrested in geneva , libya cut oil supplies to switzerland and withdrew more than $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.6 billlion euros -rrb- dollars in assets from swiss banks . libya then prevented two swiss businessmen from leaving the country , and subsequently tried them on visa violations . the row flared up again in november last year when switzerland asked the 25 schengen signatories to restrict visas to libyan passport holders . following that request , libyan prime minister baghadadi al-mahmoudi and other senior officials were denied schengen visas , a refusal that libya 's deputy prime minister khalid kaim blamed on the swiss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the libyan leader took his cash out of switzerland last year last week , a tripoli appeals court reduced an earlier , 16-month prison sentence against max goldi , one of the two swiss businessmen held in libya on visa violations , after a court on february 7 acquitted fellow swiss citizen rachid al-hamdani on the same charges . swiss trauma but the row erupted again at the weekend with libya taking steps which not only punish swiss citizens but those from switzerland 's fellow schengen area signatories . isabelle werenfels , senior associate at the middle east and africa research division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that the whole affair , from the start in 2008 to this week 's developments , has been traumatizing for the swiss . " the libyans have made it very hard for the swiss to get out of libya and it has felt at times like they were hostages there , " she said .

many people say that the libya situation is actually at the heart of the swiss attitude towards minarets and muslims .
it has been a very difficult time for switzerland . " while the libyan government has not publicly confirmed the reports , or given a public reason for the decision to ban entry to schengen area citizens , the country 's private daily newspaper oea , which is close to gadhafi 's family , carried the story , quoting a " high-ranking " unidentified official who mentioned both the arrest of hannibal gadhafi and the swiss ban on 188 libyan citizens . schengen countries suffer as libya punishes swiss the italian foreign ministry confirmed the ban on its web site soon after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss banned 188 libyans from crossing its borders " libyan authorities have confirmed the suspension of all types of visas for citizens of schengen states .
in addition , they have specified that citizens from schengen states will be denied entry into libya even if they are in possession of a visa , of whatever duration or type , " a statement on its web site read . the passport-free schengen zone comprises 25 nations , including switzerland , iceland , norway and most european union members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania . werenfels said that predicting the effects of the visa ban would be difficult as libya seemed to be employing an arbitrary ban at the moment .

the eu has joined the row on the swiss side but some countries may jump ship if trade ties with tripoli are threatened . on sunday , libya took the decision to stop issuing visas to citizens of the eu schengen free-travel zone - of which non-eu member switzerland is a signatory - escalating the spat caused by switzerland 's travel ban handed out to one of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's sons . the libyan leader 's son hannibal and his spouse joined 186 other libyan figures barred from visiting switzerland after an incident in july 2008 when two hotel servants in geneva complained hannibal had mistreated them . after hannibal and his pregnant wife aline were arrested in geneva , libya cut oil supplies to switzerland and withdrew more than $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.6 billlion euros -rrb- dollars in assets from swiss banks . libya then prevented two swiss businessmen from leaving the country , and subsequently tried them on visa violations . the row flared up again in november last year when switzerland asked the 25 schengen signatories to restrict visas to libyan passport holders . following that request , libyan prime minister baghadadi al-mahmoudi and other senior officials were denied schengen visas , a refusal that libya 's deputy prime minister khalid kaim blamed on the swiss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the libyan leader took his cash out of switzerland last year last week , a tripoli appeals court reduced an earlier , 16-month prison sentence against max goldi , one of the two swiss businessmen held in libya on visa violations , after a court on february 7 acquitted fellow swiss citizen rachid al-hamdani on the same charges . swiss trauma but the row erupted again at the weekend with libya taking steps which not only punish swiss citizens but those from switzerland 's fellow schengen area signatories . isabelle werenfels , senior associate at the middle east and africa research division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that the whole affair , from the start in 2008 to this week 's developments , has been traumatizing for the swiss .

it has been a very difficult time for switzerland . " while the libyan government has not publicly confirmed the reports , or given a public reason for the decision to ban entry to schengen area citizens , the country 's private daily newspaper oea , which is close to gadhafi 's family , carried the story , quoting a " high-ranking " unidentified official who mentioned both the arrest of hannibal gadhafi and the swiss ban on 188 libyan citizens . schengen countries suffer as libya punishes swiss the italian foreign ministry confirmed the ban on its web site soon after . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss banned 188 libyans from crossing its borders " libyan authorities have confirmed the suspension of all types of visas for citizens of schengen states .
in addition , they have specified that citizens from schengen states will be denied entry into libya even if they are in possession of a visa , of whatever duration or type , " a statement on its web site read . the passport-free schengen zone comprises 25 nations , including switzerland , iceland , norway and most european union members except britain , ireland , bulgaria and romania . werenfels said that predicting the effects of the visa ban would be difficult as libya seemed to be employing an arbitrary ban at the moment .
" libya seems to be targeting high-level business people from europe but we 'll see how long that lasts , " she said .
" this would be damaging for libya too .

greece 's financial woes started decades ago when the country was ruled by one socialist regime after another .
now experts warn that unless greece learns from its financial history , it is bound to repeat it . who would have imagined it ?
greece could soon be bankrupt and there are some speculations that athens will begin refusing payment on its obligations .
due to massive debt and doctored data , greece has lost the trust of both the european union and the financial markets .
and it 's not looking good for athens , despite an eu security net .
greece currently owes foreign banks more than $ 300 billion -lrb- 219.8 billion euros -rrb- , which equals 115 percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
their current debt amounts to more then 12.7 percent of their economic output .
but how did it get this far ?
spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "
repeating history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overspending led to greece 's current situation this is not new territory for greece .
back in the 1980 's and 1990 's the country faced similar financial difficulties .
back then the socialist governments solved the problem by devaluing the country 's former currency , the drachma .
that way they were able to shrink imports and raise exports .
but economic expert babi papadimitriou said this option became unavailable when greece entered into the euro zone . over the past few years the political elite and the greek government have not really grasped what it means to be a member of the euro zone , the economist said .
" it goes without saying that you have to reduce your deficit as much as possible when you share your currency with other countries , " he said .
" but those in power have ignored this principle .
and the necessary reforms were never imposed . "
the state acted irresponsibly as costs began to mount and the ability for the economy to compete on an international level was reduced .
when added to the global financial crisis that hit back in 2008 , these structural weak points became a full-blown nightmare .
cutting costs the country 's biggest problem is the state itself and the services it offers .
according to professor paraskewopoulos , the largest share of savings could come from cutting the costs incurred by public employees : reducing tax exceptions , putting a hiring freeze on state offices and reducing employee salaries .
along with this , he said the government needs to tackle two other major hurdles : tax evasion and corruption . each year the greek government loses 20 billion euros in unpaid taxes , and it is estimated that the average greek family pays out some 1,600 euros annually in bribes .
notoriously , things rarely work in the country without a little money to grease the wheels .
bildunterschrift : greek prime minister george papandreou has some very unenviable choices to make " those in power have always rewarded those loyal to them with cushy jobs and now we have a bloated government that costs an inconceivable amount of money .
that 's where you have to start , " explained paraskewopoulos .
" of course that 's easy to say , but to really do it , you have to be prepared to deal with the people affected . "
and that is exactly what papandreou 's government is facing at the moment .
the public sector has gone on strike and indignant farmers are blocking the motorways and border crossings .
however , both experts agree that unless they get rid of the subsidies and begin to privatize state agencies , cleaning up the financial mess will be impossible .

greece 's financial woes started decades ago when the country was ruled by one socialist regime after another .
now experts warn that unless greece learns from its financial history , it is bound to repeat it . who would have imagined it ?
greece could soon be bankrupt and there are some speculations that athens will begin refusing payment on its obligations .
due to massive debt and doctored data , greece has lost the trust of both the european union and the financial markets .
and it 's not looking good for athens , despite an eu security net .
greece currently owes foreign banks more than $ 300 billion -lrb- 219.8 billion euros -rrb- , which equals 115 percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
their current debt amounts to more then 12.7 percent of their economic output .
but how did it get this far ?
spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "
repeating history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overspending led to greece 's current situation this is not new territory for greece .
back in the 1980 's and 1990 's the country faced similar financial difficulties .

the eu offered its support , but no firm commitments on specific aid . at a european union meeting in brussels , finance ministers from germany , sweden and austria told greece it needs to do more to bring its runaway debt under control and calm worried financial markets .
joerg asmussen , germany 's deputy finance minister , advised greece to follow the lead of ireland and latvia , eu countries which are slashing spending in an effort to rein in their financial troubles .
" we made it clear the ball is in greece 's court , " asmussen said .
" additional measures by greece are needed . "
a statement issued by the ministers after the meeting said although greece has until march 16 to prove it has taken initial steps towards reducing its budgetary deficit by four percent , they will likely demand more budget cuts or tax hikes to prevent wider financial troubles .
the four percent reduction is the first step in a plan to eventually reduce the deficit from 12.7 percent of gdp to less than three percent in 2012 .
" the pressure on greece to consider further measures by march 16 has clearly increased , " said austrian finance minister josef proell .

greek finance minister george papaconstantinou told reporters after the meeting that the country is already ahead of its deficit reduction goals , adding that a one-off tax on large companies had resulted in a january surplus .
papaconstantinou , who warned on monday that his government would need more than a day to turn things around , said the pledge of support should act as a deterrent if financial markets increased the pressure on greece or other euro zone countries .

the eu offered its support , but no firm commitments on specific aid . at a european union meeting in brussels , finance ministers from germany , sweden and austria told greece it needs to do more to bring its runaway debt under control and calm worried financial markets .
joerg asmussen , germany 's deputy finance minister , advised greece to follow the lead of ireland and latvia , eu countries which are slashing spending in an effort to rein in their financial troubles .
" we made it clear the ball is in greece 's court , " asmussen said .
" additional measures by greece are needed . "
a statement issued by the ministers after the meeting said although greece has until march 16 to prove it has taken initial steps towards reducing its budgetary deficit by four percent , they will likely demand more budget cuts or tax hikes to prevent wider financial troubles .
the four percent reduction is the first step in a plan to eventually reduce the deficit from 12.7 percent of gdp to less than three percent in 2012 .
" the pressure on greece to consider further measures by march 16 has clearly increased , " said austrian finance minister josef proell .

papaconstantinou , who warned on monday that his government would need more than a day to turn things around , said the pledge of support should act as a deterrent if financial markets increased the pressure on greece or other euro zone countries .

little was known about the soviet camps until after the fall of the east german regime . sixty years ago on monday , the last inmates were reported to have been released from the last of a total of 10 internment camps that the russians had set up in what was then the soviet zone of occupation in germany .
their existence had become a thorn in the side of the founding fathers of communist east germany , who were left to deal with requests from the inmates ' family members to tell them what had happened to the prisoners .
documents that became available only after german unification in 1990 indicate that up to 176,000 inmates were held in the soviets ' " special camps . "
thirty-five percent of the detainees are thought to have died there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst zander , here with his wife renate , is unable to forget some of those who survived the camp at buchenwald , which is now a memorial site , met with historians there on saturday to talk about their personal experiences and the latest scientific findings about the soviet camps .
eyewitnesses still able to tell their story ernst zander was a youngster when he was captured by the soviets after the war .
after doing time at a prison at jamlitz , he was sent on to buchenwald .
the nazis had used the site as a concentration camp , where an estimated 50,000 people were executed , starved or worked to death .
after world war ii , the soviets used the same facility for one of their biggest internment camps . zander ended up there , because the russians accused him of being a " wehrwolf " - the standard term back then for a german who tried to fight soviet tanks and machinery as the red army advanced toward berlin in the final stages of the war .
he denies these allegations , saying that he was imprisoned for no crime at all .
he says the conditions he and other prisoners faced at the buchenwald camp were harsh .
" our family did not know we were being held in the camp .
we could not write to anyone .
we were so alone , " zander told deutsche welle .
the director of the buchenwald memorial site foundation , volkhard knigge , hastens to add that all the war-time allies had their own internment camps in germany , emphasizing that of course the soviets too had the right to have such camps after all the cruelty they 'd experienced at the hands of nazi germany .
but he points out that the soviet internment camps differed from those of the western allies .
" buchenwald in particular was a 100 percent stalinist camp between 1945 and its closure in 1950 , " knigge said .
" inmates had no right to complain to anyone .
there was no examination of the facts to establish personal guilt , no case-by-case investigations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a section of the sachsenhausen museum is devoted to soviet special camp no. 7 out of the fire - into the frying pan the last three camps - buchenwald , sachsenhausen and bautzen - were only closed as soviet internment centers in 1950 , several months after the founding of the communist german democratic republic .
some of the inmates were sent on to soviet gulags such as the one at workuta .
others were sentenced to long prison terms after show trials .
others were freed .
" many youngsters were able to start a normal life again , " said knigge .
" but what was difficult for them all was that they could n't openly speak about their experiences in the camps , as east german leaders kept sweeping the issue under the carpet . "
renate zander , the wife of former buchenwald inmate ernst zander , says that even now , the fate of the former detainees is not well known among the general german population .
" teachers here usually do n't want to talk about the events after 1945 , " she said .
" we have seven grandchildren , and they say that they only hear about the holocaust period when talking about the history of the camps at buchenwald and elsewhere .
nobody asks about the later events , because they 're not in the teachers ' minds . "
she also said that she sees little hope that this will be added to school curriculums anytime soon .

little was known about the soviet camps until after the fall of the east german regime . sixty years ago on monday , the last inmates were reported to have been released from the last of a total of 10 internment camps that the russians had set up in what was then the soviet zone of occupation in germany .
their existence had become a thorn in the side of the founding fathers of communist east germany , who were left to deal with requests from the inmates ' family members to tell them what had happened to the prisoners .
documents that became available only after german unification in 1990 indicate that up to 176,000 inmates were held in the soviets ' " special camps . "
thirty-five percent of the detainees are thought to have died there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst zander , here with his wife renate , is unable to forget some of those who survived the camp at buchenwald , which is now a memorial site , met with historians there on saturday to talk about their personal experiences and the latest scientific findings about the soviet camps .
eyewitnesses still able to tell their story ernst zander was a youngster when he was captured by the soviets after the war .
after doing time at a prison at jamlitz , he was sent on to buchenwald .
the nazis had used the site as a concentration camp , where an estimated 50,000 people were executed , starved or worked to death .
after world war ii , the soviets used the same facility for one of their biggest internment camps . zander ended up there , because the russians accused him of being a " wehrwolf " - the standard term back then for a german who tried to fight soviet tanks and machinery as the red army advanced toward berlin in the final stages of the war .
he denies these allegations , saying that he was imprisoned for no crime at all .
he says the conditions he and other prisoners faced at the buchenwald camp were harsh .
" our family did not know we were being held in the camp .
we could not write to anyone .
we were so alone , " zander told deutsche welle .
the director of the buchenwald memorial site foundation , volkhard knigge , hastens to add that all the war-time allies had their own internment camps in germany , emphasizing that of course the soviets too had the right to have such camps after all the cruelty they 'd experienced at the hands of nazi germany .
but he points out that the soviet internment camps differed from those of the western allies .
" buchenwald in particular was a 100 percent stalinist camp between 1945 and its closure in 1950 , " knigge said .
" inmates had no right to complain to anyone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 16.02.2010 tamed ' celtic tiger ' seeks economic comeback großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish government made bailout funds available to banks in 2008 ireland 's economy was once the envy of europe .
now , with debt mounting , an economic comeback in 2010 appears increasingly unlikely as the celtic tiger struggles to avoid the fate of greece . the economy of the republic of ireland , until the early 1990s , was rooted firmly in agriculture , largely relying on traditional , farm-based businesses .
but in 1994 , ireland began to experience economic growth that would transform one of europe 's poorest nations into one of its richest .
starting that year , ireland used its educated and under utilized english-speaking workforce , state policies that attracted large american corporations eager to make inroads into the european union market , tolerance towards low-skilled immigrant workers and generous corporate tax benefits to fuel expansive economic growth .
property prices soared as wages increased .
personal and public debt levels decreased dramatically .
the ' celtic tiger ' , as ireland came to be known , became a knowledge-based economy .
the 2007 global downturn ended ireland 's positive run , and the crisis of 2008 sent the country into an economic tailspin .
the government could no longer continue wage increases necessary for workers to pay high home prices , leading to widespread mortgage defaults .
ireland 's housing losses were devastating ; its real estate bubble had grown much faster than that in the rest of europe .
debt levels , at historical lows in 2006 , returned to unmanageable levels .
many of the gains made during the celtic tiger 's boom period have been lost in the last three years .
it could take decades to restore them . bildunterschrift : ireland 's construction sector collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis 2010 forecasts discouraging few economists believe ireland will recover this year .
an official forecast released by the irish government last month predicted an average unemployment rate of 13.2 percent in 2010 . the latest quarterly report from dublin-based economic and social research institute -lrb- esri -rrb- estimates an average jobless rate of 13.75 percent this year .
although much higher than european average , this is a significant downward revision from the institute 's spring 2009 forecast , which put unemployment at almost 17 percent by the end of 2010 .
like greece , spain and portugal , ireland 's biggest problem is debt .
tax revenue declines of 20 percent last year have left ireland operating 25 billion euros over budget this year .
meanwhile , homeowners still are forced to pay expensive mortgages on property which has lost significant value .
home prices fell nearly 20 percent last year , according to esri , and are down more than 30 percent since 2007 .
" it is just tragic when you look at the reversal in debt levels , " erik jones , a professor of european studies at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they worked so hard for so long just to be back where they were -lrb- when the economic revival began in the 1990s -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising debt levels have triggered protests in ireland the road forward the european union is not expected to allow ireland 's fiscal problems to become unmanageable .
the european commission last week made clear that while current action would be limited , greece would not be allowed to fail .
the same promise applies to ireland .
the irish government has helped itself by acting with more fiscal discipline than its greek counterpart .
dublin has made sizeable spending cuts in this year 's budget , and public workers , from low level bureaucrats to top public officials , are expected to earn less this year .
philip lane , a professor of international microeconomics at trinity college dublin attributed ireland 's ability to make difficult cuts to the nature of the irish crisis .
" ireland is feeling the pinch because of the burst of the real estate bubble , " he said .
" greece , meanwhile , has chronically overspent for years . "
" we made the cutbacks in ireland because we knew that wages were growing too quickly , that wages were too high , " lane told deutsche welle .
" we knew we needed to get sensible again . "
lane says that once the crisis passes , ireland should revert to the practices that made the early part of the celtic tiger years successful .
" the real celtic tiger was driven by an export boom .
we got diverted by a domestic construction bubble , " he said .
" we need to get back to international business . "

property prices soared as wages increased .
personal and public debt levels decreased dramatically .
the ' celtic tiger ' , as ireland came to be known , became a knowledge-based economy .
the 2007 global downturn ended ireland 's positive run , and the crisis of 2008 sent the country into an economic tailspin .
the government could no longer continue wage increases necessary for workers to pay high home prices , leading to widespread mortgage defaults .
ireland 's housing losses were devastating ; its real estate bubble had grown much faster than that in the rest of europe .
debt levels , at historical lows in 2006 , returned to unmanageable levels .
many of the gains made during the celtic tiger 's boom period have been lost in the last three years .
it could take decades to restore them . bildunterschrift : ireland 's construction sector collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis 2010 forecasts discouraging few economists believe ireland will recover this year .
an official forecast released by the irish government last month predicted an average unemployment rate of 13.2 percent in 2010 . the latest quarterly report from dublin-based economic and social research institute -lrb- esri -rrb- estimates an average jobless rate of 13.75 percent this year .
although much higher than european average , this is a significant downward revision from the institute 's spring 2009 forecast , which put unemployment at almost 17 percent by the end of 2010 .
like greece , spain and portugal , ireland 's biggest problem is debt .
tax revenue declines of 20 percent last year have left ireland operating 25 billion euros over budget this year .
meanwhile , homeowners still are forced to pay expensive mortgages on property which has lost significant value .
home prices fell nearly 20 percent last year , according to esri , and are down more than 30 percent since 2007 .
" it is just tragic when you look at the reversal in debt levels , " erik jones , a professor of european studies at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they worked so hard for so long just to be back where they were -lrb- when the economic revival began in the 1990s -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising debt levels have triggered protests in ireland the road forward the european union is not expected to allow ireland 's fiscal problems to become unmanageable .
the european commission last week made clear that while current action would be limited , greece would not be allowed to fail .
the same promise applies to ireland .
the irish government has helped itself by acting with more fiscal discipline than its greek counterpart .
dublin has made sizeable spending cuts in this year 's budget , and public workers , from low level bureaucrats to top public officials , are expected to earn less this year .
philip lane , a professor of international microeconomics at trinity college dublin attributed ireland 's ability to make difficult cuts to the nature of the irish crisis .
" ireland is feeling the pinch because of the burst of the real estate bubble , " he said .
" greece , meanwhile , has chronically overspent for years . "
" we made the cutbacks in ireland because we knew that wages were growing too quickly , that wages were too high , " lane told deutsche welle .
" we knew we needed to get sensible again . "
lane says that once the crisis passes , ireland should revert to the practices that made the early part of the celtic tiger years successful .
" the real celtic tiger was driven by an export boom .
we got diverted by a domestic construction bubble , " he said .
" we need to get back to international business . "

now , with debt mounting , an economic comeback in 2010 appears increasingly unlikely as the celtic tiger struggles to avoid the fate of greece . the economy of the republic of ireland , until the early 1990s , was rooted firmly in agriculture , largely relying on traditional , farm-based businesses .
but in 1994 , ireland began to experience economic growth that would transform one of europe 's poorest nations into one of its richest .
starting that year , ireland used its educated and under utilized english-speaking workforce , state policies that attracted large american corporations eager to make inroads into the european union market , tolerance towards low-skilled immigrant workers and generous corporate tax benefits to fuel expansive economic growth .
property prices soared as wages increased .
personal and public debt levels decreased dramatically .
the ' celtic tiger ' , as ireland came to be known , became a knowledge-based economy .
the 2007 global downturn ended ireland 's positive run , and the crisis of 2008 sent the country into an economic tailspin .
the government could no longer continue wage increases necessary for workers to pay high home prices , leading to widespread mortgage defaults .
ireland 's housing losses were devastating ; its real estate bubble had grown much faster than that in the rest of europe .
debt levels , at historical lows in 2006 , returned to unmanageable levels .
many of the gains made during the celtic tiger 's boom period have been lost in the last three years .
it could take decades to restore them . bildunterschrift : ireland 's construction sector collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis 2010 forecasts discouraging few economists believe ireland will recover this year .
an official forecast released by the irish government last month predicted an average unemployment rate of 13.2 percent in 2010 . the latest quarterly report from dublin-based economic and social research institute -lrb- esri -rrb- estimates an average jobless rate of 13.75 percent this year .
although much higher than european average , this is a significant downward revision from the institute 's spring 2009 forecast , which put unemployment at almost 17 percent by the end of 2010 .
like greece , spain and portugal , ireland 's biggest problem is debt .
tax revenue declines of 20 percent last year have left ireland operating 25 billion euros over budget this year .
meanwhile , homeowners still are forced to pay expensive mortgages on property which has lost significant value .
home prices fell nearly 20 percent last year , according to esri , and are down more than 30 percent since 2007 .
" it is just tragic when you look at the reversal in debt levels , " erik jones , a professor of european studies at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they worked so hard for so long just to be back where they were -lrb- when the economic revival began in the 1990s -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising debt levels have triggered protests in ireland the road forward the european union is not expected to allow ireland 's fiscal problems to become unmanageable .
the european commission last week made clear that while current action would be limited , greece would not be allowed to fail .
the same promise applies to ireland .
the irish government has helped itself by acting with more fiscal discipline than its greek counterpart .
dublin has made sizeable spending cuts in this year 's budget , and public workers , from low level bureaucrats to top public officials , are expected to earn less this year .
philip lane , a professor of international microeconomics at trinity college dublin attributed ireland 's ability to make difficult cuts to the nature of the irish crisis .
" ireland is feeling the pinch because of the burst of the real estate bubble , " he said .
" greece , meanwhile , has chronically overspent for years . "
" we made the cutbacks in ireland because we knew that wages were growing too quickly , that wages were too high , " lane told deutsche welle .
" we knew we needed to get sensible again . "
lane says that once the crisis passes , ireland should revert to the practices that made the early part of the celtic tiger years successful .
" the real celtic tiger was driven by an export boom .
we got diverted by a domestic construction bubble , " he said .
" we need to get back to international business . "

a heterosexual couple in austria has vowed to go to the country 's highest court - to be granted a civil partnership introduced for gay couples .
they argue that current legislation is discriminatory . a heterosexual couple in austria is fighting for the right to enter into a registered civil partnership - introduced for homosexual couples in january 2010 .
under current law the couple will be denied that right - but they have vowed to take the case to the country 's constitutional court to overturn what they says is a discriminatory legislation .
austria introduced civil unions for gay couples on january 1 , affording them some of the rights enjoyed by their heterosexual counterparts .
the new legislation , passed after weeks of wrangling between the ruling social democrats and their conservative coalition partner in government , gives same-sex couples a status similar to traditional marriage but different in a number of respects .
for instance , there are less strict rules in the event of a divorce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the issue is equality - nothing but equality , ' the couple argues the heterosexual couple in question argues that this is a more modern form of union - which simply suits them better than a traditional marriage .
and if it 's offered to gay couples , why should n't it be an option for them as well ?
the issue at stake , they argue , is standing up against discrimination .
" everyone should have the same rights , and there should n't be different rules for different people , " the couple 's lawyer , helmut graupner , told deutsche welle .
" regardless of how many different forms of union a state provides to couples , all of those forms should be available for everyone and must not be restricted on the basis of race , class or sex or gender or other criteria , which are traditionally the very criteria for discrimination , " graupner said .
can you be ' a little bit equal ' ?
at the end of february , the couple plans to officially apply for a civil partnership - they expect this to be rejected , in which case they plan to take their case to the constitutional court .
their goal is to force the government to rework the legislation so that both traditional marriage and registered partnership will be open to any couple - gay or straight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay and lesbian activists say the different forms of union are discriminatory " the issue is equality - nothing but equality , " graupner said .
" you can not be ' a little bit equal . '
just like you ca n't be ' a little bit pregnant ' or ' a little bit dead . '
unless you 're entitled to the same kind of institutions and forms of law you 're not being treated equally and that 's discriminatory .
that 's what we are fighting against - we 're fighting for the rights of both heterosexuals and homosexuals . "
graupner is not only trying to help the heterosexual couple to get a ' gay ' marriage .
he 's also representing gay couples who want a traditional marriage - rather than the registered civil partnership that lawmakers have agreed on .
the current legislation provides same-sex couples with equal rights to heterosexuals with regards to pensions and alimony - but the law for instance continues to ban adoption .
it also does not allow civil partnership ceremonies at the civil registry office , where heterosexual couples can marry .
yet graupner is up against strong resistance .
the country 's conservative party - the austrian peoples party - only reluctantly agreed to the civil partnership in the first place .
the conservatives insists that significant differences between the two forms of union must remain .
the catholic church is not amused another powerful opponent to the law is the roman catholic church - after all , austria is predominantly catholic and the church is a force to be reckoned with .
the country 's clergy is opposed to the existing law , and certainly against any further liberalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the church ' different things need to be treated differently ' " the austrian bishops have made their position quite clear , " professor erich leitenberger , spokesman for the vienna diocese told deutsche welle .
" they strongly support the fact that the law does not put the civil partnership and a traditional marriage on an equal footing . "
" but the bishops have expressed concerns that the new law could be the beginning of a trend which eventually will lead to putting the civil partnership on the same footing as the traditional marriage between a man and a woman . "
leitenberger said that the legislation in place before january 1 was sufficient to safeguard the rights of gay and lesbian couples .
families , he argued , were shouldering the task of raising children and therefore could not be put on the same level with same-sex couples .
" the bishops stick to their position that a traditional marriage , a family raising children simply is something different from a homosexual couple - and therefore should also be treated differently . "
however , should the appeal to the constitutional court be successful , soon both of the two forms of union , could be open to any couple - a situation that would place austria at the forefront in terms of homosexual rights in europe .
the decision by the court is expected by the end of this year .

a heterosexual couple in austria has vowed to go to the country 's highest court - to be granted a civil partnership introduced for gay couples .
they argue that current legislation is discriminatory . a heterosexual couple in austria is fighting for the right to enter into a registered civil partnership - introduced for homosexual couples in january 2010 .
under current law the couple will be denied that right - but they have vowed to take the case to the country 's constitutional court to overturn what they says is a discriminatory legislation .
austria introduced civil unions for gay couples on january 1 , affording them some of the rights enjoyed by their heterosexual counterparts .
the new legislation , passed after weeks of wrangling between the ruling social democrats and their conservative coalition partner in government , gives same-sex couples a status similar to traditional marriage but different in a number of respects .
for instance , there are less strict rules in the event of a divorce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the issue is equality - nothing but equality , ' the couple argues the heterosexual couple in question argues that this is a more modern form of union - which simply suits them better than a traditional marriage .
and if it 's offered to gay couples , why should n't it be an option for them as well ?
the issue at stake , they argue , is standing up against discrimination .
" everyone should have the same rights , and there should n't be different rules for different people , " the couple 's lawyer , helmut graupner , told deutsche welle .
" regardless of how many different forms of union a state provides to couples , all of those forms should be available for everyone and must not be restricted on the basis of race , class or sex or gender or other criteria , which are traditionally the very criteria for discrimination , " graupner said .
can you be ' a little bit equal ' ?
at the end of february , the couple plans to officially apply for a civil partnership - they expect this to be rejected , in which case they plan to take their case to the constitutional court .
their goal is to force the government to rework the legislation so that both traditional marriage and registered partnership will be open to any couple - gay or straight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay and lesbian activists say the different forms of union are discriminatory " the issue is equality - nothing but equality , " graupner said .
" you can not be ' a little bit equal . '
just like you ca n't be ' a little bit pregnant ' or ' a little bit dead . '
unless you 're entitled to the same kind of institutions and forms of law you 're not being treated equally and that 's discriminatory .
that 's what we are fighting against - we 're fighting for the rights of both heterosexuals and homosexuals . "
graupner is not only trying to help the heterosexual couple to get a ' gay ' marriage .
he 's also representing gay couples who want a traditional marriage - rather than the registered civil partnership that lawmakers have agreed on .
the current legislation provides same-sex couples with equal rights to heterosexuals with regards to pensions and alimony - but the law for instance continues to ban adoption .
it also does not allow civil partnership ceremonies at the civil registry office , where heterosexual couples can marry .
yet graupner is up against strong resistance .
the country 's conservative party - the austrian peoples party - only reluctantly agreed to the civil partnership in the first place .
the conservatives insists that significant differences between the two forms of union must remain .
the catholic church is not amused another powerful opponent to the law is the roman catholic church - after all , austria is predominantly catholic and the church is a force to be reckoned with .
the country 's clergy is opposed to the existing law , and certainly against any further liberalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the church ' different things need to be treated differently ' " the austrian bishops have made their position quite clear , " professor erich leitenberger , spokesman for the vienna diocese told deutsche welle .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay and lesbian activists say the different forms of union are discriminatory " the issue is equality - nothing but equality , " graupner said .
" you can not be ' a little bit equal . '
just like you ca n't be ' a little bit pregnant ' or ' a little bit dead . '
unless you 're entitled to the same kind of institutions and forms of law you 're not being treated equally and that 's discriminatory .
that 's what we are fighting against - we 're fighting for the rights of both heterosexuals and homosexuals . "
graupner is not only trying to help the heterosexual couple to get a ' gay ' marriage .
he 's also representing gay couples who want a traditional marriage - rather than the registered civil partnership that lawmakers have agreed on .
the current legislation provides same-sex couples with equal rights to heterosexuals with regards to pensions and alimony - but the law for instance continues to ban adoption .
it also does not allow civil partnership ceremonies at the civil registry office , where heterosexual couples can marry .
yet graupner is up against strong resistance .
the country 's conservative party - the austrian peoples party - only reluctantly agreed to the civil partnership in the first place .
the conservatives insists that significant differences between the two forms of union must remain .
the catholic church is not amused another powerful opponent to the law is the roman catholic church - after all , austria is predominantly catholic and the church is a force to be reckoned with .
the country 's clergy is opposed to the existing law , and certainly against any further liberalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the church ' different things need to be treated differently ' " the austrian bishops have made their position quite clear , " professor erich leitenberger , spokesman for the vienna diocese told deutsche welle .
" they strongly support the fact that the law does not put the civil partnership and a traditional marriage on an equal footing . "
" but the bishops have expressed concerns that the new law could be the beginning of a trend which eventually will lead to putting the civil partnership on the same footing as the traditional marriage between a man and a woman . "
leitenberger said that the legislation in place before january 1 was sufficient to safeguard the rights of gay and lesbian couples .
families , he argued , were shouldering the task of raising children and therefore could not be put on the same level with same-sex couples .
" the bishops stick to their position that a traditional marriage , a family raising children simply is something different from a homosexual couple - and therefore should also be treated differently . "
however , should the appeal to the constitutional court be successful , soon both of the two forms of union , could be open to any couple - a situation that would place austria at the forefront in terms of homosexual rights in europe .
the decision by the court is expected by the end of this year .

a heterosexual couple in austria has vowed to go to the country 's highest court - to be granted a civil partnership introduced for gay couples .
they argue that current legislation is discriminatory . a heterosexual couple in austria is fighting for the right to enter into a registered civil partnership - introduced for homosexual couples in january 2010 .
under current law the couple will be denied that right - but they have vowed to take the case to the country 's constitutional court to overturn what they says is a discriminatory legislation .
austria introduced civil unions for gay couples on january 1 , affording them some of the rights enjoyed by their heterosexual counterparts .
the new legislation , passed after weeks of wrangling between the ruling social democrats and their conservative coalition partner in government , gives same-sex couples a status similar to traditional marriage but different in a number of respects .
for instance , there are less strict rules in the event of a divorce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the issue is equality - nothing but equality , ' the couple argues the heterosexual couple in question argues that this is a more modern form of union - which simply suits them better than a traditional marriage .
and if it 's offered to gay couples , why should n't it be an option for them as well ?
the issue at stake , they argue , is standing up against discrimination .
" everyone should have the same rights , and there should n't be different rules for different people , " the couple 's lawyer , helmut graupner , told deutsche welle .
" regardless of how many different forms of union a state provides to couples , all of those forms should be available for everyone and must not be restricted on the basis of race , class or sex or gender or other criteria , which are traditionally the very criteria for discrimination , " graupner said .
can you be ' a little bit equal ' ?
at the end of february , the couple plans to officially apply for a civil partnership - they expect this to be rejected , in which case they plan to take their case to the constitutional court .
their goal is to force the government to rework the legislation so that both traditional marriage and registered partnership will be open to any couple - gay or straight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay and lesbian activists say the different forms of union are discriminatory " the issue is equality - nothing but equality , " graupner said .
" you can not be ' a little bit equal . '
just like you ca n't be ' a little bit pregnant ' or ' a little bit dead . '
unless you 're entitled to the same kind of institutions and forms of law you 're not being treated equally and that 's discriminatory .
that 's what we are fighting against - we 're fighting for the rights of both heterosexuals and homosexuals . "
graupner is not only trying to help the heterosexual couple to get a ' gay ' marriage .
he 's also representing gay couples who want a traditional marriage - rather than the registered civil partnership that lawmakers have agreed on .
the current legislation provides same-sex couples with equal rights to heterosexuals with regards to pensions and alimony - but the law for instance continues to ban adoption .
it also does not allow civil partnership ceremonies at the civil registry office , where heterosexual couples can marry .
yet graupner is up against strong resistance .
the country 's conservative party - the austrian peoples party - only reluctantly agreed to the civil partnership in the first place .
the conservatives insists that significant differences between the two forms of union must remain .
the catholic church is not amused another powerful opponent to the law is the roman catholic church - after all , austria is predominantly catholic and the church is a force to be reckoned with .
the country 's clergy is opposed to the existing law , and certainly against any further liberalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the church ' different things need to be treated differently ' " the austrian bishops have made their position quite clear , " professor erich leitenberger , spokesman for the vienna diocese told deutsche welle .
" they strongly support the fact that the law does not put the civil partnership and a traditional marriage on an equal footing . "
" but the bishops have expressed concerns that the new law could be the beginning of a trend which eventually will lead to putting the civil partnership on the same footing as the traditional marriage between a man and a woman . "
leitenberger said that the legislation in place before january 1 was sufficient to safeguard the rights of gay and lesbian couples .
families , he argued , were shouldering the task of raising children and therefore could not be put on the same level with same-sex couples .
" the bishops stick to their position that a traditional marriage , a family raising children simply is something different from a homosexual couple - and therefore should also be treated differently . "
however , should the appeal to the constitutional court be successful , soon both of the two forms of union , could be open to any couple - a situation that would place austria at the forefront in terms of homosexual rights in europe .
the decision by the court is expected by the end of this year .

that may be good news for germany 's axel weber , who hopes to make president . european union finance ministers on tuesday unanimously recommended portugal 's vitor constancio to be the next vice president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- , an eu statement said .
if confirmed by the european parliament next month , constancio will succeed greece 's lucas papdemos in may .
" it was a unanimous choice , " said italian economics minister giulio tremonti .
" he is a very qualified and technically experienced person , so i think that he was the right choice for europe . "

the move by tripoli was believed to have been caused by a spat with switzerland . the european commission , the eu 's executive body , has criticized libya 's decision to suspend issuing visas to citizens from the bloc 's schengen area as " unilateral and disproportionate . "
" the commission also regrets that travelers who legally obtained visas before the suspension measure were refused entry when arriving in libya , " said eu commissioner for home affairs cecilia malmstrom .
she added that eu and schengen countries would discuss the matter this week to " consider the appropriate reaction . "
a spokesman for the german foreign ministry said the decision by libya was " regrettable , " adding that the government expected the suspension to be cancelled .
tense ties the move by tripoli appears to be in response to an announcement by swiss authorities on sunday that 188 libyans , including leader moammar gadhafi and his family , are banned from visiting switzerland .
while switzerland is not a member of the eu , it is one of the 25 european countries in the border-free schengen area .
citizens of great britain , ireland , cyprus , bulgaria and romania , which are eu members but not in the schengen zone , were exempt from the decision .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gaddafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .
that event led to libya halting oil exports to switzerland and withdrawing some $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- in assets from swiss banks .
the quarrel threatens to complicate business ties between libya and the eu .

in a statement from the vatican city on tuesday , benedict said such acts of abuse were " not only a heinous crime , but also a grave sin which offends god and wounds the dignity of the human person created in his image .
" -lsb- benedict -rsb- challenged the bishops to address the problems of the past with determination and resolve , and to face the present crisis with honesty and courage , " the statement added .
ireland 's 24 standing bishops , summoned to the vatican to address the crisis , told the pontiff of their " shame " at the scandal and vowed to cooperate with authorities in ireland .
in a statement of their own , they said " significant measures have now been taken to ensure the safety of children and young people " involved in church-led activities .
murphy commission the irish church is facing criticism from a commission headed by judge yvonne murphy , which in november accused it of mishandling more than 300 sex abuse claims in the archdiocese of dublin between 1975 and 2004 .
four irish bishops have already tendered their resignations as a consequence of the murphy commission 's revelations .
to date , the pope has accepted one of the resignations .
the vatican statement did not mention specific disciplinary measures to be taken against the remaining three clerics involved in the scandal .

greece 's financial woes started decades ago when the country was ruled by one socialist regime after another .
now experts warn that unless greece learns from its financial history , it is bound to repeat it . who would have imagined it ?
greece could soon be bankrupt and there are some speculations that athens will begin refusing payment on its obligations .
due to massive debt and doctored data , greece has lost the trust of both the european union and the financial markets .
and it 's not looking good for athens , despite an eu security net .
greece currently owes foreign banks more than $ 300 billion -lrb- 219.8 billion euros -rrb- , which equals 115 percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
their current debt amounts to more then 12.7 percent of their economic output .
but how did it get this far ?
spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "
repeating history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overspending led to greece 's current situation this is not new territory for greece .
back in the 1980 's and 1990 's the country faced similar financial difficulties .
back then the socialist governments solved the problem by devaluing the country 's former currency , the drachma .
that way they were able to shrink imports and raise exports .
but economic expert babi papadimitriou said this option became unavailable when greece entered into the euro zone . over the past few years the political elite and the greek government have not really grasped what it means to be a member of the euro zone , the economist said .
" it goes without saying that you have to reduce your deficit as much as possible when you share your currency with other countries , " he said .
" but those in power have ignored this principle .
and the necessary reforms were never imposed . "
the state acted irresponsibly as costs began to mount and the ability for the economy to compete on an international level was reduced .
when added to the global financial crisis that hit back in 2008 , these structural weak points became a full-blown nightmare .
cutting costs the country 's biggest problem is the state itself and the services it offers .
according to professor paraskewopoulos , the largest share of savings could come from cutting the costs incurred by public employees : reducing tax exceptions , putting a hiring freeze on state offices and reducing employee salaries .
along with this , he said the government needs to tackle two other major hurdles : tax evasion and corruption . each year the greek government loses 20 billion euros in unpaid taxes , and it is estimated that the average greek family pays out some 1,600 euros annually in bribes .
notoriously , things rarely work in the country without a little money to grease the wheels .
bildunterschrift : greek prime minister george papandreou has some very unenviable choices to make " those in power have always rewarded those loyal to them with cushy jobs and now we have a bloated government that costs an inconceivable amount of money .
that 's where you have to start , " explained paraskewopoulos .
" of course that 's easy to say , but to really do it , you have to be prepared to deal with the people affected . "
and that is exactly what papandreou 's government is facing at the moment .
the public sector has gone on strike and indignant farmers are blocking the motorways and border crossings .
however , both experts agree that unless they get rid of the subsidies and begin to privatize state agencies , cleaning up the financial mess will be impossible .

the move by tripoli was believed to have been caused by a spat with switzerland . the european commission , the eu 's executive body , has criticized libya 's decision to suspend issuing visas to citizens from the bloc 's schengen area as " unilateral and disproportionate . "
" the commission also regrets that travelers who legally obtained visas before the suspension measure were refused entry when arriving in libya , " said eu commissioner for home affairs cecilia malmstrom .
she added that eu and schengen countries would discuss the matter this week to " consider the appropriate reaction . "
a spokesman for the german foreign ministry said the decision by libya was " regrettable , " adding that the government expected the suspension to be cancelled .
tense ties the move by tripoli appears to be in response to an announcement by swiss authorities on sunday that 188 libyans , including leader moammar gadhafi and his family , are banned from visiting switzerland .
while switzerland is not a member of the eu , it is one of the 25 european countries in the border-free schengen area .
citizens of great britain , ireland , cyprus , bulgaria and romania , which are eu members but not in the schengen zone , were exempt from the decision .
relations between libya and switzerland have been tense since 2008 , when police in geneva questioned one of gaddafi 's sons , hannibal , and his wife , after a complaint from hotel staff that he had mistreated them .
that event led to libya halting oil exports to switzerland and withdrawing some $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.7 billion euros -rrb- in assets from swiss banks .
the quarrel threatens to complicate business ties between libya and the eu .
italian diplomat francesca tardioli has said that some europeans had been kept waiting for hours at the airport in the libyan capital , while several with valid visas for libya had to fly back to their home countries. dfm / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 16.02.2010 tamed ' celtic tiger ' seeks economic comeback großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish government made bailout funds available to banks in 2008 ireland 's economy was once the envy of europe .
now , with debt mounting , an economic comeback in 2010 appears increasingly unlikely as the celtic tiger struggles to avoid the fate of greece . the economy of the republic of ireland , until the early 1990s , was rooted firmly in agriculture , largely relying on traditional , farm-based businesses .
but in 1994 , ireland began to experience economic growth that would transform one of europe 's poorest nations into one of its richest .
starting that year , ireland used its educated and under utilized english-speaking workforce , state policies that attracted large american corporations eager to make inroads into the european union market , tolerance towards low-skilled immigrant workers and generous corporate tax benefits to fuel expansive economic growth .
property prices soared as wages increased .
personal and public debt levels decreased dramatically .
the ' celtic tiger ' , as ireland came to be known , became a knowledge-based economy .
the 2007 global downturn ended ireland 's positive run , and the crisis of 2008 sent the country into an economic tailspin .
the government could no longer continue wage increases necessary for workers to pay high home prices , leading to widespread mortgage defaults .
ireland 's housing losses were devastating ; its real estate bubble had grown much faster than that in the rest of europe .
debt levels , at historical lows in 2006 , returned to unmanageable levels .
many of the gains made during the celtic tiger 's boom period have been lost in the last three years .
it could take decades to restore them . bildunterschrift : ireland 's construction sector collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis 2010 forecasts discouraging few economists believe ireland will recover this year .
an official forecast released by the irish government last month predicted an average unemployment rate of 13.2 percent in 2010 . the latest quarterly report from dublin-based economic and social research institute -lrb- esri -rrb- estimates an average jobless rate of 13.75 percent this year .
although much higher than european average , this is a significant downward revision from the institute 's spring 2009 forecast , which put unemployment at almost 17 percent by the end of 2010 .
like greece , spain and portugal , ireland 's biggest problem is debt .
tax revenue declines of 20 percent last year have left ireland operating 25 billion euros over budget this year .
meanwhile , homeowners still are forced to pay expensive mortgages on property which has lost significant value .
home prices fell nearly 20 percent last year , according to esri , and are down more than 30 percent since 2007 .
" it is just tragic when you look at the reversal in debt levels , " erik jones , a professor of european studies at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies , told deutsche welle .
" they worked so hard for so long just to be back where they were -lrb- when the economic revival began in the 1990s -rrb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising debt levels have triggered protests in ireland the road forward the european union is not expected to allow ireland 's fiscal problems to become unmanageable .
the european commission last week made clear that while current action would be limited , greece would not be allowed to fail .
the same promise applies to ireland .
the irish government has helped itself by acting with more fiscal discipline than its greek counterpart .
dublin has made sizeable spending cuts in this year 's budget , and public workers , from low level bureaucrats to top public officials , are expected to earn less this year .
philip lane , a professor of international microeconomics at trinity college dublin attributed ireland 's ability to make difficult cuts to the nature of the irish crisis .
" ireland is feeling the pinch because of the burst of the real estate bubble , " he said .
" greece , meanwhile , has chronically overspent for years . "
" we made the cutbacks in ireland because we knew that wages were growing too quickly , that wages were too high , " lane told deutsche welle .
" we knew we needed to get sensible again . "
lane says that once the crisis passes , ireland should revert to the practices that made the early part of the celtic tiger years successful .
" the real celtic tiger was driven by an export boom .
we got diverted by a domestic construction bubble , " he said .
" we need to get back to international business . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de investment -pipe- 16.02.2010 uk mulls ' green bonds ' to spur infrastructure investment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed bonds are meant to help fund the renewable energy industry britain is reportedly examining the idea of launching green bonds to boost the renewable energy sector amid cash flow snags .
but will they have the desired effect of easing funding bottlenecks ? the economic secretary to the uk 's finance ministry , ian pearson , said in an interview published in the financial times newspaper on monday that the government was considering introducing so-called “ green bonds ” to the public to help fund the renewable energy industry .
pearson said that he had asked officials to examine a proposal that would see national savings and investments - a treasury-based unit - issue the bonds for sustainable infrastructure projects .
debt by any other name … dr. martin weale , director of the national institute of economic and social research -lrb- niesr -rrb- , an independent london-based think tank , told deutsche welle that such a move would basically amount to government borrowing , regardless of what name it ’ s given .
“ if it ’ s something that makes people happier about lending to the government – assuming the government is issuing them – or if it makes it possible for the government to borrow more cheaply than would otherwise be the case , then it seems to be it ’ s a good idea , ” dr. weale said .
“ fundamentally , what matters is actually paying for spending that ’ s done , whether it ’ s a green idea or anything else , and if you finance it by borrowing , it doesn ’ t matter too much what you call it , ” he said , adding that investors would need to look at the likely yields of such bonds .
proponents of the green bonds are describing them as a new way to finance infrastructure projects at a time when the government is struggling to balance its books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. weale says emotive captions persuaded people to invest in wartime bonds however , dr. weale points out that it won ’ t actually reduce the amount of government borrowing .
“ when we look at how much the government is borrowing and whether it can afford it , people will take green bonds into account just as much as anything else , ” he said .
he draws an analogy between last century ’ s wartime borrowing in britain and the current trends .
“ in many ways it ’ s rather similar to something we saw in the twentieth century : we had defense bonds and we had war loans .
and those were names given to government debt to make it easier or persuade people to buy it , ” he explained .
long-term contracts planned the finance ministry ’ s ian pearson was also quoted as saying the government was looking to offer long-term support to wind energy and green waste companies .
" we are thinking of going direct to companies looking to establish energy from waste and wind farm projects and offering them long-term contracts that would both get the public sector a good deal on price but also get the projects off the ground , " he told the financial times .
" if they had , say , a 15-year contract to supply the public sector , that should make it easier for them to raise finance to get the projects going , while tying in with the green agenda , " pearson added .
experts like dr. weale agree that there ’ s an argument for such long-term contracts .
“ we know that at current prices many so-called green schemes are highly uneconomic .
and since the government doesn ’ t want to do the obvious thing , which is to impose a proper charge for carbon emissions , what they are proposing seems to me the next best , ” he conceded .
kfw as a model ?
also under consideration is the idea of establishing a state-run infrastructure bank to help fund energy and other infrastructure projects in the country .
some analysts have pointed to the enormous amount of investments needed for energy infrastructure not only in britain but across europe .
however , there are doubts about how such projects can be financed at a time when credit flow remains a problem as the global economy slowly recovers from recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infrastructure bank on the lines of germany 's kfw bank has been mooted as a means of mobilizing capital for such purposes , some analysts in the uk have suggested setting up an infrastructure bank on the lines of germany ’ s state-owned development bank kfw .
competition for private banks some analysts say the proposal could set off alarm bells for private sector banks .
however , dr. weale from the niesr disagrees .
“ i think private sector banks aren ’ t terribly worried about competition .
they ’ re very short of capital .
they are not wanting to lend - as far as one can tell .
and if they ’ re not wanting to lend , they shouldn ’ t be upset that other people are doing the lending instead , ” he said .
dr. weale says that if the private sector banks were to raise more capital , perhaps they could compete for that sort of business as well .

greece 's financial woes started decades ago when the country was ruled by one socialist regime after another .
now experts warn that unless greece learns from its financial history , it is bound to repeat it . who would have imagined it ?
greece could soon be bankrupt and there are some speculations that athens will begin refusing payment on its obligations .
due to massive debt and doctored data , greece has lost the trust of both the european union and the financial markets .
and it 's not looking good for athens , despite an eu security net .
greece currently owes foreign banks more than $ 300 billion -lrb- 219.8 billion euros -rrb- , which equals 115 percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
their current debt amounts to more then 12.7 percent of their economic output .
but how did it get this far ?
spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "
repeating history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overspending led to greece 's current situation this is not new territory for greece .
back in the 1980 's and 1990 's the country faced similar financial difficulties .
back then the socialist governments solved the problem by devaluing the country 's former currency , the drachma .
that way they were able to shrink imports and raise exports .
but economic expert babi papadimitriou said this option became unavailable when greece entered into the euro zone . over the past few years the political elite and the greek government have not really grasped what it means to be a member of the euro zone , the economist said .
" it goes without saying that you have to reduce your deficit as much as possible when you share your currency with other countries , " he said .
" but those in power have ignored this principle .
and the necessary reforms were never imposed . "
the state acted irresponsibly as costs began to mount and the ability for the economy to compete on an international level was reduced .
when added to the global financial crisis that hit back in 2008 , these structural weak points became a full-blown nightmare .
cutting costs the country 's biggest problem is the state itself and the services it offers .
according to professor paraskewopoulos , the largest share of savings could come from cutting the costs incurred by public employees : reducing tax exceptions , putting a hiring freeze on state offices and reducing employee salaries .
along with this , he said the government needs to tackle two other major hurdles : tax evasion and corruption . each year the greek government loses 20 billion euros in unpaid taxes , and it is estimated that the average greek family pays out some 1,600 euros annually in bribes .
notoriously , things rarely work in the country without a little money to grease the wheels .
bildunterschrift : greek prime minister george papandreou has some very unenviable choices to make " those in power have always rewarded those loyal to them with cushy jobs and now we have a bloated government that costs an inconceivable amount of money .
that 's where you have to start , " explained paraskewopoulos .
" of course that 's easy to say , but to really do it , you have to be prepared to deal with the people affected . "
and that is exactly what papandreou 's government is facing at the moment .
the public sector has gone on strike and indignant farmers are blocking the motorways and border crossings .

greece 's financial woes started decades ago when the country was ruled by one socialist regime after another .
now experts warn that unless greece learns from its financial history , it is bound to repeat it . who would have imagined it ?
greece could soon be bankrupt and there are some speculations that athens will begin refusing payment on its obligations .
due to massive debt and doctored data , greece has lost the trust of both the european union and the financial markets .
and it 's not looking good for athens , despite an eu security net .
greece currently owes foreign banks more than $ 300 billion -lrb- 219.8 billion euros -rrb- , which equals 115 percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
their current debt amounts to more then 12.7 percent of their economic output .
but how did it get this far ?
spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "
repeating history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overspending led to greece 's current situation this is not new territory for greece .
back in the 1980 's and 1990 's the country faced similar financial difficulties .
back then the socialist governments solved the problem by devaluing the country 's former currency , the drachma .
that way they were able to shrink imports and raise exports .
but economic expert babi papadimitriou said this option became unavailable when greece entered into the euro zone . over the past few years the political elite and the greek government have not really grasped what it means to be a member of the euro zone , the economist said .
" it goes without saying that you have to reduce your deficit as much as possible when you share your currency with other countries , " he said .
" but those in power have ignored this principle .
and the necessary reforms were never imposed . "
the state acted irresponsibly as costs began to mount and the ability for the economy to compete on an international level was reduced .
when added to the global financial crisis that hit back in 2008 , these structural weak points became a full-blown nightmare .
cutting costs the country 's biggest problem is the state itself and the services it offers .
according to professor paraskewopoulos , the largest share of savings could come from cutting the costs incurred by public employees : reducing tax exceptions , putting a hiring freeze on state offices and reducing employee salaries .
along with this , he said the government needs to tackle two other major hurdles : tax evasion and corruption . each year the greek government loses 20 billion euros in unpaid taxes , and it is estimated that the average greek family pays out some 1,600 euros annually in bribes .
notoriously , things rarely work in the country without a little money to grease the wheels .
bildunterschrift : greek prime minister george papandreou has some very unenviable choices to make " those in power have always rewarded those loyal to them with cushy jobs and now we have a bloated government that costs an inconceivable amount of money .
that 's where you have to start , " explained paraskewopoulos .
" of course that 's easy to say , but to really do it , you have to be prepared to deal with the people affected . "
and that is exactly what papandreou 's government is facing at the moment .
the public sector has gone on strike and indignant farmers are blocking the motorways and border crossings .
however , both experts agree that unless they get rid of the subsidies and begin to privatize state agencies , cleaning up the financial mess will be impossible .

a heterosexual couple in austria has vowed to go to the country 's highest court - to be granted a civil partnership introduced for gay couples .
they argue that current legislation is discriminatory . a heterosexual couple in austria is fighting for the right to enter into a registered civil partnership - introduced for homosexual couples in january 2010 .
under current law the couple will be denied that right - but they have vowed to take the case to the country 's constitutional court to overturn what they says is a discriminatory legislation .
austria introduced civil unions for gay couples on january 1 , affording them some of the rights enjoyed by their heterosexual counterparts .
the new legislation , passed after weeks of wrangling between the ruling social democrats and their conservative coalition partner in government , gives same-sex couples a status similar to traditional marriage but different in a number of respects .
for instance , there are less strict rules in the event of a divorce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the issue is equality - nothing but equality , ' the couple argues the heterosexual couple in question argues that this is a more modern form of union - which simply suits them better than a traditional marriage .
and if it 's offered to gay couples , why should n't it be an option for them as well ?
the issue at stake , they argue , is standing up against discrimination .
" everyone should have the same rights , and there should n't be different rules for different people , " the couple 's lawyer , helmut graupner , told deutsche welle .
" regardless of how many different forms of union a state provides to couples , all of those forms should be available for everyone and must not be restricted on the basis of race , class or sex or gender or other criteria , which are traditionally the very criteria for discrimination , " graupner said .
can you be ' a little bit equal ' ?
at the end of february , the couple plans to officially apply for a civil partnership - they expect this to be rejected , in which case they plan to take their case to the constitutional court .
their goal is to force the government to rework the legislation so that both traditional marriage and registered partnership will be open to any couple - gay or straight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay and lesbian activists say the different forms of union are discriminatory " the issue is equality - nothing but equality , " graupner said .
" you can not be ' a little bit equal . '
just like you ca n't be ' a little bit pregnant ' or ' a little bit dead . '
unless you 're entitled to the same kind of institutions and forms of law you 're not being treated equally and that 's discriminatory .
that 's what we are fighting against - we 're fighting for the rights of both heterosexuals and homosexuals . "
graupner is not only trying to help the heterosexual couple to get a ' gay ' marriage .
he 's also representing gay couples who want a traditional marriage - rather than the registered civil partnership that lawmakers have agreed on .
the current legislation provides same-sex couples with equal rights to heterosexuals with regards to pensions and alimony - but the law for instance continues to ban adoption .
it also does not allow civil partnership ceremonies at the civil registry office , where heterosexual couples can marry .
yet graupner is up against strong resistance .
the country 's conservative party - the austrian peoples party - only reluctantly agreed to the civil partnership in the first place .
the conservatives insists that significant differences between the two forms of union must remain .
the catholic church is not amused another powerful opponent to the law is the roman catholic church - after all , austria is predominantly catholic and the church is a force to be reckoned with .
the country 's clergy is opposed to the existing law , and certainly against any further liberalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the church ' different things need to be treated differently ' " the austrian bishops have made their position quite clear , " professor erich leitenberger , spokesman for the vienna diocese told deutsche welle .

" but the bishops have expressed concerns that the new law could be the beginning of a trend which eventually will lead to putting the civil partnership on the same footing as the traditional marriage between a man and a woman . "
leitenberger said that the legislation in place before january 1 was sufficient to safeguard the rights of gay and lesbian couples .
families , he argued , were shouldering the task of raising children and therefore could not be put on the same level with same-sex couples .
" the bishops stick to their position that a traditional marriage , a family raising children simply is something different from a homosexual couple - and therefore should also be treated differently . "
however , should the appeal to the constitutional court be successful , soon both of the two forms of union , could be open to any couple - a situation that would place austria at the forefront in terms of homosexual rights in europe .
the decision by the court is expected by the end of this year .

however , should the appeal to the constitutional court be successful , soon both of the two forms of union , could be open to any couple - a situation that would place austria at the forefront in terms of homosexual rights in europe .
the decision by the court is expected by the end of this year .

green groups have welcomed a program to clean up and protect europe 's second-largest and much-hymned river , the danube .

joerg asmussen , germany 's deputy finance minister , advised greece to follow the lead of ireland and latvia , eu countries which are slashing spending in an effort to rein in their financial troubles .
" we made it clear the ball is in greece 's court , " asmussen said .
" additional measures by greece are needed . "
a statement issued by the ministers after the meeting said although greece has until march 16 to prove it has taken initial steps towards reducing its budgetary deficit by four percent , they will likely demand more budget cuts or tax hikes to prevent wider financial troubles .
the four percent reduction is the first step in a plan to eventually reduce the deficit from 12.7 percent of gdp to less than three percent in 2012 .
" the pressure on greece to consider further measures by march 16 has clearly increased , " said austrian finance minister josef proell .

joerg asmussen , germany 's deputy finance minister , advised greece to follow the lead of ireland and latvia , eu countries which are slashing spending in an effort to rein in their financial troubles .
" we made it clear the ball is in greece 's court , " asmussen said .

a statement issued by the ministers after the meeting said although greece has until march 16 to prove it has taken initial steps towards reducing its budgetary deficit by four percent , they will likely demand more budget cuts or tax hikes to prevent wider financial troubles .

greece 's financial woes started decades ago when the country was ruled by one socialist regime after another .
now experts warn that unless greece learns from its financial history , it is bound to repeat it . who would have imagined it ?
greece could soon be bankrupt and there are some speculations that athens will begin refusing payment on its obligations .
due to massive debt and doctored data , greece has lost the trust of both the european union and the financial markets .
and it 's not looking good for athens , despite an eu security net .
greece currently owes foreign banks more than $ 300 billion -lrb- 219.8 billion euros -rrb- , which equals 115 percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
their current debt amounts to more then 12.7 percent of their economic output .
but how did it get this far ?
spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "
repeating history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overspending led to greece 's current situation this is not new territory for greece .
back in the 1980 's and 1990 's the country faced similar financial difficulties .
back then the socialist governments solved the problem by devaluing the country 's former currency , the drachma .
that way they were able to shrink imports and raise exports .
but economic expert babi papadimitriou said this option became unavailable when greece entered into the euro zone . over the past few years the political elite and the greek government have not really grasped what it means to be a member of the euro zone , the economist said .
" it goes without saying that you have to reduce your deficit as much as possible when you share your currency with other countries , " he said .
" but those in power have ignored this principle .
and the necessary reforms were never imposed . "
the state acted irresponsibly as costs began to mount and the ability for the economy to compete on an international level was reduced .
when added to the global financial crisis that hit back in 2008 , these structural weak points became a full-blown nightmare .
cutting costs the country 's biggest problem is the state itself and the services it offers .
according to professor paraskewopoulos , the largest share of savings could come from cutting the costs incurred by public employees : reducing tax exceptions , putting a hiring freeze on state offices and reducing employee salaries .
along with this , he said the government needs to tackle two other major hurdles : tax evasion and corruption . each year the greek government loses 20 billion euros in unpaid taxes , and it is estimated that the average greek family pays out some 1,600 euros annually in bribes .
notoriously , things rarely work in the country without a little money to grease the wheels .
bildunterschrift : greek prime minister george papandreou has some very unenviable choices to make " those in power have always rewarded those loyal to them with cushy jobs and now we have a bloated government that costs an inconceivable amount of money .
that 's where you have to start , " explained paraskewopoulos .
" of course that 's easy to say , but to really do it , you have to be prepared to deal with the people affected . "
and that is exactly what papandreou 's government is facing at the moment .
the public sector has gone on strike and indignant farmers are blocking the motorways and border crossings .
however , both experts agree that unless they get rid of the subsidies and begin to privatize state agencies , cleaning up the financial mess will be impossible .

greece 's financial woes started decades ago when the country was ruled by one socialist regime after another .
now experts warn that unless greece learns from its financial history , it is bound to repeat it . who would have imagined it ?
greece could soon be bankrupt and there are some speculations that athens will begin refusing payment on its obligations .
due to massive debt and doctored data , greece has lost the trust of both the european union and the financial markets .
and it 's not looking good for athens , despite an eu security net .
greece currently owes foreign banks more than $ 300 billion -lrb- 219.8 billion euros -rrb- , which equals 115 percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
their current debt amounts to more then 12.7 percent of their economic output .
but how did it get this far ?
spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "
repeating history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overspending led to greece 's current situation this is not new territory for greece .
back in the 1980 's and 1990 's the country faced similar financial difficulties .
back then the socialist governments solved the problem by devaluing the country 's former currency , the drachma .
that way they were able to shrink imports and raise exports .
but economic expert babi papadimitriou said this option became unavailable when greece entered into the euro zone . over the past few years the political elite and the greek government have not really grasped what it means to be a member of the euro zone , the economist said .
" it goes without saying that you have to reduce your deficit as much as possible when you share your currency with other countries , " he said .
" but those in power have ignored this principle .
and the necessary reforms were never imposed . "
the state acted irresponsibly as costs began to mount and the ability for the economy to compete on an international level was reduced .
when added to the global financial crisis that hit back in 2008 , these structural weak points became a full-blown nightmare .
cutting costs the country 's biggest problem is the state itself and the services it offers .
according to professor paraskewopoulos , the largest share of savings could come from cutting the costs incurred by public employees : reducing tax exceptions , putting a hiring freeze on state offices and reducing employee salaries .
along with this , he said the government needs to tackle two other major hurdles : tax evasion and corruption . each year the greek government loses 20 billion euros in unpaid taxes , and it is estimated that the average greek family pays out some 1,600 euros annually in bribes .
notoriously , things rarely work in the country without a little money to grease the wheels .
bildunterschrift : greek prime minister george papandreou has some very unenviable choices to make " those in power have always rewarded those loyal to them with cushy jobs and now we have a bloated government that costs an inconceivable amount of money .
that 's where you have to start , " explained paraskewopoulos .
" of course that 's easy to say , but to really do it , you have to be prepared to deal with the people affected . "
and that is exactly what papandreou 's government is facing at the moment .
the public sector has gone on strike and indignant farmers are blocking the motorways and border crossings .
however , both experts agree that unless they get rid of the subsidies and begin to privatize state agencies , cleaning up the financial mess will be impossible .

from here it is 2,840km to the sea .
green groups have welcomed a program to clean up and protect europe 's second-largest and much-hymned river , the danube .
but activists have also urged more action to preserve what they see as a " backbone of biodiversity . " environmentalists have warned that pressure to build new hydroelectric plants and to make the river more navigable for shipping continue to threaten the danube , which runs a staggering 2,860 kilometers from germany 's black forest to the black sea in romania .
additional water regulation measures threaten the dynamism of the river - one of the danube 's most-prized qualities , according to georg kestel , danube expert of the german arm of friends of the earth , bund .
bildunterschrift : this is close to where the danube ends - by lake razim in romania " what makes this river really special is that it crosses through such a great variety of landscapes in its journey from west to east .

" the danube waters are shared by us all and therefore we also share the responsibility , " said mitja bricelj , president of the international commission for the protection of the danube river -lrb- icpdr -rrb- who hosted the meeting on tuesday -lrb- february 16 -rrb- in vienna .
" we meet to ensure that the resources of the danube basin are managed in an environmentally sustainable manner , " bricelj added . the plan includes a series of measures to be implemented by 2015 , including concrete efforts to reduce pollution and minimize the negative effects of man-made changes to the world 's most international river .
the re-naturalization of wetlands , the creation of natural flood barriers and the upgrading of dykes are also part of the program . more sustainable shipping bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist as well as freight ships frequent the danube environmental groups , such as bund and the world wildlife fund , generally welcomed the plan , but they also took the opportunity to present a petition with 100,000 signatures calling for greener and more sustainable shipping projects . in particular , green groups are campaigning against river regulation work in the upper danube between straubing and vilshofen in germany .
the planned construction of a dam and a canal would destroy the last significant free-flowing section of the river in germany .
" overall , we welcome it , but we do see some critical points , " said irene lucius , senioor policy coordinator of the wwf 's danube-carpathian program told afp news agency .
giving nature a helping hand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danube has a great symbolic significance in some countries bund expert georg kestel praised the moves to restore natural water meadows and to improve the continuity of the river by building fish ladders , for example , to allow their passage through dams and other man-made obstacles . kestel also backed the ministers ' call for the introduction of phosphate-free detergents - a problem in eastern europe .
however , he urged an eu-wide ban to make this effective .
although 10 member countries directly border the danube and there several more in its catchment area , international cooperation appears to be working well .
shared waters , different problems bildunterschrift : the danube delta in romania is a paradise for birds however , the river faces different problems in different places .
whereas in eastern europe the pollution of the river mainly stems from excessive levels of inadequately treated municipal sewage .
in the west , agriculture is the main culprit .
and whereas many free-flowing sections and water meadows have been lost in western europe , many remain intact further to the east .
for kestel , it is essential that the danube 's dynamic character is retained .
" the danube is classes better than the rhine .
shipping is very dominant there .
the problem is that there are number of projects hanging over the danube that would ruin its quality . "

the river is the backbone of biodiversity , " kestel told deutsche welle .
most international river bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : repeated flooding of the river has led to moves to restore flood plains environment ministers from 14 countries that either border the danube or belong to the river 's catchment area this week agreed to adopt a five-year plan to " improve the environmental condition of the danube and its tributaries " .
" the danube waters are shared by us all and therefore we also share the responsibility , " said mitja bricelj , president of the international commission for the protection of the danube river -lrb- icpdr -rrb- who hosted the meeting on tuesday -lrb- february 16 -rrb- in vienna .
" we meet to ensure that the resources of the danube basin are managed in an environmentally sustainable manner , " bricelj added . the plan includes a series of measures to be implemented by 2015 , including concrete efforts to reduce pollution and minimize the negative effects of man-made changes to the world 's most international river .
the re-naturalization of wetlands , the creation of natural flood barriers and the upgrading of dykes are also part of the program . more sustainable shipping bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist as well as freight ships frequent the danube environmental groups , such as bund and the world wildlife fund , generally welcomed the plan , but they also took the opportunity to present a petition with 100,000 signatures calling for greener and more sustainable shipping projects . in particular , green groups are campaigning against river regulation work in the upper danube between straubing and vilshofen in germany .
the planned construction of a dam and a canal would destroy the last significant free-flowing section of the river in germany .
" overall , we welcome it , but we do see some critical points , " said irene lucius , senioor policy coordinator of the wwf 's danube-carpathian program told afp news agency .
giving nature a helping hand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danube has a great symbolic significance in some countries bund expert georg kestel praised the moves to restore natural water meadows and to improve the continuity of the river by building fish ladders , for example , to allow their passage through dams and other man-made obstacles . kestel also backed the ministers ' call for the introduction of phosphate-free detergents - a problem in eastern europe .
however , he urged an eu-wide ban to make this effective .
although 10 member countries directly border the danube and there several more in its catchment area , international cooperation appears to be working well .
shared waters , different problems bildunterschrift : the danube delta in romania is a paradise for birds however , the river faces different problems in different places .
whereas in eastern europe the pollution of the river mainly stems from excessive levels of inadequately treated municipal sewage .
in the west , agriculture is the main culprit .
and whereas many free-flowing sections and water meadows have been lost in western europe , many remain intact further to the east .
for kestel , it is essential that the danube 's dynamic character is retained .
" the danube is classes better than the rhine .
shipping is very dominant there .
the problem is that there are number of projects hanging over the danube that would ruin its quality . "

a heterosexual couple in austria has vowed to go to the country 's highest court - to be granted a civil partnership introduced for gay couples .
they argue that current legislation is discriminatory . a heterosexual couple in austria is fighting for the right to enter into a registered civil partnership - introduced for homosexual couples in january 2010 .
under current law the couple will be denied that right - but they have vowed to take the case to the country 's constitutional court to overturn what they says is a discriminatory legislation .
austria introduced civil unions for gay couples on january 1 , affording them some of the rights enjoyed by their heterosexual counterparts .
the new legislation , passed after weeks of wrangling between the ruling social democrats and their conservative coalition partner in government , gives same-sex couples a status similar to traditional marriage but different in a number of respects .
for instance , there are less strict rules in the event of a divorce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the issue is equality - nothing but equality , ' the couple argues the heterosexual couple in question argues that this is a more modern form of union - which simply suits them better than a traditional marriage .
and if it 's offered to gay couples , why should n't it be an option for them as well ?
the issue at stake , they argue , is standing up against discrimination .
" everyone should have the same rights , and there should n't be different rules for different people , " the couple 's lawyer , helmut graupner , told deutsche welle .
" regardless of how many different forms of union a state provides to couples , all of those forms should be available for everyone and must not be restricted on the basis of race , class or sex or gender or other criteria , which are traditionally the very criteria for discrimination , " graupner said .
can you be ' a little bit equal ' ?
at the end of february , the couple plans to officially apply for a civil partnership - they expect this to be rejected , in which case they plan to take their case to the constitutional court .
their goal is to force the government to rework the legislation so that both traditional marriage and registered partnership will be open to any couple - gay or straight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay and lesbian activists say the different forms of union are discriminatory " the issue is equality - nothing but equality , " graupner said .
" you can not be ' a little bit equal . '
just like you ca n't be ' a little bit pregnant ' or ' a little bit dead . '
unless you 're entitled to the same kind of institutions and forms of law you 're not being treated equally and that 's discriminatory .
that 's what we are fighting against - we 're fighting for the rights of both heterosexuals and homosexuals . "
graupner is not only trying to help the heterosexual couple to get a ' gay ' marriage .
he 's also representing gay couples who want a traditional marriage - rather than the registered civil partnership that lawmakers have agreed on .
the current legislation provides same-sex couples with equal rights to heterosexuals with regards to pensions and alimony - but the law for instance continues to ban adoption .
it also does not allow civil partnership ceremonies at the civil registry office , where heterosexual couples can marry .
yet graupner is up against strong resistance .
the country 's conservative party - the austrian peoples party - only reluctantly agreed to the civil partnership in the first place .
the conservatives insists that significant differences between the two forms of union must remain .
the catholic church is not amused another powerful opponent to the law is the roman catholic church - after all , austria is predominantly catholic and the church is a force to be reckoned with .
the country 's clergy is opposed to the existing law , and certainly against any further liberalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the church ' different things need to be treated differently ' " the austrian bishops have made their position quite clear , " professor erich leitenberger , spokesman for the vienna diocese told deutsche welle .
" they strongly support the fact that the law does not put the civil partnership and a traditional marriage on an equal footing . "
" but the bishops have expressed concerns that the new law could be the beginning of a trend which eventually will lead to putting the civil partnership on the same footing as the traditional marriage between a man and a woman . "
leitenberger said that the legislation in place before january 1 was sufficient to safeguard the rights of gay and lesbian couples .
families , he argued , were shouldering the task of raising children and therefore could not be put on the same level with same-sex couples .
" the bishops stick to their position that a traditional marriage , a family raising children simply is something different from a homosexual couple - and therefore should also be treated differently . "
however , should the appeal to the constitutional court be successful , soon both of the two forms of union , could be open to any couple - a situation that would place austria at the forefront in terms of homosexual rights in europe .
the decision by the court is expected by the end of this year .

a heterosexual couple in austria has vowed to go to the country 's highest court - to be granted a civil partnership introduced for gay couples .
they argue that current legislation is discriminatory . a heterosexual couple in austria is fighting for the right to enter into a registered civil partnership - introduced for homosexual couples in january 2010 .
under current law the couple will be denied that right - but they have vowed to take the case to the country 's constitutional court to overturn what they says is a discriminatory legislation .
austria introduced civil unions for gay couples on january 1 , affording them some of the rights enjoyed by their heterosexual counterparts .
the new legislation , passed after weeks of wrangling between the ruling social democrats and their conservative coalition partner in government , gives same-sex couples a status similar to traditional marriage but different in a number of respects .
for instance , there are less strict rules in the event of a divorce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the issue is equality - nothing but equality , ' the couple argues the heterosexual couple in question argues that this is a more modern form of union - which simply suits them better than a traditional marriage .
and if it 's offered to gay couples , why should n't it be an option for them as well ?
the issue at stake , they argue , is standing up against discrimination .
" everyone should have the same rights , and there should n't be different rules for different people , " the couple 's lawyer , helmut graupner , told deutsche welle .
" regardless of how many different forms of union a state provides to couples , all of those forms should be available for everyone and must not be restricted on the basis of race , class or sex or gender or other criteria , which are traditionally the very criteria for discrimination , " graupner said .
can you be ' a little bit equal ' ?
at the end of february , the couple plans to officially apply for a civil partnership - they expect this to be rejected , in which case they plan to take their case to the constitutional court .
their goal is to force the government to rework the legislation so that both traditional marriage and registered partnership will be open to any couple - gay or straight .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay and lesbian activists say the different forms of union are discriminatory " the issue is equality - nothing but equality , " graupner said .
" you can not be ' a little bit equal . '
just like you ca n't be ' a little bit pregnant ' or ' a little bit dead . '
unless you 're entitled to the same kind of institutions and forms of law you 're not being treated equally and that 's discriminatory .
that 's what we are fighting against - we 're fighting for the rights of both heterosexuals and homosexuals . "
graupner is not only trying to help the heterosexual couple to get a ' gay ' marriage .
he 's also representing gay couples who want a traditional marriage - rather than the registered civil partnership that lawmakers have agreed on .
the current legislation provides same-sex couples with equal rights to heterosexuals with regards to pensions and alimony - but the law for instance continues to ban adoption .
it also does not allow civil partnership ceremonies at the civil registry office , where heterosexual couples can marry .
yet graupner is up against strong resistance .
the country 's conservative party - the austrian peoples party - only reluctantly agreed to the civil partnership in the first place .
the conservatives insists that significant differences between the two forms of union must remain .
the catholic church is not amused another powerful opponent to the law is the roman catholic church - after all , austria is predominantly catholic and the church is a force to be reckoned with .
the country 's clergy is opposed to the existing law , and certainly against any further liberalization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the church ' different things need to be treated differently ' " the austrian bishops have made their position quite clear , " professor erich leitenberger , spokesman for the vienna diocese told deutsche welle .
" they strongly support the fact that the law does not put the civil partnership and a traditional marriage on an equal footing . "
" but the bishops have expressed concerns that the new law could be the beginning of a trend which eventually will lead to putting the civil partnership on the same footing as the traditional marriage between a man and a woman . "
leitenberger said that the legislation in place before january 1 was sufficient to safeguard the rights of gay and lesbian couples .
families , he argued , were shouldering the task of raising children and therefore could not be put on the same level with same-sex couples .
" the bishops stick to their position that a traditional marriage , a family raising children simply is something different from a homosexual couple - and therefore should also be treated differently . "
however , should the appeal to the constitutional court be successful , soon both of the two forms of union , could be open to any couple - a situation that would place austria at the forefront in terms of homosexual rights in europe .
the decision by the court is expected by the end of this year .

from here it is 2,840km to the sea .
green groups have welcomed a program to clean up and protect europe 's second-largest and much-hymned river , the danube .
but activists have also urged more action to preserve what they see as a " backbone of biodiversity . " environmentalists have warned that pressure to build new hydroelectric plants and to make the river more navigable for shipping continue to threaten the danube , which runs a staggering 2,860 kilometers from germany 's black forest to the black sea in romania .
additional water regulation measures threaten the dynamism of the river - one of the danube 's most-prized qualities , according to georg kestel , danube expert of the german arm of friends of the earth , bund .
bildunterschrift : this is close to where the danube ends - by lake razim in romania " what makes this river really special is that it crosses through such a great variety of landscapes in its journey from west to east .

" the danube waters are shared by us all and therefore we also share the responsibility , " said mitja bricelj , president of the international commission for the protection of the danube river -lrb- icpdr -rrb- who hosted the meeting on tuesday -lrb- february 16 -rrb- in vienna .
" we meet to ensure that the resources of the danube basin are managed in an environmentally sustainable manner , " bricelj added . the plan includes a series of measures to be implemented by 2015 , including concrete efforts to reduce pollution and minimize the negative effects of man-made changes to the world 's most international river .
the re-naturalization of wetlands , the creation of natural flood barriers and the upgrading of dykes are also part of the program . more sustainable shipping bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourist as well as freight ships frequent the danube environmental groups , such as bund and the world wildlife fund , generally welcomed the plan , but they also took the opportunity to present a petition with 100,000 signatures calling for greener and more sustainable shipping projects . in particular , green groups are campaigning against river regulation work in the upper danube between straubing and vilshofen in germany .
the planned construction of a dam and a canal would destroy the last significant free-flowing section of the river in germany .
" overall , we welcome it , but we do see some critical points , " said irene lucius , senioor policy coordinator of the wwf 's danube-carpathian program told afp news agency .

however , he urged an eu-wide ban to make this effective .
although 10 member countries directly border the danube and there several more in its catchment area , international cooperation appears to be working well .

for kestel , it is essential that the danube 's dynamic character is retained .

the problem is that there are number of projects hanging over the danube that would ruin its quality . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de greece -pipe- 16.02.2010 the evolution of greece 's financial woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is greece doomed to repeat its financial history ?
greece 's financial woes started decades ago when the country was ruled by one socialist regime after another .
now experts warn that unless greece learns from its financial history , it is bound to repeat it . who would have imagined it ?
greece could soon be bankrupt and there are some speculations that athens will begin refusing payment on its obligations .
due to massive debt and doctored data , greece has lost the trust of both the european union and the financial markets .
and it 's not looking good for athens , despite an eu security net .
greece currently owes foreign banks more than $ 300 billion -lrb- 219.8 billion euros -rrb- , which equals 115 percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
their current debt amounts to more then 12.7 percent of their economic output .
but how did it get this far ?
spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "
repeating history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overspending led to greece 's current situation this is not new territory for greece .
back in the 1980 's and 1990 's the country faced similar financial difficulties .
back then the socialist governments solved the problem by devaluing the country 's former currency , the drachma .
that way they were able to shrink imports and raise exports .
but economic expert babi papadimitriou said this option became unavailable when greece entered into the euro zone . over the past few years the political elite and the greek government have not really grasped what it means to be a member of the euro zone , the economist said .
" it goes without saying that you have to reduce your deficit as much as possible when you share your currency with other countries , " he said .
" but those in power have ignored this principle .
and the necessary reforms were never imposed . "
the state acted irresponsibly as costs began to mount and the ability for the economy to compete on an international level was reduced .
when added to the global financial crisis that hit back in 2008 , these structural weak points became a full-blown nightmare .
cutting costs the country 's biggest problem is the state itself and the services it offers .
according to professor paraskewopoulos , the largest share of savings could come from cutting the costs incurred by public employees : reducing tax exceptions , putting a hiring freeze on state offices and reducing employee salaries .
along with this , he said the government needs to tackle two other major hurdles : tax evasion and corruption . each year the greek government loses 20 billion euros in unpaid taxes , and it is estimated that the average greek family pays out some 1,600 euros annually in bribes .
notoriously , things rarely work in the country without a little money to grease the wheels .
bildunterschrift : greek prime minister george papandreou has some very unenviable choices to make " those in power have always rewarded those loyal to them with cushy jobs and now we have a bloated government that costs an inconceivable amount of money .
that 's where you have to start , " explained paraskewopoulos .
" of course that 's easy to say , but to really do it , you have to be prepared to deal with the people affected . "
and that is exactly what papandreou 's government is facing at the moment .
the public sector has gone on strike and indignant farmers are blocking the motorways and border crossings .
however , both experts agree that unless they get rid of the subsidies and begin to privatize state agencies , cleaning up the financial mess will be impossible .

ireland 's 24 standing bishops , summoned to the vatican to address the crisis , told the pontiff of their " shame " at the scandal and vowed to cooperate with authorities in ireland .
in a statement of their own , they said " significant measures have now been taken to ensure the safety of children and young people " involved in church-led activities .
murphy commission the irish church is facing criticism from a commission headed by judge yvonne murphy , which in november accused it of mishandling more than 300 sex abuse claims in the archdiocese of dublin between 1975 and 2004 .
four irish bishops have already tendered their resignations as a consequence of the murphy commission 's revelations .
to date , the pope has accepted one of the resignations .
the vatican statement did not mention specific disciplinary measures to be taken against the remaining three clerics involved in the scandal .
the resignations of the clerics and other church officials in ireland " were not discussed , " said chief vatican spokesman father federico lombardi .
" that is a separate procedure , " he said , stressing that the two-day meeting in rome was " only a step of a long process . " cmk / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu offered its support , but no firm commitments on specific aid . at a european union meeting in brussels , finance ministers from germany , sweden and austria told greece it needs to do more to bring its runaway debt under control and calm worried financial markets .
joerg asmussen , germany 's deputy finance minister , advised greece to follow the lead of ireland and latvia , eu countries which are slashing spending in an effort to rein in their financial troubles .
" we made it clear the ball is in greece 's court , " asmussen said .
" additional measures by greece are needed . "
a statement issued by the ministers after the meeting said although greece has until march 16 to prove it has taken initial steps towards reducing its budgetary deficit by four percent , they will likely demand more budget cuts or tax hikes to prevent wider financial troubles .
the four percent reduction is the first step in a plan to eventually reduce the deficit from 12.7 percent of gdp to less than three percent in 2012 .
" the pressure on greece to consider further measures by march 16 has clearly increased , " said austrian finance minister josef proell .

greek finance minister george papaconstantinou told reporters after the meeting that the country is already ahead of its deficit reduction goals , adding that a one-off tax on large companies had resulted in a january surplus .
papaconstantinou , who warned on monday that his government would need more than a day to turn things around , said the pledge of support should act as a deterrent if financial markets increased the pressure on greece or other euro zone countries .

greece 's financial woes started decades ago when the country was ruled by one socialist regime after another .
now experts warn that unless greece learns from its financial history , it is bound to repeat it . who would have imagined it ?
greece could soon be bankrupt and there are some speculations that athens will begin refusing payment on its obligations .
due to massive debt and doctored data , greece has lost the trust of both the european union and the financial markets .
and it 's not looking good for athens , despite an eu security net .
greece currently owes foreign banks more than $ 300 billion -lrb- 219.8 billion euros -rrb- , which equals 115 percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
their current debt amounts to more then 12.7 percent of their economic output .
but how did it get this far ?
spiros paraskewopoulos , a greek national currently working as a professor of macroeconomics at the university of leipzig in eastern germany , believes the root of the problem lies in the sins of the past .
specifically , he points to the growth and development policies of the last 30 years , which " have been based on consumption . "
this consumption was financed through credit , and since the greeks did not invest any of the money , they now have no way to pay it back , paraskewopoulos explained .
" so now we 're here , " he said referring to eu demands to significantly cut spending .
" both the greek government and people have been living above their means . "
repeating history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overspending led to greece 's current situation this is not new territory for greece .
back in the 1980 's and 1990 's the country faced similar financial difficulties .
back then the socialist governments solved the problem by devaluing the country 's former currency , the drachma .
that way they were able to shrink imports and raise exports .
but economic expert babi papadimitriou said this option became unavailable when greece entered into the euro zone . over the past few years the political elite and the greek government have not really grasped what it means to be a member of the euro zone , the economist said .
" it goes without saying that you have to reduce your deficit as much as possible when you share your currency with other countries , " he said .
" but those in power have ignored this principle .
and the necessary reforms were never imposed . "
the state acted irresponsibly as costs began to mount and the ability for the economy to compete on an international level was reduced .
when added to the global financial crisis that hit back in 2008 , these structural weak points became a full-blown nightmare .
cutting costs the country 's biggest problem is the state itself and the services it offers .
according to professor paraskewopoulos , the largest share of savings could come from cutting the costs incurred by public employees : reducing tax exceptions , putting a hiring freeze on state offices and reducing employee salaries .
along with this , he said the government needs to tackle two other major hurdles : tax evasion and corruption . each year the greek government loses 20 billion euros in unpaid taxes , and it is estimated that the average greek family pays out some 1,600 euros annually in bribes .
notoriously , things rarely work in the country without a little money to grease the wheels .
bildunterschrift : greek prime minister george papandreou has some very unenviable choices to make " those in power have always rewarded those loyal to them with cushy jobs and now we have a bloated government that costs an inconceivable amount of money .
that 's where you have to start , " explained paraskewopoulos .
" of course that 's easy to say , but to really do it , you have to be prepared to deal with the people affected . "
and that is exactly what papandreou 's government is facing at the moment .
the public sector has gone on strike and indignant farmers are blocking the motorways and border crossings .
however , both experts agree that unless they get rid of the subsidies and begin to privatize state agencies , cleaning up the financial mess will be impossible .

nearly 50 rebels on motorcycles encircled the camp of the eastern frontier rifles -lrb- erf -rrb- at silda village on monday and started firing on it .
more fighters joined the assault on foot , firing from automatic weapons .
more than 6,000 people have died during the rebels ' 20-year fight for communist rule in many indian states .
the indian government recently began a major offensive against the rebels in several states .
indian prime minister manmohan singh has described the maoist insurgency as india 's " greatest internal security challenge " .
the rebels now have a presence in 223 of india 's 600-odd districts .
landmines the camp was overrun by the maoists after the troops put up brief initial resistance , district magistrate of west midnapore district ns nigam told the bbc .
" the maoists then burnt down the camp and planted landmines on the entire length of the road leading to the camp .
reinforcements with night vision and anti-landmine vehicles reached the camp late at night , " mr nigam said .
at least 24 bodies have been recovered from in and around the camp and some of them are badly charred , he said .
the government has launched a major offensive against the rebels the seriously injured troops were being taken to the state capital , calcutta , for treatment .
officials said at least 12 soldiers were still missing .
it took four hours for reinforcements to reached silda as there were landmines planted on the entire stretch of the road .
police officials leading the reinforcements that reached silda late at night said many of the paramilitary troops were shot dead by the rebels as they tried to escape the fire .
west bengal 's police chief bhupinder singh said there were nearly 50 erf troops in the camp when the attack took place .
the maoists pulled out of silda after looting a huge amount of weapons from the camp 's armoury .
chief of the rebels ' military wing , koteswara rao - alias kishenji - claimed responsibility for the attack .
he said this attack was the beginning of " operation peace hunt " , the maoist answer to the government " operation green hunt " launched against the maoists recently .
" we are looking for peace but we are forced to fight and kill the poor troops of the government forces .
we will mourn the death of those killed but the government is responsible for their death , " kishenji told the bbc by phone from an undisclosed location .
the maoist leader warned of more such attacks unless operation green hunt was stopped .
earlier this month home minister p chidambaram held a meeting of four maoist-affected states - west bengal , jharkhand , bihar and orissa - in calcutta .
he threatened to intensify operation green hunt if the rebels did not start talks by abjuring violence .
the maoists said they would agree to talks if four of their senior leaders now in jail were released and operation green hunt was halted .
the government has not responded to that conditional overture .

police officials leading the reinforcements that reached silda late at night said many of the paramilitary troops were shot dead by the rebels as they tried to escape the fire .
west bengal 's police chief bhupinder singh said there were nearly 50 erf troops in the camp when the attack took place .
the maoists pulled out of silda after looting a huge amount of weapons from the camp 's armoury .
chief of the rebels ' military wing , koteswara rao - alias kishenji - claimed responsibility for the attack .
he said this attack was the beginning of " operation peace hunt " , the maoist answer to the government " operation green hunt " launched against the maoists recently .
" we are looking for peace but we are forced to fight and kill the poor troops of the government forces .
we will mourn the death of those killed but the government is responsible for their death , " kishenji told the bbc by phone from an undisclosed location .
the maoist leader warned of more such attacks unless operation green hunt was stopped .
earlier this month home minister p chidambaram held a meeting of four maoist-affected states - west bengal , jharkhand , bihar and orissa - in calcutta .
he threatened to intensify operation green hunt if the rebels did not start talks by abjuring violence .
the maoists said they would agree to talks if four of their senior leaders now in jail were released and operation green hunt was halted .
the government has not responded to that conditional overture .
