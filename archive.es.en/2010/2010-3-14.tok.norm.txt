werder bremen beat hoffenheim , and stay close to the european qualification spots . bayer leverkusen kept their championship hopes alive on sunday with a much needed win against fellow top-team hamburg .
on home turf , leverkusen won 4-2 , with a brace of goals fairy early in the second half turning the game decisively in their favor .
german international striker stefan kiessling opened the scoring after 22 minutes for leverkusen , after being set clear by a wonderful pass from tranquilo barnetta .
however , eleven minutes later goalie rene adler came to claim high ball , but only succeeded in colliding with veteran sami hyppia .
adler only parried the ball as far as hamburg 's ze roberto , who gratefully fired into the unprotected goal .
ten minutes after the break swiss striker eren derdiyok put leverkusen back in front , and just after the hour mark , kiessling grabbed his second of the game - and his 16th of the season - heading home from close range .
hamburg did narrow leverkusen 's lead on 83 minutes , but it was too little , too late , and leverkusen 's gonzalo castro added a fourth just moments later , finally putting the match beyond doubt .
that win moves leverkusen up to 53 points , still in third position , but only three points adrift of leaders bayern munich , and one point shy of second-placed side schalke .
hamburg remain fifth in the table , but might be looking over their shoulders , given the result in sunday 's other fixture .
bremen in range bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudio pizarro was the man of the match , scoring the winner for bremen it was n't a similar feast of goals but werder bremen sealed a valuable 1-0 win in hoffenheim during the earlier match of the day .
peruvian striker claudio pizarro - playing his 100th game for bremen - scored a late winner , bagging three key points for a side still hoping to qualify for european competition .
pizarro latched on to a nice through pass from daniel jensen , and looped the ball over hoffenheim keeper timo hildebrand .
bremen now are within one point of fifth-placed hamburg , and only three away from borussia dortmund in fourth .
and with bremen 's attacking and open style , the team already has a superior goal difference than both the sides it 's chasing .
finishing in the top five in the bundesliga would earn bremen the reward of a spot in european competition next season. msh / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just like in 2005 and 2006 , the spaniard spoiled schumacher 's party in bahrain . the spotlight might have been on michael schumacher 's return to formula one and his new mercedes gp team , but it was schumi 's former employer ferrari that took the spoils at the first race in bahrain .
schumacher 's old adversary fernando alonso - making his debut for the scuderia - came in first , with his teammate felipe massa second .
massa was making a comeback of his own , after sustaining serious head and eye injuries in a freak accident midway through last season , which sidelined him for the rest of the year .
2008 world champion lewis hamilton rounded out the podium for mclaren mercedes .
fourth-placed sebastian vettel looked like the winner for most of the race , having led from pole position .
but in the closing stages he radioed in to the pits with the message , " there 's a loss of power , loss of power . " a mechanical problem was to blame , and vettel dropped down the order .
the 22-year-old even got back in touch with the garage later to ask if the mechanics could fix the problem on their computers , but he did n't get the answer he wanted to hear . " for me it was noticeable that there was no juice back there , " vettel told reporters , expalining he did n't yet know what had gone wrong with the car . " fourth place is great damage limitation , until then the race was perfect .
we had managed our tires better than the others , fernando -lsb- alonso , then in second place -rsb- was attacking , but i think we had him under control . "
mercedes off the pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher finished a solid sixth , but win number 92 will have to wait but vettel just managed to keep the rather disappointing " silver arrows " at bay .
the mercedes gp duo nico rosberg and michael schumacher claimed fifth and sixth places , respectively , with rosberg glued to vettel 's gearbox by the end .
as schumacher had predicted in pre-season testing , the mercedes car was close to the top teams ' pace , but could n't keep up over race distance .
both rosberg and schumacher 's best efforts in the race were over a second shy of the fastest lap set by alonso .
" red bull and ferrari definitely have the advantage right now , " schumacher told german television reporters after the race . " but that 's roughly what we expected pre-season , we have a lot of work to do to get to the front .
but it 's not impossible . "
reigning champion jenson button came in seventh for mclaren mercedes , red bull 's mark webber had a frustrating day back in eighth , force india 's vitantonio liuzzi grabbed an impressive ninth , and williams veteran rubens barrichello scored the last available points in tenth .
disappointing day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pole-sitter vettel was n't the only unlucky german driver vettel 's mechanical issues and mercedes ' missing pace was but the tip of the iceberg , as german drivers struggled lower down the field as well .
adrian sutil , starting a promising 10th for force india , spun on the first lap , and had to fight his way through the field from the back .
he only managed 12th in the end .
debutant nico hulkenberg lost control of his williams at the tricky turns six and seven early in the race ; he was doomed to a similar fate to sutil , finishing 14th .
and virgin racing 's timo glock - one of the drivers brave enough to go to work for one of the three struggling new teams - only made it half way through the race before retiring .
only two of the six new entrants - the two lotus cars - made it to the checkered flag .

the mercedes gp duo nico rosberg and michael schumacher claimed fifth and sixth places , respectively , with rosberg glued to vettel 's gearbox by the end .
as schumacher had predicted in pre-season testing , the mercedes car was close to the top teams ' pace , but could n't keep up over race distance .
both rosberg and schumacher 's best efforts in the race were over a second shy of the fastest lap set by alonso .
" red bull and ferrari definitely have the advantage right now , " schumacher told german television reporters after the race . " but that 's roughly what we expected pre-season , we have a lot of work to do to get to the front .

reigning champion jenson button came in seventh for mclaren mercedes , red bull 's mark webber had a frustrating day back in eighth , force india 's vitantonio liuzzi grabbed an impressive ninth , and williams veteran rubens barrichello scored the last available points in tenth .

werder bremen beat hoffenheim , and stay close to the european qualification spots . bayer leverkusen kept their championship hopes alive on sunday with a much needed win against fellow top-team hamburg .
on home turf , leverkusen won 4-2 , with a brace of goals fairy early in the second half turning the game decisively in their favor .
german international striker stefan kiessling opened the scoring after 22 minutes for leverkusen , after being set clear by a wonderful pass from tranquilo barnetta .
however , eleven minutes later goalie rene adler came to claim high ball , but only succeeded in colliding with veteran sami hyppia .
adler only parried the ball as far as hamburg 's ze roberto , who gratefully fired into the unprotected goal .
ten minutes after the break swiss striker eren derdiyok put leverkusen back in front , and just after the hour mark , kiessling grabbed his second of the game - and his 16th of the season - heading home from close range .
hamburg did narrow leverkusen 's lead on 83 minutes , but it was too little , too late , and leverkusen 's gonzalo castro added a fourth just moments later , finally putting the match beyond doubt .
that win moves leverkusen up to 53 points , still in third position , but only three points adrift of leaders bayern munich , and one point shy of second-placed side schalke .
hamburg remain fifth in the table , but might be looking over their shoulders , given the result in sunday 's other fixture .
bremen in range bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudio pizarro was the man of the match , scoring the winner for bremen it was n't a similar feast of goals but werder bremen sealed a valuable 1-0 win in hoffenheim during the earlier match of the day .
peruvian striker claudio pizarro - playing his 100th game for bremen - scored a late winner , bagging three key points for a side still hoping to qualify for european competition .
pizarro latched on to a nice through pass from daniel jensen , and looped the ball over hoffenheim keeper timo hildebrand .
bremen now are within one point of fifth-placed hamburg , and only three away from borussia dortmund in fourth .
and with bremen 's attacking and open style , the team already has a superior goal difference than both the sides it 's chasing .

werder bremen beat hoffenheim , and stay close to the european qualification spots . bayer leverkusen kept their championship hopes alive on sunday with a much needed win against fellow top-team hamburg .
on home turf , leverkusen won 4-2 , with a brace of goals fairy early in the second half turning the game decisively in their favor .
german international striker stefan kiessling opened the scoring after 22 minutes for leverkusen , after being set clear by a wonderful pass from tranquilo barnetta .
however , eleven minutes later goalie rene adler came to claim high ball , but only succeeded in colliding with veteran sami hyppia .
adler only parried the ball as far as hamburg 's ze roberto , who gratefully fired into the unprotected goal .
ten minutes after the break swiss striker eren derdiyok put leverkusen back in front , and just after the hour mark , kiessling grabbed his second of the game - and his 16th of the season - heading home from close range .
hamburg did narrow leverkusen 's lead on 83 minutes , but it was too little , too late , and leverkusen 's gonzalo castro added a fourth just moments later , finally putting the match beyond doubt .
that win moves leverkusen up to 53 points , still in third position , but only three points adrift of leaders bayern munich , and one point shy of second-placed side schalke .
hamburg remain fifth in the table , but might be looking over their shoulders , given the result in sunday 's other fixture .
bremen in range bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudio pizarro was the man of the match , scoring the winner for bremen it was n't a similar feast of goals but werder bremen sealed a valuable 1-0 win in hoffenheim during the earlier match of the day .
peruvian striker claudio pizarro - playing his 100th game for bremen - scored a late winner , bagging three key points for a side still hoping to qualify for european competition .
pizarro latched on to a nice through pass from daniel jensen , and looped the ball over hoffenheim keeper timo hildebrand .
bremen now are within one point of fifth-placed hamburg , and only three away from borussia dortmund in fourth .
and with bremen 's attacking and open style , the team already has a superior goal difference than both the sides it 's chasing .
finishing in the top five in the bundesliga would earn bremen the reward of a spot in european competition next season. msh / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the last synagogue in herford closed during adolf hitler 's rule of germany . after over 70 years , the city of herford has an official jewish place of worship once again .
the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , juergen ruettgers , and the president of the germany 's central council of jews , charlotte knobloch , celebrated along with the congregation at the opening ceremony .
" i hope for you - and for us all - that jewish life here in north rhine-westphalia bears fruit - that it is present , changes , initiates change , and invigorates , " ruettgers said .
" we must , and we will , do everything to ensure there is never another auschwitz . "
charlotte knobloch commented on how jewish history in herford stretches back seven centuries , although after the holocaust only a handful of the roughly 200 former inhabitants returned .
the former synagogue was destroyed during " kristallnacht " -lrb- " the night of broken glass " -rrb- on november 9 , 1938 , one of the nazis ' most widespread and brutal single purges of jewish society within germany .
knobloch said the synagogue would act as a memorial for the former jewish community , meaning that worshippers might shed a few tears from time to time .
" but today , together , we can prove that there can also be tears of joy , " she said .
jewish population on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 267 synagogues and thousands of homes and shops were destroyed during " kristallnacht " the neo-gothic building was erected on the site of the former synagogue , which was constructed in 1852 .
it cost roughly two million euros , and the prayer area can accommodate over 90 people .
the prayer room in a nearby jewish school in herford had becaome overcrowded in recent years due to the arrival of many jews from the former soviet union .
herford is in the east of the state , near osnabruck and bielefeld .

how is the project advancing ?
the digital archive structure itself is there – the goal now is to fill it .
the staff can now analyse the archive contents , digitize the traditional analog storage media , and restore damaged tapes .
some 10,000 audio files have been digitized and 80,000 descriptive files have been logged .
we estimate that it will take another five years to digitize the tape material , and at least two years to restore the badly damaged tapes .
most of the staff working in the archive has not been trained in the various fields of archiving .
this means they will need ongoing training so that in the medium and long-term , they will be able to manage the archive independently .
how will vov benefit from the project ?
the archiving and restoration expertise which we ’ ve established for broadcasting is unique here in vietnam and also in asia .
long-term , the project will improve the broadcaster ’ s quality of programming , increase its topicality and preserve its historical value .
and in the end , it supports the country ’ s exchange with other nations – we ’ ve begun cross-linking asia ’ s archives , which not only strengthens south-south cooperation but also inner-asian dialogue .
you will be in vietnam for a total of two years .
how did the first few months proceed ?
my tasks in 2009 were to establish a dw-akademie regional office , to encourage and support the people at asian broadcasting archives , and to intensify our contacts with our asian partner organizations .
from a german perspective , the lively exchange with other development agencies has also been important .
all in all , this is an exciting project with lasting results .
by investing in the past we ’ re creating benefits for the future .
what are the plans for 2010 ?
this year we ’ ve started concentrating more on the multimedia archive .
vov launched a television channel in september 2008 , and that means there ’ s a lot of audio-visual material which needs to be archived .
there ’ s also an online project , where we need to think about how to store content long-term .
as for audio , we ’ ll be developing a strategy whereby audio archives and audio media from the regional stations can be digitized in accordance with the standards we have set .
in addition to the work in vietnam , we ’ ll also be expanding our regional consulting services .
this includes continuing the archive project with radio nepal in kathmandu .
we ’ ll conduct an archive analysis for sri lanka broadcasting corporation in colombo to see where further consultations are needed .
and we ’ ll also hold a regional archiving workshop in malaysia .
the need for more archiving expertise in asia is enormous . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 german version dw-akademie auf deutsch dw-tv europe live in focus - documentaries and reports we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

since assuming office barack obama has redefined the conflict by calling it the af-pak war . the us president 's redefinition is recognition that the taliban 's nerve center , as well as al qaeda 's safe haven , are across afghanistan 's border in neighboring pakistan .
in the forbidding tribal territories , waziristan especially , another dimension of the same fierce conflict is underway with more pakistani troops thrown into the fray than the whole of nato deploys on its side of the northwest frontier .
but unlike afghanistan where nato allows journalists free access to combat operations , the pakistani military remains media-averse and highly secretive of its own internal counter-insurgency efforts .
on the surface of things , however pakistan is nato 's and particularly washington 's staunch ally in the regional and global campaign against terror .
it 's a role for which islamabad in dire economic straits is rewarded handsomely with a massive combined us economic and military aid package it could not do without .
but as british author moni mohsin , a lifelong student of pakistan , points out " pakistan is also the only us ally america frequently bombs with drone missile strikes , which sometimes kill terrorists and just as often kill civilians . "
and while islamabad is at pains to denounce the predator missile attacks and adamantly insists it does not authorize them , mohsin told deutsche welle that there is tacit pakistani government approval for the strikes .
yet when the attacks are publicized it only helps to feed the ever present anti-american propaganda in pakistan 's right wing media " which in turn becomes a pro-talibanization as far as the public is concerned . "
anti-us sentiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , and its director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- , have been accused of stoking up tensions in afghanistan the prevalence of anti-us sentiment in popular culture is something the pakistani army and the all powerful military intelligence service , or isi , seems to thrive on and encourage although they are ostensible allies of the west , in presumably the same struggle .
the underpinning complexity of such duality is at the essence of what routine western analysis of south asia often fails to pinpoint .
at the core of this double game , is pakistan 's traditional enmity with india , the dominance of the armed forces and its spymasters in pakistan 's national and political life and a long standing rapport with the taliban and other radical groups which it has not only supported but also created in some cases .
british journalist rishaad salamat , a long time pakistani analyst and a senior economic anchor with bloomberg europe , argues that from a national security perspective " there are elements in the isi who do n't want a democratic and stable afghanistan .
a state that they perceive as being in the pocket of india and one which has irredentist claims on pakistani territory . " mohsin concurs .
" the pakistani army feels threatened by india on its right flank .
and if most countries have armies , pakistan is an army with a country and to remain in this preeminent position , the generals play up the indian threat .
but then india does have a massive presence and influence in afghanistan .
it has 26 consulates , what does afghanistan have as one of the poorest nations on earth that india needs so badly ? "
proxy war means more instability muddling things further in what seems to be an ongoing proxy war between delhi and islamabad , though they are not playing it up , there is widespread suspicion in western intelligence agencies that the isi may well have behind the recent suicide attacks and shootings in kabul aimed at the indian community there .
not surprising when the pakistani jihadist group laskhar e taiba which carried out the bloody raid on mumbai in 2008 is clearly recognized as an offspring of the isi , recruited , armed and trained by the intelligence service .
that thus far islamabad has also refused to extradite or try a single suspect among over 40 militants linked to the slaughter has only exacerbated tensions with its indian rival .
this refusal arguably brought india and pakistan to the brink of what might have become their fourth modern war since achieving independence from the british raj in 1947 .
it is also undeniable that the isi has a clear hand in supporting separatist militants in indian administered kashmir .
though it is n't all one way mischief , india continues to covertly back baluchi separatists in pakistan deeply alienated from central government , in what endures as another , albeit lower-level rebellion within islamabad 's borders .
it is also now conveniently overlooked that the taliban itself , ironically enough , was the very creation - with a lot of us funding - of both the isi and the cia , designed to act as a tool to confront moscow during the soviet war in afghanistan .
what remains more confusing is that while the pakistani army fights a costly war against the taliban in its own tribal areas , every once in a while taliban casualties in afghanistan are discovered wearing pakistani army dog tags , most of them officers on seconded , special duty .
there have also been repeated instances of taliban prisoners of war admitting that pakistani regular army officers run specialized taliban training camps .
so does it mean civil war has spread to the ranks of the pakistani military itself ?
is it a simple case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing ?
not quite .
mohsin argues that there are elements of the taliban the pakistani army and the isi do not control nor favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the isaf troops are facing an uphill battle on several different fronts " the army and isi say -lrb- to washington -rrb- look we will deal with al qaeda and the jihadists , but you have made it clear that you will withdraw sooner rather than later and we want an afghan government in which we have a say , because we live here and we 'd prefer a taliban type of government we can play ball with , " mohsin told deutsche welle .
it is a stance that angers washington but when " nato is bleeding and pakistani support is critical there is little that they can do and pakistan is going to milk it for all its worth and keep collecting the aid looking to washington to keep defusing tensions with dehli . "
history repeating itself ?
of course there are also other permutations of power geo-politics at play too .
china remains a staunch pakistani ally and military supplier because it suits china to have pakistan as a thorn in india 's side , with whom its also fought a war in the past and seeks to check its power .
israel increasingly has also emerged as key provider of military technology for india which it sees as a natural ally in the fight against islamic radicalism .
but its hard to escape the perception that the pakistani military and the isi are really the key players in the drama of the hindu kush and the larger crisis of south asia .
within pakistan itself the military 's power far exceeds that of a weak civilian government .
a massive portion of the national budget is allocated to the armed forces with no questions asked .
there is no public nor international accountability of the nature of conflict in the territories , where there may well be large scale civilian losses and human rights abuses on both sides .
and among those that dissent in pakistan , but who also oppose radicalization , the military and the isi are challenging democracy itself , pitting the judiciary against the government and using nationalist sentiment in the conservative elements of the media to keep tensions at a fever pitch .
it 's a dangerous game and last year casualties from suicide bombings in pakistan exceeded those in iraq .
bildunterschrift : foreign troops have more often than not failed in afghanistan the great game as it was once called pitted the british and russian empires against one another with afghanistan as the chosen battleground .
during world war ii , nazi germany even sought afghanistan as a potential ally in its struggle against britain , even sending a team of saboteurs to blow up bridges on the afghan-indian borders .
of course the soviets had their failed era and now it is america and its nato european allies who are embroiled in the hindu kush .
but it is much more complex than anyone dare admit and it would seem as ever , if history is anything to go by , it is the locals that will have the final say , not the outsider .

since assuming office barack obama has redefined the conflict by calling it the af-pak war . the us president 's redefinition is recognition that the taliban 's nerve center , as well as al qaeda 's safe haven , are across afghanistan 's border in neighboring pakistan .
in the forbidding tribal territories , waziristan especially , another dimension of the same fierce conflict is underway with more pakistani troops thrown into the fray than the whole of nato deploys on its side of the northwest frontier .
but unlike afghanistan where nato allows journalists free access to combat operations , the pakistani military remains media-averse and highly secretive of its own internal counter-insurgency efforts .
on the surface of things , however pakistan is nato 's and particularly washington 's staunch ally in the regional and global campaign against terror .
it 's a role for which islamabad in dire economic straits is rewarded handsomely with a massive combined us economic and military aid package it could not do without .
but as british author moni mohsin , a lifelong student of pakistan , points out " pakistan is also the only us ally america frequently bombs with drone missile strikes , which sometimes kill terrorists and just as often kill civilians . "
and while islamabad is at pains to denounce the predator missile attacks and adamantly insists it does not authorize them , mohsin told deutsche welle that there is tacit pakistani government approval for the strikes .
yet when the attacks are publicized it only helps to feed the ever present anti-american propaganda in pakistan 's right wing media " which in turn becomes a pro-talibanization as far as the public is concerned . "
anti-us sentiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , and its director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- , have been accused of stoking up tensions in afghanistan the prevalence of anti-us sentiment in popular culture is something the pakistani army and the all powerful military intelligence service , or isi , seems to thrive on and encourage although they are ostensible allies of the west , in presumably the same struggle .
the underpinning complexity of such duality is at the essence of what routine western analysis of south asia often fails to pinpoint .
at the core of this double game , is pakistan 's traditional enmity with india , the dominance of the armed forces and its spymasters in pakistan 's national and political life and a long standing rapport with the taliban and other radical groups which it has not only supported but also created in some cases .
british journalist rishaad salamat , a long time pakistani analyst and a senior economic anchor with bloomberg europe , argues that from a national security perspective " there are elements in the isi who do n't want a democratic and stable afghanistan .
a state that they perceive as being in the pocket of india and one which has irredentist claims on pakistani territory . " mohsin concurs .
" the pakistani army feels threatened by india on its right flank .
and if most countries have armies , pakistan is an army with a country and to remain in this preeminent position , the generals play up the indian threat .
but then india does have a massive presence and influence in afghanistan .
it has 26 consulates , what does afghanistan have as one of the poorest nations on earth that india needs so badly ? "
proxy war means more instability muddling things further in what seems to be an ongoing proxy war between delhi and islamabad , though they are not playing it up , there is widespread suspicion in western intelligence agencies that the isi may well have behind the recent suicide attacks and shootings in kabul aimed at the indian community there .
not surprising when the pakistani jihadist group laskhar e taiba which carried out the bloody raid on mumbai in 2008 is clearly recognized as an offspring of the isi , recruited , armed and trained by the intelligence service .
that thus far islamabad has also refused to extradite or try a single suspect among over 40 militants linked to the slaughter has only exacerbated tensions with its indian rival .
this refusal arguably brought india and pakistan to the brink of what might have become their fourth modern war since achieving independence from the british raj in 1947 .
it is also undeniable that the isi has a clear hand in supporting separatist militants in indian administered kashmir .
though it is n't all one way mischief , india continues to covertly back baluchi separatists in pakistan deeply alienated from central government , in what endures as another , albeit lower-level rebellion within islamabad 's borders .
it is also now conveniently overlooked that the taliban itself , ironically enough , was the very creation - with a lot of us funding - of both the isi and the cia , designed to act as a tool to confront moscow during the soviet war in afghanistan .
what remains more confusing is that while the pakistani army fights a costly war against the taliban in its own tribal areas , every once in a while taliban casualties in afghanistan are discovered wearing pakistani army dog tags , most of them officers on seconded , special duty .
there have also been repeated instances of taliban prisoners of war admitting that pakistani regular army officers run specialized taliban training camps .
so does it mean civil war has spread to the ranks of the pakistani military itself ?
is it a simple case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing ?
not quite .
mohsin argues that there are elements of the taliban the pakistani army and the isi do not control nor favor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de motor racing -pipe- 14.03.2010 fernando alonso and ferrari spoil the schumacher party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike schumacher in 1997 , alonso won on his ferrari debut on the day of michael schumacher 's return to formula one , it was his old rival fernando alonso who rolled back the years .
just like in 2005 and 2006 , the spaniard spoiled schumacher 's party in bahrain . the spotlight might have been on michael schumacher 's return to formula one and his new mercedes gp team , but it was schumi 's former employer ferrari that took the spoils at the first race in bahrain .
schumacher 's old adversary fernando alonso - making his debut for the scuderia - came in first , with his teammate felipe massa second .
massa was making a comeback of his own , after sustaining serious head and eye injuries in a freak accident midway through last season , which sidelined him for the rest of the year .
2008 world champion lewis hamilton rounded out the podium for mclaren mercedes .
fourth-placed sebastian vettel looked like the winner for most of the race , having led from pole position .
but in the closing stages he radioed in to the pits with the message , " there 's a loss of power , loss of power . " a mechanical problem was to blame , and vettel dropped down the order .
the 22-year-old even got back in touch with the garage later to ask if the mechanics could fix the problem on their computers , but he did n't get the answer he wanted to hear . " for me it was noticeable that there was no juice back there , " vettel told reporters , expalining he did n't yet know what had gone wrong with the car . " fourth place is great damage limitation , until then the race was perfect .
we had managed our tires better than the others , fernando -lsb- alonso , then in second place -rsb- was attacking , but i think we had him under control . "
mercedes off the pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher finished a solid sixth , but win number 92 will have to wait but vettel just managed to keep the rather disappointing " silver arrows " at bay .
the mercedes gp duo nico rosberg and michael schumacher claimed fifth and sixth places , respectively , with rosberg glued to vettel 's gearbox by the end .
as schumacher had predicted in pre-season testing , the mercedes car was close to the top teams ' pace , but could n't keep up over race distance .
both rosberg and schumacher 's best efforts in the race were over a second shy of the fastest lap set by alonso .
" red bull and ferrari definitely have the advantage right now , " schumacher told german television reporters after the race . " but that 's roughly what we expected pre-season , we have a lot of work to do to get to the front .
but it 's not impossible . "
reigning champion jenson button came in seventh for mclaren mercedes , red bull 's mark webber had a frustrating day back in eighth , force india 's vitantonio liuzzi grabbed an impressive ninth , and williams veteran rubens barrichello scored the last available points in tenth .
disappointing day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pole-sitter vettel was n't the only unlucky german driver vettel 's mechanical issues and mercedes ' missing pace was but the tip of the iceberg , as german drivers struggled lower down the field as well .
adrian sutil , starting a promising 10th for force india , spun on the first lap , and had to fight his way through the field from the back .
he only managed 12th in the end .
debutant nico hulkenberg lost control of his williams at the tricky turns six and seven early in the race ; he was doomed to a similar fate to sutil , finishing 14th .
and virgin racing 's timo glock - one of the drivers brave enough to go to work for one of the three struggling new teams - only made it half way through the race before retiring .
only two of the six new entrants - the two lotus cars - made it to the checkered flag .

just like in 2005 and 2006 , the spaniard spoiled schumacher 's party in bahrain . the spotlight might have been on michael schumacher 's return to formula one and his new mercedes gp team , but it was schumi 's former employer ferrari that took the spoils at the first race in bahrain .
schumacher 's old adversary fernando alonso - making his debut for the scuderia - came in first , with his teammate felipe massa second .
massa was making a comeback of his own , after sustaining serious head and eye injuries in a freak accident midway through last season , which sidelined him for the rest of the year .
2008 world champion lewis hamilton rounded out the podium for mclaren mercedes .
fourth-placed sebastian vettel looked like the winner for most of the race , having led from pole position .
but in the closing stages he radioed in to the pits with the message , " there 's a loss of power , loss of power . " a mechanical problem was to blame , and vettel dropped down the order .
the 22-year-old even got back in touch with the garage later to ask if the mechanics could fix the problem on their computers , but he did n't get the answer he wanted to hear . " for me it was noticeable that there was no juice back there , " vettel told reporters , expalining he did n't yet know what had gone wrong with the car . " fourth place is great damage limitation , until then the race was perfect .
we had managed our tires better than the others , fernando -lsb- alonso , then in second place -rsb- was attacking , but i think we had him under control . "
mercedes off the pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher finished a solid sixth , but win number 92 will have to wait but vettel just managed to keep the rather disappointing " silver arrows " at bay .
the mercedes gp duo nico rosberg and michael schumacher claimed fifth and sixth places , respectively , with rosberg glued to vettel 's gearbox by the end .
as schumacher had predicted in pre-season testing , the mercedes car was close to the top teams ' pace , but could n't keep up over race distance .
both rosberg and schumacher 's best efforts in the race were over a second shy of the fastest lap set by alonso .
" red bull and ferrari definitely have the advantage right now , " schumacher told german television reporters after the race . " but that 's roughly what we expected pre-season , we have a lot of work to do to get to the front .
but it 's not impossible . "
reigning champion jenson button came in seventh for mclaren mercedes , red bull 's mark webber had a frustrating day back in eighth , force india 's vitantonio liuzzi grabbed an impressive ninth , and williams veteran rubens barrichello scored the last available points in tenth .
disappointing day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pole-sitter vettel was n't the only unlucky german driver vettel 's mechanical issues and mercedes ' missing pace was but the tip of the iceberg , as german drivers struggled lower down the field as well .
adrian sutil , starting a promising 10th for force india , spun on the first lap , and had to fight his way through the field from the back .
he only managed 12th in the end .
debutant nico hulkenberg lost control of his williams at the tricky turns six and seven early in the race ; he was doomed to a similar fate to sutil , finishing 14th .
and virgin racing 's timo glock - one of the drivers brave enough to go to work for one of the three struggling new teams - only made it half way through the race before retiring .
only two of the six new entrants - the two lotus cars - made it to the checkered flag .

the former synagogue was destroyed during " kristallnacht " -lrb- " the night of broken glass " -rrb- on november 9 , 1938 , one of the nazis ' most widespread and brutal single purges of jewish society within germany .

the last synagogue in herford closed during adolf hitler 's rule of germany . after over 70 years , the city of herford has an official jewish place of worship once again .
the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , juergen ruettgers , and the president of the germany 's central council of jews , charlotte knobloch , celebrated along with the congregation at the opening ceremony .
" i hope for you - and for us all - that jewish life here in north rhine-westphalia bears fruit - that it is present , changes , initiates change , and invigorates , " ruettgers said .
" we must , and we will , do everything to ensure there is never another auschwitz . "
charlotte knobloch commented on how jewish history in herford stretches back seven centuries , although after the holocaust only a handful of the roughly 200 former inhabitants returned .
the former synagogue was destroyed during " kristallnacht " -lrb- " the night of broken glass " -rrb- on november 9 , 1938 , one of the nazis ' most widespread and brutal single purges of jewish society within germany .
knobloch said the synagogue would act as a memorial for the former jewish community , meaning that worshippers might shed a few tears from time to time .
" but today , together , we can prove that there can also be tears of joy , " she said .
jewish population on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 267 synagogues and thousands of homes and shops were destroyed during " kristallnacht " the neo-gothic building was erected on the site of the former synagogue , which was constructed in 1852 .
it cost roughly two million euros , and the prayer area can accommodate over 90 people .
the prayer room in a nearby jewish school in herford had becaome overcrowded in recent years due to the arrival of many jews from the former soviet union .
herford is in the east of the state , near osnabruck and bielefeld .
roughly 30,000 people of jewish faith live in north rhine-westphalia nowadays , and that population has been steadily growing since the fall of the iron curtain .
ten new synagogues have been built in north rhine-westphalia since the mid-1990s. msh / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

werder bremen beat hoffenheim , and stay close to the european qualification spots . bayer leverkusen kept their championship hopes alive on sunday with a much needed win against fellow top-team hamburg .
on home turf , leverkusen won 4-2 , with a brace of goals fairy early in the second half turning the game decisively in their favor .
german international striker stefan kiessling opened the scoring after 22 minutes for leverkusen , after being set clear by a wonderful pass from tranquilo barnetta .
however , eleven minutes later goalie rene adler came to claim high ball , but only succeeded in colliding with veteran sami hyppia .
adler only parried the ball as far as hamburg 's ze roberto , who gratefully fired into the unprotected goal .
ten minutes after the break swiss striker eren derdiyok put leverkusen back in front , and just after the hour mark , kiessling grabbed his second of the game - and his 16th of the season - heading home from close range .
hamburg did narrow leverkusen 's lead on 83 minutes , but it was too little , too late , and leverkusen 's gonzalo castro added a fourth just moments later , finally putting the match beyond doubt .
that win moves leverkusen up to 53 points , still in third position , but only three points adrift of leaders bayern munich , and one point shy of second-placed side schalke .

the green party and environmental leaders are protesting the decision . environmentalists and member of the green party responded with sharp criticism to reports that the german environment ministry would reopen talks on the future of the gorleben nuclear waste dump .
greenpeace activists projected the phrase " gorleben : unsuitable for nuclear waste , mr. roettgen " onto a tower at the disused salt mine in the early hours of sunday .
green party leaders sharply criticized the decision to resume talks to make the gorleben salt mines a permanent nuclear waste dump .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town of gorleben has about 600 residents a ministry spokeswoman declined to comment on the report and said environment minister norbert roettgen would be holding a press conference on the topic of gorleben on monday .
discussions regarding using the underground salt mines in gorleben in lower saxony have been on hold since 2000 .
according to a report in der spiegel newsmagazine , exploration of the salt dome could take eight to 10 years .
during the exploration , the mining legislation would apply rather than nuclear legislation , which requires broader civic participation in the decision-making process , the magazine wrote .
sharp criticism the green party expressed outrage over the decision and accused the environment minister of having the interests of the nuclear industry closer to his heart than people 's health and safety .
" he 's following in the tradition of the previous administration , attempting to fool the people of gorleben with tricks and targeted manipulation , " said green party parliamentary leader renate kuenast .
" we will use all our powers to block this cowardly decision , " said european parliament green leader rebecca harms , a native of the gorleben region .
hot topic storage of nuclear waste is a controversial topic in germany , where there is no definitive agreement on what constitutes a suitable disposal site .
convoys transporting waste to interim storage sites are regularly the targets of protesters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have protested against the nuclear waste dump for years gorleben has been used as temporary repository for nuclear waste since 1983 .
the site became even more controversial after it was revealed that the german government under chancellor helmut kohl had suppressed scientific evidence against using the underground salt cavern for permanent nuclear waste storage .
nuclear plant closure germany covers about a quarter of its energy consumption with nuclear power .
a phase-out of nuclear power has been planned for 2021 , and eight of the country 's 17 reactors are currently due to cease output in 2018 .
chancellor angela merkel 's center-right government has said it wants to extend the lives of national nuclear plants , but rifts inside her cabinet over the merit of rival renewable energies have delayed steps to prevent the closure. smh / afp / ap / dpa editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 14.03.2010 afghanistan 's new great game : the undeclared wars within the war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflict in afghanistan has long since taken on a new dimension and spilled over into pakistan conventional western public opinion regards the war in afghanistan as a struggle between nato and extremist islamic militants .
since assuming office barack obama has redefined the conflict by calling it the af-pak war . the us president 's redefinition is recognition that the taliban 's nerve center , as well as al qaeda 's safe haven , are across afghanistan 's border in neighboring pakistan .
in the forbidding tribal territories , waziristan especially , another dimension of the same fierce conflict is underway with more pakistani troops thrown into the fray than the whole of nato deploys on its side of the northwest frontier .
but unlike afghanistan where nato allows journalists free access to combat operations , the pakistani military remains media-averse and highly secretive of its own internal counter-insurgency efforts .
on the surface of things , however pakistan is nato 's and particularly washington 's staunch ally in the regional and global campaign against terror .
it 's a role for which islamabad in dire economic straits is rewarded handsomely with a massive combined us economic and military aid package it could not do without .
but as british author moni mohsin , a lifelong student of pakistan , points out " pakistan is also the only us ally america frequently bombs with drone missile strikes , which sometimes kill terrorists and just as often kill civilians . "
and while islamabad is at pains to denounce the predator missile attacks and adamantly insists it does not authorize them , mohsin told deutsche welle that there is tacit pakistani government approval for the strikes .
yet when the attacks are publicized it only helps to feed the ever present anti-american propaganda in pakistan 's right wing media " which in turn becomes a pro-talibanization as far as the public is concerned . "
anti-us sentiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , and its director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- , have been accused of stoking up tensions in afghanistan the prevalence of anti-us sentiment in popular culture is something the pakistani army and the all powerful military intelligence service , or isi , seems to thrive on and encourage although they are ostensible allies of the west , in presumably the same struggle .
the underpinning complexity of such duality is at the essence of what routine western analysis of south asia often fails to pinpoint .
at the core of this double game , is pakistan 's traditional enmity with india , the dominance of the armed forces and its spymasters in pakistan 's national and political life and a long standing rapport with the taliban and other radical groups which it has not only supported but also created in some cases .
british journalist rishaad salamat , a long time pakistani analyst and a senior economic anchor with bloomberg europe , argues that from a national security perspective " there are elements in the isi who do n't want a democratic and stable afghanistan .
a state that they perceive as being in the pocket of india and one which has irredentist claims on pakistani territory . " mohsin concurs .
" the pakistani army feels threatened by india on its right flank .
and if most countries have armies , pakistan is an army with a country and to remain in this preeminent position , the generals play up the indian threat .
but then india does have a massive presence and influence in afghanistan .
it has 26 consulates , what does afghanistan have as one of the poorest nations on earth that india needs so badly ? "
proxy war means more instability muddling things further in what seems to be an ongoing proxy war between delhi and islamabad , though they are not playing it up , there is widespread suspicion in western intelligence agencies that the isi may well have behind the recent suicide attacks and shootings in kabul aimed at the indian community there .
not surprising when the pakistani jihadist group laskhar e taiba which carried out the bloody raid on mumbai in 2008 is clearly recognized as an offspring of the isi , recruited , armed and trained by the intelligence service .
that thus far islamabad has also refused to extradite or try a single suspect among over 40 militants linked to the slaughter has only exacerbated tensions with its indian rival .
this refusal arguably brought india and pakistan to the brink of what might have become their fourth modern war since achieving independence from the british raj in 1947 .
it is also undeniable that the isi has a clear hand in supporting separatist militants in indian administered kashmir .
though it is n't all one way mischief , india continues to covertly back baluchi separatists in pakistan deeply alienated from central government , in what endures as another , albeit lower-level rebellion within islamabad 's borders .
it is also now conveniently overlooked that the taliban itself , ironically enough , was the very creation - with a lot of us funding - of both the isi and the cia , designed to act as a tool to confront moscow during the soviet war in afghanistan .
what remains more confusing is that while the pakistani army fights a costly war against the taliban in its own tribal areas , every once in a while taliban casualties in afghanistan are discovered wearing pakistani army dog tags , most of them officers on seconded , special duty .
there have also been repeated instances of taliban prisoners of war admitting that pakistani regular army officers run specialized taliban training camps .
so does it mean civil war has spread to the ranks of the pakistani military itself ?
is it a simple case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing ?
not quite .
mohsin argues that there are elements of the taliban the pakistani army and the isi do not control nor favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the isaf troops are facing an uphill battle on several different fronts " the army and isi say -lrb- to washington -rrb- look we will deal with al qaeda and the jihadists , but you have made it clear that you will withdraw sooner rather than later and we want an afghan government in which we have a say , because we live here and we 'd prefer a taliban type of government we can play ball with , " mohsin told deutsche welle .
it is a stance that angers washington but when " nato is bleeding and pakistani support is critical there is little that they can do and pakistan is going to milk it for all its worth and keep collecting the aid looking to washington to keep defusing tensions with dehli . "
history repeating itself ?
of course there are also other permutations of power geo-politics at play too .
china remains a staunch pakistani ally and military supplier because it suits china to have pakistan as a thorn in india 's side , with whom its also fought a war in the past and seeks to check its power .
israel increasingly has also emerged as key provider of military technology for india which it sees as a natural ally in the fight against islamic radicalism .
but its hard to escape the perception that the pakistani military and the isi are really the key players in the drama of the hindu kush and the larger crisis of south asia .
within pakistan itself the military 's power far exceeds that of a weak civilian government .
a massive portion of the national budget is allocated to the armed forces with no questions asked .
there is no public nor international accountability of the nature of conflict in the territories , where there may well be large scale civilian losses and human rights abuses on both sides .
and among those that dissent in pakistan , but who also oppose radicalization , the military and the isi are challenging democracy itself , pitting the judiciary against the government and using nationalist sentiment in the conservative elements of the media to keep tensions at a fever pitch .
it 's a dangerous game and last year casualties from suicide bombings in pakistan exceeded those in iraq .
bildunterschrift : foreign troops have more often than not failed in afghanistan the great game as it was once called pitted the british and russian empires against one another with afghanistan as the chosen battleground .
during world war ii , nazi germany even sought afghanistan as a potential ally in its struggle against britain , even sending a team of saboteurs to blow up bridges on the afghan-indian borders .
of course the soviets had their failed era and now it is america and its nato european allies who are embroiled in the hindu kush .
but it is much more complex than anyone dare admit and it would seem as ever , if history is anything to go by , it is the locals that will have the final say , not the outsider .

werder bremen beat hoffenheim , and stay close to the european qualification spots . bayer leverkusen kept their championship hopes alive on sunday with a much needed win against fellow top-team hamburg .
on home turf , leverkusen won 4-2 , with a brace of goals fairy early in the second half turning the game decisively in their favor .
german international striker stefan kiessling opened the scoring after 22 minutes for leverkusen , after being set clear by a wonderful pass from tranquilo barnetta .
however , eleven minutes later goalie rene adler came to claim high ball , but only succeeded in colliding with veteran sami hyppia .
adler only parried the ball as far as hamburg 's ze roberto , who gratefully fired into the unprotected goal .
ten minutes after the break swiss striker eren derdiyok put leverkusen back in front , and just after the hour mark , kiessling grabbed his second of the game - and his 16th of the season - heading home from close range .
hamburg did narrow leverkusen 's lead on 83 minutes , but it was too little , too late , and leverkusen 's gonzalo castro added a fourth just moments later , finally putting the match beyond doubt .
that win moves leverkusen up to 53 points , still in third position , but only three points adrift of leaders bayern munich , and one point shy of second-placed side schalke .
hamburg remain fifth in the table , but might be looking over their shoulders , given the result in sunday 's other fixture .
bremen in range bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudio pizarro was the man of the match , scoring the winner for bremen it was n't a similar feast of goals but werder bremen sealed a valuable 1-0 win in hoffenheim during the earlier match of the day .
peruvian striker claudio pizarro - playing his 100th game for bremen - scored a late winner , bagging three key points for a side still hoping to qualify for european competition .
pizarro latched on to a nice through pass from daniel jensen , and looped the ball over hoffenheim keeper timo hildebrand .
bremen now are within one point of fifth-placed hamburg , and only three away from borussia dortmund in fourth .
and with bremen 's attacking and open style , the team already has a superior goal difference than both the sides it 's chasing .
finishing in the top five in the bundesliga would earn bremen the reward of a spot in european competition next season. msh / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since assuming office barack obama has redefined the conflict by calling it the af-pak war . the us president 's redefinition is recognition that the taliban 's nerve center , as well as al qaeda 's safe haven , are across afghanistan 's border in neighboring pakistan .
in the forbidding tribal territories , waziristan especially , another dimension of the same fierce conflict is underway with more pakistani troops thrown into the fray than the whole of nato deploys on its side of the northwest frontier .
but unlike afghanistan where nato allows journalists free access to combat operations , the pakistani military remains media-averse and highly secretive of its own internal counter-insurgency efforts .
on the surface of things , however pakistan is nato 's and particularly washington 's staunch ally in the regional and global campaign against terror .
it 's a role for which islamabad in dire economic straits is rewarded handsomely with a massive combined us economic and military aid package it could not do without .
but as british author moni mohsin , a lifelong student of pakistan , points out " pakistan is also the only us ally america frequently bombs with drone missile strikes , which sometimes kill terrorists and just as often kill civilians . "
and while islamabad is at pains to denounce the predator missile attacks and adamantly insists it does not authorize them , mohsin told deutsche welle that there is tacit pakistani government approval for the strikes .
yet when the attacks are publicized it only helps to feed the ever present anti-american propaganda in pakistan 's right wing media " which in turn becomes a pro-talibanization as far as the public is concerned . "
anti-us sentiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , and its director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- , have been accused of stoking up tensions in afghanistan the prevalence of anti-us sentiment in popular culture is something the pakistani army and the all powerful military intelligence service , or isi , seems to thrive on and encourage although they are ostensible allies of the west , in presumably the same struggle .
the underpinning complexity of such duality is at the essence of what routine western analysis of south asia often fails to pinpoint .
at the core of this double game , is pakistan 's traditional enmity with india , the dominance of the armed forces and its spymasters in pakistan 's national and political life and a long standing rapport with the taliban and other radical groups which it has not only supported but also created in some cases .
british journalist rishaad salamat , a long time pakistani analyst and a senior economic anchor with bloomberg europe , argues that from a national security perspective " there are elements in the isi who do n't want a democratic and stable afghanistan .
a state that they perceive as being in the pocket of india and one which has irredentist claims on pakistani territory . " mohsin concurs .
" the pakistani army feels threatened by india on its right flank .
and if most countries have armies , pakistan is an army with a country and to remain in this preeminent position , the generals play up the indian threat .
but then india does have a massive presence and influence in afghanistan .
it has 26 consulates , what does afghanistan have as one of the poorest nations on earth that india needs so badly ? "
proxy war means more instability muddling things further in what seems to be an ongoing proxy war between delhi and islamabad , though they are not playing it up , there is widespread suspicion in western intelligence agencies that the isi may well have behind the recent suicide attacks and shootings in kabul aimed at the indian community there .
not surprising when the pakistani jihadist group laskhar e taiba which carried out the bloody raid on mumbai in 2008 is clearly recognized as an offspring of the isi , recruited , armed and trained by the intelligence service .
that thus far islamabad has also refused to extradite or try a single suspect among over 40 militants linked to the slaughter has only exacerbated tensions with its indian rival .
this refusal arguably brought india and pakistan to the brink of what might have become their fourth modern war since achieving independence from the british raj in 1947 .
it is also undeniable that the isi has a clear hand in supporting separatist militants in indian administered kashmir .
though it is n't all one way mischief , india continues to covertly back baluchi separatists in pakistan deeply alienated from central government , in what endures as another , albeit lower-level rebellion within islamabad 's borders .
it is also now conveniently overlooked that the taliban itself , ironically enough , was the very creation - with a lot of us funding - of both the isi and the cia , designed to act as a tool to confront moscow during the soviet war in afghanistan .
what remains more confusing is that while the pakistani army fights a costly war against the taliban in its own tribal areas , every once in a while taliban casualties in afghanistan are discovered wearing pakistani army dog tags , most of them officers on seconded , special duty .
there have also been repeated instances of taliban prisoners of war admitting that pakistani regular army officers run specialized taliban training camps .
so does it mean civil war has spread to the ranks of the pakistani military itself ?
is it a simple case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing ?
not quite .
mohsin argues that there are elements of the taliban the pakistani army and the isi do not control nor favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the isaf troops are facing an uphill battle on several different fronts " the army and isi say -lrb- to washington -rrb- look we will deal with al qaeda and the jihadists , but you have made it clear that you will withdraw sooner rather than later and we want an afghan government in which we have a say , because we live here and we 'd prefer a taliban type of government we can play ball with , " mohsin told deutsche welle .
it is a stance that angers washington but when " nato is bleeding and pakistani support is critical there is little that they can do and pakistan is going to milk it for all its worth and keep collecting the aid looking to washington to keep defusing tensions with dehli . "
history repeating itself ?
of course there are also other permutations of power geo-politics at play too .
china remains a staunch pakistani ally and military supplier because it suits china to have pakistan as a thorn in india 's side , with whom its also fought a war in the past and seeks to check its power .
israel increasingly has also emerged as key provider of military technology for india which it sees as a natural ally in the fight against islamic radicalism .
but its hard to escape the perception that the pakistani military and the isi are really the key players in the drama of the hindu kush and the larger crisis of south asia .
within pakistan itself the military 's power far exceeds that of a weak civilian government .
a massive portion of the national budget is allocated to the armed forces with no questions asked .
there is no public nor international accountability of the nature of conflict in the territories , where there may well be large scale civilian losses and human rights abuses on both sides .
and among those that dissent in pakistan , but who also oppose radicalization , the military and the isi are challenging democracy itself , pitting the judiciary against the government and using nationalist sentiment in the conservative elements of the media to keep tensions at a fever pitch .
it 's a dangerous game and last year casualties from suicide bombings in pakistan exceeded those in iraq .
bildunterschrift : foreign troops have more often than not failed in afghanistan the great game as it was once called pitted the british and russian empires against one another with afghanistan as the chosen battleground .
during world war ii , nazi germany even sought afghanistan as a potential ally in its struggle against britain , even sending a team of saboteurs to blow up bridges on the afghan-indian borders .

just like in 2005 and 2006 , the spaniard spoiled schumacher 's party in bahrain . the spotlight might have been on michael schumacher 's return to formula one and his new mercedes gp team , but it was schumi 's former employer ferrari that took the spoils at the first race in bahrain .
schumacher 's old adversary fernando alonso - making his debut for the scuderia - came in first , with his teammate felipe massa second .
massa was making a comeback of his own , after sustaining serious head and eye injuries in a freak accident midway through last season , which sidelined him for the rest of the year .
2008 world champion lewis hamilton rounded out the podium for mclaren mercedes .
fourth-placed sebastian vettel looked like the winner for most of the race , having led from pole position .
but in the closing stages he radioed in to the pits with the message , " there 's a loss of power , loss of power . " a mechanical problem was to blame , and vettel dropped down the order .
the 22-year-old even got back in touch with the garage later to ask if the mechanics could fix the problem on their computers , but he did n't get the answer he wanted to hear . " for me it was noticeable that there was no juice back there , " vettel told reporters , expalining he did n't yet know what had gone wrong with the car . " fourth place is great damage limitation , until then the race was perfect .
we had managed our tires better than the others , fernando -lsb- alonso , then in second place -rsb- was attacking , but i think we had him under control . "
mercedes off the pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher finished a solid sixth , but win number 92 will have to wait but vettel just managed to keep the rather disappointing " silver arrows " at bay .
the mercedes gp duo nico rosberg and michael schumacher claimed fifth and sixth places , respectively , with rosberg glued to vettel 's gearbox by the end .
as schumacher had predicted in pre-season testing , the mercedes car was close to the top teams ' pace , but could n't keep up over race distance .
both rosberg and schumacher 's best efforts in the race were over a second shy of the fastest lap set by alonso .
" red bull and ferrari definitely have the advantage right now , " schumacher told german television reporters after the race . " but that 's roughly what we expected pre-season , we have a lot of work to do to get to the front .
but it 's not impossible . "
reigning champion jenson button came in seventh for mclaren mercedes , red bull 's mark webber had a frustrating day back in eighth , force india 's vitantonio liuzzi grabbed an impressive ninth , and williams veteran rubens barrichello scored the last available points in tenth .
disappointing day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pole-sitter vettel was n't the only unlucky german driver vettel 's mechanical issues and mercedes ' missing pace was but the tip of the iceberg , as german drivers struggled lower down the field as well .
adrian sutil , starting a promising 10th for force india , spun on the first lap , and had to fight his way through the field from the back .
he only managed 12th in the end .
debutant nico hulkenberg lost control of his williams at the tricky turns six and seven early in the race ; he was doomed to a similar fate to sutil , finishing 14th .
and virgin racing 's timo glock - one of the drivers brave enough to go to work for one of the three struggling new teams - only made it half way through the race before retiring .
only two of the six new entrants - the two lotus cars - made it to the checkered flag .

since assuming office barack obama has redefined the conflict by calling it the af-pak war . the us president 's redefinition is recognition that the taliban 's nerve center , as well as al qaeda 's safe haven , are across afghanistan 's border in neighboring pakistan .
in the forbidding tribal territories , waziristan especially , another dimension of the same fierce conflict is underway with more pakistani troops thrown into the fray than the whole of nato deploys on its side of the northwest frontier .
but unlike afghanistan where nato allows journalists free access to combat operations , the pakistani military remains media-averse and highly secretive of its own internal counter-insurgency efforts .
on the surface of things , however pakistan is nato 's and particularly washington 's staunch ally in the regional and global campaign against terror .
it 's a role for which islamabad in dire economic straits is rewarded handsomely with a massive combined us economic and military aid package it could not do without .
but as british author moni mohsin , a lifelong student of pakistan , points out " pakistan is also the only us ally america frequently bombs with drone missile strikes , which sometimes kill terrorists and just as often kill civilians . "
and while islamabad is at pains to denounce the predator missile attacks and adamantly insists it does not authorize them , mohsin told deutsche welle that there is tacit pakistani government approval for the strikes .
yet when the attacks are publicized it only helps to feed the ever present anti-american propaganda in pakistan 's right wing media " which in turn becomes a pro-talibanization as far as the public is concerned . "
anti-us sentiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , and its director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- , have been accused of stoking up tensions in afghanistan the prevalence of anti-us sentiment in popular culture is something the pakistani army and the all powerful military intelligence service , or isi , seems to thrive on and encourage although they are ostensible allies of the west , in presumably the same struggle .
the underpinning complexity of such duality is at the essence of what routine western analysis of south asia often fails to pinpoint .
at the core of this double game , is pakistan 's traditional enmity with india , the dominance of the armed forces and its spymasters in pakistan 's national and political life and a long standing rapport with the taliban and other radical groups which it has not only supported but also created in some cases .
british journalist rishaad salamat , a long time pakistani analyst and a senior economic anchor with bloomberg europe , argues that from a national security perspective " there are elements in the isi who do n't want a democratic and stable afghanistan .
a state that they perceive as being in the pocket of india and one which has irredentist claims on pakistani territory . " mohsin concurs .
" the pakistani army feels threatened by india on its right flank .
and if most countries have armies , pakistan is an army with a country and to remain in this preeminent position , the generals play up the indian threat .
but then india does have a massive presence and influence in afghanistan .
it has 26 consulates , what does afghanistan have as one of the poorest nations on earth that india needs so badly ? "
proxy war means more instability muddling things further in what seems to be an ongoing proxy war between delhi and islamabad , though they are not playing it up , there is widespread suspicion in western intelligence agencies that the isi may well have behind the recent suicide attacks and shootings in kabul aimed at the indian community there .
not surprising when the pakistani jihadist group laskhar e taiba which carried out the bloody raid on mumbai in 2008 is clearly recognized as an offspring of the isi , recruited , armed and trained by the intelligence service .
that thus far islamabad has also refused to extradite or try a single suspect among over 40 militants linked to the slaughter has only exacerbated tensions with its indian rival .
this refusal arguably brought india and pakistan to the brink of what might have become their fourth modern war since achieving independence from the british raj in 1947 .
it is also undeniable that the isi has a clear hand in supporting separatist militants in indian administered kashmir .
though it is n't all one way mischief , india continues to covertly back baluchi separatists in pakistan deeply alienated from central government , in what endures as another , albeit lower-level rebellion within islamabad 's borders .
it is also now conveniently overlooked that the taliban itself , ironically enough , was the very creation - with a lot of us funding - of both the isi and the cia , designed to act as a tool to confront moscow during the soviet war in afghanistan .
what remains more confusing is that while the pakistani army fights a costly war against the taliban in its own tribal areas , every once in a while taliban casualties in afghanistan are discovered wearing pakistani army dog tags , most of them officers on seconded , special duty .
there have also been repeated instances of taliban prisoners of war admitting that pakistani regular army officers run specialized taliban training camps .
so does it mean civil war has spread to the ranks of the pakistani military itself ?
is it a simple case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing ?
not quite .
mohsin argues that there are elements of the taliban the pakistani army and the isi do not control nor favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the isaf troops are facing an uphill battle on several different fronts " the army and isi say -lrb- to washington -rrb- look we will deal with al qaeda and the jihadists , but you have made it clear that you will withdraw sooner rather than later and we want an afghan government in which we have a say , because we live here and we 'd prefer a taliban type of government we can play ball with , " mohsin told deutsche welle .
it is a stance that angers washington but when " nato is bleeding and pakistani support is critical there is little that they can do and pakistan is going to milk it for all its worth and keep collecting the aid looking to washington to keep defusing tensions with dehli . "
history repeating itself ?
of course there are also other permutations of power geo-politics at play too .
china remains a staunch pakistani ally and military supplier because it suits china to have pakistan as a thorn in india 's side , with whom its also fought a war in the past and seeks to check its power .
israel increasingly has also emerged as key provider of military technology for india which it sees as a natural ally in the fight against islamic radicalism .
but its hard to escape the perception that the pakistani military and the isi are really the key players in the drama of the hindu kush and the larger crisis of south asia .
within pakistan itself the military 's power far exceeds that of a weak civilian government .
a massive portion of the national budget is allocated to the armed forces with no questions asked .
there is no public nor international accountability of the nature of conflict in the territories , where there may well be large scale civilian losses and human rights abuses on both sides .
and among those that dissent in pakistan , but who also oppose radicalization , the military and the isi are challenging democracy itself , pitting the judiciary against the government and using nationalist sentiment in the conservative elements of the media to keep tensions at a fever pitch .
it 's a dangerous game and last year casualties from suicide bombings in pakistan exceeded those in iraq .
bildunterschrift : foreign troops have more often than not failed in afghanistan the great game as it was once called pitted the british and russian empires against one another with afghanistan as the chosen battleground .
during world war ii , nazi germany even sought afghanistan as a potential ally in its struggle against britain , even sending a team of saboteurs to blow up bridges on the afghan-indian borders .
of course the soviets had their failed era and now it is america and its nato european allies who are embroiled in the hindu kush .
but it is much more complex than anyone dare admit and it would seem as ever , if history is anything to go by , it is the locals that will have the final say , not the outsider .

in the forbidding tribal territories , waziristan especially , another dimension of the same fierce conflict is underway with more pakistani troops thrown into the fray than the whole of nato deploys on its side of the northwest frontier .
but unlike afghanistan where nato allows journalists free access to combat operations , the pakistani military remains media-averse and highly secretive of its own internal counter-insurgency efforts .
on the surface of things , however pakistan is nato 's and particularly washington 's staunch ally in the regional and global campaign against terror .
it 's a role for which islamabad in dire economic straits is rewarded handsomely with a massive combined us economic and military aid package it could not do without .
but as british author moni mohsin , a lifelong student of pakistan , points out " pakistan is also the only us ally america frequently bombs with drone missile strikes , which sometimes kill terrorists and just as often kill civilians . "
and while islamabad is at pains to denounce the predator missile attacks and adamantly insists it does not authorize them , mohsin told deutsche welle that there is tacit pakistani government approval for the strikes .
yet when the attacks are publicized it only helps to feed the ever present anti-american propaganda in pakistan 's right wing media " which in turn becomes a pro-talibanization as far as the public is concerned . "
anti-us sentiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , and its director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- , have been accused of stoking up tensions in afghanistan the prevalence of anti-us sentiment in popular culture is something the pakistani army and the all powerful military intelligence service , or isi , seems to thrive on and encourage although they are ostensible allies of the west , in presumably the same struggle .
the underpinning complexity of such duality is at the essence of what routine western analysis of south asia often fails to pinpoint .
at the core of this double game , is pakistan 's traditional enmity with india , the dominance of the armed forces and its spymasters in pakistan 's national and political life and a long standing rapport with the taliban and other radical groups which it has not only supported but also created in some cases .
british journalist rishaad salamat , a long time pakistani analyst and a senior economic anchor with bloomberg europe , argues that from a national security perspective " there are elements in the isi who do n't want a democratic and stable afghanistan .
a state that they perceive as being in the pocket of india and one which has irredentist claims on pakistani territory . " mohsin concurs .
" the pakistani army feels threatened by india on its right flank .
and if most countries have armies , pakistan is an army with a country and to remain in this preeminent position , the generals play up the indian threat .
but then india does have a massive presence and influence in afghanistan .
it has 26 consulates , what does afghanistan have as one of the poorest nations on earth that india needs so badly ? "
proxy war means more instability muddling things further in what seems to be an ongoing proxy war between delhi and islamabad , though they are not playing it up , there is widespread suspicion in western intelligence agencies that the isi may well have behind the recent suicide attacks and shootings in kabul aimed at the indian community there .
not surprising when the pakistani jihadist group laskhar e taiba which carried out the bloody raid on mumbai in 2008 is clearly recognized as an offspring of the isi , recruited , armed and trained by the intelligence service .
that thus far islamabad has also refused to extradite or try a single suspect among over 40 militants linked to the slaughter has only exacerbated tensions with its indian rival .
this refusal arguably brought india and pakistan to the brink of what might have become their fourth modern war since achieving independence from the british raj in 1947 .
it is also undeniable that the isi has a clear hand in supporting separatist militants in indian administered kashmir .
though it is n't all one way mischief , india continues to covertly back baluchi separatists in pakistan deeply alienated from central government , in what endures as another , albeit lower-level rebellion within islamabad 's borders .
it is also now conveniently overlooked that the taliban itself , ironically enough , was the very creation - with a lot of us funding - of both the isi and the cia , designed to act as a tool to confront moscow during the soviet war in afghanistan .
what remains more confusing is that while the pakistani army fights a costly war against the taliban in its own tribal areas , every once in a while taliban casualties in afghanistan are discovered wearing pakistani army dog tags , most of them officers on seconded , special duty .
there have also been repeated instances of taliban prisoners of war admitting that pakistani regular army officers run specialized taliban training camps .
so does it mean civil war has spread to the ranks of the pakistani military itself ?
is it a simple case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing ?
not quite .
mohsin argues that there are elements of the taliban the pakistani army and the isi do not control nor favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the isaf troops are facing an uphill battle on several different fronts " the army and isi say -lrb- to washington -rrb- look we will deal with al qaeda and the jihadists , but you have made it clear that you will withdraw sooner rather than later and we want an afghan government in which we have a say , because we live here and we 'd prefer a taliban type of government we can play ball with , " mohsin told deutsche welle .
it is a stance that angers washington but when " nato is bleeding and pakistani support is critical there is little that they can do and pakistan is going to milk it for all its worth and keep collecting the aid looking to washington to keep defusing tensions with dehli . "
history repeating itself ?
of course there are also other permutations of power geo-politics at play too .
china remains a staunch pakistani ally and military supplier because it suits china to have pakistan as a thorn in india 's side , with whom its also fought a war in the past and seeks to check its power .
israel increasingly has also emerged as key provider of military technology for india which it sees as a natural ally in the fight against islamic radicalism .
but its hard to escape the perception that the pakistani military and the isi are really the key players in the drama of the hindu kush and the larger crisis of south asia .
within pakistan itself the military 's power far exceeds that of a weak civilian government .
a massive portion of the national budget is allocated to the armed forces with no questions asked .
there is no public nor international accountability of the nature of conflict in the territories , where there may well be large scale civilian losses and human rights abuses on both sides .
and among those that dissent in pakistan , but who also oppose radicalization , the military and the isi are challenging democracy itself , pitting the judiciary against the government and using nationalist sentiment in the conservative elements of the media to keep tensions at a fever pitch .
it 's a dangerous game and last year casualties from suicide bombings in pakistan exceeded those in iraq .
bildunterschrift : foreign troops have more often than not failed in afghanistan the great game as it was once called pitted the british and russian empires against one another with afghanistan as the chosen battleground .
during world war ii , nazi germany even sought afghanistan as a potential ally in its struggle against britain , even sending a team of saboteurs to blow up bridges on the afghan-indian borders .
of course the soviets had their failed era and now it is america and its nato european allies who are embroiled in the hindu kush .
but it is much more complex than anyone dare admit and it would seem as ever , if history is anything to go by , it is the locals that will have the final say , not the outsider .

since assuming office barack obama has redefined the conflict by calling it the af-pak war . the us president 's redefinition is recognition that the taliban 's nerve center , as well as al qaeda 's safe haven , are across afghanistan 's border in neighboring pakistan .
in the forbidding tribal territories , waziristan especially , another dimension of the same fierce conflict is underway with more pakistani troops thrown into the fray than the whole of nato deploys on its side of the northwest frontier .
but unlike afghanistan where nato allows journalists free access to combat operations , the pakistani military remains media-averse and highly secretive of its own internal counter-insurgency efforts .
on the surface of things , however pakistan is nato 's and particularly washington 's staunch ally in the regional and global campaign against terror .
it 's a role for which islamabad in dire economic straits is rewarded handsomely with a massive combined us economic and military aid package it could not do without .
but as british author moni mohsin , a lifelong student of pakistan , points out " pakistan is also the only us ally america frequently bombs with drone missile strikes , which sometimes kill terrorists and just as often kill civilians . "
and while islamabad is at pains to denounce the predator missile attacks and adamantly insists it does not authorize them , mohsin told deutsche welle that there is tacit pakistani government approval for the strikes .
yet when the attacks are publicized it only helps to feed the ever present anti-american propaganda in pakistan 's right wing media " which in turn becomes a pro-talibanization as far as the public is concerned . "
anti-us sentiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , and its director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- , have been accused of stoking up tensions in afghanistan the prevalence of anti-us sentiment in popular culture is something the pakistani army and the all powerful military intelligence service , or isi , seems to thrive on and encourage although they are ostensible allies of the west , in presumably the same struggle .
the underpinning complexity of such duality is at the essence of what routine western analysis of south asia often fails to pinpoint .
at the core of this double game , is pakistan 's traditional enmity with india , the dominance of the armed forces and its spymasters in pakistan 's national and political life and a long standing rapport with the taliban and other radical groups which it has not only supported but also created in some cases .
british journalist rishaad salamat , a long time pakistani analyst and a senior economic anchor with bloomberg europe , argues that from a national security perspective " there are elements in the isi who do n't want a democratic and stable afghanistan .
a state that they perceive as being in the pocket of india and one which has irredentist claims on pakistani territory . " mohsin concurs .
" the pakistani army feels threatened by india on its right flank .
and if most countries have armies , pakistan is an army with a country and to remain in this preeminent position , the generals play up the indian threat .
but then india does have a massive presence and influence in afghanistan .
it has 26 consulates , what does afghanistan have as one of the poorest nations on earth that india needs so badly ? "
proxy war means more instability muddling things further in what seems to be an ongoing proxy war between delhi and islamabad , though they are not playing it up , there is widespread suspicion in western intelligence agencies that the isi may well have behind the recent suicide attacks and shootings in kabul aimed at the indian community there .
not surprising when the pakistani jihadist group laskhar e taiba which carried out the bloody raid on mumbai in 2008 is clearly recognized as an offspring of the isi , recruited , armed and trained by the intelligence service .
that thus far islamabad has also refused to extradite or try a single suspect among over 40 militants linked to the slaughter has only exacerbated tensions with its indian rival .
this refusal arguably brought india and pakistan to the brink of what might have become their fourth modern war since achieving independence from the british raj in 1947 .
it is also undeniable that the isi has a clear hand in supporting separatist militants in indian administered kashmir .
though it is n't all one way mischief , india continues to covertly back baluchi separatists in pakistan deeply alienated from central government , in what endures as another , albeit lower-level rebellion within islamabad 's borders .
it is also now conveniently overlooked that the taliban itself , ironically enough , was the very creation - with a lot of us funding - of both the isi and the cia , designed to act as a tool to confront moscow during the soviet war in afghanistan .
what remains more confusing is that while the pakistani army fights a costly war against the taliban in its own tribal areas , every once in a while taliban casualties in afghanistan are discovered wearing pakistani army dog tags , most of them officers on seconded , special duty .
there have also been repeated instances of taliban prisoners of war admitting that pakistani regular army officers run specialized taliban training camps .
so does it mean civil war has spread to the ranks of the pakistani military itself ?
is it a simple case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing ?
not quite .
mohsin argues that there are elements of the taliban the pakistani army and the isi do not control nor favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the isaf troops are facing an uphill battle on several different fronts " the army and isi say -lrb- to washington -rrb- look we will deal with al qaeda and the jihadists , but you have made it clear that you will withdraw sooner rather than later and we want an afghan government in which we have a say , because we live here and we 'd prefer a taliban type of government we can play ball with , " mohsin told deutsche welle .
it is a stance that angers washington but when " nato is bleeding and pakistani support is critical there is little that they can do and pakistan is going to milk it for all its worth and keep collecting the aid looking to washington to keep defusing tensions with dehli . "
history repeating itself ?
of course there are also other permutations of power geo-politics at play too .
china remains a staunch pakistani ally and military supplier because it suits china to have pakistan as a thorn in india 's side , with whom its also fought a war in the past and seeks to check its power .
israel increasingly has also emerged as key provider of military technology for india which it sees as a natural ally in the fight against islamic radicalism .
but its hard to escape the perception that the pakistani military and the isi are really the key players in the drama of the hindu kush and the larger crisis of south asia .
within pakistan itself the military 's power far exceeds that of a weak civilian government .
a massive portion of the national budget is allocated to the armed forces with no questions asked .
there is no public nor international accountability of the nature of conflict in the territories , where there may well be large scale civilian losses and human rights abuses on both sides .
and among those that dissent in pakistan , but who also oppose radicalization , the military and the isi are challenging democracy itself , pitting the judiciary against the government and using nationalist sentiment in the conservative elements of the media to keep tensions at a fever pitch .
it 's a dangerous game and last year casualties from suicide bombings in pakistan exceeded those in iraq .
bildunterschrift : foreign troops have more often than not failed in afghanistan the great game as it was once called pitted the british and russian empires against one another with afghanistan as the chosen battleground .
during world war ii , nazi germany even sought afghanistan as a potential ally in its struggle against britain , even sending a team of saboteurs to blow up bridges on the afghan-indian borders .
of course the soviets had their failed era and now it is america and its nato european allies who are embroiled in the hindu kush .
but it is much more complex than anyone dare admit and it would seem as ever , if history is anything to go by , it is the locals that will have the final say , not the outsider .

bundestag vice president wolfgang thierse warned that the foundation was in danger after a czech and polish historian resigned from its academic committee .

significant concession won the deal meant that steinbach won the significant concession of being able to nominate six members to the board instead of just three .
federal government culture representative bernd neumann admitted the museum had been at the center of " substantial controversy " but said that he hoped real progress would be made on the museum soon .
neumann added that the questions about bdv members ' pasts were outside the scope of the foundation 's work. rc / epd / apn / dpa editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

werder bremen beat hoffenheim , and stay close to the european qualification spots . bayer leverkusen kept their championship hopes alive on sunday with a much needed win against fellow top-team hamburg .
on home turf , leverkusen won 4-2 , with a brace of goals fairy early in the second half turning the game decisively in their favor .
german international striker stefan kiessling opened the scoring after 22 minutes for leverkusen , after being set clear by a wonderful pass from tranquilo barnetta .
however , eleven minutes later goalie rene adler came to claim high ball , but only succeeded in colliding with veteran sami hyppia .
adler only parried the ball as far as hamburg 's ze roberto , who gratefully fired into the unprotected goal .
ten minutes after the break swiss striker eren derdiyok put leverkusen back in front , and just after the hour mark , kiessling grabbed his second of the game - and his 16th of the season - heading home from close range .
hamburg did narrow leverkusen 's lead on 83 minutes , but it was too little , too late , and leverkusen 's gonzalo castro added a fourth just moments later , finally putting the match beyond doubt .
that win moves leverkusen up to 53 points , still in third position , but only three points adrift of leaders bayern munich , and one point shy of second-placed side schalke .
hamburg remain fifth in the table , but might be looking over their shoulders , given the result in sunday 's other fixture .
bremen in range bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudio pizarro was the man of the match , scoring the winner for bremen it was n't a similar feast of goals but werder bremen sealed a valuable 1-0 win in hoffenheim during the earlier match of the day .
peruvian striker claudio pizarro - playing his 100th game for bremen - scored a late winner , bagging three key points for a side still hoping to qualify for european competition .
pizarro latched on to a nice through pass from daniel jensen , and looped the ball over hoffenheim keeper timo hildebrand .
bremen now are within one point of fifth-placed hamburg , and only three away from borussia dortmund in fourth .
and with bremen 's attacking and open style , the team already has a superior goal difference than both the sides it 's chasing .
finishing in the top five in the bundesliga would earn bremen the reward of a spot in european competition next season. msh / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the engineer 's posting is funded by cim - germany 's development cooperation recruiting agency . how were you received by your new colleagues in hanoi ?
my first day of work coincided with vov ’ s 64th anniversary , and that special day made things easier .
everyone was very friendly and kind .
in fact , many of my current colleagues had been in my previous dw-akademie workshops , so i wasn ’ t really “ new ’ in that sense .
your task is to finish the project to digitize vov ’ s old audio recordings .
how is the project advancing ?
the digital archive structure itself is there – the goal now is to fill it .
the staff can now analyse the archive contents , digitize the traditional analog storage media , and restore damaged tapes .
some 10,000 audio files have been digitized and 80,000 descriptive files have been logged .
we estimate that it will take another five years to digitize the tape material , and at least two years to restore the badly damaged tapes .
most of the staff working in the archive has not been trained in the various fields of archiving .
this means they will need ongoing training so that in the medium and long-term , they will be able to manage the archive independently .
how will vov benefit from the project ?
the archiving and restoration expertise which we ’ ve established for broadcasting is unique here in vietnam and also in asia .
long-term , the project will improve the broadcaster ’ s quality of programming , increase its topicality and preserve its historical value .
and in the end , it supports the country ’ s exchange with other nations – we ’ ve begun cross-linking asia ’ s archives , which not only strengthens south-south cooperation but also inner-asian dialogue .
you will be in vietnam for a total of two years .
how did the first few months proceed ?
my tasks in 2009 were to establish a dw-akademie regional office , to encourage and support the people at asian broadcasting archives , and to intensify our contacts with our asian partner organizations .
from a german perspective , the lively exchange with other development agencies has also been important .
all in all , this is an exciting project with lasting results .
by investing in the past we ’ re creating benefits for the future .
what are the plans for 2010 ?
this year we ’ ve started concentrating more on the multimedia archive .
vov launched a television channel in september 2008 , and that means there ’ s a lot of audio-visual material which needs to be archived .
there ’ s also an online project , where we need to think about how to store content long-term .
as for audio , we ’ ll be developing a strategy whereby audio archives and audio media from the regional stations can be digitized in accordance with the standards we have set .
in addition to the work in vietnam , we ’ ll also be expanding our regional consulting services .
this includes continuing the archive project with radio nepal in kathmandu .
we ’ ll conduct an archive analysis for sri lanka broadcasting corporation in colombo to see where further consultations are needed .
and we ’ ll also hold a regional archiving workshop in malaysia .
the need for more archiving expertise in asia is enormous . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 german version dw-akademie auf deutsch dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit wirtschaft we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

on home turf , leverkusen won 4-2 , with a brace of goals fairy early in the second half turning the game decisively in their favor .
german international striker stefan kiessling opened the scoring after 22 minutes for leverkusen , after being set clear by a wonderful pass from tranquilo barnetta .
however , eleven minutes later goalie rene adler came to claim high ball , but only succeeded in colliding with veteran sami hyppia .
adler only parried the ball as far as hamburg 's ze roberto , who gratefully fired into the unprotected goal .
ten minutes after the break swiss striker eren derdiyok put leverkusen back in front , and just after the hour mark , kiessling grabbed his second of the game - and his 16th of the season - heading home from close range .
hamburg did narrow leverkusen 's lead on 83 minutes , but it was too little , too late , and leverkusen 's gonzalo castro added a fourth just moments later , finally putting the match beyond doubt .
that win moves leverkusen up to 53 points , still in third position , but only three points adrift of leaders bayern munich , and one point shy of second-placed side schalke .

the last synagogue in herford closed during adolf hitler 's rule of germany . after over 70 years , the city of herford has an official jewish place of worship once again .
the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , juergen ruettgers , and the president of the germany 's central council of jews , charlotte knobloch , celebrated along with the congregation at the opening ceremony .
" i hope for you - and for us all - that jewish life here in north rhine-westphalia bears fruit - that it is present , changes , initiates change , and invigorates , " ruettgers said .
" we must , and we will , do everything to ensure there is never another auschwitz . "
charlotte knobloch commented on how jewish history in herford stretches back seven centuries , although after the holocaust only a handful of the roughly 200 former inhabitants returned .

the last synagogue in herford closed during adolf hitler 's rule of germany . after over 70 years , the city of herford has an official jewish place of worship once again .
the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , juergen ruettgers , and the president of the germany 's central council of jews , charlotte knobloch , celebrated along with the congregation at the opening ceremony .
" i hope for you - and for us all - that jewish life here in north rhine-westphalia bears fruit - that it is present , changes , initiates change , and invigorates , " ruettgers said .
" we must , and we will , do everything to ensure there is never another auschwitz . "
charlotte knobloch commented on how jewish history in herford stretches back seven centuries , although after the holocaust only a handful of the roughly 200 former inhabitants returned .
the former synagogue was destroyed during " kristallnacht " -lrb- " the night of broken glass " -rrb- on november 9 , 1938 , one of the nazis ' most widespread and brutal single purges of jewish society within germany .
knobloch said the synagogue would act as a memorial for the former jewish community , meaning that worshippers might shed a few tears from time to time .
" but today , together , we can prove that there can also be tears of joy , " she said .
jewish population on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 267 synagogues and thousands of homes and shops were destroyed during " kristallnacht " the neo-gothic building was erected on the site of the former synagogue , which was constructed in 1852 .
it cost roughly two million euros , and the prayer area can accommodate over 90 people .
the prayer room in a nearby jewish school in herford had becaome overcrowded in recent years due to the arrival of many jews from the former soviet union .
herford is in the east of the state , near osnabruck and bielefeld .
roughly 30,000 people of jewish faith live in north rhine-westphalia nowadays , and that population has been steadily growing since the fall of the iron curtain .
ten new synagogues have been built in north rhine-westphalia since the mid-1990s. msh / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speakers criticized the emergency election list decree and a series of other legal challenges that have angered berlusconi 's opponents .
previous protests against the prime minister have focused on his efforts to have laws passed that would exempt him from legal proceedings .
pier luigi bersani , head of the largest opposition democratic party , called for unity in the opposition to berlusconi .
" a different italy is possible , " he said .
in a television interview , berlusconi said the protest was " grotesque , " and claimed that the protesters wanted to take away his supporters ' voting rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de motor racing -pipe- 14.03.2010 fernando alonso and ferrari spoil the schumacher party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike schumacher in 1997 , alonso won on his ferrari debut on the day of michael schumacher 's return to formula one , it was his old rival fernando alonso who rolled back the years .
just like in 2005 and 2006 , the spaniard spoiled schumacher 's party in bahrain . the spotlight might have been on michael schumacher 's return to formula one and his new mercedes gp team , but it was schumi 's former employer ferrari that took the spoils at the first race in bahrain .
schumacher 's old adversary fernando alonso - making his debut for the scuderia - came in first , with his teammate felipe massa second .
massa was making a comeback of his own , after sustaining serious head and eye injuries in a freak accident midway through last season , which sidelined him for the rest of the year .
2008 world champion lewis hamilton rounded out the podium for mclaren mercedes .
fourth-placed sebastian vettel looked like the winner for most of the race , having led from pole position .
but in the closing stages he radioed in to the pits with the message , " there 's a loss of power , loss of power . " a mechanical problem was to blame , and vettel dropped down the order .
the 22-year-old even got back in touch with the garage later to ask if the mechanics could fix the problem on their computers , but he did n't get the answer he wanted to hear . " for me it was noticeable that there was no juice back there , " vettel told reporters , expalining he did n't yet know what had gone wrong with the car . " fourth place is great damage limitation , until then the race was perfect .
we had managed our tires better than the others , fernando -lsb- alonso , then in second place -rsb- was attacking , but i think we had him under control . "
mercedes off the pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher finished a solid sixth , but win number 92 will have to wait but vettel just managed to keep the rather disappointing " silver arrows " at bay .
the mercedes gp duo nico rosberg and michael schumacher claimed fifth and sixth places , respectively , with rosberg glued to vettel 's gearbox by the end .
as schumacher had predicted in pre-season testing , the mercedes car was close to the top teams ' pace , but could n't keep up over race distance .
both rosberg and schumacher 's best efforts in the race were over a second shy of the fastest lap set by alonso .
" red bull and ferrari definitely have the advantage right now , " schumacher told german television reporters after the race . " but that 's roughly what we expected pre-season , we have a lot of work to do to get to the front .
but it 's not impossible . "
reigning champion jenson button came in seventh for mclaren mercedes , red bull 's mark webber had a frustrating day back in eighth , force india 's vitantonio liuzzi grabbed an impressive ninth , and williams veteran rubens barrichello scored the last available points in tenth .
disappointing day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pole-sitter vettel was n't the only unlucky german driver vettel 's mechanical issues and mercedes ' missing pace was but the tip of the iceberg , as german drivers struggled lower down the field as well .
adrian sutil , starting a promising 10th for force india , spun on the first lap , and had to fight his way through the field from the back .
he only managed 12th in the end .
debutant nico hulkenberg lost control of his williams at the tricky turns six and seven early in the race ; he was doomed to a similar fate to sutil , finishing 14th .
and virgin racing 's timo glock - one of the drivers brave enough to go to work for one of the three struggling new teams - only made it half way through the race before retiring .
only two of the six new entrants - the two lotus cars - made it to the checkered flag .

werder bremen beat hoffenheim , and stay close to the european qualification spots . bayer leverkusen kept their championship hopes alive on sunday with a much needed win against fellow top-team hamburg .
on home turf , leverkusen won 4-2 , with a brace of goals fairy early in the second half turning the game decisively in their favor .
german international striker stefan kiessling opened the scoring after 22 minutes for leverkusen , after being set clear by a wonderful pass from tranquilo barnetta .
however , eleven minutes later goalie rene adler came to claim high ball , but only succeeded in colliding with veteran sami hyppia .
adler only parried the ball as far as hamburg 's ze roberto , who gratefully fired into the unprotected goal .
ten minutes after the break swiss striker eren derdiyok put leverkusen back in front , and just after the hour mark , kiessling grabbed his second of the game - and his 16th of the season - heading home from close range .
hamburg did narrow leverkusen 's lead on 83 minutes , but it was too little , too late , and leverkusen 's gonzalo castro added a fourth just moments later , finally putting the match beyond doubt .
that win moves leverkusen up to 53 points , still in third position , but only three points adrift of leaders bayern munich , and one point shy of second-placed side schalke .
hamburg remain fifth in the table , but might be looking over their shoulders , given the result in sunday 's other fixture .
bremen in range bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudio pizarro was the man of the match , scoring the winner for bremen it was n't a similar feast of goals but werder bremen sealed a valuable 1-0 win in hoffenheim during the earlier match of the day .
peruvian striker claudio pizarro - playing his 100th game for bremen - scored a late winner , bagging three key points for a side still hoping to qualify for european competition .
pizarro latched on to a nice through pass from daniel jensen , and looped the ball over hoffenheim keeper timo hildebrand .
bremen now are within one point of fifth-placed hamburg , and only three away from borussia dortmund in fourth .
and with bremen 's attacking and open style , the team already has a superior goal difference than both the sides it 's chasing .
finishing in the top five in the bundesliga would earn bremen the reward of a spot in european competition next season. msh / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since assuming office barack obama has redefined the conflict by calling it the af-pak war . the us president 's redefinition is recognition that the taliban 's nerve center , as well as al qaeda 's safe haven , are across afghanistan 's border in neighboring pakistan .
in the forbidding tribal territories , waziristan especially , another dimension of the same fierce conflict is underway with more pakistani troops thrown into the fray than the whole of nato deploys on its side of the northwest frontier .
but unlike afghanistan where nato allows journalists free access to combat operations , the pakistani military remains media-averse and highly secretive of its own internal counter-insurgency efforts .
on the surface of things , however pakistan is nato 's and particularly washington 's staunch ally in the regional and global campaign against terror .
it 's a role for which islamabad in dire economic straits is rewarded handsomely with a massive combined us economic and military aid package it could not do without .
but as british author moni mohsin , a lifelong student of pakistan , points out " pakistan is also the only us ally america frequently bombs with drone missile strikes , which sometimes kill terrorists and just as often kill civilians . "
and while islamabad is at pains to denounce the predator missile attacks and adamantly insists it does not authorize them , mohsin told deutsche welle that there is tacit pakistani government approval for the strikes .
yet when the attacks are publicized it only helps to feed the ever present anti-american propaganda in pakistan 's right wing media " which in turn becomes a pro-talibanization as far as the public is concerned . "
anti-us sentiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , and its director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- , have been accused of stoking up tensions in afghanistan the prevalence of anti-us sentiment in popular culture is something the pakistani army and the all powerful military intelligence service , or isi , seems to thrive on and encourage although they are ostensible allies of the west , in presumably the same struggle .
the underpinning complexity of such duality is at the essence of what routine western analysis of south asia often fails to pinpoint .
at the core of this double game , is pakistan 's traditional enmity with india , the dominance of the armed forces and its spymasters in pakistan 's national and political life and a long standing rapport with the taliban and other radical groups which it has not only supported but also created in some cases .
british journalist rishaad salamat , a long time pakistani analyst and a senior economic anchor with bloomberg europe , argues that from a national security perspective " there are elements in the isi who do n't want a democratic and stable afghanistan .
a state that they perceive as being in the pocket of india and one which has irredentist claims on pakistani territory . " mohsin concurs .
" the pakistani army feels threatened by india on its right flank .
and if most countries have armies , pakistan is an army with a country and to remain in this preeminent position , the generals play up the indian threat .
but then india does have a massive presence and influence in afghanistan .
it has 26 consulates , what does afghanistan have as one of the poorest nations on earth that india needs so badly ? "
proxy war means more instability muddling things further in what seems to be an ongoing proxy war between delhi and islamabad , though they are not playing it up , there is widespread suspicion in western intelligence agencies that the isi may well have behind the recent suicide attacks and shootings in kabul aimed at the indian community there .
not surprising when the pakistani jihadist group laskhar e taiba which carried out the bloody raid on mumbai in 2008 is clearly recognized as an offspring of the isi , recruited , armed and trained by the intelligence service .
that thus far islamabad has also refused to extradite or try a single suspect among over 40 militants linked to the slaughter has only exacerbated tensions with its indian rival .
this refusal arguably brought india and pakistan to the brink of what might have become their fourth modern war since achieving independence from the british raj in 1947 .
it is also undeniable that the isi has a clear hand in supporting separatist militants in indian administered kashmir .
though it is n't all one way mischief , india continues to covertly back baluchi separatists in pakistan deeply alienated from central government , in what endures as another , albeit lower-level rebellion within islamabad 's borders .
it is also now conveniently overlooked that the taliban itself , ironically enough , was the very creation - with a lot of us funding - of both the isi and the cia , designed to act as a tool to confront moscow during the soviet war in afghanistan .
what remains more confusing is that while the pakistani army fights a costly war against the taliban in its own tribal areas , every once in a while taliban casualties in afghanistan are discovered wearing pakistani army dog tags , most of them officers on seconded , special duty .
there have also been repeated instances of taliban prisoners of war admitting that pakistani regular army officers run specialized taliban training camps .
so does it mean civil war has spread to the ranks of the pakistani military itself ?
is it a simple case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing ?
not quite .
mohsin argues that there are elements of the taliban the pakistani army and the isi do not control nor favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the isaf troops are facing an uphill battle on several different fronts " the army and isi say -lrb- to washington -rrb- look we will deal with al qaeda and the jihadists , but you have made it clear that you will withdraw sooner rather than later and we want an afghan government in which we have a say , because we live here and we 'd prefer a taliban type of government we can play ball with , " mohsin told deutsche welle .
it is a stance that angers washington but when " nato is bleeding and pakistani support is critical there is little that they can do and pakistan is going to milk it for all its worth and keep collecting the aid looking to washington to keep defusing tensions with dehli . "
history repeating itself ?
of course there are also other permutations of power geo-politics at play too .
china remains a staunch pakistani ally and military supplier because it suits china to have pakistan as a thorn in india 's side , with whom its also fought a war in the past and seeks to check its power .
israel increasingly has also emerged as key provider of military technology for india which it sees as a natural ally in the fight against islamic radicalism .
but its hard to escape the perception that the pakistani military and the isi are really the key players in the drama of the hindu kush and the larger crisis of south asia .
within pakistan itself the military 's power far exceeds that of a weak civilian government .
a massive portion of the national budget is allocated to the armed forces with no questions asked .
there is no public nor international accountability of the nature of conflict in the territories , where there may well be large scale civilian losses and human rights abuses on both sides .
and among those that dissent in pakistan , but who also oppose radicalization , the military and the isi are challenging democracy itself , pitting the judiciary against the government and using nationalist sentiment in the conservative elements of the media to keep tensions at a fever pitch .
it 's a dangerous game and last year casualties from suicide bombings in pakistan exceeded those in iraq .
bildunterschrift : foreign troops have more often than not failed in afghanistan the great game as it was once called pitted the british and russian empires against one another with afghanistan as the chosen battleground .
during world war ii , nazi germany even sought afghanistan as a potential ally in its struggle against britain , even sending a team of saboteurs to blow up bridges on the afghan-indian borders .
of course the soviets had their failed era and now it is america and its nato european allies who are embroiled in the hindu kush .
but it is much more complex than anyone dare admit and it would seem as ever , if history is anything to go by , it is the locals that will have the final say , not the outsider .

werder bremen beat hoffenheim , and stay close to the european qualification spots . bayer leverkusen kept their championship hopes alive on sunday with a much needed win against fellow top-team hamburg .
on home turf , leverkusen won 4-2 , with a brace of goals fairy early in the second half turning the game decisively in their favor .
german international striker stefan kiessling opened the scoring after 22 minutes for leverkusen , after being set clear by a wonderful pass from tranquilo barnetta .
however , eleven minutes later goalie rene adler came to claim high ball , but only succeeded in colliding with veteran sami hyppia .
adler only parried the ball as far as hamburg 's ze roberto , who gratefully fired into the unprotected goal .
ten minutes after the break swiss striker eren derdiyok put leverkusen back in front , and just after the hour mark , kiessling grabbed his second of the game - and his 16th of the season - heading home from close range .
hamburg did narrow leverkusen 's lead on 83 minutes , but it was too little , too late , and leverkusen 's gonzalo castro added a fourth just moments later , finally putting the match beyond doubt .
that win moves leverkusen up to 53 points , still in third position , but only three points adrift of leaders bayern munich , and one point shy of second-placed side schalke .
hamburg remain fifth in the table , but might be looking over their shoulders , given the result in sunday 's other fixture .

bremen now are within one point of fifth-placed hamburg , and only three away from borussia dortmund in fourth .
and with bremen 's attacking and open style , the team already has a superior goal difference than both the sides it 's chasing .

werder bremen beat hoffenheim , and stay close to the european qualification spots . bayer leverkusen kept their championship hopes alive on sunday with a much needed win against fellow top-team hamburg .
on home turf , leverkusen won 4-2 , with a brace of goals fairy early in the second half turning the game decisively in their favor .
german international striker stefan kiessling opened the scoring after 22 minutes for leverkusen , after being set clear by a wonderful pass from tranquilo barnetta .
however , eleven minutes later goalie rene adler came to claim high ball , but only succeeded in colliding with veteran sami hyppia .
adler only parried the ball as far as hamburg 's ze roberto , who gratefully fired into the unprotected goal .
ten minutes after the break swiss striker eren derdiyok put leverkusen back in front , and just after the hour mark , kiessling grabbed his second of the game - and his 16th of the season - heading home from close range .
hamburg did narrow leverkusen 's lead on 83 minutes , but it was too little , too late , and leverkusen 's gonzalo castro added a fourth just moments later , finally putting the match beyond doubt .
that win moves leverkusen up to 53 points , still in third position , but only three points adrift of leaders bayern munich , and one point shy of second-placed side schalke .
hamburg remain fifth in the table , but might be looking over their shoulders , given the result in sunday 's other fixture .

peruvian striker claudio pizarro - playing his 100th game for bremen - scored a late winner , bagging three key points for a side still hoping to qualify for european competition .
pizarro latched on to a nice through pass from daniel jensen , and looped the ball over hoffenheim keeper timo hildebrand .
bremen now are within one point of fifth-placed hamburg , and only three away from borussia dortmund in fourth .
and with bremen 's attacking and open style , the team already has a superior goal difference than both the sides it 's chasing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 14.03.2010 afghanistan 's new great game : the undeclared wars within the war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflict in afghanistan has long since taken on a new dimension and spilled over into pakistan conventional western public opinion regards the war in afghanistan as a struggle between nato and extremist islamic militants .
since assuming office barack obama has redefined the conflict by calling it the af-pak war . the us president 's redefinition is recognition that the taliban 's nerve center , as well as al qaeda 's safe haven , are across afghanistan 's border in neighboring pakistan .
in the forbidding tribal territories , waziristan especially , another dimension of the same fierce conflict is underway with more pakistani troops thrown into the fray than the whole of nato deploys on its side of the northwest frontier .
but unlike afghanistan where nato allows journalists free access to combat operations , the pakistani military remains media-averse and highly secretive of its own internal counter-insurgency efforts .
on the surface of things , however pakistan is nato 's and particularly washington 's staunch ally in the regional and global campaign against terror .
it 's a role for which islamabad in dire economic straits is rewarded handsomely with a massive combined us economic and military aid package it could not do without .
but as british author moni mohsin , a lifelong student of pakistan , points out " pakistan is also the only us ally america frequently bombs with drone missile strikes , which sometimes kill terrorists and just as often kill civilians . "
and while islamabad is at pains to denounce the predator missile attacks and adamantly insists it does not authorize them , mohsin told deutsche welle that there is tacit pakistani government approval for the strikes .
yet when the attacks are publicized it only helps to feed the ever present anti-american propaganda in pakistan 's right wing media " which in turn becomes a pro-talibanization as far as the public is concerned . "
anti-us sentiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , and its director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- , have been accused of stoking up tensions in afghanistan the prevalence of anti-us sentiment in popular culture is something the pakistani army and the all powerful military intelligence service , or isi , seems to thrive on and encourage although they are ostensible allies of the west , in presumably the same struggle .
the underpinning complexity of such duality is at the essence of what routine western analysis of south asia often fails to pinpoint .
at the core of this double game , is pakistan 's traditional enmity with india , the dominance of the armed forces and its spymasters in pakistan 's national and political life and a long standing rapport with the taliban and other radical groups which it has not only supported but also created in some cases .
british journalist rishaad salamat , a long time pakistani analyst and a senior economic anchor with bloomberg europe , argues that from a national security perspective " there are elements in the isi who do n't want a democratic and stable afghanistan .
a state that they perceive as being in the pocket of india and one which has irredentist claims on pakistani territory . " mohsin concurs .
" the pakistani army feels threatened by india on its right flank .
and if most countries have armies , pakistan is an army with a country and to remain in this preeminent position , the generals play up the indian threat .
but then india does have a massive presence and influence in afghanistan .
it has 26 consulates , what does afghanistan have as one of the poorest nations on earth that india needs so badly ? "
proxy war means more instability muddling things further in what seems to be an ongoing proxy war between delhi and islamabad , though they are not playing it up , there is widespread suspicion in western intelligence agencies that the isi may well have behind the recent suicide attacks and shootings in kabul aimed at the indian community there .
not surprising when the pakistani jihadist group laskhar e taiba which carried out the bloody raid on mumbai in 2008 is clearly recognized as an offspring of the isi , recruited , armed and trained by the intelligence service .
that thus far islamabad has also refused to extradite or try a single suspect among over 40 militants linked to the slaughter has only exacerbated tensions with its indian rival .
this refusal arguably brought india and pakistan to the brink of what might have become their fourth modern war since achieving independence from the british raj in 1947 .
it is also undeniable that the isi has a clear hand in supporting separatist militants in indian administered kashmir .
though it is n't all one way mischief , india continues to covertly back baluchi separatists in pakistan deeply alienated from central government , in what endures as another , albeit lower-level rebellion within islamabad 's borders .
it is also now conveniently overlooked that the taliban itself , ironically enough , was the very creation - with a lot of us funding - of both the isi and the cia , designed to act as a tool to confront moscow during the soviet war in afghanistan .
what remains more confusing is that while the pakistani army fights a costly war against the taliban in its own tribal areas , every once in a while taliban casualties in afghanistan are discovered wearing pakistani army dog tags , most of them officers on seconded , special duty .
there have also been repeated instances of taliban prisoners of war admitting that pakistani regular army officers run specialized taliban training camps .
so does it mean civil war has spread to the ranks of the pakistani military itself ?
is it a simple case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing ?
not quite .
mohsin argues that there are elements of the taliban the pakistani army and the isi do not control nor favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the isaf troops are facing an uphill battle on several different fronts " the army and isi say -lrb- to washington -rrb- look we will deal with al qaeda and the jihadists , but you have made it clear that you will withdraw sooner rather than later and we want an afghan government in which we have a say , because we live here and we 'd prefer a taliban type of government we can play ball with , " mohsin told deutsche welle .
it is a stance that angers washington but when " nato is bleeding and pakistani support is critical there is little that they can do and pakistan is going to milk it for all its worth and keep collecting the aid looking to washington to keep defusing tensions with dehli . "
history repeating itself ?
of course there are also other permutations of power geo-politics at play too .
china remains a staunch pakistani ally and military supplier because it suits china to have pakistan as a thorn in india 's side , with whom its also fought a war in the past and seeks to check its power .
israel increasingly has also emerged as key provider of military technology for india which it sees as a natural ally in the fight against islamic radicalism .
but its hard to escape the perception that the pakistani military and the isi are really the key players in the drama of the hindu kush and the larger crisis of south asia .
within pakistan itself the military 's power far exceeds that of a weak civilian government .
a massive portion of the national budget is allocated to the armed forces with no questions asked .

since assuming office barack obama has redefined the conflict by calling it the af-pak war . the us president 's redefinition is recognition that the taliban 's nerve center , as well as al qaeda 's safe haven , are across afghanistan 's border in neighboring pakistan .
in the forbidding tribal territories , waziristan especially , another dimension of the same fierce conflict is underway with more pakistani troops thrown into the fray than the whole of nato deploys on its side of the northwest frontier .
but unlike afghanistan where nato allows journalists free access to combat operations , the pakistani military remains media-averse and highly secretive of its own internal counter-insurgency efforts .
on the surface of things , however pakistan is nato 's and particularly washington 's staunch ally in the regional and global campaign against terror .
it 's a role for which islamabad in dire economic straits is rewarded handsomely with a massive combined us economic and military aid package it could not do without .
but as british author moni mohsin , a lifelong student of pakistan , points out " pakistan is also the only us ally america frequently bombs with drone missile strikes , which sometimes kill terrorists and just as often kill civilians . "
and while islamabad is at pains to denounce the predator missile attacks and adamantly insists it does not authorize them , mohsin told deutsche welle that there is tacit pakistani government approval for the strikes .
yet when the attacks are publicized it only helps to feed the ever present anti-american propaganda in pakistan 's right wing media " which in turn becomes a pro-talibanization as far as the public is concerned . "
anti-us sentiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , and its director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- , have been accused of stoking up tensions in afghanistan the prevalence of anti-us sentiment in popular culture is something the pakistani army and the all powerful military intelligence service , or isi , seems to thrive on and encourage although they are ostensible allies of the west , in presumably the same struggle .
the underpinning complexity of such duality is at the essence of what routine western analysis of south asia often fails to pinpoint .
at the core of this double game , is pakistan 's traditional enmity with india , the dominance of the armed forces and its spymasters in pakistan 's national and political life and a long standing rapport with the taliban and other radical groups which it has not only supported but also created in some cases .
british journalist rishaad salamat , a long time pakistani analyst and a senior economic anchor with bloomberg europe , argues that from a national security perspective " there are elements in the isi who do n't want a democratic and stable afghanistan .
a state that they perceive as being in the pocket of india and one which has irredentist claims on pakistani territory . " mohsin concurs .
" the pakistani army feels threatened by india on its right flank .
and if most countries have armies , pakistan is an army with a country and to remain in this preeminent position , the generals play up the indian threat .
but then india does have a massive presence and influence in afghanistan .
it has 26 consulates , what does afghanistan have as one of the poorest nations on earth that india needs so badly ? "
proxy war means more instability muddling things further in what seems to be an ongoing proxy war between delhi and islamabad , though they are not playing it up , there is widespread suspicion in western intelligence agencies that the isi may well have behind the recent suicide attacks and shootings in kabul aimed at the indian community there .
not surprising when the pakistani jihadist group laskhar e taiba which carried out the bloody raid on mumbai in 2008 is clearly recognized as an offspring of the isi , recruited , armed and trained by the intelligence service .
that thus far islamabad has also refused to extradite or try a single suspect among over 40 militants linked to the slaughter has only exacerbated tensions with its indian rival .
this refusal arguably brought india and pakistan to the brink of what might have become their fourth modern war since achieving independence from the british raj in 1947 .
it is also undeniable that the isi has a clear hand in supporting separatist militants in indian administered kashmir .
though it is n't all one way mischief , india continues to covertly back baluchi separatists in pakistan deeply alienated from central government , in what endures as another , albeit lower-level rebellion within islamabad 's borders .
it is also now conveniently overlooked that the taliban itself , ironically enough , was the very creation - with a lot of us funding - of both the isi and the cia , designed to act as a tool to confront moscow during the soviet war in afghanistan .
what remains more confusing is that while the pakistani army fights a costly war against the taliban in its own tribal areas , every once in a while taliban casualties in afghanistan are discovered wearing pakistani army dog tags , most of them officers on seconded , special duty .
there have also been repeated instances of taliban prisoners of war admitting that pakistani regular army officers run specialized taliban training camps .
so does it mean civil war has spread to the ranks of the pakistani military itself ?
is it a simple case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing ?
not quite .
mohsin argues that there are elements of the taliban the pakistani army and the isi do not control nor favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the isaf troops are facing an uphill battle on several different fronts " the army and isi say -lrb- to washington -rrb- look we will deal with al qaeda and the jihadists , but you have made it clear that you will withdraw sooner rather than later and we want an afghan government in which we have a say , because we live here and we 'd prefer a taliban type of government we can play ball with , " mohsin told deutsche welle .
it is a stance that angers washington but when " nato is bleeding and pakistani support is critical there is little that they can do and pakistan is going to milk it for all its worth and keep collecting the aid looking to washington to keep defusing tensions with dehli . "
history repeating itself ?
of course there are also other permutations of power geo-politics at play too .
china remains a staunch pakistani ally and military supplier because it suits china to have pakistan as a thorn in india 's side , with whom its also fought a war in the past and seeks to check its power .
israel increasingly has also emerged as key provider of military technology for india which it sees as a natural ally in the fight against islamic radicalism .
but its hard to escape the perception that the pakistani military and the isi are really the key players in the drama of the hindu kush and the larger crisis of south asia .
within pakistan itself the military 's power far exceeds that of a weak civilian government .
a massive portion of the national budget is allocated to the armed forces with no questions asked .
there is no public nor international accountability of the nature of conflict in the territories , where there may well be large scale civilian losses and human rights abuses on both sides .
and among those that dissent in pakistan , but who also oppose radicalization , the military and the isi are challenging democracy itself , pitting the judiciary against the government and using nationalist sentiment in the conservative elements of the media to keep tensions at a fever pitch .

salomon korn demanded that the plight of germans who fled poland be linked to nazi war crimes . the representative of germany 's jews on the board of a controversial museum for german world war ii refugees has threatened to stand down in a row over its content .

the last synagogue in herford closed during adolf hitler 's rule of germany . after over 70 years , the city of herford has an official jewish place of worship once again .
the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , juergen ruettgers , and the president of the germany 's central council of jews , charlotte knobloch , celebrated along with the congregation at the opening ceremony .
" i hope for you - and for us all - that jewish life here in north rhine-westphalia bears fruit - that it is present , changes , initiates change , and invigorates , " ruettgers said .
" we must , and we will , do everything to ensure there is never another auschwitz . "
charlotte knobloch commented on how jewish history in herford stretches back seven centuries , although after the holocaust only a handful of the roughly 200 former inhabitants returned .
the former synagogue was destroyed during " kristallnacht " -lrb- " the night of broken glass " -rrb- on november 9 , 1938 , one of the nazis ' most widespread and brutal single purges of jewish society within germany .
knobloch said the synagogue would act as a memorial for the former jewish community , meaning that worshippers might shed a few tears from time to time .
" but today , together , we can prove that there can also be tears of joy , " she said .

the prayer room in a nearby jewish school in herford had becaome overcrowded in recent years due to the arrival of many jews from the former soviet union .
herford is in the east of the state , near osnabruck and bielefeld .
roughly 30,000 people of jewish faith live in north rhine-westphalia nowadays , and that population has been steadily growing since the fall of the iron curtain .

the last synagogue in herford closed during adolf hitler 's rule of germany . after over 70 years , the city of herford has an official jewish place of worship once again .
the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , juergen ruettgers , and the president of the germany 's central council of jews , charlotte knobloch , celebrated along with the congregation at the opening ceremony .
" i hope for you - and for us all - that jewish life here in north rhine-westphalia bears fruit - that it is present , changes , initiates change , and invigorates , " ruettgers said .
" we must , and we will , do everything to ensure there is never another auschwitz . "
charlotte knobloch commented on how jewish history in herford stretches back seven centuries , although after the holocaust only a handful of the roughly 200 former inhabitants returned .
the former synagogue was destroyed during " kristallnacht " -lrb- " the night of broken glass " -rrb- on november 9 , 1938 , one of the nazis ' most widespread and brutal single purges of jewish society within germany .
knobloch said the synagogue would act as a memorial for the former jewish community , meaning that worshippers might shed a few tears from time to time .
" but today , together , we can prove that there can also be tears of joy , " she said .
jewish population on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 267 synagogues and thousands of homes and shops were destroyed during " kristallnacht " the neo-gothic building was erected on the site of the former synagogue , which was constructed in 1852 .
it cost roughly two million euros , and the prayer area can accommodate over 90 people .
the prayer room in a nearby jewish school in herford had becaome overcrowded in recent years due to the arrival of many jews from the former soviet union .
herford is in the east of the state , near osnabruck and bielefeld .
roughly 30,000 people of jewish faith live in north rhine-westphalia nowadays , and that population has been steadily growing since the fall of the iron curtain .
ten new synagogues have been built in north rhine-westphalia since the mid-1990s. msh / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the last synagogue in herford closed during adolf hitler 's rule of germany . after over 70 years , the city of herford has an official jewish place of worship once again .
the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , juergen ruettgers , and the president of the germany 's central council of jews , charlotte knobloch , celebrated along with the congregation at the opening ceremony .
" i hope for you - and for us all - that jewish life here in north rhine-westphalia bears fruit - that it is present , changes , initiates change , and invigorates , " ruettgers said .
" we must , and we will , do everything to ensure there is never another auschwitz . "
charlotte knobloch commented on how jewish history in herford stretches back seven centuries , although after the holocaust only a handful of the roughly 200 former inhabitants returned .
the former synagogue was destroyed during " kristallnacht " -lrb- " the night of broken glass " -rrb- on november 9 , 1938 , one of the nazis ' most widespread and brutal single purges of jewish society within germany .
knobloch said the synagogue would act as a memorial for the former jewish community , meaning that worshippers might shed a few tears from time to time .
" but today , together , we can prove that there can also be tears of joy , " she said .
jewish population on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 267 synagogues and thousands of homes and shops were destroyed during " kristallnacht " the neo-gothic building was erected on the site of the former synagogue , which was constructed in 1852 .
it cost roughly two million euros , and the prayer area can accommodate over 90 people .
the prayer room in a nearby jewish school in herford had becaome overcrowded in recent years due to the arrival of many jews from the former soviet union .
herford is in the east of the state , near osnabruck and bielefeld .
roughly 30,000 people of jewish faith live in north rhine-westphalia nowadays , and that population has been steadily growing since the fall of the iron curtain .
ten new synagogues have been built in north rhine-westphalia since the mid-1990s. msh / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

salomon korn demanded that the plight of germans who fled poland be linked to nazi war crimes . the representative of germany 's jews on the board of a controversial museum for german world war ii refugees has threatened to stand down in a row over its content .
in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine , the vice president of the central council of jews , salomon korn , urged a shift in emphasis in plans for the museum , which is being overseen by the foundation for flight , expulsion and reconciliation .
the permanent exhibition is intended to document the plight of people forced to flee their homelands as a result of world war ii - including german expellees who were forced to flee land that was incorporated into poland and the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn said he was not prepared to play a ' token role ' korn , a member of the foundation 's board , said that exhibits to depict the suffering of germans must be set in context with wartime outrages committed by the nazis .
the central coucil of jews as a whole was prepared to abandon its participation in the project , he said , if the museum did not dealö with the theme of german expulsion in connection with the world war ii and nazis crimes against humanity .
" we will not play a token role .
there are clear boundaries for us , " korn told der spiegel , adding that he was prepared to boycott his post or even stand down completely .
criticism of expellee group the jewish group has criticized the role of the german federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , which has pushed for the creation of a museum dedicated mainly to the fate of 15 million germans forced to leave eastern europe in 1945 .
it has also demanded transparency over the wartime past of certain officials who have served the bdv .
bundestag vice president wolfgang thierse warned that the foundation was in danger after a czech and polish historian resigned from its academic committee . " the withdrawal of committee member from neighboring states places the idea of the foundation in fundamental danger , " said thierse . " it should not become a purely german affair . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellee federation head erika steinbach has caused controversy efforts to erect a museum that would tell the story of displaced german refugees have been controversial . bdv head erika steinbach renounced her claim to a place on the board in a deal with the german government .
berlin was worried that steinbach 's views would damage germany 's relationship with poland .

werder bremen beat hoffenheim , and stay close to the european qualification spots . bayer leverkusen kept their championship hopes alive on sunday with a much needed win against fellow top-team hamburg .
on home turf , leverkusen won 4-2 , with a brace of goals fairy early in the second half turning the game decisively in their favor .
german international striker stefan kiessling opened the scoring after 22 minutes for leverkusen , after being set clear by a wonderful pass from tranquilo barnetta .
however , eleven minutes later goalie rene adler came to claim high ball , but only succeeded in colliding with veteran sami hyppia .
adler only parried the ball as far as hamburg 's ze roberto , who gratefully fired into the unprotected goal .
ten minutes after the break swiss striker eren derdiyok put leverkusen back in front , and just after the hour mark , kiessling grabbed his second of the game - and his 16th of the season - heading home from close range .
hamburg did narrow leverkusen 's lead on 83 minutes , but it was too little , too late , and leverkusen 's gonzalo castro added a fourth just moments later , finally putting the match beyond doubt .
that win moves leverkusen up to 53 points , still in third position , but only three points adrift of leaders bayern munich , and one point shy of second-placed side schalke .
hamburg remain fifth in the table , but might be looking over their shoulders , given the result in sunday 's other fixture .

peruvian striker claudio pizarro - playing his 100th game for bremen - scored a late winner , bagging three key points for a side still hoping to qualify for european competition .
pizarro latched on to a nice through pass from daniel jensen , and looped the ball over hoffenheim keeper timo hildebrand .
bremen now are within one point of fifth-placed hamburg , and only three away from borussia dortmund in fourth .

werder bremen beat hoffenheim , and stay close to the european qualification spots . bayer leverkusen kept their championship hopes alive on sunday with a much needed win against fellow top-team hamburg .
on home turf , leverkusen won 4-2 , with a brace of goals fairy early in the second half turning the game decisively in their favor .
german international striker stefan kiessling opened the scoring after 22 minutes for leverkusen , after being set clear by a wonderful pass from tranquilo barnetta .
however , eleven minutes later goalie rene adler came to claim high ball , but only succeeded in colliding with veteran sami hyppia .
adler only parried the ball as far as hamburg 's ze roberto , who gratefully fired into the unprotected goal .
ten minutes after the break swiss striker eren derdiyok put leverkusen back in front , and just after the hour mark , kiessling grabbed his second of the game - and his 16th of the season - heading home from close range .
hamburg did narrow leverkusen 's lead on 83 minutes , but it was too little , too late , and leverkusen 's gonzalo castro added a fourth just moments later , finally putting the match beyond doubt .
that win moves leverkusen up to 53 points , still in third position , but only three points adrift of leaders bayern munich , and one point shy of second-placed side schalke .
hamburg remain fifth in the table , but might be looking over their shoulders , given the result in sunday 's other fixture .
bremen in range bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudio pizarro was the man of the match , scoring the winner for bremen it was n't a similar feast of goals but werder bremen sealed a valuable 1-0 win in hoffenheim during the earlier match of the day .
peruvian striker claudio pizarro - playing his 100th game for bremen - scored a late winner , bagging three key points for a side still hoping to qualify for european competition .
pizarro latched on to a nice through pass from daniel jensen , and looped the ball over hoffenheim keeper timo hildebrand .
bremen now are within one point of fifth-placed hamburg , and only three away from borussia dortmund in fourth .
and with bremen 's attacking and open style , the team already has a superior goal difference than both the sides it 's chasing .
finishing in the top five in the bundesliga would earn bremen the reward of a spot in european competition next season. msh / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schumacher 's old adversary fernando alonso - making his debut for the scuderia - came in first , with his teammate felipe massa second .
massa was making a comeback of his own , after sustaining serious head and eye injuries in a freak accident midway through last season , which sidelined him for the rest of the year .
2008 world champion lewis hamilton rounded out the podium for mclaren mercedes .
fourth-placed sebastian vettel looked like the winner for most of the race , having led from pole position .
but in the closing stages he radioed in to the pits with the message , " there 's a loss of power , loss of power . " a mechanical problem was to blame , and vettel dropped down the order .
the 22-year-old even got back in touch with the garage later to ask if the mechanics could fix the problem on their computers , but he did n't get the answer he wanted to hear . " for me it was noticeable that there was no juice back there , " vettel told reporters , expalining he did n't yet know what had gone wrong with the car .

the mercedes gp duo nico rosberg and michael schumacher claimed fifth and sixth places , respectively , with rosberg glued to vettel 's gearbox by the end .
as schumacher had predicted in pre-season testing , the mercedes car was close to the top teams ' pace , but could n't keep up over race distance .
both rosberg and schumacher 's best efforts in the race were over a second shy of the fastest lap set by alonso .
" red bull and ferrari definitely have the advantage right now , " schumacher told german television reporters after the race . " but that 's roughly what we expected pre-season , we have a lot of work to do to get to the front .
but it 's not impossible . "
reigning champion jenson button came in seventh for mclaren mercedes , red bull 's mark webber had a frustrating day back in eighth , force india 's vitantonio liuzzi grabbed an impressive ninth , and williams veteran rubens barrichello scored the last available points in tenth .

werder bremen beat hoffenheim , and stay close to the european qualification spots . bayer leverkusen kept their championship hopes alive on sunday with a much needed win against fellow top-team hamburg .
on home turf , leverkusen won 4-2 , with a brace of goals fairy early in the second half turning the game decisively in their favor .
german international striker stefan kiessling opened the scoring after 22 minutes for leverkusen , after being set clear by a wonderful pass from tranquilo barnetta .
however , eleven minutes later goalie rene adler came to claim high ball , but only succeeded in colliding with veteran sami hyppia .
adler only parried the ball as far as hamburg 's ze roberto , who gratefully fired into the unprotected goal .
ten minutes after the break swiss striker eren derdiyok put leverkusen back in front , and just after the hour mark , kiessling grabbed his second of the game - and his 16th of the season - heading home from close range .
hamburg did narrow leverkusen 's lead on 83 minutes , but it was too little , too late , and leverkusen 's gonzalo castro added a fourth just moments later , finally putting the match beyond doubt .
that win moves leverkusen up to 53 points , still in third position , but only three points adrift of leaders bayern munich , and one point shy of second-placed side schalke .
hamburg remain fifth in the table , but might be looking over their shoulders , given the result in sunday 's other fixture .

peruvian striker claudio pizarro - playing his 100th game for bremen - scored a late winner , bagging three key points for a side still hoping to qualify for european competition .
pizarro latched on to a nice through pass from daniel jensen , and looped the ball over hoffenheim keeper timo hildebrand .
bremen now are within one point of fifth-placed hamburg , and only three away from borussia dortmund in fourth .
and with bremen 's attacking and open style , the team already has a superior goal difference than both the sides it 's chasing .
finishing in the top five in the bundesliga would earn bremen the reward of a spot in european competition next season. msh / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

salomon korn demanded that the plight of germans who fled poland be linked to nazi war crimes . the representative of germany 's jews on the board of a controversial museum for german world war ii refugees has threatened to stand down in a row over its content .
in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine , the vice president of the central council of jews , salomon korn , urged a shift in emphasis in plans for the museum , which is being overseen by the foundation for flight , expulsion and reconciliation .
the permanent exhibition is intended to document the plight of people forced to flee their homelands as a result of world war ii - including german expellees who were forced to flee land that was incorporated into poland and the soviet union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn said he was not prepared to play a ' token role ' korn , a member of the foundation 's board , said that exhibits to depict the suffering of germans must be set in context with wartime outrages committed by the nazis .
the central coucil of jews as a whole was prepared to abandon its participation in the project , he said , if the museum did not dealö with the theme of german expulsion in connection with the world war ii and nazis crimes against humanity .
" we will not play a token role .
there are clear boundaries for us , " korn told der spiegel , adding that he was prepared to boycott his post or even stand down completely .
criticism of expellee group the jewish group has criticized the role of the german federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , which has pushed for the creation of a museum dedicated mainly to the fate of 15 million germans forced to leave eastern europe in 1945 .
it has also demanded transparency over the wartime past of certain officials who have served the bdv .

" we must , and we will , do everything to ensure there is never another auschwitz . "
charlotte knobloch commented on how jewish history in herford stretches back seven centuries , although after the holocaust only a handful of the roughly 200 former inhabitants returned .
the former synagogue was destroyed during " kristallnacht " -lrb- " the night of broken glass " -rrb- on november 9 , 1938 , one of the nazis ' most widespread and brutal single purges of jewish society within germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 14.03.2010 afghanistan 's new great game : the undeclared wars within the war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflict in afghanistan has long since taken on a new dimension and spilled over into pakistan conventional western public opinion regards the war in afghanistan as a struggle between nato and extremist islamic militants .
since assuming office barack obama has redefined the conflict by calling it the af-pak war . the us president 's redefinition is recognition that the taliban 's nerve center , as well as al qaeda 's safe haven , are across afghanistan 's border in neighboring pakistan .
in the forbidding tribal territories , waziristan especially , another dimension of the same fierce conflict is underway with more pakistani troops thrown into the fray than the whole of nato deploys on its side of the northwest frontier .
but unlike afghanistan where nato allows journalists free access to combat operations , the pakistani military remains media-averse and highly secretive of its own internal counter-insurgency efforts .
on the surface of things , however pakistan is nato 's and particularly washington 's staunch ally in the regional and global campaign against terror .
it 's a role for which islamabad in dire economic straits is rewarded handsomely with a massive combined us economic and military aid package it could not do without .
but as british author moni mohsin , a lifelong student of pakistan , points out " pakistan is also the only us ally america frequently bombs with drone missile strikes , which sometimes kill terrorists and just as often kill civilians . "
and while islamabad is at pains to denounce the predator missile attacks and adamantly insists it does not authorize them , mohsin told deutsche welle that there is tacit pakistani government approval for the strikes .
yet when the attacks are publicized it only helps to feed the ever present anti-american propaganda in pakistan 's right wing media " which in turn becomes a pro-talibanization as far as the public is concerned . "
anti-us sentiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , and its director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- , have been accused of stoking up tensions in afghanistan the prevalence of anti-us sentiment in popular culture is something the pakistani army and the all powerful military intelligence service , or isi , seems to thrive on and encourage although they are ostensible allies of the west , in presumably the same struggle .
the underpinning complexity of such duality is at the essence of what routine western analysis of south asia often fails to pinpoint .
at the core of this double game , is pakistan 's traditional enmity with india , the dominance of the armed forces and its spymasters in pakistan 's national and political life and a long standing rapport with the taliban and other radical groups which it has not only supported but also created in some cases .
british journalist rishaad salamat , a long time pakistani analyst and a senior economic anchor with bloomberg europe , argues that from a national security perspective " there are elements in the isi who do n't want a democratic and stable afghanistan .
a state that they perceive as being in the pocket of india and one which has irredentist claims on pakistani territory . " mohsin concurs .
" the pakistani army feels threatened by india on its right flank .
and if most countries have armies , pakistan is an army with a country and to remain in this preeminent position , the generals play up the indian threat .
but then india does have a massive presence and influence in afghanistan .
it has 26 consulates , what does afghanistan have as one of the poorest nations on earth that india needs so badly ? "
proxy war means more instability muddling things further in what seems to be an ongoing proxy war between delhi and islamabad , though they are not playing it up , there is widespread suspicion in western intelligence agencies that the isi may well have behind the recent suicide attacks and shootings in kabul aimed at the indian community there .
not surprising when the pakistani jihadist group laskhar e taiba which carried out the bloody raid on mumbai in 2008 is clearly recognized as an offspring of the isi , recruited , armed and trained by the intelligence service .
that thus far islamabad has also refused to extradite or try a single suspect among over 40 militants linked to the slaughter has only exacerbated tensions with its indian rival .
this refusal arguably brought india and pakistan to the brink of what might have become their fourth modern war since achieving independence from the british raj in 1947 .
it is also undeniable that the isi has a clear hand in supporting separatist militants in indian administered kashmir .
though it is n't all one way mischief , india continues to covertly back baluchi separatists in pakistan deeply alienated from central government , in what endures as another , albeit lower-level rebellion within islamabad 's borders .
it is also now conveniently overlooked that the taliban itself , ironically enough , was the very creation - with a lot of us funding - of both the isi and the cia , designed to act as a tool to confront moscow during the soviet war in afghanistan .
what remains more confusing is that while the pakistani army fights a costly war against the taliban in its own tribal areas , every once in a while taliban casualties in afghanistan are discovered wearing pakistani army dog tags , most of them officers on seconded , special duty .
there have also been repeated instances of taliban prisoners of war admitting that pakistani regular army officers run specialized taliban training camps .
so does it mean civil war has spread to the ranks of the pakistani military itself ?
is it a simple case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing ?
not quite .
mohsin argues that there are elements of the taliban the pakistani army and the isi do not control nor favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the isaf troops are facing an uphill battle on several different fronts " the army and isi say -lrb- to washington -rrb- look we will deal with al qaeda and the jihadists , but you have made it clear that you will withdraw sooner rather than later and we want an afghan government in which we have a say , because we live here and we 'd prefer a taliban type of government we can play ball with , " mohsin told deutsche welle .
it is a stance that angers washington but when " nato is bleeding and pakistani support is critical there is little that they can do and pakistan is going to milk it for all its worth and keep collecting the aid looking to washington to keep defusing tensions with dehli . "
history repeating itself ?
of course there are also other permutations of power geo-politics at play too .
china remains a staunch pakistani ally and military supplier because it suits china to have pakistan as a thorn in india 's side , with whom its also fought a war in the past and seeks to check its power .
israel increasingly has also emerged as key provider of military technology for india which it sees as a natural ally in the fight against islamic radicalism .
but its hard to escape the perception that the pakistani military and the isi are really the key players in the drama of the hindu kush and the larger crisis of south asia .
within pakistan itself the military 's power far exceeds that of a weak civilian government .
a massive portion of the national budget is allocated to the armed forces with no questions asked .
there is no public nor international accountability of the nature of conflict in the territories , where there may well be large scale civilian losses and human rights abuses on both sides .
and among those that dissent in pakistan , but who also oppose radicalization , the military and the isi are challenging democracy itself , pitting the judiciary against the government and using nationalist sentiment in the conservative elements of the media to keep tensions at a fever pitch .
it 's a dangerous game and last year casualties from suicide bombings in pakistan exceeded those in iraq .
bildunterschrift : foreign troops have more often than not failed in afghanistan the great game as it was once called pitted the british and russian empires against one another with afghanistan as the chosen battleground .
during world war ii , nazi germany even sought afghanistan as a potential ally in its struggle against britain , even sending a team of saboteurs to blow up bridges on the afghan-indian borders .
of course the soviets had their failed era and now it is america and its nato european allies who are embroiled in the hindu kush .
but it is much more complex than anyone dare admit and it would seem as ever , if history is anything to go by , it is the locals that will have the final say , not the outsider .

in the forbidding tribal territories , waziristan especially , another dimension of the same fierce conflict is underway with more pakistani troops thrown into the fray than the whole of nato deploys on its side of the northwest frontier .
but unlike afghanistan where nato allows journalists free access to combat operations , the pakistani military remains media-averse and highly secretive of its own internal counter-insurgency efforts .
on the surface of things , however pakistan is nato 's and particularly washington 's staunch ally in the regional and global campaign against terror .
it 's a role for which islamabad in dire economic straits is rewarded handsomely with a massive combined us economic and military aid package it could not do without .
but as british author moni mohsin , a lifelong student of pakistan , points out " pakistan is also the only us ally america frequently bombs with drone missile strikes , which sometimes kill terrorists and just as often kill civilians . "
and while islamabad is at pains to denounce the predator missile attacks and adamantly insists it does not authorize them , mohsin told deutsche welle that there is tacit pakistani government approval for the strikes .
yet when the attacks are publicized it only helps to feed the ever present anti-american propaganda in pakistan 's right wing media " which in turn becomes a pro-talibanization as far as the public is concerned . "
anti-us sentiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , and its director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- , have been accused of stoking up tensions in afghanistan the prevalence of anti-us sentiment in popular culture is something the pakistani army and the all powerful military intelligence service , or isi , seems to thrive on and encourage although they are ostensible allies of the west , in presumably the same struggle .
the underpinning complexity of such duality is at the essence of what routine western analysis of south asia often fails to pinpoint .
at the core of this double game , is pakistan 's traditional enmity with india , the dominance of the armed forces and its spymasters in pakistan 's national and political life and a long standing rapport with the taliban and other radical groups which it has not only supported but also created in some cases .
british journalist rishaad salamat , a long time pakistani analyst and a senior economic anchor with bloomberg europe , argues that from a national security perspective " there are elements in the isi who do n't want a democratic and stable afghanistan .
a state that they perceive as being in the pocket of india and one which has irredentist claims on pakistani territory . " mohsin concurs .
" the pakistani army feels threatened by india on its right flank .
and if most countries have armies , pakistan is an army with a country and to remain in this preeminent position , the generals play up the indian threat .
but then india does have a massive presence and influence in afghanistan .
it has 26 consulates , what does afghanistan have as one of the poorest nations on earth that india needs so badly ? "
proxy war means more instability muddling things further in what seems to be an ongoing proxy war between delhi and islamabad , though they are not playing it up , there is widespread suspicion in western intelligence agencies that the isi may well have behind the recent suicide attacks and shootings in kabul aimed at the indian community there .
not surprising when the pakistani jihadist group laskhar e taiba which carried out the bloody raid on mumbai in 2008 is clearly recognized as an offspring of the isi , recruited , armed and trained by the intelligence service .
that thus far islamabad has also refused to extradite or try a single suspect among over 40 militants linked to the slaughter has only exacerbated tensions with its indian rival .
this refusal arguably brought india and pakistan to the brink of what might have become their fourth modern war since achieving independence from the british raj in 1947 .
it is also undeniable that the isi has a clear hand in supporting separatist militants in indian administered kashmir .
though it is n't all one way mischief , india continues to covertly back baluchi separatists in pakistan deeply alienated from central government , in what endures as another , albeit lower-level rebellion within islamabad 's borders .
it is also now conveniently overlooked that the taliban itself , ironically enough , was the very creation - with a lot of us funding - of both the isi and the cia , designed to act as a tool to confront moscow during the soviet war in afghanistan .
what remains more confusing is that while the pakistani army fights a costly war against the taliban in its own tribal areas , every once in a while taliban casualties in afghanistan are discovered wearing pakistani army dog tags , most of them officers on seconded , special duty .
there have also been repeated instances of taliban prisoners of war admitting that pakistani regular army officers run specialized taliban training camps .
so does it mean civil war has spread to the ranks of the pakistani military itself ?
is it a simple case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing ?
not quite .
mohsin argues that there are elements of the taliban the pakistani army and the isi do not control nor favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the isaf troops are facing an uphill battle on several different fronts " the army and isi say -lrb- to washington -rrb- look we will deal with al qaeda and the jihadists , but you have made it clear that you will withdraw sooner rather than later and we want an afghan government in which we have a say , because we live here and we 'd prefer a taliban type of government we can play ball with , " mohsin told deutsche welle .
it is a stance that angers washington but when " nato is bleeding and pakistani support is critical there is little that they can do and pakistan is going to milk it for all its worth and keep collecting the aid looking to washington to keep defusing tensions with dehli . "
history repeating itself ?
of course there are also other permutations of power geo-politics at play too .
china remains a staunch pakistani ally and military supplier because it suits china to have pakistan as a thorn in india 's side , with whom its also fought a war in the past and seeks to check its power .
israel increasingly has also emerged as key provider of military technology for india which it sees as a natural ally in the fight against islamic radicalism .
but its hard to escape the perception that the pakistani military and the isi are really the key players in the drama of the hindu kush and the larger crisis of south asia .
within pakistan itself the military 's power far exceeds that of a weak civilian government .
a massive portion of the national budget is allocated to the armed forces with no questions asked .
there is no public nor international accountability of the nature of conflict in the territories , where there may well be large scale civilian losses and human rights abuses on both sides .
and among those that dissent in pakistan , but who also oppose radicalization , the military and the isi are challenging democracy itself , pitting the judiciary against the government and using nationalist sentiment in the conservative elements of the media to keep tensions at a fever pitch .
it 's a dangerous game and last year casualties from suicide bombings in pakistan exceeded those in iraq .
bildunterschrift : foreign troops have more often than not failed in afghanistan the great game as it was once called pitted the british and russian empires against one another with afghanistan as the chosen battleground .
during world war ii , nazi germany even sought afghanistan as a potential ally in its struggle against britain , even sending a team of saboteurs to blow up bridges on the afghan-indian borders .
of course the soviets had their failed era and now it is america and its nato european allies who are embroiled in the hindu kush .
but it is much more complex than anyone dare admit and it would seem as ever , if history is anything to go by , it is the locals that will have the final say , not the outsider .

since assuming office barack obama has redefined the conflict by calling it the af-pak war . the us president 's redefinition is recognition that the taliban 's nerve center , as well as al qaeda 's safe haven , are across afghanistan 's border in neighboring pakistan .
in the forbidding tribal territories , waziristan especially , another dimension of the same fierce conflict is underway with more pakistani troops thrown into the fray than the whole of nato deploys on its side of the northwest frontier .
but unlike afghanistan where nato allows journalists free access to combat operations , the pakistani military remains media-averse and highly secretive of its own internal counter-insurgency efforts .
on the surface of things , however pakistan is nato 's and particularly washington 's staunch ally in the regional and global campaign against terror .
it 's a role for which islamabad in dire economic straits is rewarded handsomely with a massive combined us economic and military aid package it could not do without .
but as british author moni mohsin , a lifelong student of pakistan , points out " pakistan is also the only us ally america frequently bombs with drone missile strikes , which sometimes kill terrorists and just as often kill civilians . "
and while islamabad is at pains to denounce the predator missile attacks and adamantly insists it does not authorize them , mohsin told deutsche welle that there is tacit pakistani government approval for the strikes .
yet when the attacks are publicized it only helps to feed the ever present anti-american propaganda in pakistan 's right wing media " which in turn becomes a pro-talibanization as far as the public is concerned . "
anti-us sentiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , and its director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- , have been accused of stoking up tensions in afghanistan the prevalence of anti-us sentiment in popular culture is something the pakistani army and the all powerful military intelligence service , or isi , seems to thrive on and encourage although they are ostensible allies of the west , in presumably the same struggle .
the underpinning complexity of such duality is at the essence of what routine western analysis of south asia often fails to pinpoint .
at the core of this double game , is pakistan 's traditional enmity with india , the dominance of the armed forces and its spymasters in pakistan 's national and political life and a long standing rapport with the taliban and other radical groups which it has not only supported but also created in some cases .
british journalist rishaad salamat , a long time pakistani analyst and a senior economic anchor with bloomberg europe , argues that from a national security perspective " there are elements in the isi who do n't want a democratic and stable afghanistan .
a state that they perceive as being in the pocket of india and one which has irredentist claims on pakistani territory . " mohsin concurs .
" the pakistani army feels threatened by india on its right flank .
and if most countries have armies , pakistan is an army with a country and to remain in this preeminent position , the generals play up the indian threat .
but then india does have a massive presence and influence in afghanistan .
it has 26 consulates , what does afghanistan have as one of the poorest nations on earth that india needs so badly ? "
proxy war means more instability muddling things further in what seems to be an ongoing proxy war between delhi and islamabad , though they are not playing it up , there is widespread suspicion in western intelligence agencies that the isi may well have behind the recent suicide attacks and shootings in kabul aimed at the indian community there .
not surprising when the pakistani jihadist group laskhar e taiba which carried out the bloody raid on mumbai in 2008 is clearly recognized as an offspring of the isi , recruited , armed and trained by the intelligence service .
that thus far islamabad has also refused to extradite or try a single suspect among over 40 militants linked to the slaughter has only exacerbated tensions with its indian rival .
this refusal arguably brought india and pakistan to the brink of what might have become their fourth modern war since achieving independence from the british raj in 1947 .
it is also undeniable that the isi has a clear hand in supporting separatist militants in indian administered kashmir .
though it is n't all one way mischief , india continues to covertly back baluchi separatists in pakistan deeply alienated from central government , in what endures as another , albeit lower-level rebellion within islamabad 's borders .
it is also now conveniently overlooked that the taliban itself , ironically enough , was the very creation - with a lot of us funding - of both the isi and the cia , designed to act as a tool to confront moscow during the soviet war in afghanistan .
what remains more confusing is that while the pakistani army fights a costly war against the taliban in its own tribal areas , every once in a while taliban casualties in afghanistan are discovered wearing pakistani army dog tags , most of them officers on seconded , special duty .
there have also been repeated instances of taliban prisoners of war admitting that pakistani regular army officers run specialized taliban training camps .
so does it mean civil war has spread to the ranks of the pakistani military itself ?
is it a simple case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing ?
not quite .
mohsin argues that there are elements of the taliban the pakistani army and the isi do not control nor favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the isaf troops are facing an uphill battle on several different fronts " the army and isi say -lrb- to washington -rrb- look we will deal with al qaeda and the jihadists , but you have made it clear that you will withdraw sooner rather than later and we want an afghan government in which we have a say , because we live here and we 'd prefer a taliban type of government we can play ball with , " mohsin told deutsche welle .
it is a stance that angers washington but when " nato is bleeding and pakistani support is critical there is little that they can do and pakistan is going to milk it for all its worth and keep collecting the aid looking to washington to keep defusing tensions with dehli . "
history repeating itself ?
of course there are also other permutations of power geo-politics at play too .
china remains a staunch pakistani ally and military supplier because it suits china to have pakistan as a thorn in india 's side , with whom its also fought a war in the past and seeks to check its power .
israel increasingly has also emerged as key provider of military technology for india which it sees as a natural ally in the fight against islamic radicalism .
but its hard to escape the perception that the pakistani military and the isi are really the key players in the drama of the hindu kush and the larger crisis of south asia .
within pakistan itself the military 's power far exceeds that of a weak civilian government .
a massive portion of the national budget is allocated to the armed forces with no questions asked .
there is no public nor international accountability of the nature of conflict in the territories , where there may well be large scale civilian losses and human rights abuses on both sides .
and among those that dissent in pakistan , but who also oppose radicalization , the military and the isi are challenging democracy itself , pitting the judiciary against the government and using nationalist sentiment in the conservative elements of the media to keep tensions at a fever pitch .
it 's a dangerous game and last year casualties from suicide bombings in pakistan exceeded those in iraq .
bildunterschrift : foreign troops have more often than not failed in afghanistan the great game as it was once called pitted the british and russian empires against one another with afghanistan as the chosen battleground .
during world war ii , nazi germany even sought afghanistan as a potential ally in its struggle against britain , even sending a team of saboteurs to blow up bridges on the afghan-indian borders .
of course the soviets had their failed era and now it is america and its nato european allies who are embroiled in the hindu kush .
but it is much more complex than anyone dare admit and it would seem as ever , if history is anything to go by , it is the locals that will have the final say , not the outsider .

since assuming office barack obama has redefined the conflict by calling it the af-pak war . the us president 's redefinition is recognition that the taliban 's nerve center , as well as al qaeda 's safe haven , are across afghanistan 's border in neighboring pakistan .
in the forbidding tribal territories , waziristan especially , another dimension of the same fierce conflict is underway with more pakistani troops thrown into the fray than the whole of nato deploys on its side of the northwest frontier .
but unlike afghanistan where nato allows journalists free access to combat operations , the pakistani military remains media-averse and highly secretive of its own internal counter-insurgency efforts .
on the surface of things , however pakistan is nato 's and particularly washington 's staunch ally in the regional and global campaign against terror .
it 's a role for which islamabad in dire economic straits is rewarded handsomely with a massive combined us economic and military aid package it could not do without .
but as british author moni mohsin , a lifelong student of pakistan , points out " pakistan is also the only us ally america frequently bombs with drone missile strikes , which sometimes kill terrorists and just as often kill civilians . "
and while islamabad is at pains to denounce the predator missile attacks and adamantly insists it does not authorize them , mohsin told deutsche welle that there is tacit pakistani government approval for the strikes .
yet when the attacks are publicized it only helps to feed the ever present anti-american propaganda in pakistan 's right wing media " which in turn becomes a pro-talibanization as far as the public is concerned . "
anti-us sentiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , and its director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- , have been accused of stoking up tensions in afghanistan the prevalence of anti-us sentiment in popular culture is something the pakistani army and the all powerful military intelligence service , or isi , seems to thrive on and encourage although they are ostensible allies of the west , in presumably the same struggle .
the underpinning complexity of such duality is at the essence of what routine western analysis of south asia often fails to pinpoint .
at the core of this double game , is pakistan 's traditional enmity with india , the dominance of the armed forces and its spymasters in pakistan 's national and political life and a long standing rapport with the taliban and other radical groups which it has not only supported but also created in some cases .
british journalist rishaad salamat , a long time pakistani analyst and a senior economic anchor with bloomberg europe , argues that from a national security perspective " there are elements in the isi who do n't want a democratic and stable afghanistan .
a state that they perceive as being in the pocket of india and one which has irredentist claims on pakistani territory . " mohsin concurs .
" the pakistani army feels threatened by india on its right flank .
and if most countries have armies , pakistan is an army with a country and to remain in this preeminent position , the generals play up the indian threat .
but then india does have a massive presence and influence in afghanistan .
it has 26 consulates , what does afghanistan have as one of the poorest nations on earth that india needs so badly ? "
proxy war means more instability muddling things further in what seems to be an ongoing proxy war between delhi and islamabad , though they are not playing it up , there is widespread suspicion in western intelligence agencies that the isi may well have behind the recent suicide attacks and shootings in kabul aimed at the indian community there .
not surprising when the pakistani jihadist group laskhar e taiba which carried out the bloody raid on mumbai in 2008 is clearly recognized as an offspring of the isi , recruited , armed and trained by the intelligence service .
that thus far islamabad has also refused to extradite or try a single suspect among over 40 militants linked to the slaughter has only exacerbated tensions with its indian rival .
this refusal arguably brought india and pakistan to the brink of what might have become their fourth modern war since achieving independence from the british raj in 1947 .
it is also undeniable that the isi has a clear hand in supporting separatist militants in indian administered kashmir .
though it is n't all one way mischief , india continues to covertly back baluchi separatists in pakistan deeply alienated from central government , in what endures as another , albeit lower-level rebellion within islamabad 's borders .
it is also now conveniently overlooked that the taliban itself , ironically enough , was the very creation - with a lot of us funding - of both the isi and the cia , designed to act as a tool to confront moscow during the soviet war in afghanistan .
what remains more confusing is that while the pakistani army fights a costly war against the taliban in its own tribal areas , every once in a while taliban casualties in afghanistan are discovered wearing pakistani army dog tags , most of them officers on seconded , special duty .
there have also been repeated instances of taliban prisoners of war admitting that pakistani regular army officers run specialized taliban training camps .
so does it mean civil war has spread to the ranks of the pakistani military itself ?
is it a simple case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing ?
not quite .
mohsin argues that there are elements of the taliban the pakistani army and the isi do not control nor favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the isaf troops are facing an uphill battle on several different fronts " the army and isi say -lrb- to washington -rrb- look we will deal with al qaeda and the jihadists , but you have made it clear that you will withdraw sooner rather than later and we want an afghan government in which we have a say , because we live here and we 'd prefer a taliban type of government we can play ball with , " mohsin told deutsche welle .
it is a stance that angers washington but when " nato is bleeding and pakistani support is critical there is little that they can do and pakistan is going to milk it for all its worth and keep collecting the aid looking to washington to keep defusing tensions with dehli . "
history repeating itself ?
of course there are also other permutations of power geo-politics at play too .
china remains a staunch pakistani ally and military supplier because it suits china to have pakistan as a thorn in india 's side , with whom its also fought a war in the past and seeks to check its power .
israel increasingly has also emerged as key provider of military technology for india which it sees as a natural ally in the fight against islamic radicalism .
but its hard to escape the perception that the pakistani military and the isi are really the key players in the drama of the hindu kush and the larger crisis of south asia .
within pakistan itself the military 's power far exceeds that of a weak civilian government .
a massive portion of the national budget is allocated to the armed forces with no questions asked .
there is no public nor international accountability of the nature of conflict in the territories , where there may well be large scale civilian losses and human rights abuses on both sides .
and among those that dissent in pakistan , but who also oppose radicalization , the military and the isi are challenging democracy itself , pitting the judiciary against the government and using nationalist sentiment in the conservative elements of the media to keep tensions at a fever pitch .
it 's a dangerous game and last year casualties from suicide bombings in pakistan exceeded those in iraq .
bildunterschrift : foreign troops have more often than not failed in afghanistan the great game as it was once called pitted the british and russian empires against one another with afghanistan as the chosen battleground .
during world war ii , nazi germany even sought afghanistan as a potential ally in its struggle against britain , even sending a team of saboteurs to blow up bridges on the afghan-indian borders .
of course the soviets had their failed era and now it is america and its nato european allies who are embroiled in the hindu kush .
but it is much more complex than anyone dare admit and it would seem as ever , if history is anything to go by , it is the locals that will have the final say , not the outsider .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de motor racing -pipe- 14.03.2010 fernando alonso and ferrari spoil the schumacher party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike schumacher in 1997 , alonso won on his ferrari debut on the day of michael schumacher 's return to formula one , it was his old rival fernando alonso who rolled back the years .
just like in 2005 and 2006 , the spaniard spoiled schumacher 's party in bahrain . the spotlight might have been on michael schumacher 's return to formula one and his new mercedes gp team , but it was schumi 's former employer ferrari that took the spoils at the first race in bahrain .
schumacher 's old adversary fernando alonso - making his debut for the scuderia - came in first , with his teammate felipe massa second .
massa was making a comeback of his own , after sustaining serious head and eye injuries in a freak accident midway through last season , which sidelined him for the rest of the year .
2008 world champion lewis hamilton rounded out the podium for mclaren mercedes .
fourth-placed sebastian vettel looked like the winner for most of the race , having led from pole position .
but in the closing stages he radioed in to the pits with the message , " there 's a loss of power , loss of power . " a mechanical problem was to blame , and vettel dropped down the order .
the 22-year-old even got back in touch with the garage later to ask if the mechanics could fix the problem on their computers , but he did n't get the answer he wanted to hear . " for me it was noticeable that there was no juice back there , " vettel told reporters , expalining he did n't yet know what had gone wrong with the car . " fourth place is great damage limitation , until then the race was perfect .
we had managed our tires better than the others , fernando -lsb- alonso , then in second place -rsb- was attacking , but i think we had him under control . "
mercedes off the pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher finished a solid sixth , but win number 92 will have to wait but vettel just managed to keep the rather disappointing " silver arrows " at bay .
the mercedes gp duo nico rosberg and michael schumacher claimed fifth and sixth places , respectively , with rosberg glued to vettel 's gearbox by the end .
as schumacher had predicted in pre-season testing , the mercedes car was close to the top teams ' pace , but could n't keep up over race distance .
both rosberg and schumacher 's best efforts in the race were over a second shy of the fastest lap set by alonso .
" red bull and ferrari definitely have the advantage right now , " schumacher told german television reporters after the race . " but that 's roughly what we expected pre-season , we have a lot of work to do to get to the front .
but it 's not impossible . "
reigning champion jenson button came in seventh for mclaren mercedes , red bull 's mark webber had a frustrating day back in eighth , force india 's vitantonio liuzzi grabbed an impressive ninth , and williams veteran rubens barrichello scored the last available points in tenth .
disappointing day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pole-sitter vettel was n't the only unlucky german driver vettel 's mechanical issues and mercedes ' missing pace was but the tip of the iceberg , as german drivers struggled lower down the field as well .
adrian sutil , starting a promising 10th for force india , spun on the first lap , and had to fight his way through the field from the back .
he only managed 12th in the end .
debutant nico hulkenberg lost control of his williams at the tricky turns six and seven early in the race ; he was doomed to a similar fate to sutil , finishing 14th .
and virgin racing 's timo glock - one of the drivers brave enough to go to work for one of the three struggling new teams - only made it half way through the race before retiring .
only two of the six new entrants - the two lotus cars - made it to the checkered flag .

werder bremen beat hoffenheim , and stay close to the european qualification spots . bayer leverkusen kept their championship hopes alive on sunday with a much needed win against fellow top-team hamburg .
on home turf , leverkusen won 4-2 , with a brace of goals fairy early in the second half turning the game decisively in their favor .
german international striker stefan kiessling opened the scoring after 22 minutes for leverkusen , after being set clear by a wonderful pass from tranquilo barnetta .
however , eleven minutes later goalie rene adler came to claim high ball , but only succeeded in colliding with veteran sami hyppia .
adler only parried the ball as far as hamburg 's ze roberto , who gratefully fired into the unprotected goal .
ten minutes after the break swiss striker eren derdiyok put leverkusen back in front , and just after the hour mark , kiessling grabbed his second of the game - and his 16th of the season - heading home from close range .
hamburg did narrow leverkusen 's lead on 83 minutes , but it was too little , too late , and leverkusen 's gonzalo castro added a fourth just moments later , finally putting the match beyond doubt .
that win moves leverkusen up to 53 points , still in third position , but only three points adrift of leaders bayern munich , and one point shy of second-placed side schalke .
hamburg remain fifth in the table , but might be looking over their shoulders , given the result in sunday 's other fixture .

peruvian striker claudio pizarro - playing his 100th game for bremen - scored a late winner , bagging three key points for a side still hoping to qualify for european competition .
pizarro latched on to a nice through pass from daniel jensen , and looped the ball over hoffenheim keeper timo hildebrand .
bremen now are within one point of fifth-placed hamburg , and only three away from borussia dortmund in fourth .
and with bremen 's attacking and open style , the team already has a superior goal difference than both the sides it 's chasing .

werder bremen beat hoffenheim , and stay close to the european qualification spots . bayer leverkusen kept their championship hopes alive on sunday with a much needed win against fellow top-team hamburg .
on home turf , leverkusen won 4-2 , with a brace of goals fairy early in the second half turning the game decisively in their favor .
german international striker stefan kiessling opened the scoring after 22 minutes for leverkusen , after being set clear by a wonderful pass from tranquilo barnetta .
however , eleven minutes later goalie rene adler came to claim high ball , but only succeeded in colliding with veteran sami hyppia .
adler only parried the ball as far as hamburg 's ze roberto , who gratefully fired into the unprotected goal .
ten minutes after the break swiss striker eren derdiyok put leverkusen back in front , and just after the hour mark , kiessling grabbed his second of the game - and his 16th of the season - heading home from close range .
hamburg did narrow leverkusen 's lead on 83 minutes , but it was too little , too late , and leverkusen 's gonzalo castro added a fourth just moments later , finally putting the match beyond doubt .
that win moves leverkusen up to 53 points , still in third position , but only three points adrift of leaders bayern munich , and one point shy of second-placed side schalke .

in an interview with the online edition of the neue zuercher zeitung , werlen proposed creating a central organization for dealing church abuse accusations .
the organization should play a " coordinating role " in handling the abuse claims , the benedictine said . europe 's catholic church has faced a wave of sex abuse allegations across ireland , germany , austria , poland and the netherlands in the past few weeks .

the engineer 's posting is funded by cim - germany 's development cooperation recruiting agency . how were you received by your new colleagues in hanoi ?
my first day of work coincided with vov ’ s 64th anniversary , and that special day made things easier .
everyone was very friendly and kind .
in fact , many of my current colleagues had been in my previous dw-akademie workshops , so i wasn ’ t really “ new ’ in that sense .
your task is to finish the project to digitize vov ’ s old audio recordings .
how is the project advancing ?
the digital archive structure itself is there – the goal now is to fill it .
the staff can now analyse the archive contents , digitize the traditional analog storage media , and restore damaged tapes .
some 10,000 audio files have been digitized and 80,000 descriptive files have been logged .
we estimate that it will take another five years to digitize the tape material , and at least two years to restore the badly damaged tapes .
most of the staff working in the archive has not been trained in the various fields of archiving .
this means they will need ongoing training so that in the medium and long-term , they will be able to manage the archive independently .
how will vov benefit from the project ?
the archiving and restoration expertise which we ’ ve established for broadcasting is unique here in vietnam and also in asia .
long-term , the project will improve the broadcaster ’ s quality of programming , increase its topicality and preserve its historical value .
and in the end , it supports the country ’ s exchange with other nations – we ’ ve begun cross-linking asia ’ s archives , which not only strengthens south-south cooperation but also inner-asian dialogue .
you will be in vietnam for a total of two years .
how did the first few months proceed ?
my tasks in 2009 were to establish a dw-akademie regional office , to encourage and support the people at asian broadcasting archives , and to intensify our contacts with our asian partner organizations .
from a german perspective , the lively exchange with other development agencies has also been important .
all in all , this is an exciting project with lasting results .
by investing in the past we ’ re creating benefits for the future .
what are the plans for 2010 ?
this year we ’ ve started concentrating more on the multimedia archive .
vov launched a television channel in september 2008 , and that means there ’ s a lot of audio-visual material which needs to be archived .
there ’ s also an online project , where we need to think about how to store content long-term .
as for audio , we ’ ll be developing a strategy whereby audio archives and audio media from the regional stations can be digitized in accordance with the standards we have set .
in addition to the work in vietnam , we ’ ll also be expanding our regional consulting services .
this includes continuing the archive project with radio nepal in kathmandu .
we ’ ll conduct an archive analysis for sri lanka broadcasting corporation in colombo to see where further consultations are needed .
and we ’ ll also hold a regional archiving workshop in malaysia .
the need for more archiving expertise in asia is enormous . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic german version dw-akademie auf deutsch dw-tv europe live journal - news with in depth we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de motor racing -pipe- 14.03.2010 fernando alonso and ferrari spoil the schumacher party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike schumacher in 1997 , alonso won on his ferrari debut on the day of michael schumacher 's return to formula one , it was his old rival fernando alonso who rolled back the years .
just like in 2005 and 2006 , the spaniard spoiled schumacher 's party in bahrain . the spotlight might have been on michael schumacher 's return to formula one and his new mercedes gp team , but it was schumi 's former employer ferrari that took the spoils at the first race in bahrain .
schumacher 's old adversary fernando alonso - making his debut for the scuderia - came in first , with his teammate felipe massa second .
massa was making a comeback of his own , after sustaining serious head and eye injuries in a freak accident midway through last season , which sidelined him for the rest of the year .
2008 world champion lewis hamilton rounded out the podium for mclaren mercedes .
fourth-placed sebastian vettel looked like the winner for most of the race , having led from pole position .
but in the closing stages he radioed in to the pits with the message , " there 's a loss of power , loss of power . " a mechanical problem was to blame , and vettel dropped down the order .
the 22-year-old even got back in touch with the garage later to ask if the mechanics could fix the problem on their computers , but he did n't get the answer he wanted to hear . " for me it was noticeable that there was no juice back there , " vettel told reporters , expalining he did n't yet know what had gone wrong with the car . " fourth place is great damage limitation , until then the race was perfect .
we had managed our tires better than the others , fernando -lsb- alonso , then in second place -rsb- was attacking , but i think we had him under control . "
mercedes off the pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher finished a solid sixth , but win number 92 will have to wait but vettel just managed to keep the rather disappointing " silver arrows " at bay .
the mercedes gp duo nico rosberg and michael schumacher claimed fifth and sixth places , respectively , with rosberg glued to vettel 's gearbox by the end .
as schumacher had predicted in pre-season testing , the mercedes car was close to the top teams ' pace , but could n't keep up over race distance .
both rosberg and schumacher 's best efforts in the race were over a second shy of the fastest lap set by alonso .
" red bull and ferrari definitely have the advantage right now , " schumacher told german television reporters after the race . " but that 's roughly what we expected pre-season , we have a lot of work to do to get to the front .
but it 's not impossible . "
reigning champion jenson button came in seventh for mclaren mercedes , red bull 's mark webber had a frustrating day back in eighth , force india 's vitantonio liuzzi grabbed an impressive ninth , and williams veteran rubens barrichello scored the last available points in tenth .
disappointing day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pole-sitter vettel was n't the only unlucky german driver vettel 's mechanical issues and mercedes ' missing pace was but the tip of the iceberg , as german drivers struggled lower down the field as well .
adrian sutil , starting a promising 10th for force india , spun on the first lap , and had to fight his way through the field from the back .
he only managed 12th in the end .
debutant nico hulkenberg lost control of his williams at the tricky turns six and seven early in the race ; he was doomed to a similar fate to sutil , finishing 14th .
and virgin racing 's timo glock - one of the drivers brave enough to go to work for one of the three struggling new teams - only made it half way through the race before retiring .
only two of the six new entrants - the two lotus cars - made it to the checkered flag .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 14.03.2010 afghanistan 's new great game : the undeclared wars within the war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conflict in afghanistan has long since taken on a new dimension and spilled over into pakistan conventional western public opinion regards the war in afghanistan as a struggle between nato and extremist islamic militants .
since assuming office barack obama has redefined the conflict by calling it the af-pak war . the us president 's redefinition is recognition that the taliban 's nerve center , as well as al qaeda 's safe haven , are across afghanistan 's border in neighboring pakistan .
in the forbidding tribal territories , waziristan especially , another dimension of the same fierce conflict is underway with more pakistani troops thrown into the fray than the whole of nato deploys on its side of the northwest frontier .
but unlike afghanistan where nato allows journalists free access to combat operations , the pakistani military remains media-averse and highly secretive of its own internal counter-insurgency efforts .
on the surface of things , however pakistan is nato 's and particularly washington 's staunch ally in the regional and global campaign against terror .
it 's a role for which islamabad in dire economic straits is rewarded handsomely with a massive combined us economic and military aid package it could not do without .
but as british author moni mohsin , a lifelong student of pakistan , points out " pakistan is also the only us ally america frequently bombs with drone missile strikes , which sometimes kill terrorists and just as often kill civilians . "
and while islamabad is at pains to denounce the predator missile attacks and adamantly insists it does not authorize them , mohsin told deutsche welle that there is tacit pakistani government approval for the strikes .
yet when the attacks are publicized it only helps to feed the ever present anti-american propaganda in pakistan 's right wing media " which in turn becomes a pro-talibanization as far as the public is concerned . "
anti-us sentiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , and its director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- , have been accused of stoking up tensions in afghanistan the prevalence of anti-us sentiment in popular culture is something the pakistani army and the all powerful military intelligence service , or isi , seems to thrive on and encourage although they are ostensible allies of the west , in presumably the same struggle .
the underpinning complexity of such duality is at the essence of what routine western analysis of south asia often fails to pinpoint .
at the core of this double game , is pakistan 's traditional enmity with india , the dominance of the armed forces and its spymasters in pakistan 's national and political life and a long standing rapport with the taliban and other radical groups which it has not only supported but also created in some cases .
british journalist rishaad salamat , a long time pakistani analyst and a senior economic anchor with bloomberg europe , argues that from a national security perspective " there are elements in the isi who do n't want a democratic and stable afghanistan .
a state that they perceive as being in the pocket of india and one which has irredentist claims on pakistani territory . " mohsin concurs .
" the pakistani army feels threatened by india on its right flank .
and if most countries have armies , pakistan is an army with a country and to remain in this preeminent position , the generals play up the indian threat .
but then india does have a massive presence and influence in afghanistan .
it has 26 consulates , what does afghanistan have as one of the poorest nations on earth that india needs so badly ? "
proxy war means more instability muddling things further in what seems to be an ongoing proxy war between delhi and islamabad , though they are not playing it up , there is widespread suspicion in western intelligence agencies that the isi may well have behind the recent suicide attacks and shootings in kabul aimed at the indian community there .
not surprising when the pakistani jihadist group laskhar e taiba which carried out the bloody raid on mumbai in 2008 is clearly recognized as an offspring of the isi , recruited , armed and trained by the intelligence service .
that thus far islamabad has also refused to extradite or try a single suspect among over 40 militants linked to the slaughter has only exacerbated tensions with its indian rival .
this refusal arguably brought india and pakistan to the brink of what might have become their fourth modern war since achieving independence from the british raj in 1947 .
it is also undeniable that the isi has a clear hand in supporting separatist militants in indian administered kashmir .
though it is n't all one way mischief , india continues to covertly back baluchi separatists in pakistan deeply alienated from central government , in what endures as another , albeit lower-level rebellion within islamabad 's borders .
it is also now conveniently overlooked that the taliban itself , ironically enough , was the very creation - with a lot of us funding - of both the isi and the cia , designed to act as a tool to confront moscow during the soviet war in afghanistan .
what remains more confusing is that while the pakistani army fights a costly war against the taliban in its own tribal areas , every once in a while taliban casualties in afghanistan are discovered wearing pakistani army dog tags , most of them officers on seconded , special duty .
there have also been repeated instances of taliban prisoners of war admitting that pakistani regular army officers run specialized taliban training camps .
so does it mean civil war has spread to the ranks of the pakistani military itself ?
is it a simple case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing ?
not quite .
mohsin argues that there are elements of the taliban the pakistani army and the isi do not control nor favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the isaf troops are facing an uphill battle on several different fronts " the army and isi say -lrb- to washington -rrb- look we will deal with al qaeda and the jihadists , but you have made it clear that you will withdraw sooner rather than later and we want an afghan government in which we have a say , because we live here and we 'd prefer a taliban type of government we can play ball with , " mohsin told deutsche welle .
it is a stance that angers washington but when " nato is bleeding and pakistani support is critical there is little that they can do and pakistan is going to milk it for all its worth and keep collecting the aid looking to washington to keep defusing tensions with dehli . "
history repeating itself ?
of course there are also other permutations of power geo-politics at play too .
china remains a staunch pakistani ally and military supplier because it suits china to have pakistan as a thorn in india 's side , with whom its also fought a war in the past and seeks to check its power .
israel increasingly has also emerged as key provider of military technology for india which it sees as a natural ally in the fight against islamic radicalism .
but its hard to escape the perception that the pakistani military and the isi are really the key players in the drama of the hindu kush and the larger crisis of south asia .
within pakistan itself the military 's power far exceeds that of a weak civilian government .
a massive portion of the national budget is allocated to the armed forces with no questions asked .
there is no public nor international accountability of the nature of conflict in the territories , where there may well be large scale civilian losses and human rights abuses on both sides .
and among those that dissent in pakistan , but who also oppose radicalization , the military and the isi are challenging democracy itself , pitting the judiciary against the government and using nationalist sentiment in the conservative elements of the media to keep tensions at a fever pitch .
it 's a dangerous game and last year casualties from suicide bombings in pakistan exceeded those in iraq .
bildunterschrift : foreign troops have more often than not failed in afghanistan the great game as it was once called pitted the british and russian empires against one another with afghanistan as the chosen battleground .
during world war ii , nazi germany even sought afghanistan as a potential ally in its struggle against britain , even sending a team of saboteurs to blow up bridges on the afghan-indian borders .
of course the soviets had their failed era and now it is america and its nato european allies who are embroiled in the hindu kush .
but it is much more complex than anyone dare admit and it would seem as ever , if history is anything to go by , it is the locals that will have the final say , not the outsider .

since assuming office barack obama has redefined the conflict by calling it the af-pak war . the us president 's redefinition is recognition that the taliban 's nerve center , as well as al qaeda 's safe haven , are across afghanistan 's border in neighboring pakistan .
in the forbidding tribal territories , waziristan especially , another dimension of the same fierce conflict is underway with more pakistani troops thrown into the fray than the whole of nato deploys on its side of the northwest frontier .
but unlike afghanistan where nato allows journalists free access to combat operations , the pakistani military remains media-averse and highly secretive of its own internal counter-insurgency efforts .
on the surface of things , however pakistan is nato 's and particularly washington 's staunch ally in the regional and global campaign against terror .
it 's a role for which islamabad in dire economic straits is rewarded handsomely with a massive combined us economic and military aid package it could not do without .
but as british author moni mohsin , a lifelong student of pakistan , points out " pakistan is also the only us ally america frequently bombs with drone missile strikes , which sometimes kill terrorists and just as often kill civilians . "
and while islamabad is at pains to denounce the predator missile attacks and adamantly insists it does not authorize them , mohsin told deutsche welle that there is tacit pakistani government approval for the strikes .
yet when the attacks are publicized it only helps to feed the ever present anti-american propaganda in pakistan 's right wing media " which in turn becomes a pro-talibanization as far as the public is concerned . "
anti-us sentiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , and its director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- , have been accused of stoking up tensions in afghanistan the prevalence of anti-us sentiment in popular culture is something the pakistani army and the all powerful military intelligence service , or isi , seems to thrive on and encourage although they are ostensible allies of the west , in presumably the same struggle .
the underpinning complexity of such duality is at the essence of what routine western analysis of south asia often fails to pinpoint .
at the core of this double game , is pakistan 's traditional enmity with india , the dominance of the armed forces and its spymasters in pakistan 's national and political life and a long standing rapport with the taliban and other radical groups which it has not only supported but also created in some cases .
british journalist rishaad salamat , a long time pakistani analyst and a senior economic anchor with bloomberg europe , argues that from a national security perspective " there are elements in the isi who do n't want a democratic and stable afghanistan .
a state that they perceive as being in the pocket of india and one which has irredentist claims on pakistani territory . " mohsin concurs .
" the pakistani army feels threatened by india on its right flank .
and if most countries have armies , pakistan is an army with a country and to remain in this preeminent position , the generals play up the indian threat .
but then india does have a massive presence and influence in afghanistan .
it has 26 consulates , what does afghanistan have as one of the poorest nations on earth that india needs so badly ? "
proxy war means more instability muddling things further in what seems to be an ongoing proxy war between delhi and islamabad , though they are not playing it up , there is widespread suspicion in western intelligence agencies that the isi may well have behind the recent suicide attacks and shootings in kabul aimed at the indian community there .
not surprising when the pakistani jihadist group laskhar e taiba which carried out the bloody raid on mumbai in 2008 is clearly recognized as an offspring of the isi , recruited , armed and trained by the intelligence service .
that thus far islamabad has also refused to extradite or try a single suspect among over 40 militants linked to the slaughter has only exacerbated tensions with its indian rival .
this refusal arguably brought india and pakistan to the brink of what might have become their fourth modern war since achieving independence from the british raj in 1947 .
it is also undeniable that the isi has a clear hand in supporting separatist militants in indian administered kashmir .
though it is n't all one way mischief , india continues to covertly back baluchi separatists in pakistan deeply alienated from central government , in what endures as another , albeit lower-level rebellion within islamabad 's borders .
it is also now conveniently overlooked that the taliban itself , ironically enough , was the very creation - with a lot of us funding - of both the isi and the cia , designed to act as a tool to confront moscow during the soviet war in afghanistan .
what remains more confusing is that while the pakistani army fights a costly war against the taliban in its own tribal areas , every once in a while taliban casualties in afghanistan are discovered wearing pakistani army dog tags , most of them officers on seconded , special duty .
there have also been repeated instances of taliban prisoners of war admitting that pakistani regular army officers run specialized taliban training camps .
so does it mean civil war has spread to the ranks of the pakistani military itself ?
is it a simple case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing ?
not quite .
mohsin argues that there are elements of the taliban the pakistani army and the isi do not control nor favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the isaf troops are facing an uphill battle on several different fronts " the army and isi say -lrb- to washington -rrb- look we will deal with al qaeda and the jihadists , but you have made it clear that you will withdraw sooner rather than later and we want an afghan government in which we have a say , because we live here and we 'd prefer a taliban type of government we can play ball with , " mohsin told deutsche welle .
it is a stance that angers washington but when " nato is bleeding and pakistani support is critical there is little that they can do and pakistan is going to milk it for all its worth and keep collecting the aid looking to washington to keep defusing tensions with dehli . "
history repeating itself ?
of course there are also other permutations of power geo-politics at play too .
china remains a staunch pakistani ally and military supplier because it suits china to have pakistan as a thorn in india 's side , with whom its also fought a war in the past and seeks to check its power .
israel increasingly has also emerged as key provider of military technology for india which it sees as a natural ally in the fight against islamic radicalism .
but its hard to escape the perception that the pakistani military and the isi are really the key players in the drama of the hindu kush and the larger crisis of south asia .
within pakistan itself the military 's power far exceeds that of a weak civilian government .
a massive portion of the national budget is allocated to the armed forces with no questions asked .
there is no public nor international accountability of the nature of conflict in the territories , where there may well be large scale civilian losses and human rights abuses on both sides .
and among those that dissent in pakistan , but who also oppose radicalization , the military and the isi are challenging democracy itself , pitting the judiciary against the government and using nationalist sentiment in the conservative elements of the media to keep tensions at a fever pitch .
it 's a dangerous game and last year casualties from suicide bombings in pakistan exceeded those in iraq .
bildunterschrift : foreign troops have more often than not failed in afghanistan the great game as it was once called pitted the british and russian empires against one another with afghanistan as the chosen battleground .
during world war ii , nazi germany even sought afghanistan as a potential ally in its struggle against britain , even sending a team of saboteurs to blow up bridges on the afghan-indian borders .
of course the soviets had their failed era and now it is america and its nato european allies who are embroiled in the hindu kush .
but it is much more complex than anyone dare admit and it would seem as ever , if history is anything to go by , it is the locals that will have the final say , not the outsider .

since assuming office barack obama has redefined the conflict by calling it the af-pak war . the us president 's redefinition is recognition that the taliban 's nerve center , as well as al qaeda 's safe haven , are across afghanistan 's border in neighboring pakistan .
in the forbidding tribal territories , waziristan especially , another dimension of the same fierce conflict is underway with more pakistani troops thrown into the fray than the whole of nato deploys on its side of the northwest frontier .
but unlike afghanistan where nato allows journalists free access to combat operations , the pakistani military remains media-averse and highly secretive of its own internal counter-insurgency efforts .
on the surface of things , however pakistan is nato 's and particularly washington 's staunch ally in the regional and global campaign against terror .
it 's a role for which islamabad in dire economic straits is rewarded handsomely with a massive combined us economic and military aid package it could not do without .
but as british author moni mohsin , a lifelong student of pakistan , points out " pakistan is also the only us ally america frequently bombs with drone missile strikes , which sometimes kill terrorists and just as often kill civilians . "
and while islamabad is at pains to denounce the predator missile attacks and adamantly insists it does not authorize them , mohsin told deutsche welle that there is tacit pakistani government approval for the strikes .
yet when the attacks are publicized it only helps to feed the ever present anti-american propaganda in pakistan 's right wing media " which in turn becomes a pro-talibanization as far as the public is concerned . "
anti-us sentiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , and its director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- , have been accused of stoking up tensions in afghanistan the prevalence of anti-us sentiment in popular culture is something the pakistani army and the all powerful military intelligence service , or isi , seems to thrive on and encourage although they are ostensible allies of the west , in presumably the same struggle .
the underpinning complexity of such duality is at the essence of what routine western analysis of south asia often fails to pinpoint .
at the core of this double game , is pakistan 's traditional enmity with india , the dominance of the armed forces and its spymasters in pakistan 's national and political life and a long standing rapport with the taliban and other radical groups which it has not only supported but also created in some cases .
british journalist rishaad salamat , a long time pakistani analyst and a senior economic anchor with bloomberg europe , argues that from a national security perspective " there are elements in the isi who do n't want a democratic and stable afghanistan .
a state that they perceive as being in the pocket of india and one which has irredentist claims on pakistani territory . " mohsin concurs .
" the pakistani army feels threatened by india on its right flank .
and if most countries have armies , pakistan is an army with a country and to remain in this preeminent position , the generals play up the indian threat .
but then india does have a massive presence and influence in afghanistan .
it has 26 consulates , what does afghanistan have as one of the poorest nations on earth that india needs so badly ? "
proxy war means more instability muddling things further in what seems to be an ongoing proxy war between delhi and islamabad , though they are not playing it up , there is widespread suspicion in western intelligence agencies that the isi may well have behind the recent suicide attacks and shootings in kabul aimed at the indian community there .
not surprising when the pakistani jihadist group laskhar e taiba which carried out the bloody raid on mumbai in 2008 is clearly recognized as an offspring of the isi , recruited , armed and trained by the intelligence service .
that thus far islamabad has also refused to extradite or try a single suspect among over 40 militants linked to the slaughter has only exacerbated tensions with its indian rival .
this refusal arguably brought india and pakistan to the brink of what might have become their fourth modern war since achieving independence from the british raj in 1947 .
it is also undeniable that the isi has a clear hand in supporting separatist militants in indian administered kashmir .
though it is n't all one way mischief , india continues to covertly back baluchi separatists in pakistan deeply alienated from central government , in what endures as another , albeit lower-level rebellion within islamabad 's borders .
it is also now conveniently overlooked that the taliban itself , ironically enough , was the very creation - with a lot of us funding - of both the isi and the cia , designed to act as a tool to confront moscow during the soviet war in afghanistan .
what remains more confusing is that while the pakistani army fights a costly war against the taliban in its own tribal areas , every once in a while taliban casualties in afghanistan are discovered wearing pakistani army dog tags , most of them officers on seconded , special duty .
there have also been repeated instances of taliban prisoners of war admitting that pakistani regular army officers run specialized taliban training camps .
so does it mean civil war has spread to the ranks of the pakistani military itself ?
is it a simple case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing ?
not quite .
mohsin argues that there are elements of the taliban the pakistani army and the isi do not control nor favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the isaf troops are facing an uphill battle on several different fronts " the army and isi say -lrb- to washington -rrb- look we will deal with al qaeda and the jihadists , but you have made it clear that you will withdraw sooner rather than later and we want an afghan government in which we have a say , because we live here and we 'd prefer a taliban type of government we can play ball with , " mohsin told deutsche welle .
it is a stance that angers washington but when " nato is bleeding and pakistani support is critical there is little that they can do and pakistan is going to milk it for all its worth and keep collecting the aid looking to washington to keep defusing tensions with dehli . "
history repeating itself ?
of course there are also other permutations of power geo-politics at play too .
china remains a staunch pakistani ally and military supplier because it suits china to have pakistan as a thorn in india 's side , with whom its also fought a war in the past and seeks to check its power .
israel increasingly has also emerged as key provider of military technology for india which it sees as a natural ally in the fight against islamic radicalism .
but its hard to escape the perception that the pakistani military and the isi are really the key players in the drama of the hindu kush and the larger crisis of south asia .
within pakistan itself the military 's power far exceeds that of a weak civilian government .
a massive portion of the national budget is allocated to the armed forces with no questions asked .
there is no public nor international accountability of the nature of conflict in the territories , where there may well be large scale civilian losses and human rights abuses on both sides .

but its hard to escape the perception that the pakistani military and the isi are really the key players in the drama of the hindu kush and the larger crisis of south asia .
within pakistan itself the military 's power far exceeds that of a weak civilian government .
a massive portion of the national budget is allocated to the armed forces with no questions asked .
there is no public nor international accountability of the nature of conflict in the territories , where there may well be large scale civilian losses and human rights abuses on both sides .
and among those that dissent in pakistan , but who also oppose radicalization , the military and the isi are challenging democracy itself , pitting the judiciary against the government and using nationalist sentiment in the conservative elements of the media to keep tensions at a fever pitch .

during world war ii , nazi germany even sought afghanistan as a potential ally in its struggle against britain , even sending a team of saboteurs to blow up bridges on the afghan-indian borders .
of course the soviets had their failed era and now it is america and its nato european allies who are embroiled in the hindu kush .

since assuming office barack obama has redefined the conflict by calling it the af-pak war . the us president 's redefinition is recognition that the taliban 's nerve center , as well as al qaeda 's safe haven , are across afghanistan 's border in neighboring pakistan .
in the forbidding tribal territories , waziristan especially , another dimension of the same fierce conflict is underway with more pakistani troops thrown into the fray than the whole of nato deploys on its side of the northwest frontier .
but unlike afghanistan where nato allows journalists free access to combat operations , the pakistani military remains media-averse and highly secretive of its own internal counter-insurgency efforts .
on the surface of things , however pakistan is nato 's and particularly washington 's staunch ally in the regional and global campaign against terror .
it 's a role for which islamabad in dire economic straits is rewarded handsomely with a massive combined us economic and military aid package it could not do without .
but as british author moni mohsin , a lifelong student of pakistan , points out " pakistan is also the only us ally america frequently bombs with drone missile strikes , which sometimes kill terrorists and just as often kill civilians . "
and while islamabad is at pains to denounce the predator missile attacks and adamantly insists it does not authorize them , mohsin told deutsche welle that there is tacit pakistani government approval for the strikes .
yet when the attacks are publicized it only helps to feed the ever present anti-american propaganda in pakistan 's right wing media " which in turn becomes a pro-talibanization as far as the public is concerned . "
anti-us sentiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , and its director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- , have been accused of stoking up tensions in afghanistan the prevalence of anti-us sentiment in popular culture is something the pakistani army and the all powerful military intelligence service , or isi , seems to thrive on and encourage although they are ostensible allies of the west , in presumably the same struggle .
the underpinning complexity of such duality is at the essence of what routine western analysis of south asia often fails to pinpoint .
at the core of this double game , is pakistan 's traditional enmity with india , the dominance of the armed forces and its spymasters in pakistan 's national and political life and a long standing rapport with the taliban and other radical groups which it has not only supported but also created in some cases .
british journalist rishaad salamat , a long time pakistani analyst and a senior economic anchor with bloomberg europe , argues that from a national security perspective " there are elements in the isi who do n't want a democratic and stable afghanistan .
a state that they perceive as being in the pocket of india and one which has irredentist claims on pakistani territory . " mohsin concurs .
" the pakistani army feels threatened by india on its right flank .
and if most countries have armies , pakistan is an army with a country and to remain in this preeminent position , the generals play up the indian threat .
but then india does have a massive presence and influence in afghanistan .
it has 26 consulates , what does afghanistan have as one of the poorest nations on earth that india needs so badly ? "
proxy war means more instability muddling things further in what seems to be an ongoing proxy war between delhi and islamabad , though they are not playing it up , there is widespread suspicion in western intelligence agencies that the isi may well have behind the recent suicide attacks and shootings in kabul aimed at the indian community there .
not surprising when the pakistani jihadist group laskhar e taiba which carried out the bloody raid on mumbai in 2008 is clearly recognized as an offspring of the isi , recruited , armed and trained by the intelligence service .
that thus far islamabad has also refused to extradite or try a single suspect among over 40 militants linked to the slaughter has only exacerbated tensions with its indian rival .
this refusal arguably brought india and pakistan to the brink of what might have become their fourth modern war since achieving independence from the british raj in 1947 .
it is also undeniable that the isi has a clear hand in supporting separatist militants in indian administered kashmir .
though it is n't all one way mischief , india continues to covertly back baluchi separatists in pakistan deeply alienated from central government , in what endures as another , albeit lower-level rebellion within islamabad 's borders .
it is also now conveniently overlooked that the taliban itself , ironically enough , was the very creation - with a lot of us funding - of both the isi and the cia , designed to act as a tool to confront moscow during the soviet war in afghanistan .
what remains more confusing is that while the pakistani army fights a costly war against the taliban in its own tribal areas , every once in a while taliban casualties in afghanistan are discovered wearing pakistani army dog tags , most of them officers on seconded , special duty .
there have also been repeated instances of taliban prisoners of war admitting that pakistani regular army officers run specialized taliban training camps .
so does it mean civil war has spread to the ranks of the pakistani military itself ?
is it a simple case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing ?
not quite .
mohsin argues that there are elements of the taliban the pakistani army and the isi do not control nor favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the isaf troops are facing an uphill battle on several different fronts " the army and isi say -lrb- to washington -rrb- look we will deal with al qaeda and the jihadists , but you have made it clear that you will withdraw sooner rather than later and we want an afghan government in which we have a say , because we live here and we 'd prefer a taliban type of government we can play ball with , " mohsin told deutsche welle .
it is a stance that angers washington but when " nato is bleeding and pakistani support is critical there is little that they can do and pakistan is going to milk it for all its worth and keep collecting the aid looking to washington to keep defusing tensions with dehli . "
history repeating itself ?
of course there are also other permutations of power geo-politics at play too .
china remains a staunch pakistani ally and military supplier because it suits china to have pakistan as a thorn in india 's side , with whom its also fought a war in the past and seeks to check its power .
israel increasingly has also emerged as key provider of military technology for india which it sees as a natural ally in the fight against islamic radicalism .

it is a stance that angers washington but when " nato is bleeding and pakistani support is critical there is little that they can do and pakistan is going to milk it for all its worth and keep collecting the aid looking to washington to keep defusing tensions with dehli . "
history repeating itself ?
of course there are also other permutations of power geo-politics at play too .
china remains a staunch pakistani ally and military supplier because it suits china to have pakistan as a thorn in india 's side , with whom its also fought a war in the past and seeks to check its power .
israel increasingly has also emerged as key provider of military technology for india which it sees as a natural ally in the fight against islamic radicalism .
but its hard to escape the perception that the pakistani military and the isi are really the key players in the drama of the hindu kush and the larger crisis of south asia .
within pakistan itself the military 's power far exceeds that of a weak civilian government .
a massive portion of the national budget is allocated to the armed forces with no questions asked .
there is no public nor international accountability of the nature of conflict in the territories , where there may well be large scale civilian losses and human rights abuses on both sides .
and among those that dissent in pakistan , but who also oppose radicalization , the military and the isi are challenging democracy itself , pitting the judiciary against the government and using nationalist sentiment in the conservative elements of the media to keep tensions at a fever pitch .
it 's a dangerous game and last year casualties from suicide bombings in pakistan exceeded those in iraq .
bildunterschrift : foreign troops have more often than not failed in afghanistan the great game as it was once called pitted the british and russian empires against one another with afghanistan as the chosen battleground .
during world war ii , nazi germany even sought afghanistan as a potential ally in its struggle against britain , even sending a team of saboteurs to blow up bridges on the afghan-indian borders .
of course the soviets had their failed era and now it is america and its nato european allies who are embroiled in the hindu kush .
but it is much more complex than anyone dare admit and it would seem as ever , if history is anything to go by , it is the locals that will have the final say , not the outsider .

since assuming office barack obama has redefined the conflict by calling it the af-pak war . the us president 's redefinition is recognition that the taliban 's nerve center , as well as al qaeda 's safe haven , are across afghanistan 's border in neighboring pakistan .
in the forbidding tribal territories , waziristan especially , another dimension of the same fierce conflict is underway with more pakistani troops thrown into the fray than the whole of nato deploys on its side of the northwest frontier .
but unlike afghanistan where nato allows journalists free access to combat operations , the pakistani military remains media-averse and highly secretive of its own internal counter-insurgency efforts .
on the surface of things , however pakistan is nato 's and particularly washington 's staunch ally in the regional and global campaign against terror .
it 's a role for which islamabad in dire economic straits is rewarded handsomely with a massive combined us economic and military aid package it could not do without .
but as british author moni mohsin , a lifelong student of pakistan , points out " pakistan is also the only us ally america frequently bombs with drone missile strikes , which sometimes kill terrorists and just as often kill civilians . "
and while islamabad is at pains to denounce the predator missile attacks and adamantly insists it does not authorize them , mohsin told deutsche welle that there is tacit pakistani government approval for the strikes .
yet when the attacks are publicized it only helps to feed the ever present anti-american propaganda in pakistan 's right wing media " which in turn becomes a pro-talibanization as far as the public is concerned . "
anti-us sentiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , and its director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- , have been accused of stoking up tensions in afghanistan the prevalence of anti-us sentiment in popular culture is something the pakistani army and the all powerful military intelligence service , or isi , seems to thrive on and encourage although they are ostensible allies of the west , in presumably the same struggle .
the underpinning complexity of such duality is at the essence of what routine western analysis of south asia often fails to pinpoint .
at the core of this double game , is pakistan 's traditional enmity with india , the dominance of the armed forces and its spymasters in pakistan 's national and political life and a long standing rapport with the taliban and other radical groups which it has not only supported but also created in some cases .
british journalist rishaad salamat , a long time pakistani analyst and a senior economic anchor with bloomberg europe , argues that from a national security perspective " there are elements in the isi who do n't want a democratic and stable afghanistan .
a state that they perceive as being in the pocket of india and one which has irredentist claims on pakistani territory . " mohsin concurs .
" the pakistani army feels threatened by india on its right flank .
and if most countries have armies , pakistan is an army with a country and to remain in this preeminent position , the generals play up the indian threat .
but then india does have a massive presence and influence in afghanistan .
it has 26 consulates , what does afghanistan have as one of the poorest nations on earth that india needs so badly ? "
proxy war means more instability muddling things further in what seems to be an ongoing proxy war between delhi and islamabad , though they are not playing it up , there is widespread suspicion in western intelligence agencies that the isi may well have behind the recent suicide attacks and shootings in kabul aimed at the indian community there .
not surprising when the pakistani jihadist group laskhar e taiba which carried out the bloody raid on mumbai in 2008 is clearly recognized as an offspring of the isi , recruited , armed and trained by the intelligence service .
that thus far islamabad has also refused to extradite or try a single suspect among over 40 militants linked to the slaughter has only exacerbated tensions with its indian rival .
this refusal arguably brought india and pakistan to the brink of what might have become their fourth modern war since achieving independence from the british raj in 1947 .
it is also undeniable that the isi has a clear hand in supporting separatist militants in indian administered kashmir .
though it is n't all one way mischief , india continues to covertly back baluchi separatists in pakistan deeply alienated from central government , in what endures as another , albeit lower-level rebellion within islamabad 's borders .
it is also now conveniently overlooked that the taliban itself , ironically enough , was the very creation - with a lot of us funding - of both the isi and the cia , designed to act as a tool to confront moscow during the soviet war in afghanistan .
what remains more confusing is that while the pakistani army fights a costly war against the taliban in its own tribal areas , every once in a while taliban casualties in afghanistan are discovered wearing pakistani army dog tags , most of them officers on seconded , special duty .
there have also been repeated instances of taliban prisoners of war admitting that pakistani regular army officers run specialized taliban training camps .
so does it mean civil war has spread to the ranks of the pakistani military itself ?
is it a simple case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing ?
not quite .
mohsin argues that there are elements of the taliban the pakistani army and the isi do not control nor favor .

it is also now conveniently overlooked that the taliban itself , ironically enough , was the very creation - with a lot of us funding - of both the isi and the cia , designed to act as a tool to confront moscow during the soviet war in afghanistan .
what remains more confusing is that while the pakistani army fights a costly war against the taliban in its own tribal areas , every once in a while taliban casualties in afghanistan are discovered wearing pakistani army dog tags , most of them officers on seconded , special duty .
there have also been repeated instances of taliban prisoners of war admitting that pakistani regular army officers run specialized taliban training camps .
so does it mean civil war has spread to the ranks of the pakistani military itself ?
is it a simple case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing ?
not quite .
mohsin argues that there are elements of the taliban the pakistani army and the isi do not control nor favor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato and the isaf troops are facing an uphill battle on several different fronts " the army and isi say -lrb- to washington -rrb- look we will deal with al qaeda and the jihadists , but you have made it clear that you will withdraw sooner rather than later and we want an afghan government in which we have a say , because we live here and we 'd prefer a taliban type of government we can play ball with , " mohsin told deutsche welle .
it is a stance that angers washington but when " nato is bleeding and pakistani support is critical there is little that they can do and pakistan is going to milk it for all its worth and keep collecting the aid looking to washington to keep defusing tensions with dehli . "
history repeating itself ?
of course there are also other permutations of power geo-politics at play too .
china remains a staunch pakistani ally and military supplier because it suits china to have pakistan as a thorn in india 's side , with whom its also fought a war in the past and seeks to check its power .
israel increasingly has also emerged as key provider of military technology for india which it sees as a natural ally in the fight against islamic radicalism .
but its hard to escape the perception that the pakistani military and the isi are really the key players in the drama of the hindu kush and the larger crisis of south asia .
within pakistan itself the military 's power far exceeds that of a weak civilian government .
a massive portion of the national budget is allocated to the armed forces with no questions asked .
there is no public nor international accountability of the nature of conflict in the territories , where there may well be large scale civilian losses and human rights abuses on both sides .
and among those that dissent in pakistan , but who also oppose radicalization , the military and the isi are challenging democracy itself , pitting the judiciary against the government and using nationalist sentiment in the conservative elements of the media to keep tensions at a fever pitch .
it 's a dangerous game and last year casualties from suicide bombings in pakistan exceeded those in iraq .
bildunterschrift : foreign troops have more often than not failed in afghanistan the great game as it was once called pitted the british and russian empires against one another with afghanistan as the chosen battleground .
during world war ii , nazi germany even sought afghanistan as a potential ally in its struggle against britain , even sending a team of saboteurs to blow up bridges on the afghan-indian borders .
of course the soviets had their failed era and now it is america and its nato european allies who are embroiled in the hindu kush .
but it is much more complex than anyone dare admit and it would seem as ever , if history is anything to go by , it is the locals that will have the final say , not the outsider .

since assuming office barack obama has redefined the conflict by calling it the af-pak war . the us president 's redefinition is recognition that the taliban 's nerve center , as well as al qaeda 's safe haven , are across afghanistan 's border in neighboring pakistan .
in the forbidding tribal territories , waziristan especially , another dimension of the same fierce conflict is underway with more pakistani troops thrown into the fray than the whole of nato deploys on its side of the northwest frontier .
but unlike afghanistan where nato allows journalists free access to combat operations , the pakistani military remains media-averse and highly secretive of its own internal counter-insurgency efforts .
on the surface of things , however pakistan is nato 's and particularly washington 's staunch ally in the regional and global campaign against terror .
it 's a role for which islamabad in dire economic straits is rewarded handsomely with a massive combined us economic and military aid package it could not do without .
but as british author moni mohsin , a lifelong student of pakistan , points out " pakistan is also the only us ally america frequently bombs with drone missile strikes , which sometimes kill terrorists and just as often kill civilians . "
and while islamabad is at pains to denounce the predator missile attacks and adamantly insists it does not authorize them , mohsin told deutsche welle that there is tacit pakistani government approval for the strikes .
yet when the attacks are publicized it only helps to feed the ever present anti-american propaganda in pakistan 's right wing media " which in turn becomes a pro-talibanization as far as the public is concerned . "
anti-us sentiment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , and its director general lt. general ahmed shuja pasha -lrb- r -rrb- , have been accused of stoking up tensions in afghanistan the prevalence of anti-us sentiment in popular culture is something the pakistani army and the all powerful military intelligence service , or isi , seems to thrive on and encourage although they are ostensible allies of the west , in presumably the same struggle .
the underpinning complexity of such duality is at the essence of what routine western analysis of south asia often fails to pinpoint .
at the core of this double game , is pakistan 's traditional enmity with india , the dominance of the armed forces and its spymasters in pakistan 's national and political life and a long standing rapport with the taliban and other radical groups which it has not only supported but also created in some cases .
british journalist rishaad salamat , a long time pakistani analyst and a senior economic anchor with bloomberg europe , argues that from a national security perspective " there are elements in the isi who do n't want a democratic and stable afghanistan .
a state that they perceive as being in the pocket of india and one which has irredentist claims on pakistani territory . " mohsin concurs .
" the pakistani army feels threatened by india on its right flank .
and if most countries have armies , pakistan is an army with a country and to remain in this preeminent position , the generals play up the indian threat .
but then india does have a massive presence and influence in afghanistan .
it has 26 consulates , what does afghanistan have as one of the poorest nations on earth that india needs so badly ? "
proxy war means more instability muddling things further in what seems to be an ongoing proxy war between delhi and islamabad , though they are not playing it up , there is widespread suspicion in western intelligence agencies that the isi may well have behind the recent suicide attacks and shootings in kabul aimed at the indian community there .
not surprising when the pakistani jihadist group laskhar e taiba which carried out the bloody raid on mumbai in 2008 is clearly recognized as an offspring of the isi , recruited , armed and trained by the intelligence service .
that thus far islamabad has also refused to extradite or try a single suspect among over 40 militants linked to the slaughter has only exacerbated tensions with its indian rival .
this refusal arguably brought india and pakistan to the brink of what might have become their fourth modern war since achieving independence from the british raj in 1947 .
it is also undeniable that the isi has a clear hand in supporting separatist militants in indian administered kashmir .
though it is n't all one way mischief , india continues to covertly back baluchi separatists in pakistan deeply alienated from central government , in what endures as another , albeit lower-level rebellion within islamabad 's borders .
it is also now conveniently overlooked that the taliban itself , ironically enough , was the very creation - with a lot of us funding - of both the isi and the cia , designed to act as a tool to confront moscow during the soviet war in afghanistan .

salomon korn demanded that the plight of germans who fled poland be linked to nazi war crimes . the representative of germany 's jews on the board of a controversial museum for german world war ii refugees has threatened to stand down in a row over its content .
in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine , the vice president of the central council of jews , salomon korn , urged a shift in emphasis in plans for the museum , which is being overseen by the foundation for flight , expulsion and reconciliation .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn said he was not prepared to play a ' token role ' korn , a member of the foundation 's board , said that exhibits to depict the suffering of germans must be set in context with wartime outrages committed by the nazis .

neumann added that the questions about bdv members ' pasts were outside the scope of the foundation 's work. rc / epd / apn / dpa editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
