meanwhile , members of the african bloc of nations have threatened to remove him by force . the validity of laurent gbagbo 's claim to the office of president of ivory coast took another hit on wednesday , when the french foreign ministry announced that eu nations would recognize only representatives selected by his rival , alassane ouattara . the decision was reached among eu heads of state meeting in brussels , a french foreign ministry spokesman said . following presidential elections in november , ouattara was recognized as the rightful winner by the united nations , the european union , the african union and the united states , but incumbent president laurent gbagbo has so far refused to step down .
the dispute has boiled over into violent clashes , and around 200 people have been killed .
on wednesday , west african leaders met in nigeria to plan their next steps aimed at persuading ivory coast president laurent gbagbo to step down , after their first attempt failed . the presidents of three countries - benin 's boni yayi , sierra leone 's ernest bai koroma and pedro pires of cape verde - traveled to ivory coast on tuesday with a message for defiant president gbagbo : step down from office , or be removed . the presidents , delegates of the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- , planned to return to abidjan " next week " to resume their efforts , the president 's office in cape verde announced wednesday . military intervention ecowas had said last friday that if gbagbo did n't give up the presidency of ivory coast to alassane ouattara , he would face military intervention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a fear of escalating violence in ivory coast after arriving tuesday in abidjan , the ecowas trio first met with the head of the united nations mission in ivory coast , and later met with gbagbo at the presidential palace . " they told the former president laurent gbagbo that ...
alassane outtara 's status as president of the republic is non-negotiable , " outtara 's spokesman patrick achi told reporters tuesday . " the matter now is to negotiate the conditions for the departure of -lsb- the -rsb- former president , " achi added . after meeting with both gbagbo and ouattara , the three delegates flew late on tuesday to abuja , where they were set to meet with the chairman of ecowas , nigerian president goodluck jonathan . nigeria is the largest economic and military power in the 15-nation ecowas bloc and could be expected to take a leading role in any military action taken to oust gbagbo and install outtara . on tuesday , abidjan saw renewed unrest as a mob in a pro-gbagbo neighborhood attacked a convoy of three vehicles carrying united nations peacekeepers .
the mob injured one soldier with a machete and burned one of the convoy 's vehicles , the un said in a statement . the un human rights council says about 14,000 refugees have fled ivory coast to neighboring liberia over fears of renewed civil war . influential in west africa even before tuesday 's meeting , gbagbo responded to the threat of military force from ecowas by saying it would push ivory coast closer to civil war , and added that there would be consequences for countries that got involved . " he was clearly sending a warning to his neighbors , " paul-simon handy from the institute for strategic studies in south africa told deutsche welle .
" particularly to the leaders of the neighboring countries , saying any involvement in that war will have an impact on your own country . " a military conflict in the ivory coast could have serious consequences for the region .
handy says the country 's size and economic importance make it a key state in west africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biofuels -pipe- 28.12.2010 new biofuel standard coming to german pumps großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new , higher ethanol biofuel is coming in january higher ethanol content biofuel is being introduced for german drivers .
but critics say the intiative may see higher prices at the pump and cause damage to the environment . as of january 1 , 2011 , german drivers will have the option to fuel up their cars with new super e10 , a biofuel with higher ethanol content .
the change is part of germany 's plan to incrementally decrease its carbon emissions , with the goal of an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
but for everyday german drivers , the cost of the new biofuel is still a relative unknown , and the subject of much speculation .
previously , biofuel in germany only had five percent ethanol content , whereas e10 packs a solid 10 percent ethanol , an increase that should prove more environmentally friendly .
the federal ministry for the environment , nature conservation and nuclear safety -lrb- bmu -rrb- estimates that around 90 percent of existing german cars will be e10-compatible .
those vehicles unable to run on e10 can keep using the five percent variety until it is phased out in 2013 .
e10 will be available from the more than 14,000 service stations throughout the country as of the first of the year .
according to the bmu , the higher ethanol gasoline will have a decreased impact on the environment in terms of carbon emissions and will reduce consumer reliance on diminishing oil reserves .
the initiative is also designed to bring germany into compliance with a european commission directive seeking an eu-wide greenhouse gas emission savings of 60 percent from 2018 onwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while they disagree on how much , most parties say e10 will cost more than regular gas more ethanol means more cost the cost to the consumer is one contentious issue that is being batted around between the various groups interested in the project .
as the cost of producing ethanol biofuel is higher than regular gasoline , the bmu expects the price at the pump to increase slightly as well .
" with the introduction of e10 come additional costs for the production of bioethanol and the maintenance of fuel quality , " the ministry said .
but the german association for the biofuel industry contended that prices will not increase significantly .
" ethanol will not be much more expensive than gasoline , " association president claus sauter told press agency dpa .
" in addition , the petroleum industry itself is interested in selling e10 , because it is legally obliged to bring biofuels to market . "
on the other side of the issue , the spokesman for bp europe told bonn 's general anzeiger newspaper , " for drivers , the price will always be higher , " estimating an increased cost of 50 percent over normal petrol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as food crops are replaced by biofuel production , the cost in carbon increases cost to the environment another bone of contention is the actual environmental impact of the new biofuel due to something called indirect land use .
this is essentially the consequence of changing the use of land in order to produce crops used in biofuel production .
as more arable land is used to produce biofuel , the increased land clearance to grow food crops has the knock-on effect of higher carbon emissions .
originally , the commission had anticipated enacting its directive 98/70 / ec , requiring member states to report on the greenhouse gas intensity of fuel and energy , starting on january 1 , 2011 .
according to the directive , suppliers are required to gradually reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent by the end of 2020 at the latest .
but shortly before the january kick-off date for the initiative , the european commission published a report on indirect land use change related to biofuels .
it found that the ramifications of indirect land use required more investigation before it could proceed with the directive .
" the potential effects of indirect land use need to be properly weighed in our biofuels policy .
it is in our interest to investigate this seriously and ensure legislation that avoids negative side effects , " energy commissioner guenther oettinger said .

but critics say the intiative may see higher prices at the pump and cause damage to the environment . as of january 1 , 2011 , german drivers will have the option to fuel up their cars with new super e10 , a biofuel with higher ethanol content .
the change is part of germany 's plan to incrementally decrease its carbon emissions , with the goal of an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
but for everyday german drivers , the cost of the new biofuel is still a relative unknown , and the subject of much speculation .
previously , biofuel in germany only had five percent ethanol content , whereas e10 packs a solid 10 percent ethanol , an increase that should prove more environmentally friendly .
the federal ministry for the environment , nature conservation and nuclear safety -lrb- bmu -rrb- estimates that around 90 percent of existing german cars will be e10-compatible .
those vehicles unable to run on e10 can keep using the five percent variety until it is phased out in 2013 .
e10 will be available from the more than 14,000 service stations throughout the country as of the first of the year .
according to the bmu , the higher ethanol gasoline will have a decreased impact on the environment in terms of carbon emissions and will reduce consumer reliance on diminishing oil reserves .
the initiative is also designed to bring germany into compliance with a european commission directive seeking an eu-wide greenhouse gas emission savings of 60 percent from 2018 onwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while they disagree on how much , most parties say e10 will cost more than regular gas more ethanol means more cost the cost to the consumer is one contentious issue that is being batted around between the various groups interested in the project .
as the cost of producing ethanol biofuel is higher than regular gasoline , the bmu expects the price at the pump to increase slightly as well .
" with the introduction of e10 come additional costs for the production of bioethanol and the maintenance of fuel quality , " the ministry said .
but the german association for the biofuel industry contended that prices will not increase significantly .
" ethanol will not be much more expensive than gasoline , " association president claus sauter told press agency dpa .
" in addition , the petroleum industry itself is interested in selling e10 , because it is legally obliged to bring biofuels to market . "
on the other side of the issue , the spokesman for bp europe told bonn 's general anzeiger newspaper , " for drivers , the price will always be higher , " estimating an increased cost of 50 percent over normal petrol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as food crops are replaced by biofuel production , the cost in carbon increases cost to the environment another bone of contention is the actual environmental impact of the new biofuel due to something called indirect land use .
this is essentially the consequence of changing the use of land in order to produce crops used in biofuel production .
as more arable land is used to produce biofuel , the increased land clearance to grow food crops has the knock-on effect of higher carbon emissions .
originally , the commission had anticipated enacting its directive 98/70 / ec , requiring member states to report on the greenhouse gas intensity of fuel and energy , starting on january 1 , 2011 .
according to the directive , suppliers are required to gradually reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent by the end of 2020 at the latest .
but shortly before the january kick-off date for the initiative , the european commission published a report on indirect land use change related to biofuels .
it found that the ramifications of indirect land use required more investigation before it could proceed with the directive .
" the potential effects of indirect land use need to be properly weighed in our biofuels policy .
it is in our interest to investigate this seriously and ensure legislation that avoids negative side effects , " energy commissioner guenther oettinger said .
the result of its findings led the commission to delay its biofuel directive until july of 2011 .

in 1806 , hegel described him as an iconic " world-soul , " and even his enemies could not quite shake off the fascination for the emperor who at first seemed to be invincible .
but poets and artists of his time also portrayed napoleon as a heartless warmonger , a ridiculous caricature , and even as satan 's eldest son .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show examines the emperor from various angles in " napoleon and europe , dream and trauma " the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany takes on napoleon in the context of his time .
the exhibition gives visitors with a critical and multifaceted look at a challenging topic .
the historic exhibition was done in cooperation with the musee de l 'armee in paris , where it will be shown in the spring of 2012 .
it will be the first comprehensive exhibition about napoleon in france for over 40 years .
" up to now in france , it 's been quite impossible to have a reasonable point of view about napoleon , " robert bresse , director of the musee de l 'armee , told deutsche welle .
" so , it 's really important to have an exhibition in paris that was built outside of france . "
master of propaganda as one of the exhibition 's 12 chapters illuminates , napoleon was a master of image cultivation and propaganda through artworks such as busts and paintings .
and napoleon 's image continues to be influenced by propaganda , the exhibit 's curator says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : napoleon 's myth lives on in marlon brando 's mantle from the movie desiree " part of the exhibition is the coronation mantle marlon brando wore when he played napoleon , revealing how much the official iconography of napoleon 's time has been passed on by film history and our popular culture , " said benedicte savoy , curator of the exhibition .
and , of course , there were napoleon 's wars .
his ambitious plans to unify europe under his command resulted in strategic triumphs , such as the battle of the three emperors in 1805 .
but they also led to his disastrous defeat and eventual downfall after the battle of waterloo in 1815 .
a generation of veterans other exhibitions have dealt thoroughly with the millions of victims who were killed in the napoleonic wars .
but ' napoleon and europe ' takes a closer look at the survivors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a living example of napoleon 's soldiers at the museum in bonn " nobody thinks of those who were wounded , " angelica francke , director of the exhibition , told deutsche welle .
" but those people , the veterans , were present in the streets for decades after napoleon was exiled .
so we dedicate a part of the exhibition to them . "
napoleon 's influence remains a part of europe up to the present day .
the exhibit shows how he implemented new standards like the metric system , connected european cities through a system of roads and telegraph lines , and , of course , introduced the napoleonic code , the civil rights opus still applied in france .
napoleon 's controversial impact on europe but napoleon 's impact on the face of europe was dark as well .
one part of the exhibit focuses one the theft of artworks from archives and museums of the conquered regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the young emperor : napoleon age 27 however , even this systematic theft has more than one side to it , according to erich pelzer , a historian at the university of mannheim .
" napoleon is never one-dimensional , he 's always controversial , " pelzer told deutsche welle .
" many artworks that could n't be stored in the louvre were redistributed to other european cities , helping a new ' europe of culture ' to emerge .
in fact , the theft of archives reflects a core phenomenon of napoleon : he creates something new without changing the actual substance , " pelzer said . napoleon 's impact on europe remains as controversial as napoleon himself .
and by taking a pan-european approach to its subject , the exhibition " napoleon and europe " offers a variety of new insights .

the most recent is pirateleaks.cz , launched by the czech pirate party . in the aftermath of the latest releases of information of secret documents by the infamous wikileaks , a crop of clones have popped up in europe .
one has been seeded by ex-wikileaks staffers , others were simply inspired by the original , but all of them want to make a difference .
wikileaks clones include the forthcoming openleaks in germany , with former wikileaks staffer , daniel domscheit-berg at the helm .
openleaks aims to democratize the process of leaking information and whistle-blowing and support the introduction of new legislation defending the rights of whistle-blowers .
other such websites include brusselsleaks.com , balkanleaks.eu , rospil.info and indoleaks.org , each hoping to blow the lid on corruption and secret documents in the european union , the balkans , russia and indonesia respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other sites , such as openleaks in germany plan to tackle transparency pirates of the czech republic in a café in prague , the public face of another secret whistle-blowing website demonstrated such a product to deutsche welle .
the czech pirate party announced earlier this month that it had created a new secret-leaking site called pirateleaks and it aims to do the same thing as wikileaks , only focusing in the czech republic .
the aim of the site is to encourage transparency in czech government .
" our sources are people who work with documents in the authorities , are journalists who are afraid to publish these documents because of political reasons , and are simply members of the public , " spokesman jakub michalek said .
the creators of pirateleaks will be hoping all those sources supply them with evidence of corruption .
the small amount of information released since this week 's launch has n't exactly rocked the czech political establishment – though the site has ruffled a few feathers , michalek added .
" the politicians are afraid to say that this is a bad thing , because we are working exactly in accordance with the law , " he said . " but on the other side there were also reactions like , ' this is outrageous , this should be banned , the site should be closed immediately . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirateleaks.cz wants to fight corruption within czech government members of the media who have been reporting on corruption within the czech republic welcomed the new site .
" i think it 's very good that we have another source of information , one that is setting as its goal finding documents that are normally not available , " prague-based journalist erik best told deutsche welle .
" and i think with the impetus , with the excitement in the west and all over the world with wikileaks , that connection is going to be a big benefit for the site . "
data protection in sweden pirateleaks next goal is to locate its servers in sweden , with either a fellow pirate organization or prq , the same hosting service that maintains wikileaks ' servers there .
prq prides itself on requiring hardly any personal information from its clients .
" we would like to move to sweden or a different place that is much safer , as soon as possible , " michalek said .
" because the services that we can get in sweden with a pirate isp , or the prq company , are much better , we can get a safer connection .
things can be with more anonymity than we can get here in the czech republic . "

the most recent is pirateleaks.cz , launched by the czech pirate party . in the aftermath of the latest releases of information of secret documents by the infamous wikileaks , a crop of clones have popped up in europe .
one has been seeded by ex-wikileaks staffers , others were simply inspired by the original , but all of them want to make a difference .
wikileaks clones include the forthcoming openleaks in germany , with former wikileaks staffer , daniel domscheit-berg at the helm .
openleaks aims to democratize the process of leaking information and whistle-blowing and support the introduction of new legislation defending the rights of whistle-blowers .
other such websites include brusselsleaks.com , balkanleaks.eu , rospil.info and indoleaks.org , each hoping to blow the lid on corruption and secret documents in the european union , the balkans , russia and indonesia respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other sites , such as openleaks in germany plan to tackle transparency pirates of the czech republic in a café in prague , the public face of another secret whistle-blowing website demonstrated such a product to deutsche welle .
the czech pirate party announced earlier this month that it had created a new secret-leaking site called pirateleaks and it aims to do the same thing as wikileaks , only focusing in the czech republic .
the aim of the site is to encourage transparency in czech government .
" our sources are people who work with documents in the authorities , are journalists who are afraid to publish these documents because of political reasons , and are simply members of the public , " spokesman jakub michalek said .
the creators of pirateleaks will be hoping all those sources supply them with evidence of corruption .
the small amount of information released since this week 's launch has n't exactly rocked the czech political establishment – though the site has ruffled a few feathers , michalek added .
" the politicians are afraid to say that this is a bad thing , because we are working exactly in accordance with the law , " he said . " but on the other side there were also reactions like , ' this is outrageous , this should be banned , the site should be closed immediately . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirateleaks.cz wants to fight corruption within czech government members of the media who have been reporting on corruption within the czech republic welcomed the new site .
" i think it 's very good that we have another source of information , one that is setting as its goal finding documents that are normally not available , " prague-based journalist erik best told deutsche welle .
" and i think with the impetus , with the excitement in the west and all over the world with wikileaks , that connection is going to be a big benefit for the site . "
data protection in sweden pirateleaks next goal is to locate its servers in sweden , with either a fellow pirate organization or prq , the same hosting service that maintains wikileaks ' servers there .
prq prides itself on requiring hardly any personal information from its clients .
" we would like to move to sweden or a different place that is much safer , as soon as possible , " michalek said .
" because the services that we can get in sweden with a pirate isp , or the prq company , are much better , we can get a safer connection .
things can be with more anonymity than we can get here in the czech republic . "

moscow said claims of selective justice were " unacceptable . " russia has reacted to criticism over monday 's new guilty verdict against the jailed former oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky by telling the european union and the united states to stay out of its affairs . " we expect everyone to mind his own business , both at home and in the international arena , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" attempts to put pressure on the proceedings are unacceptable , " the ministry said , using unusually blunt language for a diplomatic statement .
khodorkovsky was convicted on monday of stealing oil from his former company , yukos , between 1999 and 2003 and laundering the proceeds .
the conviction drew international criticism , with the united states saying it was " deeply concerned " about the " selective application of justice . "
germany said the verdict was a step backwards for russia , while france called for the rule of law to be respected .
khodorkovsky vs putin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and khodorkovsky are seen as personal rivals critics and human rights activists regard the trial as having been politically motivated .
they say the aim is to sideline khodorkovsky because he financed opposition parties . once the richest man in russia , he was convicted of fraud in 2003 and sentenced to prison .
his jail term was due to expire in 2011 .
khodorkovsky is an outspoken opponent of russian prime minister vladimir putin , who was the country 's president when khodorkovsky was initially convicted .
the new prison sentence could put him behind bars beyond the 2012 presidential elections .
if the court follows the prosecutors ' calls , he could stay in jail until 2017 .
vladimir putin is widely expected to run again for the presidency in 2012 .
he served two terms in that office , from 2000 to 2008 .
the constitution barred him from serving a third , consecutive term .
however , from 2012 putin could again serve as president for another two terms .
full verdict expected by friday the reading of the full verdict is ongoing and expected to be completed by the end of the week , at the earliest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as yukos chief , khodorkovsky was the richest man in russia khodorkovsky 's defense team suggested the verdict would be pronounced on friday .
as the first 10 days of january are vacation days in russia , no newspapers will be published that could question the court 's impartiality . in a statement released on khodorkovsky 's website , he and his co-defendant , platon lebedev , thanked their supporters for protesting outside the court building .

moscow said claims of selective justice were " unacceptable . " russia has reacted to criticism over monday 's new guilty verdict against the jailed former oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky by telling the european union and the united states to stay out of its affairs . " we expect everyone to mind his own business , both at home and in the international arena , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" attempts to put pressure on the proceedings are unacceptable , " the ministry said , using unusually blunt language for a diplomatic statement .
khodorkovsky was convicted on monday of stealing oil from his former company , yukos , between 1999 and 2003 and laundering the proceeds .
the conviction drew international criticism , with the united states saying it was " deeply concerned " about the " selective application of justice . "
germany said the verdict was a step backwards for russia , while france called for the rule of law to be respected .
khodorkovsky vs putin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and khodorkovsky are seen as personal rivals critics and human rights activists regard the trial as having been politically motivated .
they say the aim is to sideline khodorkovsky because he financed opposition parties . once the richest man in russia , he was convicted of fraud in 2003 and sentenced to prison .
his jail term was due to expire in 2011 .
khodorkovsky is an outspoken opponent of russian prime minister vladimir putin , who was the country 's president when khodorkovsky was initially convicted .
the new prison sentence could put him behind bars beyond the 2012 presidential elections .
if the court follows the prosecutors ' calls , he could stay in jail until 2017 .
vladimir putin is widely expected to run again for the presidency in 2012 .
he served two terms in that office , from 2000 to 2008 .
the constitution barred him from serving a third , consecutive term .
however , from 2012 putin could again serve as president for another two terms .
full verdict expected by friday the reading of the full verdict is ongoing and expected to be completed by the end of the week , at the earliest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as yukos chief , khodorkovsky was the richest man in russia khodorkovsky 's defense team suggested the verdict would be pronounced on friday .
as the first 10 days of january are vacation days in russia , no newspapers will be published that could question the court 's impartiality . in a statement released on khodorkovsky 's website , he and his co-defendant , platon lebedev , thanked their supporters for protesting outside the court building .
" power without law is a stool without a leg .
it looks silly and its prospects are predictable , " the statement said .

despite the visit coming after christmas , westerwelle issued a statement on monday thanking his iranian counterpart , ali akbar salehi , for his support in setting up the visit and called for the release of the two journalists .
according to iran 's irna news agency , humanitarian grounds and the christian holiday season were taken into account when the decision was made to grant the visit .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the journalists were seeking interviews about ashtiani iranian authorities said the journalists had entered the country on tourist visas and did not get the proper press accreditation , thereby violating visa regulations .

the case recalls the murder of former russian agent alexander litvinenko in 2006 . german prosecutors say they are investigating the possibility that a russian dissident couple living in germany could be the victims of a poisoning attack .
the news magazine focus reported earlier that the couple alerted police because they believed they were the target of an attack .
the magazine said that the couple , viktor and marina kalashnikov , had abnormally high concentrations of mercury in their blood .
the magazine said both have suffered health problems and that medical experts have recommended that the couple undergo further tests and be watched closely .
mercury poisoning can lead to kidney failure and problems with speech .
kremlin critics the kalashnikovs , who are journalists , have written articles in which they criticize the kremlin , especially its policy in chechnya .
they came to germany in september and now live in berlin .
they told focus they were sure the russian secret service was behind the suspected attack .
prosecutors said the case was being handled by a department specializing in politically motivated crimes .

" there has been a sharp rise in so-called electronic attacks on the networks of german government and local authorities , " he said .

some commentators fear blurry boundaries are putting aid workers at deadly risk . the killing of an afghanistan-based german aid worker by the taliban over the weekend has sparked calls for a greater and more visible separation between development work and military forces in the country .
former united nations special representative to afghanistan and current member of the german bundestag tom koenigs stressed that aid workers are in more danger than ever .
" the workers ' neutrality is no longer being acknowledged a priori , partly because their work has been politicized more and more in recent years , " koenigs said in an interview with the daily koelner stadtanzeiger .
" the price for that is that the development workers are perceived as part of the war .
we should concentrate more on separating development work from military deployment . "
koenigs ' comments come just weeks after german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg called for troops in crisis regions to work more closely with humanitarian aid agencies on the ground .
targeting aid workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is still rebuilding the most recent victim of the insurgency , an engineer working as an advisor to the german development bank kfw , was fatally wounded while travelling in a vehicle with three colleagues .
one of the colleagues , an afghan translator , was also injured in the attack .
the kfw advisor is the latest in a series of aid workers to be targeted in afghanistan this year , which has seen a spike in the number deaths of civilian development workers .
attacks directed at un employees working in afghanistan have increased by more than 130 percent in 2010 compared to last year , according to the united nations department of safety and security .
in another high-profile case from september , aid worker linda norgrove of scotland was taken hostage and later killed during a us-led operation to secure her release .
she had been working for the american-based organization development alternatives inc .
risks ever-present kieran dwyer of the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan said his organization attempts to minimize risks for development workers by remaining in constant contact with civilian and government leaders about possible risks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister dirk niebel called the attack on the aid worker " cowardly " " but the security risks can only be mitigated by the way we operate , not eliminated , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's important to remember that not just foreign aid workers but also afghan aid and government workers are targeted by insurgents .
it is not only the rising number of attacks that concerns dwyer .
" insurgents also began to target more regions of the country in the last year , often attacking the so-called soft targets of unarmed government and humanitarian workers , " he added .
germany has 4,800 troops in afghanistan , most of whom are serving in the north of the country , where the attack on the kfw consultant took place .
berlin is to begin reducing troop numbers in afghanistan by the end of 2011 , and to pull out of the country completely within four years . author : greg wiser -lrb- dpa -rrb- editor : sophie tarr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de biofuels -pipe- 28.12.2010 new biofuel standard coming to german pumps großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new , higher ethanol biofuel is coming in january higher ethanol content biofuel is being introduced for german drivers .
but critics say the intiative may see higher prices at the pump and cause damage to the environment . as of january 1 , 2011 , german drivers will have the option to fuel up their cars with new super e10 , a biofuel with higher ethanol content .
the change is part of germany 's plan to incrementally decrease its carbon emissions , with the goal of an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
but for everyday german drivers , the cost of the new biofuel is still a relative unknown , and the subject of much speculation .
previously , biofuel in germany only had five percent ethanol content , whereas e10 packs a solid 10 percent ethanol , an increase that should prove more environmentally friendly .
the federal ministry for the environment , nature conservation and nuclear safety -lrb- bmu -rrb- estimates that around 90 percent of existing german cars will be e10-compatible .
those vehicles unable to run on e10 can keep using the five percent variety until it is phased out in 2013 .
e10 will be available from the more than 14,000 service stations throughout the country as of the first of the year .
according to the bmu , the higher ethanol gasoline will have a decreased impact on the environment in terms of carbon emissions and will reduce consumer reliance on diminishing oil reserves .
the initiative is also designed to bring germany into compliance with a european commission directive seeking an eu-wide greenhouse gas emission savings of 60 percent from 2018 onwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while they disagree on how much , most parties say e10 will cost more than regular gas more ethanol means more cost the cost to the consumer is one contentious issue that is being batted around between the various groups interested in the project .
as the cost of producing ethanol biofuel is higher than regular gasoline , the bmu expects the price at the pump to increase slightly as well .
" with the introduction of e10 come additional costs for the production of bioethanol and the maintenance of fuel quality , " the ministry said .
but the german association for the biofuel industry contended that prices will not increase significantly .
" ethanol will not be much more expensive than gasoline , " association president claus sauter told press agency dpa .
" in addition , the petroleum industry itself is interested in selling e10 , because it is legally obliged to bring biofuels to market . "
on the other side of the issue , the spokesman for bp europe told bonn 's general anzeiger newspaper , " for drivers , the price will always be higher , " estimating an increased cost of 50 percent over normal petrol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as food crops are replaced by biofuel production , the cost in carbon increases cost to the environment another bone of contention is the actual environmental impact of the new biofuel due to something called indirect land use .
this is essentially the consequence of changing the use of land in order to produce crops used in biofuel production .
as more arable land is used to produce biofuel , the increased land clearance to grow food crops has the knock-on effect of higher carbon emissions .
originally , the commission had anticipated enacting its directive 98/70 / ec , requiring member states to report on the greenhouse gas intensity of fuel and energy , starting on january 1 , 2011 .
according to the directive , suppliers are required to gradually reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent by the end of 2020 at the latest .
but shortly before the january kick-off date for the initiative , the european commission published a report on indirect land use change related to biofuels .
it found that the ramifications of indirect land use required more investigation before it could proceed with the directive .
" the potential effects of indirect land use need to be properly weighed in our biofuels policy .
it is in our interest to investigate this seriously and ensure legislation that avoids negative side effects , " energy commissioner guenther oettinger said .
the result of its findings led the commission to delay its biofuel directive until july of 2011 .
in germany , however , the bmu claims that many of the required elements for biofuel production are locally and sustainably grown .

competitors from austria , poland and switzerland are considered to be among the favorites . the four hills tournament is a series of four ski jump competitions timed to ring in the new year .
the 59th edition of the competition starts in the german town of oberstdorf on wednesday , followed by the new year 's day jumps in garmisch-partenkirchen .
after that , the tournament moves to austria , with jumps in innsbruck on january 3 and in bishofshofen on january 6 .
at the end of the tournament , the competitor with the best overall score from the four events is declared the winner .
for german fans of ski jumping , it seems ages ago since sven hannawald swept the events of the four hills tournament in the 2001-02 competition .
he became the first ski jumper to win all four events of the tournament , a feat that has yet to be matched .
but if germany 's current form is anything to go by , they 'll be lucky to crack the top-10 in the overall standings , let alone win any of the events .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german pascal bodmer could crack the top 10 " of course we would rather go into the competition as one of the favourites , " said german ski jumping coach werner schuster .
" but it 's our goal for at least one of our ski jumpers to make it into the top 10 . "
the former stars of the german team , martin schmitt and michael uhrmann , are both 32 and not in very good form . schmitt 's best days on the hills may be behind him , but according to coach schuster , due to his experience - schmitt is competing in his 15th four hills tournament - he remains an important part of the team .
with schmitt no longer expected to reach the podium , it will be young up-and-coming ski jumpers such as severin freund and pascal bodmer who will likely be germany 's best hopes for cracking the top 10 . " the young guys are still really coachable , " schuster said .
" they 'll have to show what they can do at the first and second events in particular .
that 's where the wheat is separated from the chaff . "
austria 's morgenstern is the favorite the austrians , with their duo of thomas morgenstern and andreas kofler are considered to be favorites , and are going for their third consecutive overall win . morgenstern is on form , having won four consecutive world cup events this season .
he 's trying to go into the four hills as relaxed as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's thomas morgenstern is one of the favourites " i do n't wrack my brain over winning the tournament , " morgenstern said .
" i still just want to continue to have fun .
ski-jumping is not the most important part in my life . "
kofler , the defending four hills title holder , said he did n't feel any added pressure going into this year 's competition . " i can be calm about it and start with a lot of pleasant anticipation since i 've already won the tournament , " he said .
austria 's national coach , alexander pointer , is quite optimistic about a win .
" we do n't need to be overmodest , " he said .
" i see two exceptional athletes on the ski-jumping circuit at the moment : morgenstern and kofler . "
but there is some bad news for the austrian team as well .
gregor schlierenzauer , who has twice won the ski jumping world championship , will not be able to compete in the first two of the four tournament events due to an injured knee .
" it 's a tough decision for me .
but my head tells me that this is right thing to do for the long-term , " the 20-year-old schlierenzauer said .
schmitt wo n't quit after this year 's season polish ski jumper adam malysz and simon ammann from switzerland have set out to stop the austrian wave of success .
ammann , who has won four olympic titles - including two gold medals in vancouver - has yet to win the four hills tournament .
" the tournament is hugely attractive and its mystique gets bigger and bigger , as my chances of winning get " he said .
" so far , the tournament has been a tough nut to crack for me . "
a maximum of 57,000 euro -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- awaits the winner of the four hills tournament if he ties the record by german ski jumper hannawald .
in addition to the prize money , there will be a car worth some 30,000 euro -lrb- $ 40,000 -rrb- .

the most recent is pirateleaks.cz , launched by the czech pirate party . in the aftermath of the latest releases of information of secret documents by the infamous wikileaks , a crop of clones have popped up in europe .
one has been seeded by ex-wikileaks staffers , others were simply inspired by the original , but all of them want to make a difference .
wikileaks clones include the forthcoming openleaks in germany , with former wikileaks staffer , daniel domscheit-berg at the helm .
openleaks aims to democratize the process of leaking information and whistle-blowing and support the introduction of new legislation defending the rights of whistle-blowers .
other such websites include brusselsleaks.com , balkanleaks.eu , rospil.info and indoleaks.org , each hoping to blow the lid on corruption and secret documents in the european union , the balkans , russia and indonesia respectively .

the czech pirate party announced earlier this month that it had created a new secret-leaking site called pirateleaks and it aims to do the same thing as wikileaks , only focusing in the czech republic .
the aim of the site is to encourage transparency in czech government .
" our sources are people who work with documents in the authorities , are journalists who are afraid to publish these documents because of political reasons , and are simply members of the public , " spokesman jakub michalek said .
the creators of pirateleaks will be hoping all those sources supply them with evidence of corruption .
the small amount of information released since this week 's launch has n't exactly rocked the czech political establishment – though the site has ruffled a few feathers , michalek added .
" the politicians are afraid to say that this is a bad thing , because we are working exactly in accordance with the law , " he said . " but on the other side there were also reactions like , ' this is outrageous , this should be banned , the site should be closed immediately . " '

in 1806 , hegel described him as an iconic " world-soul , " and even his enemies could not quite shake off the fascination for the emperor who at first seemed to be invincible .
but poets and artists of his time also portrayed napoleon as a heartless warmonger , a ridiculous caricature , and even as satan 's eldest son .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show examines the emperor from various angles in " napoleon and europe , dream and trauma " the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany takes on napoleon in the context of his time .
the exhibition gives visitors with a critical and multifaceted look at a challenging topic .
the historic exhibition was done in cooperation with the musee de l 'armee in paris , where it will be shown in the spring of 2012 .
it will be the first comprehensive exhibition about napoleon in france for over 40 years .
" up to now in france , it 's been quite impossible to have a reasonable point of view about napoleon , " robert bresse , director of the musee de l 'armee , told deutsche welle .
" so , it 's really important to have an exhibition in paris that was built outside of france . "
master of propaganda as one of the exhibition 's 12 chapters illuminates , napoleon was a master of image cultivation and propaganda through artworks such as busts and paintings .
and napoleon 's image continues to be influenced by propaganda , the exhibit 's curator says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : napoleon 's myth lives on in marlon brando 's mantle from the movie desiree " part of the exhibition is the coronation mantle marlon brando wore when he played napoleon , revealing how much the official iconography of napoleon 's time has been passed on by film history and our popular culture , " said benedicte savoy , curator of the exhibition .
and , of course , there were napoleon 's wars .
his ambitious plans to unify europe under his command resulted in strategic triumphs , such as the battle of the three emperors in 1805 .
but they also led to his disastrous defeat and eventual downfall after the battle of waterloo in 1815 .
a generation of veterans other exhibitions have dealt thoroughly with the millions of victims who were killed in the napoleonic wars .
but ' napoleon and europe ' takes a closer look at the survivors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a living example of napoleon 's soldiers at the museum in bonn " nobody thinks of those who were wounded , " angelica francke , director of the exhibition , told deutsche welle .
" but those people , the veterans , were present in the streets for decades after napoleon was exiled .
so we dedicate a part of the exhibition to them . "
napoleon 's influence remains a part of europe up to the present day .
the exhibit shows how he implemented new standards like the metric system , connected european cities through a system of roads and telegraph lines , and , of course , introduced the napoleonic code , the civil rights opus still applied in france .
napoleon 's controversial impact on europe but napoleon 's impact on the face of europe was dark as well .
one part of the exhibit focuses one the theft of artworks from archives and museums of the conquered regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the young emperor : napoleon age 27 however , even this systematic theft has more than one side to it , according to erich pelzer , a historian at the university of mannheim .
" napoleon is never one-dimensional , he 's always controversial , " pelzer told deutsche welle .
" many artworks that could n't be stored in the louvre were redistributed to other european cities , helping a new ' europe of culture ' to emerge .
in fact , the theft of archives reflects a core phenomenon of napoleon : he creates something new without changing the actual substance , " pelzer said . napoleon 's impact on europe remains as controversial as napoleon himself .
and by taking a pan-european approach to its subject , the exhibition " napoleon and europe " offers a variety of new insights .

the countries each expelled two diplomats after spain accused russian embassy staff of espionage . spanish newspaper el pais reported on tuesday that spain and russia had been in a serious diplomatic spat resulting in a tit-for-tat expulsion of diplomats .
the spanish foreign ministry later confirmed that it had expelled two russian diplomats one month ago , leading to moscow sending away two spanish diplomats in response .
madrid asked the two russian embassy staff members to leave spain for " engaging in activities incompatible with their status , " the spanish foreign ministry said .
in diplomatic language a statement like this usually is an allegation of espionage .
the spanish secret service reportedly found evidence that the two had been spying .
" in retaliation , " russia expelled two spanish diplomats , the ministry statement continued .
no comment from moscow the incident is one of the most serious between the two nations since moscow restored diplomatic relations with madrid in 1977 after a 38-year break during the rein of spanish dictator francisco franco .
moscow on tuesday declined to comment on the incident .
spanish foreign minister trinidad jimenez is scheduled to meet with her russian counterpart sergey lavrov on january 16 to try and smooth things over .
last week london requested the departure of a russian diplomat accused of activities against british interests .
russia then expelled a british diplomat , saying the spat was groundless , but that it had been forced to respond in kind .
the tensions between moscow and london date back to the murder of former russian agent alexander litvinenko , who died in 2006 .
moscow refuses to extradite a russian lawmaker who britain suspects to was involved in the killing .

" up to now in france , it 's been quite impossible to have a reasonable point of view about napoleon , " robert bresse , director of the musee de l 'armee , told deutsche welle .
" so , it 's really important to have an exhibition in paris that was built outside of france . "
master of propaganda as one of the exhibition 's 12 chapters illuminates , napoleon was a master of image cultivation and propaganda through artworks such as busts and paintings .
and napoleon 's image continues to be influenced by propaganda , the exhibit 's curator says .

" but those people , the veterans , were present in the streets for decades after napoleon was exiled .
so we dedicate a part of the exhibition to them . "
napoleon 's influence remains a part of europe up to the present day .

" napoleon is never one-dimensional , he 's always controversial , " pelzer told deutsche welle .
" many artworks that could n't be stored in the louvre were redistributed to other european cities , helping a new ' europe of culture ' to emerge .
in fact , the theft of archives reflects a core phenomenon of napoleon : he creates something new without changing the actual substance , " pelzer said . napoleon 's impact on europe remains as controversial as napoleon himself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ski jumping -pipe- 28.12.2010 german ski jumpers seen as outsiders at four hills tournament großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schmitt , 32 , is still an important part of the team this year , german ski jumpers are not predicted to finish in the medals at the prestigious four hills tournament .
competitors from austria , poland and switzerland are considered to be among the favorites . the four hills tournament is a series of four ski jump competitions timed to ring in the new year .
the 59th edition of the competition starts in the german town of oberstdorf on wednesday , followed by the new year 's day jumps in garmisch-partenkirchen .
after that , the tournament moves to austria , with jumps in innsbruck on january 3 and in bishofshofen on january 6 .
at the end of the tournament , the competitor with the best overall score from the four events is declared the winner .
for german fans of ski jumping , it seems ages ago since sven hannawald swept the events of the four hills tournament in the 2001-02 competition .
he became the first ski jumper to win all four events of the tournament , a feat that has yet to be matched .
but if germany 's current form is anything to go by , they 'll be lucky to crack the top-10 in the overall standings , let alone win any of the events .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german pascal bodmer could crack the top 10 " of course we would rather go into the competition as one of the favourites , " said german ski jumping coach werner schuster .
" but it 's our goal for at least one of our ski jumpers to make it into the top 10 . "
the former stars of the german team , martin schmitt and michael uhrmann , are both 32 and not in very good form . schmitt 's best days on the hills may be behind him , but according to coach schuster , due to his experience - schmitt is competing in his 15th four hills tournament - he remains an important part of the team .
with schmitt no longer expected to reach the podium , it will be young up-and-coming ski jumpers such as severin freund and pascal bodmer who will likely be germany 's best hopes for cracking the top 10 . " the young guys are still really coachable , " schuster said .
" they 'll have to show what they can do at the first and second events in particular .
that 's where the wheat is separated from the chaff . "
austria 's morgenstern is the favorite the austrians , with their duo of thomas morgenstern and andreas kofler are considered to be favorites , and are going for their third consecutive overall win . morgenstern is on form , having won four consecutive world cup events this season .
he 's trying to go into the four hills as relaxed as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's thomas morgenstern is one of the favourites " i do n't wrack my brain over winning the tournament , " morgenstern said .
" i still just want to continue to have fun .
ski-jumping is not the most important part in my life . "
kofler , the defending four hills title holder , said he did n't feel any added pressure going into this year 's competition . " i can be calm about it and start with a lot of pleasant anticipation since i 've already won the tournament , " he said .
austria 's national coach , alexander pointer , is quite optimistic about a win .
" we do n't need to be overmodest , " he said .
" i see two exceptional athletes on the ski-jumping circuit at the moment : morgenstern and kofler . "
but there is some bad news for the austrian team as well .
gregor schlierenzauer , who has twice won the ski jumping world championship , will not be able to compete in the first two of the four tournament events due to an injured knee .
" it 's a tough decision for me .
but my head tells me that this is right thing to do for the long-term , " the 20-year-old schlierenzauer said .
schmitt wo n't quit after this year 's season polish ski jumper adam malysz and simon ammann from switzerland have set out to stop the austrian wave of success .
ammann , who has won four olympic titles - including two gold medals in vancouver - has yet to win the four hills tournament .
" the tournament is hugely attractive and its mystique gets bigger and bigger , as my chances of winning get " he said .
" so far , the tournament has been a tough nut to crack for me . "
a maximum of 57,000 euro -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- awaits the winner of the four hills tournament if he ties the record by german ski jumper hannawald .
in addition to the prize money , there will be a car worth some 30,000 euro -lrb- $ 40,000 -rrb- .

the most recent is pirateleaks.cz , launched by the czech pirate party . in the aftermath of the latest releases of information of secret documents by the infamous wikileaks , a crop of clones have popped up in europe .
one has been seeded by ex-wikileaks staffers , others were simply inspired by the original , but all of them want to make a difference .
wikileaks clones include the forthcoming openleaks in germany , with former wikileaks staffer , daniel domscheit-berg at the helm .
openleaks aims to democratize the process of leaking information and whistle-blowing and support the introduction of new legislation defending the rights of whistle-blowers .
other such websites include brusselsleaks.com , balkanleaks.eu , rospil.info and indoleaks.org , each hoping to blow the lid on corruption and secret documents in the european union , the balkans , russia and indonesia respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other sites , such as openleaks in germany plan to tackle transparency pirates of the czech republic in a café in prague , the public face of another secret whistle-blowing website demonstrated such a product to deutsche welle .
the czech pirate party announced earlier this month that it had created a new secret-leaking site called pirateleaks and it aims to do the same thing as wikileaks , only focusing in the czech republic .
the aim of the site is to encourage transparency in czech government .
" our sources are people who work with documents in the authorities , are journalists who are afraid to publish these documents because of political reasons , and are simply members of the public , " spokesman jakub michalek said .
the creators of pirateleaks will be hoping all those sources supply them with evidence of corruption .
the small amount of information released since this week 's launch has n't exactly rocked the czech political establishment – though the site has ruffled a few feathers , michalek added .
" the politicians are afraid to say that this is a bad thing , because we are working exactly in accordance with the law , " he said . " but on the other side there were also reactions like , ' this is outrageous , this should be banned , the site should be closed immediately . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirateleaks.cz wants to fight corruption within czech government members of the media who have been reporting on corruption within the czech republic welcomed the new site .
" i think it 's very good that we have another source of information , one that is setting as its goal finding documents that are normally not available , " prague-based journalist erik best told deutsche welle .
" and i think with the impetus , with the excitement in the west and all over the world with wikileaks , that connection is going to be a big benefit for the site . "
data protection in sweden pirateleaks next goal is to locate its servers in sweden , with either a fellow pirate organization or prq , the same hosting service that maintains wikileaks ' servers there .
prq prides itself on requiring hardly any personal information from its clients .
" we would like to move to sweden or a different place that is much safer , as soon as possible , " michalek said .
" because the services that we can get in sweden with a pirate isp , or the prq company , are much better , we can get a safer connection .
things can be with more anonymity than we can get here in the czech republic . "

the countries each expelled two diplomats after spain accused russian embassy staff of espionage . spanish newspaper el pais reported on tuesday that spain and russia had been in a serious diplomatic spat resulting in a tit-for-tat expulsion of diplomats .
the spanish foreign ministry later confirmed that it had expelled two russian diplomats one month ago , leading to moscow sending away two spanish diplomats in response .
madrid asked the two russian embassy staff members to leave spain for " engaging in activities incompatible with their status , " the spanish foreign ministry said .
in diplomatic language a statement like this usually is an allegation of espionage .
the spanish secret service reportedly found evidence that the two had been spying .
" in retaliation , " russia expelled two spanish diplomats , the ministry statement continued .
no comment from moscow the incident is one of the most serious between the two nations since moscow restored diplomatic relations with madrid in 1977 after a 38-year break during the rein of spanish dictator francisco franco .
moscow on tuesday declined to comment on the incident .
spanish foreign minister trinidad jimenez is scheduled to meet with her russian counterpart sergey lavrov on january 16 to try and smooth things over .
last week london requested the departure of a russian diplomat accused of activities against british interests .
russia then expelled a british diplomat , saying the spat was groundless , but that it had been forced to respond in kind .
the tensions between moscow and london date back to the murder of former russian agent alexander litvinenko , who died in 2006 .
moscow refuses to extradite a russian lawmaker who britain suspects to was involved in the killing .

competitors from austria , poland and switzerland are considered to be among the favorites . the four hills tournament is a series of four ski jump competitions timed to ring in the new year .
the 59th edition of the competition starts in the german town of oberstdorf on wednesday , followed by the new year 's day jumps in garmisch-partenkirchen .
after that , the tournament moves to austria , with jumps in innsbruck on january 3 and in bishofshofen on january 6 .
at the end of the tournament , the competitor with the best overall score from the four events is declared the winner .
for german fans of ski jumping , it seems ages ago since sven hannawald swept the events of the four hills tournament in the 2001-02 competition .
he became the first ski jumper to win all four events of the tournament , a feat that has yet to be matched .
but if germany 's current form is anything to go by , they 'll be lucky to crack the top-10 in the overall standings , let alone win any of the events .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german pascal bodmer could crack the top 10 " of course we would rather go into the competition as one of the favourites , " said german ski jumping coach werner schuster .
" but it 's our goal for at least one of our ski jumpers to make it into the top 10 . "
the former stars of the german team , martin schmitt and michael uhrmann , are both 32 and not in very good form . schmitt 's best days on the hills may be behind him , but according to coach schuster , due to his experience - schmitt is competing in his 15th four hills tournament - he remains an important part of the team .
with schmitt no longer expected to reach the podium , it will be young up-and-coming ski jumpers such as severin freund and pascal bodmer who will likely be germany 's best hopes for cracking the top 10 . " the young guys are still really coachable , " schuster said .
" they 'll have to show what they can do at the first and second events in particular .
that 's where the wheat is separated from the chaff . "
austria 's morgenstern is the favorite the austrians , with their duo of thomas morgenstern and andreas kofler are considered to be favorites , and are going for their third consecutive overall win . morgenstern is on form , having won four consecutive world cup events this season .
he 's trying to go into the four hills as relaxed as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's thomas morgenstern is one of the favourites " i do n't wrack my brain over winning the tournament , " morgenstern said .
" i still just want to continue to have fun .
ski-jumping is not the most important part in my life . "
kofler , the defending four hills title holder , said he did n't feel any added pressure going into this year 's competition . " i can be calm about it and start with a lot of pleasant anticipation since i 've already won the tournament , " he said .
austria 's national coach , alexander pointer , is quite optimistic about a win .
" we do n't need to be overmodest , " he said .
" i see two exceptional athletes on the ski-jumping circuit at the moment : morgenstern and kofler . "
but there is some bad news for the austrian team as well .
gregor schlierenzauer , who has twice won the ski jumping world championship , will not be able to compete in the first two of the four tournament events due to an injured knee .
" it 's a tough decision for me .
but my head tells me that this is right thing to do for the long-term , " the 20-year-old schlierenzauer said .
schmitt wo n't quit after this year 's season polish ski jumper adam malysz and simon ammann from switzerland have set out to stop the austrian wave of success .
ammann , who has won four olympic titles - including two gold medals in vancouver - has yet to win the four hills tournament .
" the tournament is hugely attractive and its mystique gets bigger and bigger , as my chances of winning get " he said .
" so far , the tournament has been a tough nut to crack for me . "
a maximum of 57,000 euro -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- awaits the winner of the four hills tournament if he ties the record by german ski jumper hannawald .
in addition to the prize money , there will be a car worth some 30,000 euro -lrb- $ 40,000 -rrb- .

the countries each expelled two diplomats after spain accused russian embassy staff of espionage . spanish newspaper el pais reported on tuesday that spain and russia had been in a serious diplomatic spat resulting in a tit-for-tat expulsion of diplomats .
the spanish foreign ministry later confirmed that it had expelled two russian diplomats one month ago , leading to moscow sending away two spanish diplomats in response .
madrid asked the two russian embassy staff members to leave spain for " engaging in activities incompatible with their status , " the spanish foreign ministry said .
in diplomatic language a statement like this usually is an allegation of espionage .
the spanish secret service reportedly found evidence that the two had been spying .
" in retaliation , " russia expelled two spanish diplomats , the ministry statement continued .
no comment from moscow the incident is one of the most serious between the two nations since moscow restored diplomatic relations with madrid in 1977 after a 38-year break during the rein of spanish dictator francisco franco .
moscow on tuesday declined to comment on the incident .
spanish foreign minister trinidad jimenez is scheduled to meet with her russian counterpart sergey lavrov on january 16 to try and smooth things over .
last week london requested the departure of a russian diplomat accused of activities against british interests .
russia then expelled a british diplomat , saying the spat was groundless , but that it had been forced to respond in kind .
the tensions between moscow and london date back to the murder of former russian agent alexander litvinenko , who died in 2006 .
moscow refuses to extradite a russian lawmaker who britain suspects to was involved in the killing .

meanwhile , members of the african bloc of nations have threatened to remove him by force . the validity of laurent gbagbo 's claim to the office of president of ivory coast took another hit on wednesday , when the french foreign ministry announced that eu nations would recognize only representatives selected by his rival , alassane ouattara . the decision was reached among eu heads of state meeting in brussels , a french foreign ministry spokesman said . following presidential elections in november , ouattara was recognized as the rightful winner by the united nations , the european union , the african union and the united states , but incumbent president laurent gbagbo has so far refused to step down .
the dispute has boiled over into violent clashes , and around 200 people have been killed .
on wednesday , west african leaders met in nigeria to plan their next steps aimed at persuading ivory coast president laurent gbagbo to step down , after their first attempt failed . the presidents of three countries - benin 's boni yayi , sierra leone 's ernest bai koroma and pedro pires of cape verde - traveled to ivory coast on tuesday with a message for defiant president gbagbo : step down from office , or be removed . the presidents , delegates of the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- , planned to return to abidjan " next week " to resume their efforts , the president 's office in cape verde announced wednesday . military intervention ecowas had said last friday that if gbagbo did n't give up the presidency of ivory coast to alassane ouattara , he would face military intervention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a fear of escalating violence in ivory coast after arriving tuesday in abidjan , the ecowas trio first met with the head of the united nations mission in ivory coast , and later met with gbagbo at the presidential palace .

the mob injured one soldier with a machete and burned one of the convoy 's vehicles , the un said in a statement . the un human rights council says about 14,000 refugees have fled ivory coast to neighboring liberia over fears of renewed civil war . influential in west africa even before tuesday 's meeting , gbagbo responded to the threat of military force from ecowas by saying it would push ivory coast closer to civil war , and added that there would be consequences for countries that got involved .

in 1806 , hegel described him as an iconic " world-soul , " and even his enemies could not quite shake off the fascination for the emperor who at first seemed to be invincible .
but poets and artists of his time also portrayed napoleon as a heartless warmonger , a ridiculous caricature , and even as satan 's eldest son .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show examines the emperor from various angles in " napoleon and europe , dream and trauma " the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany takes on napoleon in the context of his time .
the exhibition gives visitors with a critical and multifaceted look at a challenging topic .
the historic exhibition was done in cooperation with the musee de l 'armee in paris , where it will be shown in the spring of 2012 .
it will be the first comprehensive exhibition about napoleon in france for over 40 years .
" up to now in france , it 's been quite impossible to have a reasonable point of view about napoleon , " robert bresse , director of the musee de l 'armee , told deutsche welle .
" so , it 's really important to have an exhibition in paris that was built outside of france . "
master of propaganda as one of the exhibition 's 12 chapters illuminates , napoleon was a master of image cultivation and propaganda through artworks such as busts and paintings .
and napoleon 's image continues to be influenced by propaganda , the exhibit 's curator says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : napoleon 's myth lives on in marlon brando 's mantle from the movie desiree " part of the exhibition is the coronation mantle marlon brando wore when he played napoleon , revealing how much the official iconography of napoleon 's time has been passed on by film history and our popular culture , " said benedicte savoy , curator of the exhibition .
and , of course , there were napoleon 's wars .
his ambitious plans to unify europe under his command resulted in strategic triumphs , such as the battle of the three emperors in 1805 .
but they also led to his disastrous defeat and eventual downfall after the battle of waterloo in 1815 .
a generation of veterans other exhibitions have dealt thoroughly with the millions of victims who were killed in the napoleonic wars .
but ' napoleon and europe ' takes a closer look at the survivors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a living example of napoleon 's soldiers at the museum in bonn " nobody thinks of those who were wounded , " angelica francke , director of the exhibition , told deutsche welle .
" but those people , the veterans , were present in the streets for decades after napoleon was exiled .
so we dedicate a part of the exhibition to them . "
napoleon 's influence remains a part of europe up to the present day .
the exhibit shows how he implemented new standards like the metric system , connected european cities through a system of roads and telegraph lines , and , of course , introduced the napoleonic code , the civil rights opus still applied in france .
napoleon 's controversial impact on europe but napoleon 's impact on the face of europe was dark as well .
one part of the exhibit focuses one the theft of artworks from archives and museums of the conquered regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the young emperor : napoleon age 27 however , even this systematic theft has more than one side to it , according to erich pelzer , a historian at the university of mannheim .
" napoleon is never one-dimensional , he 's always controversial , " pelzer told deutsche welle .
" many artworks that could n't be stored in the louvre were redistributed to other european cities , helping a new ' europe of culture ' to emerge .
in fact , the theft of archives reflects a core phenomenon of napoleon : he creates something new without changing the actual substance , " pelzer said . napoleon 's impact on europe remains as controversial as napoleon himself .
and by taking a pan-european approach to its subject , the exhibition " napoleon and europe " offers a variety of new insights .

this has triggered a copyright discussion in germany . german copyright rules require anyone who copies sheet music pay fees to germany 's music licensing agency , gema .
the organization has begun notifying kindergartens and other preschool facilities that if they reproduce music to be sung or performed , they must pay for a license .
" if a preschool wants to make its own copy of certain music - if the words of a song or the musical score is copied - then they need to buy a license , " gema spokesperson peter hempel told deutsche welle .
the rules have been in place for 25 years , but they have only recently drawn attention .
gema began at the beginning of 2010 to send out reminders to daycare centers stressing that they need to sign contracts before making copies of sheet music for the children to sing from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if copies of music are made , the fee needs to be paid gema said that the need for licenses would not have any effect on singing in kindergartens .
" it does n't cost anything to sing in kindergartens , " said peter hempel .
" if a kindergarten or school does not make any copies of music , then of course they do n't need to pay anything . "
traditional songs are copyright-free the copyright rules only concern the rights for modern songs .
songs written by an author who has been dead for over 70 years are automatically in the public domain .
" for old songs , for traditional folk songs for example , it costs nothing , " said hempel .
fees start at 56 euros -lrb- $ 74 -rrb- for 500 copies of a song , a rate charged annually , not per child .
gema - the german abbreviation stands for the society for musical performing and mechanical reproduction rights - exists to make sure that the intellectual property of musicians is protected .
it is the collection agent for another group , vg musikedition , which monitors copyright for musicians and distributes the profits from the licensing fees back to its members .

this has triggered a copyright discussion in germany . german copyright rules require anyone who copies sheet music pay fees to germany 's music licensing agency , gema .
the organization has begun notifying kindergartens and other preschool facilities that if they reproduce music to be sung or performed , they must pay for a license .
" if a preschool wants to make its own copy of certain music - if the words of a song or the musical score is copied - then they need to buy a license , " gema spokesperson peter hempel told deutsche welle .
the rules have been in place for 25 years , but they have only recently drawn attention .
gema began at the beginning of 2010 to send out reminders to daycare centers stressing that they need to sign contracts before making copies of sheet music for the children to sing from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if copies of music are made , the fee needs to be paid gema said that the need for licenses would not have any effect on singing in kindergartens .
" it does n't cost anything to sing in kindergartens , " said peter hempel .
" if a kindergarten or school does not make any copies of music , then of course they do n't need to pay anything . "
traditional songs are copyright-free the copyright rules only concern the rights for modern songs .
songs written by an author who has been dead for over 70 years are automatically in the public domain .
" for old songs , for traditional folk songs for example , it costs nothing , " said hempel .
fees start at 56 euros -lrb- $ 74 -rrb- for 500 copies of a song , a rate charged annually , not per child .
gema - the german abbreviation stands for the society for musical performing and mechanical reproduction rights - exists to make sure that the intellectual property of musicians is protected .
it is the collection agent for another group , vg musikedition , which monitors copyright for musicians and distributes the profits from the licensing fees back to its members .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 28.12.2010 franco-german exhibition highlights napoleon 's ambiguous glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many faces of the emperor : napoleon in his coronation garment a new exhibition at a national museum in bonn takes on the myth of napoleon with a critical and multifaceted approach , revealing the complexity of napoleon and his time . a world of opinions exists about napoleon and his time , and that has always been the case .
in 1806 , hegel described him as an iconic " world-soul , " and even his enemies could not quite shake off the fascination for the emperor who at first seemed to be invincible .
but poets and artists of his time also portrayed napoleon as a heartless warmonger , a ridiculous caricature , and even as satan 's eldest son .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show examines the emperor from various angles in " napoleon and europe , dream and trauma " the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany takes on napoleon in the context of his time .
the exhibition gives visitors with a critical and multifaceted look at a challenging topic .
the historic exhibition was done in cooperation with the musee de l 'armee in paris , where it will be shown in the spring of 2012 .
it will be the first comprehensive exhibition about napoleon in france for over 40 years .
" up to now in france , it 's been quite impossible to have a reasonable point of view about napoleon , " robert bresse , director of the musee de l 'armee , told deutsche welle .
" so , it 's really important to have an exhibition in paris that was built outside of france . "
master of propaganda as one of the exhibition 's 12 chapters illuminates , napoleon was a master of image cultivation and propaganda through artworks such as busts and paintings .
and napoleon 's image continues to be influenced by propaganda , the exhibit 's curator says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : napoleon 's myth lives on in marlon brando 's mantle from the movie desiree " part of the exhibition is the coronation mantle marlon brando wore when he played napoleon , revealing how much the official iconography of napoleon 's time has been passed on by film history and our popular culture , " said benedicte savoy , curator of the exhibition .
and , of course , there were napoleon 's wars .
his ambitious plans to unify europe under his command resulted in strategic triumphs , such as the battle of the three emperors in 1805 .
but they also led to his disastrous defeat and eventual downfall after the battle of waterloo in 1815 .
a generation of veterans other exhibitions have dealt thoroughly with the millions of victims who were killed in the napoleonic wars .
but ' napoleon and europe ' takes a closer look at the survivors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a living example of napoleon 's soldiers at the museum in bonn " nobody thinks of those who were wounded , " angelica francke , director of the exhibition , told deutsche welle .
" but those people , the veterans , were present in the streets for decades after napoleon was exiled .
so we dedicate a part of the exhibition to them . "
napoleon 's influence remains a part of europe up to the present day .
the exhibit shows how he implemented new standards like the metric system , connected european cities through a system of roads and telegraph lines , and , of course , introduced the napoleonic code , the civil rights opus still applied in france .
napoleon 's controversial impact on europe but napoleon 's impact on the face of europe was dark as well .
one part of the exhibit focuses one the theft of artworks from archives and museums of the conquered regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the young emperor : napoleon age 27 however , even this systematic theft has more than one side to it , according to erich pelzer , a historian at the university of mannheim .
" napoleon is never one-dimensional , he 's always controversial , " pelzer told deutsche welle .
" many artworks that could n't be stored in the louvre were redistributed to other european cities , helping a new ' europe of culture ' to emerge .
in fact , the theft of archives reflects a core phenomenon of napoleon : he creates something new without changing the actual substance , " pelzer said . napoleon 's impact on europe remains as controversial as napoleon himself .
and by taking a pan-european approach to its subject , the exhibition " napoleon and europe " offers a variety of new insights .

some commentators fear blurry boundaries are putting aid workers at deadly risk . the killing of an afghanistan-based german aid worker by the taliban over the weekend has sparked calls for a greater and more visible separation between development work and military forces in the country .
former united nations special representative to afghanistan and current member of the german bundestag tom koenigs stressed that aid workers are in more danger than ever .
" the workers ' neutrality is no longer being acknowledged a priori , partly because their work has been politicized more and more in recent years , " koenigs said in an interview with the daily koelner stadtanzeiger .
" the price for that is that the development workers are perceived as part of the war .
we should concentrate more on separating development work from military deployment . "
koenigs ' comments come just weeks after german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg called for troops in crisis regions to work more closely with humanitarian aid agencies on the ground .
targeting aid workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is still rebuilding the most recent victim of the insurgency , an engineer working as an advisor to the german development bank kfw , was fatally wounded while travelling in a vehicle with three colleagues .
one of the colleagues , an afghan translator , was also injured in the attack .
the kfw advisor is the latest in a series of aid workers to be targeted in afghanistan this year , which has seen a spike in the number deaths of civilian development workers .
attacks directed at un employees working in afghanistan have increased by more than 130 percent in 2010 compared to last year , according to the united nations department of safety and security .

" it 's important to remember that not just foreign aid workers but also afghan aid and government workers are targeted by insurgents .
it is not only the rising number of attacks that concerns dwyer .
" insurgents also began to target more regions of the country in the last year , often attacking the so-called soft targets of unarmed government and humanitarian workers , " he added .

in 1806 , hegel described him as an iconic " world-soul , " and even his enemies could not quite shake off the fascination for the emperor who at first seemed to be invincible .
but poets and artists of his time also portrayed napoleon as a heartless warmonger , a ridiculous caricature , and even as satan 's eldest son .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show examines the emperor from various angles in " napoleon and europe , dream and trauma " the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany takes on napoleon in the context of his time .
the exhibition gives visitors with a critical and multifaceted look at a challenging topic .
the historic exhibition was done in cooperation with the musee de l 'armee in paris , where it will be shown in the spring of 2012 .
it will be the first comprehensive exhibition about napoleon in france for over 40 years .
" up to now in france , it 's been quite impossible to have a reasonable point of view about napoleon , " robert bresse , director of the musee de l 'armee , told deutsche welle .
" so , it 's really important to have an exhibition in paris that was built outside of france . "
master of propaganda as one of the exhibition 's 12 chapters illuminates , napoleon was a master of image cultivation and propaganda through artworks such as busts and paintings .
and napoleon 's image continues to be influenced by propaganda , the exhibit 's curator says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : napoleon 's myth lives on in marlon brando 's mantle from the movie desiree " part of the exhibition is the coronation mantle marlon brando wore when he played napoleon , revealing how much the official iconography of napoleon 's time has been passed on by film history and our popular culture , " said benedicte savoy , curator of the exhibition .
and , of course , there were napoleon 's wars .
his ambitious plans to unify europe under his command resulted in strategic triumphs , such as the battle of the three emperors in 1805 .
but they also led to his disastrous defeat and eventual downfall after the battle of waterloo in 1815 .
a generation of veterans other exhibitions have dealt thoroughly with the millions of victims who were killed in the napoleonic wars .
but ' napoleon and europe ' takes a closer look at the survivors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a living example of napoleon 's soldiers at the museum in bonn " nobody thinks of those who were wounded , " angelica francke , director of the exhibition , told deutsche welle .
" but those people , the veterans , were present in the streets for decades after napoleon was exiled .
so we dedicate a part of the exhibition to them . "
napoleon 's influence remains a part of europe up to the present day .
the exhibit shows how he implemented new standards like the metric system , connected european cities through a system of roads and telegraph lines , and , of course , introduced the napoleonic code , the civil rights opus still applied in france .
napoleon 's controversial impact on europe but napoleon 's impact on the face of europe was dark as well .
one part of the exhibit focuses one the theft of artworks from archives and museums of the conquered regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the young emperor : napoleon age 27 however , even this systematic theft has more than one side to it , according to erich pelzer , a historian at the university of mannheim .
" napoleon is never one-dimensional , he 's always controversial , " pelzer told deutsche welle .
" many artworks that could n't be stored in the louvre were redistributed to other european cities , helping a new ' europe of culture ' to emerge .
in fact , the theft of archives reflects a core phenomenon of napoleon : he creates something new without changing the actual substance , " pelzer said . napoleon 's impact on europe remains as controversial as napoleon himself .
and by taking a pan-european approach to its subject , the exhibition " napoleon and europe " offers a variety of new insights .

the case recalls the murder of former russian agent alexander litvinenko in 2006 . german prosecutors say they are investigating the possibility that a russian dissident couple living in germany could be the victims of a poisoning attack .
the news magazine focus reported earlier that the couple alerted police because they believed they were the target of an attack .
the magazine said that the couple , viktor and marina kalashnikov , had abnormally high concentrations of mercury in their blood .
the magazine said both have suffered health problems and that medical experts have recommended that the couple undergo further tests and be watched closely .
mercury poisoning can lead to kidney failure and problems with speech .
kremlin critics the kalashnikovs , who are journalists , have written articles in which they criticize the kremlin , especially its policy in chechnya .
they came to germany in september and now live in berlin .
they told focus they were sure the russian secret service was behind the suspected attack .
prosecutors said the case was being handled by a department specializing in politically motivated crimes .

the case recalls the murder of former russian agent alexander litvinenko in 2006 . german prosecutors say they are investigating the possibility that a russian dissident couple living in germany could be the victims of a poisoning attack .
the news magazine focus reported earlier that the couple alerted police because they believed they were the target of an attack .
the magazine said that the couple , viktor and marina kalashnikov , had abnormally high concentrations of mercury in their blood .
the magazine said both have suffered health problems and that medical experts have recommended that the couple undergo further tests and be watched closely .
mercury poisoning can lead to kidney failure and problems with speech .
kremlin critics the kalashnikovs , who are journalists , have written articles in which they criticize the kremlin , especially its policy in chechnya .
they came to germany in september and now live in berlin .
they told focus they were sure the russian secret service was behind the suspected attack .
prosecutors said the case was being handled by a department specializing in politically motivated crimes .

but critics say the intiative may see higher prices at the pump and cause damage to the environment . as of january 1 , 2011 , german drivers will have the option to fuel up their cars with new super e10 , a biofuel with higher ethanol content .
the change is part of germany 's plan to incrementally decrease its carbon emissions , with the goal of an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
but for everyday german drivers , the cost of the new biofuel is still a relative unknown , and the subject of much speculation .
previously , biofuel in germany only had five percent ethanol content , whereas e10 packs a solid 10 percent ethanol , an increase that should prove more environmentally friendly .
the federal ministry for the environment , nature conservation and nuclear safety -lrb- bmu -rrb- estimates that around 90 percent of existing german cars will be e10-compatible .
those vehicles unable to run on e10 can keep using the five percent variety until it is phased out in 2013 .
e10 will be available from the more than 14,000 service stations throughout the country as of the first of the year .
according to the bmu , the higher ethanol gasoline will have a decreased impact on the environment in terms of carbon emissions and will reduce consumer reliance on diminishing oil reserves .
the initiative is also designed to bring germany into compliance with a european commission directive seeking an eu-wide greenhouse gas emission savings of 60 percent from 2018 onwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while they disagree on how much , most parties say e10 will cost more than regular gas more ethanol means more cost the cost to the consumer is one contentious issue that is being batted around between the various groups interested in the project .
as the cost of producing ethanol biofuel is higher than regular gasoline , the bmu expects the price at the pump to increase slightly as well .
" with the introduction of e10 come additional costs for the production of bioethanol and the maintenance of fuel quality , " the ministry said .
but the german association for the biofuel industry contended that prices will not increase significantly .
" ethanol will not be much more expensive than gasoline , " association president claus sauter told press agency dpa .
" in addition , the petroleum industry itself is interested in selling e10 , because it is legally obliged to bring biofuels to market . "
on the other side of the issue , the spokesman for bp europe told bonn 's general anzeiger newspaper , " for drivers , the price will always be higher , " estimating an increased cost of 50 percent over normal petrol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as food crops are replaced by biofuel production , the cost in carbon increases cost to the environment another bone of contention is the actual environmental impact of the new biofuel due to something called indirect land use .
this is essentially the consequence of changing the use of land in order to produce crops used in biofuel production .
as more arable land is used to produce biofuel , the increased land clearance to grow food crops has the knock-on effect of higher carbon emissions .
originally , the commission had anticipated enacting its directive 98/70 / ec , requiring member states to report on the greenhouse gas intensity of fuel and energy , starting on january 1 , 2011 .
according to the directive , suppliers are required to gradually reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent by the end of 2020 at the latest .
but shortly before the january kick-off date for the initiative , the european commission published a report on indirect land use change related to biofuels .
it found that the ramifications of indirect land use required more investigation before it could proceed with the directive .
" the potential effects of indirect land use need to be properly weighed in our biofuels policy .
it is in our interest to investigate this seriously and ensure legislation that avoids negative side effects , " energy commissioner guenther oettinger said .
the result of its findings led the commission to delay its biofuel directive until july of 2011 .
in germany , however , the bmu claims that many of the required elements for biofuel production are locally and sustainably grown .

but critics say the intiative may see higher prices at the pump and cause damage to the environment . as of january 1 , 2011 , german drivers will have the option to fuel up their cars with new super e10 , a biofuel with higher ethanol content .
the change is part of germany 's plan to incrementally decrease its carbon emissions , with the goal of an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
but for everyday german drivers , the cost of the new biofuel is still a relative unknown , and the subject of much speculation .
previously , biofuel in germany only had five percent ethanol content , whereas e10 packs a solid 10 percent ethanol , an increase that should prove more environmentally friendly .
the federal ministry for the environment , nature conservation and nuclear safety -lrb- bmu -rrb- estimates that around 90 percent of existing german cars will be e10-compatible .
those vehicles unable to run on e10 can keep using the five percent variety until it is phased out in 2013 .
e10 will be available from the more than 14,000 service stations throughout the country as of the first of the year .
according to the bmu , the higher ethanol gasoline will have a decreased impact on the environment in terms of carbon emissions and will reduce consumer reliance on diminishing oil reserves .
the initiative is also designed to bring germany into compliance with a european commission directive seeking an eu-wide greenhouse gas emission savings of 60 percent from 2018 onwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while they disagree on how much , most parties say e10 will cost more than regular gas more ethanol means more cost the cost to the consumer is one contentious issue that is being batted around between the various groups interested in the project .
as the cost of producing ethanol biofuel is higher than regular gasoline , the bmu expects the price at the pump to increase slightly as well .
" with the introduction of e10 come additional costs for the production of bioethanol and the maintenance of fuel quality , " the ministry said .
but the german association for the biofuel industry contended that prices will not increase significantly .
" ethanol will not be much more expensive than gasoline , " association president claus sauter told press agency dpa .
" in addition , the petroleum industry itself is interested in selling e10 , because it is legally obliged to bring biofuels to market . "
on the other side of the issue , the spokesman for bp europe told bonn 's general anzeiger newspaper , " for drivers , the price will always be higher , " estimating an increased cost of 50 percent over normal petrol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as food crops are replaced by biofuel production , the cost in carbon increases cost to the environment another bone of contention is the actual environmental impact of the new biofuel due to something called indirect land use .
this is essentially the consequence of changing the use of land in order to produce crops used in biofuel production .
as more arable land is used to produce biofuel , the increased land clearance to grow food crops has the knock-on effect of higher carbon emissions .
originally , the commission had anticipated enacting its directive 98/70 / ec , requiring member states to report on the greenhouse gas intensity of fuel and energy , starting on january 1 , 2011 .
according to the directive , suppliers are required to gradually reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent by the end of 2020 at the latest .
but shortly before the january kick-off date for the initiative , the european commission published a report on indirect land use change related to biofuels .
it found that the ramifications of indirect land use required more investigation before it could proceed with the directive .
" the potential effects of indirect land use need to be properly weighed in our biofuels policy .
it is in our interest to investigate this seriously and ensure legislation that avoids negative side effects , " energy commissioner guenther oettinger said .
the result of its findings led the commission to delay its biofuel directive until july of 2011 .
in germany , however , the bmu claims that many of the required elements for biofuel production are locally and sustainably grown .

the most recent is pirateleaks.cz , launched by the czech pirate party . in the aftermath of the latest releases of information of secret documents by the infamous wikileaks , a crop of clones have popped up in europe .
one has been seeded by ex-wikileaks staffers , others were simply inspired by the original , but all of them want to make a difference .
wikileaks clones include the forthcoming openleaks in germany , with former wikileaks staffer , daniel domscheit-berg at the helm .
openleaks aims to democratize the process of leaking information and whistle-blowing and support the introduction of new legislation defending the rights of whistle-blowers .
other such websites include brusselsleaks.com , balkanleaks.eu , rospil.info and indoleaks.org , each hoping to blow the lid on corruption and secret documents in the european union , the balkans , russia and indonesia respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other sites , such as openleaks in germany plan to tackle transparency pirates of the czech republic in a café in prague , the public face of another secret whistle-blowing website demonstrated such a product to deutsche welle .
the czech pirate party announced earlier this month that it had created a new secret-leaking site called pirateleaks and it aims to do the same thing as wikileaks , only focusing in the czech republic .
the aim of the site is to encourage transparency in czech government .
" our sources are people who work with documents in the authorities , are journalists who are afraid to publish these documents because of political reasons , and are simply members of the public , " spokesman jakub michalek said .
the creators of pirateleaks will be hoping all those sources supply them with evidence of corruption .
the small amount of information released since this week 's launch has n't exactly rocked the czech political establishment – though the site has ruffled a few feathers , michalek added .
" the politicians are afraid to say that this is a bad thing , because we are working exactly in accordance with the law , " he said . " but on the other side there were also reactions like , ' this is outrageous , this should be banned , the site should be closed immediately . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirateleaks.cz wants to fight corruption within czech government members of the media who have been reporting on corruption within the czech republic welcomed the new site .
" i think it 's very good that we have another source of information , one that is setting as its goal finding documents that are normally not available , " prague-based journalist erik best told deutsche welle .
" and i think with the impetus , with the excitement in the west and all over the world with wikileaks , that connection is going to be a big benefit for the site . "
data protection in sweden pirateleaks next goal is to locate its servers in sweden , with either a fellow pirate organization or prq , the same hosting service that maintains wikileaks ' servers there .
prq prides itself on requiring hardly any personal information from its clients .
" we would like to move to sweden or a different place that is much safer , as soon as possible , " michalek said .
" because the services that we can get in sweden with a pirate isp , or the prq company , are much better , we can get a safer connection .
things can be with more anonymity than we can get here in the czech republic . "

this has triggered a copyright discussion in germany . german copyright rules require anyone who copies sheet music pay fees to germany 's music licensing agency , gema .
the organization has begun notifying kindergartens and other preschool facilities that if they reproduce music to be sung or performed , they must pay for a license .
" if a preschool wants to make its own copy of certain music - if the words of a song or the musical score is copied - then they need to buy a license , " gema spokesperson peter hempel told deutsche welle .
the rules have been in place for 25 years , but they have only recently drawn attention .
gema began at the beginning of 2010 to send out reminders to daycare centers stressing that they need to sign contracts before making copies of sheet music for the children to sing from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if copies of music are made , the fee needs to be paid gema said that the need for licenses would not have any effect on singing in kindergartens .
" it does n't cost anything to sing in kindergartens , " said peter hempel .
" if a kindergarten or school does not make any copies of music , then of course they do n't need to pay anything . "
traditional songs are copyright-free the copyright rules only concern the rights for modern songs .
songs written by an author who has been dead for over 70 years are automatically in the public domain .
" for old songs , for traditional folk songs for example , it costs nothing , " said hempel .
fees start at 56 euros -lrb- $ 74 -rrb- for 500 copies of a song , a rate charged annually , not per child .
gema - the german abbreviation stands for the society for musical performing and mechanical reproduction rights - exists to make sure that the intellectual property of musicians is protected .
it is the collection agent for another group , vg musikedition , which monitors copyright for musicians and distributes the profits from the licensing fees back to its members .

a new center will open next year , and will follow the example laid out by nato , the united states and britain . the german government announced on monday that it will create a new cyber-defense center in 2011 .
addressing reporters gathered in berlin , interior ministry spokesperson stefan paris said online espionage and cyber-attacks against german interests were becoming more common .
" there has been a sharp rise in so-called electronic attacks on the networks of german government and local authorities , " he said .
" germany is a very high-tech country with considerable experience and know-how , so of course others will naturally try to get hold of this knowledge - china is playing a large role in this . "
paris added that in the first nine months of 2010 , there were around 1,600 such attacks , compared with 900 for all of 2009 .

in the last of a three-part series , dw examines the country 's decision to deploy its military in afghanistan , and the ' warlike conditions ' there . a political shockwave reverberated across the atlantic ocean after islamic terrorists razed the world trade center and part of the pentagon on september 11 , 2001 .
in keeping with germany 's responsibility as a nato member , chancellor gerhard schroeder declared unlimited solidarity with a wounded america .
schroeder 's declaration carried sweeping military consequences for germany .
only three years after his left-of-center coalition had participated in nato 's air war against serbia , he deployed soldiers for an ambitious stabilization mission in war-torn afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schroeder showed solidarity with the us in sending troops .
germany 's stabilization mission looked increasingly like a counterinsurgency as its soldiers faced a resurgent taliban .
and in september 2009 , tensions came to a head when a german colonel ordered an airstrike against two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the strike killed 142 people , laying bare the realities of the afghan conflict for the german public .
after years of whitewashing the conflict in afghanistan , berlin has been forced to acknowledge that its soldiers are fighting and dying under " warlike conditions . "
germany can never again claim that it will never wage war .
solidarity among allies in the days following september 11 , germany rallied behind the united states as the bush administration assembled a military coalition to retaliate against the perpetrators of the attacks in new york and washington d.c.
" initially , operation enduring freedom was mandated through the united nations while nato invoked article 5 for the first time , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who served as deputy foreign minister at that time .
" the usa had been attacked and article 5 required germany to make a contribution . "
but germany 's support for america went beyond legal obligations , according to volmer .
many germans felt a deep emotional bond with their historical ally , creating a political climate in which participation in an offensive military campaign could be openly discussed .
" the german people made spontaneous displays of solidarity with the american people , " volmer said .
" many germans said the americans helped us against hitler and protected us during the cold war and now we have to return the favor . "
this solidarity ran into obstacles on the political front , however .
although the german military had participated in the kosovo war of 1999 , anxiety about military force remained deeply rooted in the national psyche .
many social democrats and greens worried that germany would be dragged into an open ended , global war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years , flag-draped caskets began returning to germany but in a political power play , schroeder tied parliament 's vote on operation enduring freedom with a vote of confidence .
if antiwar skeptics among the social democrats and greens voted against the war , they would also be voting against their own government .
faced with the choice of political influence or principle , most social democrats and greens closed ranks and threw their confidence behind their coalition government .
the resolution passed , allocating 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom and saving the government from collapse . mixed message as the united states waged war in pursuit of the perpetrators of september 11 , the international community designed a stabilization force to ease the impact of the conflict on civilians .
" the next step in the discussion was to demand that the military strikes not be directed against the afghan people , " volmer said .
" instead , the afghans should benefit from the intervention . "
while oef had been tasked with rooting out the taliban and al-qaeda , the international security assistance force would seek to create a secure environment in which afghanistan could build a postwar future for itself .
berlin sought to keep oef and isaf - war and stabilization - clearly separated from one another with an emphasis on putting isaf in the lead .
" that again has to do with history , " said karl lamers , former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats . " we do n't do war .
we conduct other actions that demand the use of force . "
but berlin 's policy began to send mixed messages .
in 2004 , german soldiers set up shop in the northern afghan city of kunduz , where they assisted civilian reconstruction efforts .
however , they became increasingly entangled in ambushes , mortar attacks and running gun battles as the taliban made a comeback .
the distinction between stabilization and war had become blurred .
as the years passed , flag-draped caskets returned home , and terrorists increasingly targeted europe , the justification for the mission became more self-assertive .
slowly , german defense experts began to take ownership of the conflict by identifying it as being in the national interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz strike killed 142 and left many wounded in hospitals " later we recognized what defense minister -lrb- peter -rrb- struck had pointed out : we are also defending germany 's security on the hindu kush , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert within the social democratic party .
" this view was supported by the attacks in london and madrid and through the clear fact that there 's something like a home-grown but foreign-trained terrorism that threatens us all . "
acts of war in september of 2009 , the simmering security situation in northern afghanistan boiled over .
colonel georg klein , commander of the german soldiers in kunduz , ordered american bombers to eliminate two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the airstrike killed 142 people .
many of the dead were civilians .
klein defended his order by claiming that he had believed the tankers would be used as an explosive device against his soldiers .
however , the subsequent investigation by isaf indicated that klein targeted the people , not the tanker itself .
local taliban leaders may have been among the crowd .
a german officer had launched a preemptive strike against a perceived threat orchestrated by a human enemy .
germany had waged war in front of the entire international community .
a half truth in the aftermath of the kunduz bombing , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg acknowledged that the german army was operating under " warlike conditions . "
and after three soldiers died in a taliban ambush in april of 2010 , chancellor angela merkel made a similar admission .
during the nationally televised memorial service for the fallen , merkel expressed understanding for soldiers who said they were fighting in a war .
so what do observers think of politicians ' attempts to find a label just short of ' war ' for the unconventional conflict in afghanistan ?
according to lamers , it 's a legal sideshow - one that began with the debate over the gulf war , raged during the yugoslavia crisis , and has been partially exposed by the kunduz airstrike .
military force - however it may be labeled by the political establishment - is now a regular and tolerated feature of german foreign policy .
germany no longer faces a national historical dilemma of whether it can use force at all .
rather , it has returned to history and once again confronts the broader human question : under what circumstances is military force justified ?
" it 's a question for all of us that nobody can definitively answer yet , but which we have to discuss intensively with one another , " lamers said .
" how do we position ourselves in a world where there are still cases like afghanistan ?
how do we deal with that ?
do we just say that we ca n't do anything about it ?
or if we can do something , what exactly should we do ? "
considering its tainted history , germany will have to be especially careful in its search for an answer .

in the last of a three-part series , dw examines the country 's decision to deploy its military in afghanistan , and the ' warlike conditions ' there . a political shockwave reverberated across the atlantic ocean after islamic terrorists razed the world trade center and part of the pentagon on september 11 , 2001 .
in keeping with germany 's responsibility as a nato member , chancellor gerhard schroeder declared unlimited solidarity with a wounded america .
schroeder 's declaration carried sweeping military consequences for germany .
only three years after his left-of-center coalition had participated in nato 's air war against serbia , he deployed soldiers for an ambitious stabilization mission in war-torn afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schroeder showed solidarity with the us in sending troops .
germany 's stabilization mission looked increasingly like a counterinsurgency as its soldiers faced a resurgent taliban .
and in september 2009 , tensions came to a head when a german colonel ordered an airstrike against two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the strike killed 142 people , laying bare the realities of the afghan conflict for the german public .
after years of whitewashing the conflict in afghanistan , berlin has been forced to acknowledge that its soldiers are fighting and dying under " warlike conditions . "
germany can never again claim that it will never wage war .
solidarity among allies in the days following september 11 , germany rallied behind the united states as the bush administration assembled a military coalition to retaliate against the perpetrators of the attacks in new york and washington d.c.
" initially , operation enduring freedom was mandated through the united nations while nato invoked article 5 for the first time , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who served as deputy foreign minister at that time .
" the usa had been attacked and article 5 required germany to make a contribution . "
but germany 's support for america went beyond legal obligations , according to volmer .
many germans felt a deep emotional bond with their historical ally , creating a political climate in which participation in an offensive military campaign could be openly discussed .
" the german people made spontaneous displays of solidarity with the american people , " volmer said .
" many germans said the americans helped us against hitler and protected us during the cold war and now we have to return the favor . "
this solidarity ran into obstacles on the political front , however .
although the german military had participated in the kosovo war of 1999 , anxiety about military force remained deeply rooted in the national psyche .
many social democrats and greens worried that germany would be dragged into an open ended , global war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years , flag-draped caskets began returning to germany but in a political power play , schroeder tied parliament 's vote on operation enduring freedom with a vote of confidence .
if antiwar skeptics among the social democrats and greens voted against the war , they would also be voting against their own government .
faced with the choice of political influence or principle , most social democrats and greens closed ranks and threw their confidence behind their coalition government .
the resolution passed , allocating 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom and saving the government from collapse . mixed message as the united states waged war in pursuit of the perpetrators of september 11 , the international community designed a stabilization force to ease the impact of the conflict on civilians .
" the next step in the discussion was to demand that the military strikes not be directed against the afghan people , " volmer said .
" instead , the afghans should benefit from the intervention . "
while oef had been tasked with rooting out the taliban and al-qaeda , the international security assistance force would seek to create a secure environment in which afghanistan could build a postwar future for itself .
berlin sought to keep oef and isaf - war and stabilization - clearly separated from one another with an emphasis on putting isaf in the lead .
" that again has to do with history , " said karl lamers , former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats . " we do n't do war .
we conduct other actions that demand the use of force . "
but berlin 's policy began to send mixed messages .
in 2004 , german soldiers set up shop in the northern afghan city of kunduz , where they assisted civilian reconstruction efforts .
however , they became increasingly entangled in ambushes , mortar attacks and running gun battles as the taliban made a comeback .
the distinction between stabilization and war had become blurred .
as the years passed , flag-draped caskets returned home , and terrorists increasingly targeted europe , the justification for the mission became more self-assertive .
slowly , german defense experts began to take ownership of the conflict by identifying it as being in the national interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz strike killed 142 and left many wounded in hospitals " later we recognized what defense minister -lrb- peter -rrb- struck had pointed out : we are also defending germany 's security on the hindu kush , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert within the social democratic party .
" this view was supported by the attacks in london and madrid and through the clear fact that there 's something like a home-grown but foreign-trained terrorism that threatens us all . "
acts of war in september of 2009 , the simmering security situation in northern afghanistan boiled over .
colonel georg klein , commander of the german soldiers in kunduz , ordered american bombers to eliminate two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the airstrike killed 142 people .
many of the dead were civilians .
klein defended his order by claiming that he had believed the tankers would be used as an explosive device against his soldiers .
however , the subsequent investigation by isaf indicated that klein targeted the people , not the tanker itself .
local taliban leaders may have been among the crowd .
a german officer had launched a preemptive strike against a perceived threat orchestrated by a human enemy .
germany had waged war in front of the entire international community .
a half truth in the aftermath of the kunduz bombing , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg acknowledged that the german army was operating under " warlike conditions . "
and after three soldiers died in a taliban ambush in april of 2010 , chancellor angela merkel made a similar admission .
during the nationally televised memorial service for the fallen , merkel expressed understanding for soldiers who said they were fighting in a war .
so what do observers think of politicians ' attempts to find a label just short of ' war ' for the unconventional conflict in afghanistan ?
according to lamers , it 's a legal sideshow - one that began with the debate over the gulf war , raged during the yugoslavia crisis , and has been partially exposed by the kunduz airstrike .
military force - however it may be labeled by the political establishment - is now a regular and tolerated feature of german foreign policy .
germany no longer faces a national historical dilemma of whether it can use force at all .
rather , it has returned to history and once again confronts the broader human question : under what circumstances is military force justified ?
" it 's a question for all of us that nobody can definitively answer yet , but which we have to discuss intensively with one another , " lamers said .
" how do we position ourselves in a world where there are still cases like afghanistan ?
how do we deal with that ?
do we just say that we ca n't do anything about it ?
or if we can do something , what exactly should we do ? "
considering its tainted history , germany will have to be especially careful in its search for an answer .

in the last of a three-part series , dw examines the country 's decision to deploy its military in afghanistan , and the ' warlike conditions ' there . a political shockwave reverberated across the atlantic ocean after islamic terrorists razed the world trade center and part of the pentagon on september 11 , 2001 .
in keeping with germany 's responsibility as a nato member , chancellor gerhard schroeder declared unlimited solidarity with a wounded america .
schroeder 's declaration carried sweeping military consequences for germany .
only three years after his left-of-center coalition had participated in nato 's air war against serbia , he deployed soldiers for an ambitious stabilization mission in war-torn afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schroeder showed solidarity with the us in sending troops .
germany 's stabilization mission looked increasingly like a counterinsurgency as its soldiers faced a resurgent taliban .
and in september 2009 , tensions came to a head when a german colonel ordered an airstrike against two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the strike killed 142 people , laying bare the realities of the afghan conflict for the german public .
after years of whitewashing the conflict in afghanistan , berlin has been forced to acknowledge that its soldiers are fighting and dying under " warlike conditions . "
germany can never again claim that it will never wage war .
solidarity among allies in the days following september 11 , germany rallied behind the united states as the bush administration assembled a military coalition to retaliate against the perpetrators of the attacks in new york and washington d.c.
" initially , operation enduring freedom was mandated through the united nations while nato invoked article 5 for the first time , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who served as deputy foreign minister at that time .
" the usa had been attacked and article 5 required germany to make a contribution . "
but germany 's support for america went beyond legal obligations , according to volmer .
many germans felt a deep emotional bond with their historical ally , creating a political climate in which participation in an offensive military campaign could be openly discussed .
" the german people made spontaneous displays of solidarity with the american people , " volmer said .
" many germans said the americans helped us against hitler and protected us during the cold war and now we have to return the favor . "
this solidarity ran into obstacles on the political front , however .
although the german military had participated in the kosovo war of 1999 , anxiety about military force remained deeply rooted in the national psyche .
many social democrats and greens worried that germany would be dragged into an open ended , global war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years , flag-draped caskets began returning to germany but in a political power play , schroeder tied parliament 's vote on operation enduring freedom with a vote of confidence .
if antiwar skeptics among the social democrats and greens voted against the war , they would also be voting against their own government .
faced with the choice of political influence or principle , most social democrats and greens closed ranks and threw their confidence behind their coalition government .
the resolution passed , allocating 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom and saving the government from collapse . mixed message as the united states waged war in pursuit of the perpetrators of september 11 , the international community designed a stabilization force to ease the impact of the conflict on civilians .
" the next step in the discussion was to demand that the military strikes not be directed against the afghan people , " volmer said .
" instead , the afghans should benefit from the intervention . "
while oef had been tasked with rooting out the taliban and al-qaeda , the international security assistance force would seek to create a secure environment in which afghanistan could build a postwar future for itself .
berlin sought to keep oef and isaf - war and stabilization - clearly separated from one another with an emphasis on putting isaf in the lead .
" that again has to do with history , " said karl lamers , former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats . " we do n't do war .
we conduct other actions that demand the use of force . "
but berlin 's policy began to send mixed messages .
in 2004 , german soldiers set up shop in the northern afghan city of kunduz , where they assisted civilian reconstruction efforts .
however , they became increasingly entangled in ambushes , mortar attacks and running gun battles as the taliban made a comeback .
the distinction between stabilization and war had become blurred .
as the years passed , flag-draped caskets returned home , and terrorists increasingly targeted europe , the justification for the mission became more self-assertive .
slowly , german defense experts began to take ownership of the conflict by identifying it as being in the national interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz strike killed 142 and left many wounded in hospitals " later we recognized what defense minister -lrb- peter -rrb- struck had pointed out : we are also defending germany 's security on the hindu kush , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert within the social democratic party .
" this view was supported by the attacks in london and madrid and through the clear fact that there 's something like a home-grown but foreign-trained terrorism that threatens us all . "
acts of war in september of 2009 , the simmering security situation in northern afghanistan boiled over .
colonel georg klein , commander of the german soldiers in kunduz , ordered american bombers to eliminate two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the airstrike killed 142 people .
many of the dead were civilians .
klein defended his order by claiming that he had believed the tankers would be used as an explosive device against his soldiers .
however , the subsequent investigation by isaf indicated that klein targeted the people , not the tanker itself .
local taliban leaders may have been among the crowd .
a german officer had launched a preemptive strike against a perceived threat orchestrated by a human enemy .
germany had waged war in front of the entire international community .
a half truth in the aftermath of the kunduz bombing , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg acknowledged that the german army was operating under " warlike conditions . "
and after three soldiers died in a taliban ambush in april of 2010 , chancellor angela merkel made a similar admission .
during the nationally televised memorial service for the fallen , merkel expressed understanding for soldiers who said they were fighting in a war .
so what do observers think of politicians ' attempts to find a label just short of ' war ' for the unconventional conflict in afghanistan ?
according to lamers , it 's a legal sideshow - one that began with the debate over the gulf war , raged during the yugoslavia crisis , and has been partially exposed by the kunduz airstrike .
military force - however it may be labeled by the political establishment - is now a regular and tolerated feature of german foreign policy .
germany no longer faces a national historical dilemma of whether it can use force at all .
rather , it has returned to history and once again confronts the broader human question : under what circumstances is military force justified ?
" it 's a question for all of us that nobody can definitively answer yet , but which we have to discuss intensively with one another , " lamers said .
" how do we position ourselves in a world where there are still cases like afghanistan ?
how do we deal with that ?
do we just say that we ca n't do anything about it ?
or if we can do something , what exactly should we do ? "
considering its tainted history , germany will have to be especially careful in its search for an answer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 28.12.2010 the balkan dilemma : germany returns to military action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reality trumped rhetoric : germany agreed to use force in the yugoslavia burdened by the genocidal legacy of national socialism , germany swore never again to wage war .
in part two of a three-part series , dw examines how the country returned to military action in the balkans . war returned to germany 's doorstep when yugoslavia imploded in ethnic violence .
during the winter of 1994 , german officials agonized over whether to participate in a nato-led military intervention aimed at containing the war .
although the nation 's highest court had declared such interventions constitutional , germany remained deeply reluctant to use military force for any reason other than defense .
but enormous political and moral pressure pushed the kohl government and the opposition toward a shaky consensus in favor of military action against serbia .
this consensus faced its trial-by-fire when the social democrats and greens took the reins of power in 1998 .
in a twist of fate , the traditionally antiwar parties ordered germany 's first offensive military strike since world war ii .
the war next door by the fall of 1994 , the war in yugoslavia had reached a boiling point as serb forces began targeting nato aircraft and un peacekeepers .
the nato allies feared the worst and drew up plans to rescue the lightly armed peacekeepers in the event that the serbs launched an all-out attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl dragged his feet to avoid intervening in yugoslavia .
as nato prepared for a showdown , germany dragged its feet .
chancellor helmut kohl argued that since the third reich had occupied yugoslavia , it would be historically inappropriate for germany to intervene in the current conflict .
kohl was trying to prevent germany from getting involved in the conflict too quickly , according to karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats .
" that was an ineffectual attempt to throw up a firewall , " lamers said .
" kohl was much too intelligent to think that it would hold .
but it fit the disposition among the german people . "
kohl 's firewall began crumbling as the arrival of bosnian refugees started impacting german domestic politics , according to lamers .
and as the humanitarian situation worsened , nato began to lose its patience with bonn .
the allies pressured germany to send its tornado warplanes into the bosnian firestorm .
the tornados had a unique capability to locate and destroy serb radar installations , which would help cover a possible un withdrawal .
germany was the only european country that possessed such aircraft .
ultimately , strategic realities trumped political rhetoric and the kohl government assented to nato 's request .
but germany 's deeply divided parliament still had to approve the decision .
" you can always argue about the sense of using military force , because you never know what the result will be .
that 's the risk , " lamers said .
" but when all the countries in the community that we belong to say its necessary , we ca n't just say ' count me out . " '
winning the home front for the first time since the world war ii , a german government had decided to deploy its military to a war zone .
unwilling to shoulder the full political and moral responsibility for its historic decision , the kohl government reached out to the opposition social democrats and greens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the greens ' joschka fischer said force was justified to stop genocide the bosnian quagmire had thrown the social democratic party into an uproar .
the antiwar mainstream feared embarking down a slippery slope that could lead the country away from its peaceful foreign policy .
but a more hawkish minority supported using force as a last resort to rescue the un peacekeepers and stop the ethnic cleansing .
" in a 10-to-1 vote , the foreign and security policy experts supported the government 's proposal , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" we knew that the party had a different opinion .
there was considerable uproar .
in the end , around 50 social democrats voted with the government in favor of the bosnian mission and against their own party . "
green revolution as social democrats inched closer to the kohl government , the greens were facing a crisis of conscience that threatened to tear their party in two .
traditionally , the green party advocated a pacifist foreign policy rooted in the peaceful resolution of conflicts through international institutions like the un .
but the un 's failure to stop the ethnic cleansing in bosnia led to an ideological revolution within certain quarters of the party .
after serb forces massacred thousands of bosnian muslims in the town of srebrenica , green party whip joschka fischer declared that force was justified to stop genocide .
" with the balkan wars we realized for the first time that there are situations in which one has to intervene militarily , " said ludger volmer , former president of the green party who went on to serve as the country 's deputy foreign minister . " that was a difficult learning process . "
this learning process would end with the bundestag sending tornado warplanes as well as peacekeepers to bosnia .
against the historical and political odds , germany 's divided parties had forged a shaky consensus in favor of military intervention .
peaceniks in power after serving 16 years in the opposition , the social democrats and greens defeated the kohl government in the 1998 elections .
no sooner had the left-of-center coalition come to power than renewed ethnic violence erupted in yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's air war against serbia was an allied intervention while nato peacekeepers secured the precarious peace in bosnia , the breakaway province of kosovo careened toward war as ethnic albanians demanded independence from serbia .
germany and its nato allies pushed for a peaceful settlement .
but negotiations collapsed when both sides refused to compromise on kosovo 's political status .
in anticipation of this worst-case scenario , the kohl government had committed germany to participate in a nato air war against serbia .
now , social democratic chancellor gerhard schroeder and green party foreign minister joschka fischer had to decide whether they would honor their predecessor 's commitment .
air strikes hardly squared with the coalition 's platform of a foreign policy rooted in peaceful conflict resolution .
bombing belgrade when the security council stalled over russian and chinese objections , nato decided to launch its air war without a un mandate .
the nato allies accused serbia of ethnic cleansing and argued that time was of the essence in order to save innocent lives .
schroeder and fischer faced a nightmare scenario : an allied military intervention without un sanction .
" the new schroeder-fischer government agreed to participate for purely opportune reasons , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert and parliamentarian within the social democratic party .
" they knew that if they did n't participate , they would face foreign policy isolation from the outset .
that 's what i call the joke of history .
the german position changed irrevocably because the government had no choice but to say yes . "
with deep reservations , the former antiwar opposition ordered warplanes to bomb belgrade in germany 's first overt military strike since world war ii .
the shaky foreign policy consensus forged during the bosnian crisis had survived its trial-by-fire in kosovo .
" germany is not a military power and it does n't want to become one , " volmer said .
" you can not help but recognize that there are some conflicts for which you have to arm yourself and that there may be situations in which you have to intervene militarily .
but at its very core , germany has a remote relationship to armed force .
that 's a lesson from the second world war , from history . "

in part one of a three-part series , dw examines how germans overcame historic taboos about deploying their military abroad . in memory of the atrocities committed under the third reich , democratic west germany foreswore war as an instrument of its foreign policy .
its military served a single purpose : to help defend the nato allies in western europe and north america from a soviet attack .
but when the berlin wall fell , the world changed , as did germany 's role within it .
the government of chancellor helmut kohl had just finalized german reunification when a series of conflicts erupted in the persian gulf , yugoslavia and somalia .
as the international community intervened to contain these conflicts , germans faced a historically uncomfortable question : should a reunited and fully sovereign germany become a military power capable of using force on the world stage ? checkbook diplomacy as the us and its coalition partners launched air strikes to eject the iraqi military from kuwait in january 1991 , the streets of germany 's major cities filled with 250,000 protestors who opposed the us-led war against saddam hussein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after reunification , kohl used germany 's checkbook to show solidarity the protests expressed a deep-seated national aversion to war and militarism .
after living at the epicenter of international conflict for an entire century , german society had lost its taste for political violence .
" through the double catastrophe of the two -lsb- world -rsb- wars , the germans transformed themselves from a violent society into a post-heroic society , " said hans-ulrich klose , a bundestag representative and a leading foreign policy expert within the left-of-center social democratic party .
" many germans say that we 're the ones who learned the lessons of history and that others still have to learn those lessons . "
but the germans ' rejection of the american-led coalition , and a un-sanctioned military campaign that targeted an aggressive dictator , left chancellor helmut kohl 's government in a deeply uncomfortable position .
" the kohl government knew they had to contribute to the gulf war due to the principle of allied solidarity , " said karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" but they were at the same time aware of the growing opposition to the war within the electorate . " instead of sending troops to the persian gulf , bonn wrote the coalition partners a check for 17 billion marks -lrb- $ 12 billion , or 8 billion euros -rrb- and supplied logistical support . " we effectively bought ourselves out of the war with our financial contribution , " lamers said . opening pandora 's box the kohl government had been politically and legally boxed into a corner .
on top of vehement public opposition , the government faced a constitution that sanctioned war only in self-defense .
and since saddam hussein had neither attacked germany nor the nato allies , direct german military participation in the conflict was off-limits .
in an effort to reconcile germany 's laws with its international obligations , the center-right christian democratic union called for the " clarification " of two conflicting constitutional articles .
article 87 gave germany the right to field an army for national defense .
but article 24 also permitted germany to join collective security organizations to preserve world peace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faced a quandary during the 1991 gulf war many conservatives argued that article 24 sanctioned german participation in multilateral military operations - with or without a un mandate - that were not directly related to territorial defense . " the claim that the constitution forbids the german armed forces from participating in these kinds of deployments is a legal facade that hides the real political issue , " lamers said .
" in reality it was about the unwillingness and the incapability of the large majority of german citizens and voters to participate in warlike measures . "
partisan firestorm as the governing christian democrats pushed the constitutional question , the opposition social democrats faced internal divisions .
the party base limited its support to un peacekeeping missions while a small elite favored more aggressive military operations like the gulf war .
" the foreign and security policy experts actually wanted such operations as an option , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" but we could n't move our own parliamentary faction because they said the constitution did n't allow such operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boutros boutros-ghali asked germany to send peacekeepers to somalia meanwhile , the pacifist green party rejected military intervention in virtually any form .
" we feared the conservatives who were in power wanted to reconstruct a classic nation state with the capability to project power , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who later served as deputy foreign minister .
" we believed that non-military measures should be developed and given priority . "
even the christian democrats ' own coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , expressed reservations about operations without a un mandate .
fait accompli but world events overshadowed the partisan debate in germany .
the dust had hardly settled in the persian gulf when devastating civil wars broke out in yugoslavia and somalia .
in an attempt to contain violence in southeastern europe , nato and the west european union - a european defense organization - imposed a sea and air blockade on yugoslavia .
nato deployed awacs radar planes to patrol the skies of the balkan war zone .
with germans serving in the multinational crews that manned these aircraft , participation in the blockade was a foregone conclusion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , the constitutional court was asked to decide " we could n't just pull out , " lamers said .
" we were part of a larger whole and were not really free .
we would have risked enormous damage to our image and influence . "
while nato tried to stem the tide of violence in yugoslavia , the un sanctioned a us-led peacekeeping mission to stabilize somalia .
in a trip to bonn , then-un secretary general boutros boutros-ghali personally asked the german government to send peacekeepers to the war-torn east african nation .
with the political parties still in gridlock over the constitutional question , the kohl government decided to act without parliamentary approval .
kohl deployed ships and aircraft to yugoslavia and more than 1,000 soldiers to somalia .
foreign policy on trial politically outmaneuvered , the social democrats sued the kohl government in the federal constitutional court .
yet the party 's foreign and security policy experts worked with the government behind the scenes , according to voigt .
both the opposition and the government wanted to put the constitutional question to rest .
and since parliament could not reach a compromise , they agreed to resolve the political controversy in court .
" we internally agreed to create a case on un operations -lsb- somalia -rsb- , a case on nato operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- and a case on west european union operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- , " voigt said .
" the federal government conducted these operations , and we filed suits against them . "
however , the kohl government almost became a casualty of the legal battle when its coalition partner - the free democrats - sued it over the nato air blockade .
germany 's government now faced an uncertain future as the judges deliberated .
the kohl government dodged a bullet when the federal constitutional court ruled that germany could participate in un , nato and weu military operations worldwide .
but there was an important caveat : these operations had to be approved by a simple parliamentary majority . " we had to slowly learn that we 're a country that represents interests , and that we 're an ally and that carries consequences , " klose said .
" that was a tremendously difficult learning process that has in no way come to an end . "

in part one of a three-part series , dw examines how germans overcame historic taboos about deploying their military abroad . in memory of the atrocities committed under the third reich , democratic west germany foreswore war as an instrument of its foreign policy .
its military served a single purpose : to help defend the nato allies in western europe and north america from a soviet attack .
but when the berlin wall fell , the world changed , as did germany 's role within it .
the government of chancellor helmut kohl had just finalized german reunification when a series of conflicts erupted in the persian gulf , yugoslavia and somalia .
as the international community intervened to contain these conflicts , germans faced a historically uncomfortable question : should a reunited and fully sovereign germany become a military power capable of using force on the world stage ? checkbook diplomacy as the us and its coalition partners launched air strikes to eject the iraqi military from kuwait in january 1991 , the streets of germany 's major cities filled with 250,000 protestors who opposed the us-led war against saddam hussein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after reunification , kohl used germany 's checkbook to show solidarity the protests expressed a deep-seated national aversion to war and militarism .
after living at the epicenter of international conflict for an entire century , german society had lost its taste for political violence .
" through the double catastrophe of the two -lsb- world -rsb- wars , the germans transformed themselves from a violent society into a post-heroic society , " said hans-ulrich klose , a bundestag representative and a leading foreign policy expert within the left-of-center social democratic party .
" many germans say that we 're the ones who learned the lessons of history and that others still have to learn those lessons . "
but the germans ' rejection of the american-led coalition , and a un-sanctioned military campaign that targeted an aggressive dictator , left chancellor helmut kohl 's government in a deeply uncomfortable position .
" the kohl government knew they had to contribute to the gulf war due to the principle of allied solidarity , " said karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" but they were at the same time aware of the growing opposition to the war within the electorate . " instead of sending troops to the persian gulf , bonn wrote the coalition partners a check for 17 billion marks -lrb- $ 12 billion , or 8 billion euros -rrb- and supplied logistical support . " we effectively bought ourselves out of the war with our financial contribution , " lamers said . opening pandora 's box the kohl government had been politically and legally boxed into a corner .
on top of vehement public opposition , the government faced a constitution that sanctioned war only in self-defense .
and since saddam hussein had neither attacked germany nor the nato allies , direct german military participation in the conflict was off-limits .
in an effort to reconcile germany 's laws with its international obligations , the center-right christian democratic union called for the " clarification " of two conflicting constitutional articles .
article 87 gave germany the right to field an army for national defense .
but article 24 also permitted germany to join collective security organizations to preserve world peace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faced a quandary during the 1991 gulf war many conservatives argued that article 24 sanctioned german participation in multilateral military operations - with or without a un mandate - that were not directly related to territorial defense . " the claim that the constitution forbids the german armed forces from participating in these kinds of deployments is a legal facade that hides the real political issue , " lamers said .
" in reality it was about the unwillingness and the incapability of the large majority of german citizens and voters to participate in warlike measures . "
partisan firestorm as the governing christian democrats pushed the constitutional question , the opposition social democrats faced internal divisions .
the party base limited its support to un peacekeeping missions while a small elite favored more aggressive military operations like the gulf war .
" the foreign and security policy experts actually wanted such operations as an option , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" but we could n't move our own parliamentary faction because they said the constitution did n't allow such operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boutros boutros-ghali asked germany to send peacekeepers to somalia meanwhile , the pacifist green party rejected military intervention in virtually any form .
" we feared the conservatives who were in power wanted to reconstruct a classic nation state with the capability to project power , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who later served as deputy foreign minister .
" we believed that non-military measures should be developed and given priority . "
even the christian democrats ' own coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , expressed reservations about operations without a un mandate .
fait accompli but world events overshadowed the partisan debate in germany .
the dust had hardly settled in the persian gulf when devastating civil wars broke out in yugoslavia and somalia .
in an attempt to contain violence in southeastern europe , nato and the west european union - a european defense organization - imposed a sea and air blockade on yugoslavia .
nato deployed awacs radar planes to patrol the skies of the balkan war zone .
with germans serving in the multinational crews that manned these aircraft , participation in the blockade was a foregone conclusion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , the constitutional court was asked to decide " we could n't just pull out , " lamers said .
" we were part of a larger whole and were not really free .
we would have risked enormous damage to our image and influence . "
while nato tried to stem the tide of violence in yugoslavia , the un sanctioned a us-led peacekeeping mission to stabilize somalia .
in a trip to bonn , then-un secretary general boutros boutros-ghali personally asked the german government to send peacekeepers to the war-torn east african nation .
with the political parties still in gridlock over the constitutional question , the kohl government decided to act without parliamentary approval .
kohl deployed ships and aircraft to yugoslavia and more than 1,000 soldiers to somalia .
foreign policy on trial politically outmaneuvered , the social democrats sued the kohl government in the federal constitutional court .
yet the party 's foreign and security policy experts worked with the government behind the scenes , according to voigt .
both the opposition and the government wanted to put the constitutional question to rest .
and since parliament could not reach a compromise , they agreed to resolve the political controversy in court .
" we internally agreed to create a case on un operations -lsb- somalia -rsb- , a case on nato operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- and a case on west european union operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- , " voigt said .
" the federal government conducted these operations , and we filed suits against them . "
however , the kohl government almost became a casualty of the legal battle when its coalition partner - the free democrats - sued it over the nato air blockade .
germany 's government now faced an uncertain future as the judges deliberated .
the kohl government dodged a bullet when the federal constitutional court ruled that germany could participate in un , nato and weu military operations worldwide .
but there was an important caveat : these operations had to be approved by a simple parliamentary majority . " we had to slowly learn that we 're a country that represents interests , and that we 're an ally and that carries consequences , " klose said .
" that was a tremendously difficult learning process that has in no way come to an end . "

in part two of a three-part series , dw examines how the country returned to military action in the balkans . war returned to germany 's doorstep when yugoslavia imploded in ethnic violence .
during the winter of 1994 , german officials agonized over whether to participate in a nato-led military intervention aimed at containing the war .
although the nation 's highest court had declared such interventions constitutional , germany remained deeply reluctant to use military force for any reason other than defense .
but enormous political and moral pressure pushed the kohl government and the opposition toward a shaky consensus in favor of military action against serbia .
this consensus faced its trial-by-fire when the social democrats and greens took the reins of power in 1998 .
in a twist of fate , the traditionally antiwar parties ordered germany 's first offensive military strike since world war ii .
the war next door by the fall of 1994 , the war in yugoslavia had reached a boiling point as serb forces began targeting nato aircraft and un peacekeepers .
the nato allies feared the worst and drew up plans to rescue the lightly armed peacekeepers in the event that the serbs launched an all-out attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl dragged his feet to avoid intervening in yugoslavia .
as nato prepared for a showdown , germany dragged its feet .
chancellor helmut kohl argued that since the third reich had occupied yugoslavia , it would be historically inappropriate for germany to intervene in the current conflict .
kohl was trying to prevent germany from getting involved in the conflict too quickly , according to karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats .
" that was an ineffectual attempt to throw up a firewall , " lamers said .
" kohl was much too intelligent to think that it would hold .
but it fit the disposition among the german people . "
kohl 's firewall began crumbling as the arrival of bosnian refugees started impacting german domestic politics , according to lamers .
and as the humanitarian situation worsened , nato began to lose its patience with bonn .
the allies pressured germany to send its tornado warplanes into the bosnian firestorm .
the tornados had a unique capability to locate and destroy serb radar installations , which would help cover a possible un withdrawal .
germany was the only european country that possessed such aircraft .
ultimately , strategic realities trumped political rhetoric and the kohl government assented to nato 's request .
but germany 's deeply divided parliament still had to approve the decision .
" you can always argue about the sense of using military force , because you never know what the result will be .
that 's the risk , " lamers said .
" but when all the countries in the community that we belong to say its necessary , we ca n't just say ' count me out . " '
winning the home front for the first time since the world war ii , a german government had decided to deploy its military to a war zone .
unwilling to shoulder the full political and moral responsibility for its historic decision , the kohl government reached out to the opposition social democrats and greens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the greens ' joschka fischer said force was justified to stop genocide the bosnian quagmire had thrown the social democratic party into an uproar .
the antiwar mainstream feared embarking down a slippery slope that could lead the country away from its peaceful foreign policy .
but a more hawkish minority supported using force as a last resort to rescue the un peacekeepers and stop the ethnic cleansing .
" in a 10-to-1 vote , the foreign and security policy experts supported the government 's proposal , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" we knew that the party had a different opinion .
there was considerable uproar .
in the end , around 50 social democrats voted with the government in favor of the bosnian mission and against their own party . "
green revolution as social democrats inched closer to the kohl government , the greens were facing a crisis of conscience that threatened to tear their party in two .
traditionally , the green party advocated a pacifist foreign policy rooted in the peaceful resolution of conflicts through international institutions like the un .
but the un 's failure to stop the ethnic cleansing in bosnia led to an ideological revolution within certain quarters of the party .
after serb forces massacred thousands of bosnian muslims in the town of srebrenica , green party whip joschka fischer declared that force was justified to stop genocide .
" with the balkan wars we realized for the first time that there are situations in which one has to intervene militarily , " said ludger volmer , former president of the green party who went on to serve as the country 's deputy foreign minister . " that was a difficult learning process . "
this learning process would end with the bundestag sending tornado warplanes as well as peacekeepers to bosnia .
against the historical and political odds , germany 's divided parties had forged a shaky consensus in favor of military intervention .
peaceniks in power after serving 16 years in the opposition , the social democrats and greens defeated the kohl government in the 1998 elections .
no sooner had the left-of-center coalition come to power than renewed ethnic violence erupted in yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's air war against serbia was an allied intervention while nato peacekeepers secured the precarious peace in bosnia , the breakaway province of kosovo careened toward war as ethnic albanians demanded independence from serbia .
germany and its nato allies pushed for a peaceful settlement .
but negotiations collapsed when both sides refused to compromise on kosovo 's political status .
in anticipation of this worst-case scenario , the kohl government had committed germany to participate in a nato air war against serbia .
now , social democratic chancellor gerhard schroeder and green party foreign minister joschka fischer had to decide whether they would honor their predecessor 's commitment .
air strikes hardly squared with the coalition 's platform of a foreign policy rooted in peaceful conflict resolution .
bombing belgrade when the security council stalled over russian and chinese objections , nato decided to launch its air war without a un mandate .
the nato allies accused serbia of ethnic cleansing and argued that time was of the essence in order to save innocent lives .
schroeder and fischer faced a nightmare scenario : an allied military intervention without un sanction .
" the new schroeder-fischer government agreed to participate for purely opportune reasons , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert and parliamentarian within the social democratic party .
" they knew that if they did n't participate , they would face foreign policy isolation from the outset .
that 's what i call the joke of history .
the german position changed irrevocably because the government had no choice but to say yes . "
with deep reservations , the former antiwar opposition ordered warplanes to bomb belgrade in germany 's first overt military strike since world war ii .
the shaky foreign policy consensus forged during the bosnian crisis had survived its trial-by-fire in kosovo .
" germany is not a military power and it does n't want to become one , " volmer said .
" you can not help but recognize that there are some conflicts for which you have to arm yourself and that there may be situations in which you have to intervene militarily .
but at its very core , germany has a remote relationship to armed force .
that 's a lesson from the second world war , from history . "

there are no easy answers but experts agree on one thing – climate education is in dire need of improvement . everyone is talking about climate change .
in recent years , global warming has been the subject of extensive research , press reports and conferences .
following the un climate summit in mexico earlier this month , the environmental question of the century would appear to be widely understood .
but impressions can be deceptive , and as a recent eu commission survey revealed , one quarter of europeans are climate skeptics .
almost half admit that they are inadequately informed about global warming .
“ there is broad superficial understanding , but to probe a little deeper is to reveal great gaps in the public knowledge , ” udo kuckartz of the university of marburg said .
“ we need new models for climate education , new approaches which turn environmental knowledge into environmental action . ”
from knowledge to action that leads to an important question - how can teachers address climate change in classrooms in a way that actually leads people to change their behavior and switch to a low-carbon lifestyle ?
educators and psychologists all over the globe are currently seeking answers to that question .
and in order to find them , they first need to establish which teaching models are already in use and which of them have proved successful in schools , universities and in further education .
bildunterschrift : learning by doing : children plant trees in flood-prone bangladesh gerhard de haan , a professor at the free university in berlin , says the greatest range of learning opportunities is in adult education .
he stresses the importance of grant programs , such as the one run by the humboldt foundation to encourage young researchers from developing and emerging nations to spend a year working on climate and energy projects at german universities .
“ such approaches are particularly effective because they are aimed at disseminators and come at it from an economic angle , ” de haan said .
“ foundations , companies and governments ought to offer many more grant programs . ”
udo kuckartz says there are already some signs that that is the way things are going .
“ there has been a lot of progress , often from large companies , ” he said .
but it is not only private enterprises that are seizing the initiative .
sometimes , as in the case of denmark which staged the un climate conference at the end of last year , governments offer grants to encourage foreign students to come to their country and learn about wind power or environmental engineering or chemistry .
new environmental programs over the past decade , kuckartz says , there 's been a huge increase in the number of environment related courses .
most , however , focus on climate and energy issues .
“ they are almost always scientific or environmental management programs , ” he said , adding that there are few which look at the issues from a sociological point of view .
two exceptions are a program about environment and education , at the rostock university in eastern germany , and another at berlin 's freie university , which looks at research in the future .
bildunterschrift : games are one way of teaching kids the links between climate change and species protection gerhard de haan believes schools could and should be doing more to enhance a general level of understanding of the issues surrounding climate change among children .
he points out that climate change is usually addressed only in geography classes in germany but says that it is actually “ increasingly being marginalized . ”
and in subjects such as biology , politics or social studies , teachers are by no means obliged to include climate issues and sustainability in the curriculum .
that partly has to do with germany 's federal structure in which each of the 16 states determine the content of the education they offer .
but that 's not the only reason .
experts say teachers themselves are not taught enough about climate issues during their own training .
in some places , there are regional initiatives which promote climate education in school and therefore try to get teachers up to speed .
a group of charities has teamed up with the german government to launch a further education program for teachers from the states of hesse , saarland and rhineland-palatinate .
but such schemes , which are often backed by unesco , are rare .
“ they only reach a maximum of five percent of schools , ” kuckartz said .
us the model for climate reporting the shortcomings on addressing climate change are n't just confined to the classrooms .
the media too are to blame .

there are no easy answers but experts agree on one thing – climate education is in dire need of improvement . everyone is talking about climate change .
in recent years , global warming has been the subject of extensive research , press reports and conferences .
following the un climate summit in mexico earlier this month , the environmental question of the century would appear to be widely understood .
but impressions can be deceptive , and as a recent eu commission survey revealed , one quarter of europeans are climate skeptics .
almost half admit that they are inadequately informed about global warming .
“ there is broad superficial understanding , but to probe a little deeper is to reveal great gaps in the public knowledge , ” udo kuckartz of the university of marburg said .
“ we need new models for climate education , new approaches which turn environmental knowledge into environmental action . ”
from knowledge to action that leads to an important question - how can teachers address climate change in classrooms in a way that actually leads people to change their behavior and switch to a low-carbon lifestyle ?
educators and psychologists all over the globe are currently seeking answers to that question .
and in order to find them , they first need to establish which teaching models are already in use and which of them have proved successful in schools , universities and in further education .
bildunterschrift : learning by doing : children plant trees in flood-prone bangladesh gerhard de haan , a professor at the free university in berlin , says the greatest range of learning opportunities is in adult education .
he stresses the importance of grant programs , such as the one run by the humboldt foundation to encourage young researchers from developing and emerging nations to spend a year working on climate and energy projects at german universities .
“ such approaches are particularly effective because they are aimed at disseminators and come at it from an economic angle , ” de haan said .
“ foundations , companies and governments ought to offer many more grant programs . ”
udo kuckartz says there are already some signs that that is the way things are going .
“ there has been a lot of progress , often from large companies , ” he said .
but it is not only private enterprises that are seizing the initiative .
sometimes , as in the case of denmark which staged the un climate conference at the end of last year , governments offer grants to encourage foreign students to come to their country and learn about wind power or environmental engineering or chemistry .
new environmental programs over the past decade , kuckartz says , there 's been a huge increase in the number of environment related courses .
most , however , focus on climate and energy issues .
“ they are almost always scientific or environmental management programs , ” he said , adding that there are few which look at the issues from a sociological point of view .
two exceptions are a program about environment and education , at the rostock university in eastern germany , and another at berlin 's freie university , which looks at research in the future .
bildunterschrift : games are one way of teaching kids the links between climate change and species protection gerhard de haan believes schools could and should be doing more to enhance a general level of understanding of the issues surrounding climate change among children .
he points out that climate change is usually addressed only in geography classes in germany but says that it is actually “ increasingly being marginalized . ”
and in subjects such as biology , politics or social studies , teachers are by no means obliged to include climate issues and sustainability in the curriculum .
that partly has to do with germany 's federal structure in which each of the 16 states determine the content of the education they offer .
but that 's not the only reason .
experts say teachers themselves are not taught enough about climate issues during their own training .
in some places , there are regional initiatives which promote climate education in school and therefore try to get teachers up to speed .
a group of charities has teamed up with the german government to launch a further education program for teachers from the states of hesse , saarland and rhineland-palatinate .
but such schemes , which are often backed by unesco , are rare .
“ they only reach a maximum of five percent of schools , ” kuckartz said .
us the model for climate reporting the shortcomings on addressing climate change are n't just confined to the classrooms .
the media too are to blame .
experts say journalists - the main conduits for climate information reaching the masses – could also do with greater training in environmental issues .
unlike america , there are few universities and journalism schools in europe that offer courses on climate reporting .
across the atlantic , the picture is altogether more rounded ; there are already a number of environmental journalism programs on offer , and the society of environmental journalists -lrb- sej -rrb- is constantly working towards improving the standard of reporting on the subject .
that said , things are slowly improving in europe too .
programs such as deutsche welle 's annual global media forum in bonn is the largest european event of its kind .
its aim is to help journalists deepen their knowledge and sharpen their skills on issues surrounding global climate change .

the case recalls the murder of former russian agent alexander litvinenko in 2006 . german prosecutors say they are investigating the possibility that a russian dissident couple living in germany could be the victims of a poisoning attack .
the news magazine focus reported earlier that the couple alerted police because they believed they were the target of an attack .
the magazine said that the couple , viktor and marina kalashnikov , had abnormally high concentrations of mercury in their blood .
the magazine said both have suffered health problems and that medical experts have recommended that the couple undergo further tests and be watched closely .
mercury poisoning can lead to kidney failure and problems with speech .
kremlin critics the kalashnikovs , who are journalists , have written articles in which they criticize the kremlin , especially its policy in chechnya .
they came to germany in september and now live in berlin .
they told focus they were sure the russian secret service was behind the suspected attack .
prosecutors said the case was being handled by a department specializing in politically motivated crimes .

we should concentrate more on separating development work from military deployment . "
koenigs ' comments come just weeks after german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg called for troops in crisis regions to work more closely with humanitarian aid agencies on the ground .
targeting aid workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is still rebuilding the most recent victim of the insurgency , an engineer working as an advisor to the german development bank kfw , was fatally wounded while travelling in a vehicle with three colleagues .
one of the colleagues , an afghan translator , was also injured in the attack .
the kfw advisor is the latest in a series of aid workers to be targeted in afghanistan this year , which has seen a spike in the number deaths of civilian development workers .
attacks directed at un employees working in afghanistan have increased by more than 130 percent in 2010 compared to last year , according to the united nations department of safety and security .
in another high-profile case from september , aid worker linda norgrove of scotland was taken hostage and later killed during a us-led operation to secure her release .
she had been working for the american-based organization development alternatives inc .
risks ever-present kieran dwyer of the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan said his organization attempts to minimize risks for development workers by remaining in constant contact with civilian and government leaders about possible risks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister dirk niebel called the attack on the aid worker " cowardly " " but the security risks can only be mitigated by the way we operate , not eliminated , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's important to remember that not just foreign aid workers but also afghan aid and government workers are targeted by insurgents .
it is not only the rising number of attacks that concerns dwyer .
" insurgents also began to target more regions of the country in the last year , often attacking the so-called soft targets of unarmed government and humanitarian workers , " he added .
germany has 4,800 troops in afghanistan , most of whom are serving in the north of the country , where the attack on the kfw consultant took place .
berlin is to begin reducing troop numbers in afghanistan by the end of 2011 , and to pull out of the country completely within four years . author : greg wiser -lrb- dpa -rrb- editor : sophie tarr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics say the intiative may see higher prices at the pump and cause damage to the environment . as of january 1 , 2011 , german drivers will have the option to fuel up their cars with new super e10 , a biofuel with higher ethanol content .
the change is part of germany 's plan to incrementally decrease its carbon emissions , with the goal of an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
but for everyday german drivers , the cost of the new biofuel is still a relative unknown , and the subject of much speculation .
previously , biofuel in germany only had five percent ethanol content , whereas e10 packs a solid 10 percent ethanol , an increase that should prove more environmentally friendly .
the federal ministry for the environment , nature conservation and nuclear safety -lrb- bmu -rrb- estimates that around 90 percent of existing german cars will be e10-compatible .
those vehicles unable to run on e10 can keep using the five percent variety until it is phased out in 2013 .
e10 will be available from the more than 14,000 service stations throughout the country as of the first of the year .
according to the bmu , the higher ethanol gasoline will have a decreased impact on the environment in terms of carbon emissions and will reduce consumer reliance on diminishing oil reserves .
the initiative is also designed to bring germany into compliance with a european commission directive seeking an eu-wide greenhouse gas emission savings of 60 percent from 2018 onwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while they disagree on how much , most parties say e10 will cost more than regular gas more ethanol means more cost the cost to the consumer is one contentious issue that is being batted around between the various groups interested in the project .
as the cost of producing ethanol biofuel is higher than regular gasoline , the bmu expects the price at the pump to increase slightly as well .
" with the introduction of e10 come additional costs for the production of bioethanol and the maintenance of fuel quality , " the ministry said .
but the german association for the biofuel industry contended that prices will not increase significantly .
" ethanol will not be much more expensive than gasoline , " association president claus sauter told press agency dpa .
" in addition , the petroleum industry itself is interested in selling e10 , because it is legally obliged to bring biofuels to market . "
on the other side of the issue , the spokesman for bp europe told bonn 's general anzeiger newspaper , " for drivers , the price will always be higher , " estimating an increased cost of 50 percent over normal petrol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as food crops are replaced by biofuel production , the cost in carbon increases cost to the environment another bone of contention is the actual environmental impact of the new biofuel due to something called indirect land use .
this is essentially the consequence of changing the use of land in order to produce crops used in biofuel production .
as more arable land is used to produce biofuel , the increased land clearance to grow food crops has the knock-on effect of higher carbon emissions .
originally , the commission had anticipated enacting its directive 98/70 / ec , requiring member states to report on the greenhouse gas intensity of fuel and energy , starting on january 1 , 2011 .
according to the directive , suppliers are required to gradually reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent by the end of 2020 at the latest .
but shortly before the january kick-off date for the initiative , the european commission published a report on indirect land use change related to biofuels .
it found that the ramifications of indirect land use required more investigation before it could proceed with the directive .
" the potential effects of indirect land use need to be properly weighed in our biofuels policy .
it is in our interest to investigate this seriously and ensure legislation that avoids negative side effects , " energy commissioner guenther oettinger said .
the result of its findings led the commission to delay its biofuel directive until july of 2011 .
in germany , however , the bmu claims that many of the required elements for biofuel production are locally and sustainably grown .

in 1806 , hegel described him as an iconic " world-soul , " and even his enemies could not quite shake off the fascination for the emperor who at first seemed to be invincible .
but poets and artists of his time also portrayed napoleon as a heartless warmonger , a ridiculous caricature , and even as satan 's eldest son .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show examines the emperor from various angles in " napoleon and europe , dream and trauma " the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany takes on napoleon in the context of his time .
the exhibition gives visitors with a critical and multifaceted look at a challenging topic .

the most recent is pirateleaks.cz , launched by the czech pirate party . in the aftermath of the latest releases of information of secret documents by the infamous wikileaks , a crop of clones have popped up in europe .
one has been seeded by ex-wikileaks staffers , others were simply inspired by the original , but all of them want to make a difference .
wikileaks clones include the forthcoming openleaks in germany , with former wikileaks staffer , daniel domscheit-berg at the helm .
openleaks aims to democratize the process of leaking information and whistle-blowing and support the introduction of new legislation defending the rights of whistle-blowers .
other such websites include brusselsleaks.com , balkanleaks.eu , rospil.info and indoleaks.org , each hoping to blow the lid on corruption and secret documents in the european union , the balkans , russia and indonesia respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other sites , such as openleaks in germany plan to tackle transparency pirates of the czech republic in a café in prague , the public face of another secret whistle-blowing website demonstrated such a product to deutsche welle .
the czech pirate party announced earlier this month that it had created a new secret-leaking site called pirateleaks and it aims to do the same thing as wikileaks , only focusing in the czech republic .
the aim of the site is to encourage transparency in czech government .
" our sources are people who work with documents in the authorities , are journalists who are afraid to publish these documents because of political reasons , and are simply members of the public , " spokesman jakub michalek said .
the creators of pirateleaks will be hoping all those sources supply them with evidence of corruption .
the small amount of information released since this week 's launch has n't exactly rocked the czech political establishment – though the site has ruffled a few feathers , michalek added .
" the politicians are afraid to say that this is a bad thing , because we are working exactly in accordance with the law , " he said . " but on the other side there were also reactions like , ' this is outrageous , this should be banned , the site should be closed immediately . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirateleaks.cz wants to fight corruption within czech government members of the media who have been reporting on corruption within the czech republic welcomed the new site .
" i think it 's very good that we have another source of information , one that is setting as its goal finding documents that are normally not available , " prague-based journalist erik best told deutsche welle .
" and i think with the impetus , with the excitement in the west and all over the world with wikileaks , that connection is going to be a big benefit for the site . "
data protection in sweden pirateleaks next goal is to locate its servers in sweden , with either a fellow pirate organization or prq , the same hosting service that maintains wikileaks ' servers there .
prq prides itself on requiring hardly any personal information from its clients .
" we would like to move to sweden or a different place that is much safer , as soon as possible , " michalek said .
" because the services that we can get in sweden with a pirate isp , or the prq company , are much better , we can get a safer connection .
things can be with more anonymity than we can get here in the czech republic . "

the most recent is pirateleaks.cz , launched by the czech pirate party . in the aftermath of the latest releases of information of secret documents by the infamous wikileaks , a crop of clones have popped up in europe .
one has been seeded by ex-wikileaks staffers , others were simply inspired by the original , but all of them want to make a difference .
wikileaks clones include the forthcoming openleaks in germany , with former wikileaks staffer , daniel domscheit-berg at the helm .
openleaks aims to democratize the process of leaking information and whistle-blowing and support the introduction of new legislation defending the rights of whistle-blowers .
other such websites include brusselsleaks.com , balkanleaks.eu , rospil.info and indoleaks.org , each hoping to blow the lid on corruption and secret documents in the european union , the balkans , russia and indonesia respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other sites , such as openleaks in germany plan to tackle transparency pirates of the czech republic in a café in prague , the public face of another secret whistle-blowing website demonstrated such a product to deutsche welle .
the czech pirate party announced earlier this month that it had created a new secret-leaking site called pirateleaks and it aims to do the same thing as wikileaks , only focusing in the czech republic .
the aim of the site is to encourage transparency in czech government .
" our sources are people who work with documents in the authorities , are journalists who are afraid to publish these documents because of political reasons , and are simply members of the public , " spokesman jakub michalek said .
the creators of pirateleaks will be hoping all those sources supply them with evidence of corruption .
the small amount of information released since this week 's launch has n't exactly rocked the czech political establishment – though the site has ruffled a few feathers , michalek added .
" the politicians are afraid to say that this is a bad thing , because we are working exactly in accordance with the law , " he said . " but on the other side there were also reactions like , ' this is outrageous , this should be banned , the site should be closed immediately . " '

moscow said claims of selective justice were " unacceptable . " russia has reacted to criticism over monday 's new guilty verdict against the jailed former oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky by telling the european union and the united states to stay out of its affairs . " we expect everyone to mind his own business , both at home and in the international arena , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" attempts to put pressure on the proceedings are unacceptable , " the ministry said , using unusually blunt language for a diplomatic statement .
khodorkovsky was convicted on monday of stealing oil from his former company , yukos , between 1999 and 2003 and laundering the proceeds .
the conviction drew international criticism , with the united states saying it was " deeply concerned " about the " selective application of justice . "
germany said the verdict was a step backwards for russia , while france called for the rule of law to be respected .
khodorkovsky vs putin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and khodorkovsky are seen as personal rivals critics and human rights activists regard the trial as having been politically motivated .
they say the aim is to sideline khodorkovsky because he financed opposition parties . once the richest man in russia , he was convicted of fraud in 2003 and sentenced to prison .
his jail term was due to expire in 2011 .
khodorkovsky is an outspoken opponent of russian prime minister vladimir putin , who was the country 's president when khodorkovsky was initially convicted .
the new prison sentence could put him behind bars beyond the 2012 presidential elections .
if the court follows the prosecutors ' calls , he could stay in jail until 2017 .
vladimir putin is widely expected to run again for the presidency in 2012 .
he served two terms in that office , from 2000 to 2008 .
the constitution barred him from serving a third , consecutive term .
however , from 2012 putin could again serve as president for another two terms .
full verdict expected by friday the reading of the full verdict is ongoing and expected to be completed by the end of the week , at the earliest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as yukos chief , khodorkovsky was the richest man in russia khodorkovsky 's defense team suggested the verdict would be pronounced on friday .
as the first 10 days of january are vacation days in russia , no newspapers will be published that could question the court 's impartiality . in a statement released on khodorkovsky 's website , he and his co-defendant , platon lebedev , thanked their supporters for protesting outside the court building .

this has triggered a copyright discussion in germany . german copyright rules require anyone who copies sheet music pay fees to germany 's music licensing agency , gema .
the organization has begun notifying kindergartens and other preschool facilities that if they reproduce music to be sung or performed , they must pay for a license .
" if a preschool wants to make its own copy of certain music - if the words of a song or the musical score is copied - then they need to buy a license , " gema spokesperson peter hempel told deutsche welle .
the rules have been in place for 25 years , but they have only recently drawn attention .
gema began at the beginning of 2010 to send out reminders to daycare centers stressing that they need to sign contracts before making copies of sheet music for the children to sing from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if copies of music are made , the fee needs to be paid gema said that the need for licenses would not have any effect on singing in kindergartens .
" it does n't cost anything to sing in kindergartens , " said peter hempel .
" if a kindergarten or school does not make any copies of music , then of course they do n't need to pay anything . "

there are no easy answers but experts agree on one thing – climate education is in dire need of improvement . everyone is talking about climate change .
in recent years , global warming has been the subject of extensive research , press reports and conferences .
following the un climate summit in mexico earlier this month , the environmental question of the century would appear to be widely understood .
but impressions can be deceptive , and as a recent eu commission survey revealed , one quarter of europeans are climate skeptics .
almost half admit that they are inadequately informed about global warming .
“ there is broad superficial understanding , but to probe a little deeper is to reveal great gaps in the public knowledge , ” udo kuckartz of the university of marburg said .
“ we need new models for climate education , new approaches which turn environmental knowledge into environmental action . ”
from knowledge to action that leads to an important question - how can teachers address climate change in classrooms in a way that actually leads people to change their behavior and switch to a low-carbon lifestyle ?
educators and psychologists all over the globe are currently seeking answers to that question .
and in order to find them , they first need to establish which teaching models are already in use and which of them have proved successful in schools , universities and in further education .
bildunterschrift : learning by doing : children plant trees in flood-prone bangladesh gerhard de haan , a professor at the free university in berlin , says the greatest range of learning opportunities is in adult education .
he stresses the importance of grant programs , such as the one run by the humboldt foundation to encourage young researchers from developing and emerging nations to spend a year working on climate and energy projects at german universities .
“ such approaches are particularly effective because they are aimed at disseminators and come at it from an economic angle , ” de haan said .
“ foundations , companies and governments ought to offer many more grant programs . ”
udo kuckartz says there are already some signs that that is the way things are going .
“ there has been a lot of progress , often from large companies , ” he said .
but it is not only private enterprises that are seizing the initiative .
sometimes , as in the case of denmark which staged the un climate conference at the end of last year , governments offer grants to encourage foreign students to come to their country and learn about wind power or environmental engineering or chemistry .
new environmental programs over the past decade , kuckartz says , there 's been a huge increase in the number of environment related courses .
most , however , focus on climate and energy issues .
“ they are almost always scientific or environmental management programs , ” he said , adding that there are few which look at the issues from a sociological point of view .
two exceptions are a program about environment and education , at the rostock university in eastern germany , and another at berlin 's freie university , which looks at research in the future .
bildunterschrift : games are one way of teaching kids the links between climate change and species protection gerhard de haan believes schools could and should be doing more to enhance a general level of understanding of the issues surrounding climate change among children .
he points out that climate change is usually addressed only in geography classes in germany but says that it is actually “ increasingly being marginalized . ”
and in subjects such as biology , politics or social studies , teachers are by no means obliged to include climate issues and sustainability in the curriculum .
that partly has to do with germany 's federal structure in which each of the 16 states determine the content of the education they offer .
but that 's not the only reason .
experts say teachers themselves are not taught enough about climate issues during their own training .
in some places , there are regional initiatives which promote climate education in school and therefore try to get teachers up to speed .
a group of charities has teamed up with the german government to launch a further education program for teachers from the states of hesse , saarland and rhineland-palatinate .
but such schemes , which are often backed by unesco , are rare .
“ they only reach a maximum of five percent of schools , ” kuckartz said .

the media too are to blame .
experts say journalists - the main conduits for climate information reaching the masses – could also do with greater training in environmental issues .

across the atlantic , the picture is altogether more rounded ; there are already a number of environmental journalism programs on offer , and the society of environmental journalists -lrb- sej -rrb- is constantly working towards improving the standard of reporting on the subject .

there are no easy answers but experts agree on one thing – climate education is in dire need of improvement . everyone is talking about climate change .
in recent years , global warming has been the subject of extensive research , press reports and conferences .
following the un climate summit in mexico earlier this month , the environmental question of the century would appear to be widely understood .
but impressions can be deceptive , and as a recent eu commission survey revealed , one quarter of europeans are climate skeptics .
almost half admit that they are inadequately informed about global warming .
“ there is broad superficial understanding , but to probe a little deeper is to reveal great gaps in the public knowledge , ” udo kuckartz of the university of marburg said .
“ we need new models for climate education , new approaches which turn environmental knowledge into environmental action . ”
from knowledge to action that leads to an important question - how can teachers address climate change in classrooms in a way that actually leads people to change their behavior and switch to a low-carbon lifestyle ?
educators and psychologists all over the globe are currently seeking answers to that question .

“ such approaches are particularly effective because they are aimed at disseminators and come at it from an economic angle , ” de haan said .

it ’ s a journey of discovery through 100 years of german motion picture history .
it reveals that which at first appears far away can in reality be so close . “ unforgettable images ” sets out to rediscover great moments from german cinema and , by selecting and arranging scenes from a century of film , help us see the classics in a new light .
the german films of today were only made possible by all the movies that went before .
german film personalities caroline link , doris dörrie , michael ballhaus , tom tykwer , wim wenders , dominik graf , christian petzold , andreas dresen , wolfgang kohlhaase and hanns zischler tell us what films played key roles in their lives and shaped their love and vision of cinema .

“ unforgettable images ” is a subjective approach to film history . it ’ s not so much the history of german film as a story of german film . but what exactly is german about german movies ? reporters michael althen and hans helmut prinzler have a go at answering that question , among others , in their homage to the german cinema . broadcasting hours : part 1 : dw-tv europe / africa sat 15.01.2011 - 18:30 utc sun 16.01.2011 - 06:30 utc mon 17.01.2011 - 12:30 utc berlin utc + 1 -pipe- cape town utc + 2 -pipe- moscow utc + 3 dw-tv north america sat 15.01.2011 - 20:30 utc sun 16.01.2011 - 12:30 utc mon 17.01.2011 - 00:30 utc san francisco utc -8 -pipe- edmonton utc -7 -pipe- new york utc -5 dw-tv latin america sat 15.01.2011 - 20:30 utc sun 16.01.2011 - 04:30 utc caracas utc -4,5 -pipe- la paz utc -4 -pipe- buenos aires utc -3 dw-tv arabia sat 15.01.2011 - 20:30 utc sun 16.01.2011 - 12:30 utc mon 17.01.2011 - 04:30 utc algiers utc + 1 -pipe- cairo utc + 2 -pipe- dubai utc + 4 dw-tv asia sat 15.01.2011 - 18:30 utc sun 16.01.2011 - 06:30 utc delhi utc + 5,5 -pipe- jakarta utc + 7 -pipe- hong kong utc + 8 dw-tv asia + sat 15.01.2011 - 19:00 utc sun 16.01.2011 - 13:00 utc sun 16.01.2011 - 17:00 utc sun 16.01.2011 - 20:30 utc mon 17.01.2011 - 06:30 utc mon 17.01.2011 - 14:30 utc mon 17.01.2011 - 21:30 utc delhi utc + 5,5 -pipe- jakarta utc + 7 -pipe- hong kong utc + 8 1/4 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

competitors from austria , poland and switzerland are considered to be among the favorites . the four hills tournament is a series of four ski jump competitions timed to ring in the new year .
the 59th edition of the competition starts in the german town of oberstdorf on wednesday , followed by the new year 's day jumps in garmisch-partenkirchen .
after that , the tournament moves to austria , with jumps in innsbruck on january 3 and in bishofshofen on january 6 .
at the end of the tournament , the competitor with the best overall score from the four events is declared the winner .
for german fans of ski jumping , it seems ages ago since sven hannawald swept the events of the four hills tournament in the 2001-02 competition .
he became the first ski jumper to win all four events of the tournament , a feat that has yet to be matched .
but if germany 's current form is anything to go by , they 'll be lucky to crack the top-10 in the overall standings , let alone win any of the events .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german pascal bodmer could crack the top 10 " of course we would rather go into the competition as one of the favourites , " said german ski jumping coach werner schuster .
" but it 's our goal for at least one of our ski jumpers to make it into the top 10 . "
the former stars of the german team , martin schmitt and michael uhrmann , are both 32 and not in very good form . schmitt 's best days on the hills may be behind him , but according to coach schuster , due to his experience - schmitt is competing in his 15th four hills tournament - he remains an important part of the team .
with schmitt no longer expected to reach the podium , it will be young up-and-coming ski jumpers such as severin freund and pascal bodmer who will likely be germany 's best hopes for cracking the top 10 . " the young guys are still really coachable , " schuster said .
" they 'll have to show what they can do at the first and second events in particular .
that 's where the wheat is separated from the chaff . "
austria 's morgenstern is the favorite the austrians , with their duo of thomas morgenstern and andreas kofler are considered to be favorites , and are going for their third consecutive overall win . morgenstern is on form , having won four consecutive world cup events this season .
he 's trying to go into the four hills as relaxed as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's thomas morgenstern is one of the favourites " i do n't wrack my brain over winning the tournament , " morgenstern said .
" i still just want to continue to have fun .
ski-jumping is not the most important part in my life . "
kofler , the defending four hills title holder , said he did n't feel any added pressure going into this year 's competition . " i can be calm about it and start with a lot of pleasant anticipation since i 've already won the tournament , " he said .
austria 's national coach , alexander pointer , is quite optimistic about a win .
" we do n't need to be overmodest , " he said .
" i see two exceptional athletes on the ski-jumping circuit at the moment : morgenstern and kofler . "
but there is some bad news for the austrian team as well .
gregor schlierenzauer , who has twice won the ski jumping world championship , will not be able to compete in the first two of the four tournament events due to an injured knee .
" it 's a tough decision for me .
but my head tells me that this is right thing to do for the long-term , " the 20-year-old schlierenzauer said .
schmitt wo n't quit after this year 's season polish ski jumper adam malysz and simon ammann from switzerland have set out to stop the austrian wave of success .
ammann , who has won four olympic titles - including two gold medals in vancouver - has yet to win the four hills tournament .
" the tournament is hugely attractive and its mystique gets bigger and bigger , as my chances of winning get " he said .
" so far , the tournament has been a tough nut to crack for me . "
a maximum of 57,000 euro -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- awaits the winner of the four hills tournament if he ties the record by german ski jumper hannawald .

austria 's national coach , alexander pointer , is quite optimistic about a win .
" we do n't need to be overmodest , " he said .

" it 's a tough decision for me .
but my head tells me that this is right thing to do for the long-term , " the 20-year-old schlierenzauer said .
schmitt wo n't quit after this year 's season polish ski jumper adam malysz and simon ammann from switzerland have set out to stop the austrian wave of success .
ammann , who has won four olympic titles - including two gold medals in vancouver - has yet to win the four hills tournament .
" the tournament is hugely attractive and its mystique gets bigger and bigger , as my chances of winning get " he said .
" so far , the tournament has been a tough nut to crack for me . "

competitors from austria , poland and switzerland are considered to be among the favorites . the four hills tournament is a series of four ski jump competitions timed to ring in the new year .
the 59th edition of the competition starts in the german town of oberstdorf on wednesday , followed by the new year 's day jumps in garmisch-partenkirchen .
after that , the tournament moves to austria , with jumps in innsbruck on january 3 and in bishofshofen on january 6 .
at the end of the tournament , the competitor with the best overall score from the four events is declared the winner .
for german fans of ski jumping , it seems ages ago since sven hannawald swept the events of the four hills tournament in the 2001-02 competition .
he became the first ski jumper to win all four events of the tournament , a feat that has yet to be matched .
but if germany 's current form is anything to go by , they 'll be lucky to crack the top-10 in the overall standings , let alone win any of the events .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german pascal bodmer could crack the top 10 " of course we would rather go into the competition as one of the favourites , " said german ski jumping coach werner schuster .
" but it 's our goal for at least one of our ski jumpers to make it into the top 10 . "
the former stars of the german team , martin schmitt and michael uhrmann , are both 32 and not in very good form . schmitt 's best days on the hills may be behind him , but according to coach schuster , due to his experience - schmitt is competing in his 15th four hills tournament - he remains an important part of the team .
with schmitt no longer expected to reach the podium , it will be young up-and-coming ski jumpers such as severin freund and pascal bodmer who will likely be germany 's best hopes for cracking the top 10 . " the young guys are still really coachable , " schuster said .
" they 'll have to show what they can do at the first and second events in particular .
that 's where the wheat is separated from the chaff . "

competitors from austria , poland and switzerland are considered to be among the favorites . the four hills tournament is a series of four ski jump competitions timed to ring in the new year .
the 59th edition of the competition starts in the german town of oberstdorf on wednesday , followed by the new year 's day jumps in garmisch-partenkirchen .
after that , the tournament moves to austria , with jumps in innsbruck on january 3 and in bishofshofen on january 6 .
at the end of the tournament , the competitor with the best overall score from the four events is declared the winner .
for german fans of ski jumping , it seems ages ago since sven hannawald swept the events of the four hills tournament in the 2001-02 competition .
he became the first ski jumper to win all four events of the tournament , a feat that has yet to be matched .
but if germany 's current form is anything to go by , they 'll be lucky to crack the top-10 in the overall standings , let alone win any of the events .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german pascal bodmer could crack the top 10 " of course we would rather go into the competition as one of the favourites , " said german ski jumping coach werner schuster .
" but it 's our goal for at least one of our ski jumpers to make it into the top 10 . "
the former stars of the german team , martin schmitt and michael uhrmann , are both 32 and not in very good form . schmitt 's best days on the hills may be behind him , but according to coach schuster , due to his experience - schmitt is competing in his 15th four hills tournament - he remains an important part of the team .
with schmitt no longer expected to reach the podium , it will be young up-and-coming ski jumpers such as severin freund and pascal bodmer who will likely be germany 's best hopes for cracking the top 10 . " the young guys are still really coachable , " schuster said .
" they 'll have to show what they can do at the first and second events in particular .
that 's where the wheat is separated from the chaff . "
austria 's morgenstern is the favorite the austrians , with their duo of thomas morgenstern and andreas kofler are considered to be favorites , and are going for their third consecutive overall win . morgenstern is on form , having won four consecutive world cup events this season .
he 's trying to go into the four hills as relaxed as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's thomas morgenstern is one of the favourites " i do n't wrack my brain over winning the tournament , " morgenstern said .
" i still just want to continue to have fun .
ski-jumping is not the most important part in my life . "
kofler , the defending four hills title holder , said he did n't feel any added pressure going into this year 's competition . " i can be calm about it and start with a lot of pleasant anticipation since i 've already won the tournament , " he said .
austria 's national coach , alexander pointer , is quite optimistic about a win .
" we do n't need to be overmodest , " he said .
" i see two exceptional athletes on the ski-jumping circuit at the moment : morgenstern and kofler . "
but there is some bad news for the austrian team as well .
gregor schlierenzauer , who has twice won the ski jumping world championship , will not be able to compete in the first two of the four tournament events due to an injured knee .
" it 's a tough decision for me .
but my head tells me that this is right thing to do for the long-term , " the 20-year-old schlierenzauer said .
schmitt wo n't quit after this year 's season polish ski jumper adam malysz and simon ammann from switzerland have set out to stop the austrian wave of success .
ammann , who has won four olympic titles - including two gold medals in vancouver - has yet to win the four hills tournament .
" the tournament is hugely attractive and its mystique gets bigger and bigger , as my chances of winning get " he said .
" so far , the tournament has been a tough nut to crack for me . "
a maximum of 57,000 euro -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- awaits the winner of the four hills tournament if he ties the record by german ski jumper hannawald .
in addition to the prize money , there will be a car worth some 30,000 euro -lrb- $ 40,000 -rrb- .

but critics say the intiative may see higher prices at the pump and cause damage to the environment . as of january 1 , 2011 , german drivers will have the option to fuel up their cars with new super e10 , a biofuel with higher ethanol content .
the change is part of germany 's plan to incrementally decrease its carbon emissions , with the goal of an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
but for everyday german drivers , the cost of the new biofuel is still a relative unknown , and the subject of much speculation .
previously , biofuel in germany only had five percent ethanol content , whereas e10 packs a solid 10 percent ethanol , an increase that should prove more environmentally friendly .
the federal ministry for the environment , nature conservation and nuclear safety -lrb- bmu -rrb- estimates that around 90 percent of existing german cars will be e10-compatible .
those vehicles unable to run on e10 can keep using the five percent variety until it is phased out in 2013 .
e10 will be available from the more than 14,000 service stations throughout the country as of the first of the year .
according to the bmu , the higher ethanol gasoline will have a decreased impact on the environment in terms of carbon emissions and will reduce consumer reliance on diminishing oil reserves .
the initiative is also designed to bring germany into compliance with a european commission directive seeking an eu-wide greenhouse gas emission savings of 60 percent from 2018 onwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while they disagree on how much , most parties say e10 will cost more than regular gas more ethanol means more cost the cost to the consumer is one contentious issue that is being batted around between the various groups interested in the project .
as the cost of producing ethanol biofuel is higher than regular gasoline , the bmu expects the price at the pump to increase slightly as well .
" with the introduction of e10 come additional costs for the production of bioethanol and the maintenance of fuel quality , " the ministry said .
but the german association for the biofuel industry contended that prices will not increase significantly .
" ethanol will not be much more expensive than gasoline , " association president claus sauter told press agency dpa .
" in addition , the petroleum industry itself is interested in selling e10 , because it is legally obliged to bring biofuels to market . "
on the other side of the issue , the spokesman for bp europe told bonn 's general anzeiger newspaper , " for drivers , the price will always be higher , " estimating an increased cost of 50 percent over normal petrol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as food crops are replaced by biofuel production , the cost in carbon increases cost to the environment another bone of contention is the actual environmental impact of the new biofuel due to something called indirect land use .
this is essentially the consequence of changing the use of land in order to produce crops used in biofuel production .
as more arable land is used to produce biofuel , the increased land clearance to grow food crops has the knock-on effect of higher carbon emissions .
originally , the commission had anticipated enacting its directive 98/70 / ec , requiring member states to report on the greenhouse gas intensity of fuel and energy , starting on january 1 , 2011 .
according to the directive , suppliers are required to gradually reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent by the end of 2020 at the latest .
but shortly before the january kick-off date for the initiative , the european commission published a report on indirect land use change related to biofuels .
it found that the ramifications of indirect land use required more investigation before it could proceed with the directive .
" the potential effects of indirect land use need to be properly weighed in our biofuels policy .
it is in our interest to investigate this seriously and ensure legislation that avoids negative side effects , " energy commissioner guenther oettinger said .
the result of its findings led the commission to delay its biofuel directive until july of 2011 .
in germany , however , the bmu claims that many of the required elements for biofuel production are locally and sustainably grown .

the most recent is pirateleaks.cz , launched by the czech pirate party . in the aftermath of the latest releases of information of secret documents by the infamous wikileaks , a crop of clones have popped up in europe .
one has been seeded by ex-wikileaks staffers , others were simply inspired by the original , but all of them want to make a difference .
wikileaks clones include the forthcoming openleaks in germany , with former wikileaks staffer , daniel domscheit-berg at the helm .
openleaks aims to democratize the process of leaking information and whistle-blowing and support the introduction of new legislation defending the rights of whistle-blowers .
other such websites include brusselsleaks.com , balkanleaks.eu , rospil.info and indoleaks.org , each hoping to blow the lid on corruption and secret documents in the european union , the balkans , russia and indonesia respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other sites , such as openleaks in germany plan to tackle transparency pirates of the czech republic in a café in prague , the public face of another secret whistle-blowing website demonstrated such a product to deutsche welle .
the czech pirate party announced earlier this month that it had created a new secret-leaking site called pirateleaks and it aims to do the same thing as wikileaks , only focusing in the czech republic .
the aim of the site is to encourage transparency in czech government .
" our sources are people who work with documents in the authorities , are journalists who are afraid to publish these documents because of political reasons , and are simply members of the public , " spokesman jakub michalek said .
the creators of pirateleaks will be hoping all those sources supply them with evidence of corruption .
the small amount of information released since this week 's launch has n't exactly rocked the czech political establishment – though the site has ruffled a few feathers , michalek added .
" the politicians are afraid to say that this is a bad thing , because we are working exactly in accordance with the law , " he said . " but on the other side there were also reactions like , ' this is outrageous , this should be banned , the site should be closed immediately . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirateleaks.cz wants to fight corruption within czech government members of the media who have been reporting on corruption within the czech republic welcomed the new site .
" i think it 's very good that we have another source of information , one that is setting as its goal finding documents that are normally not available , " prague-based journalist erik best told deutsche welle .
" and i think with the impetus , with the excitement in the west and all over the world with wikileaks , that connection is going to be a big benefit for the site . "
data protection in sweden pirateleaks next goal is to locate its servers in sweden , with either a fellow pirate organization or prq , the same hosting service that maintains wikileaks ' servers there .
prq prides itself on requiring hardly any personal information from its clients .
" we would like to move to sweden or a different place that is much safer , as soon as possible , " michalek said .
" because the services that we can get in sweden with a pirate isp , or the prq company , are much better , we can get a safer connection .
things can be with more anonymity than we can get here in the czech republic . "

" our sources are people who work with documents in the authorities , are journalists who are afraid to publish these documents because of political reasons , and are simply members of the public , " spokesman jakub michalek said .
the creators of pirateleaks will be hoping all those sources supply them with evidence of corruption .
the small amount of information released since this week 's launch has n't exactly rocked the czech political establishment – though the site has ruffled a few feathers , michalek added .
" the politicians are afraid to say that this is a bad thing , because we are working exactly in accordance with the law , " he said . " but on the other side there were also reactions like , ' this is outrageous , this should be banned , the site should be closed immediately . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirateleaks.cz wants to fight corruption within czech government members of the media who have been reporting on corruption within the czech republic welcomed the new site .
" i think it 's very good that we have another source of information , one that is setting as its goal finding documents that are normally not available , " prague-based journalist erik best told deutsche welle .
" and i think with the impetus , with the excitement in the west and all over the world with wikileaks , that connection is going to be a big benefit for the site . "
data protection in sweden pirateleaks next goal is to locate its servers in sweden , with either a fellow pirate organization or prq , the same hosting service that maintains wikileaks ' servers there .
prq prides itself on requiring hardly any personal information from its clients .
" we would like to move to sweden or a different place that is much safer , as soon as possible , " michalek said .
" because the services that we can get in sweden with a pirate isp , or the prq company , are much better , we can get a safer connection .
things can be with more anonymity than we can get here in the czech republic . "

in 1806 , hegel described him as an iconic " world-soul , " and even his enemies could not quite shake off the fascination for the emperor who at first seemed to be invincible .
but poets and artists of his time also portrayed napoleon as a heartless warmonger , a ridiculous caricature , and even as satan 's eldest son .

" up to now in france , it 's been quite impossible to have a reasonable point of view about napoleon , " robert bresse , director of the musee de l 'armee , told deutsche welle .

but now they have to pay for a license if they want children to perform certain songs . a tightening of copyright rules means kindergartens now have to pay fees to germany 's music licensing agency , gema , to use songs that they reproduce and perform .
the organization has begun notifying creches and other daycare facilities that if they reproduce music to be sung or performed , they must pay for a license .
" if a preschool wants to make its own copy of certain music - if the words of a song or the musical score is copied - then they need to buy a license , " gema spokesperson peter hempel told deutsche welle .
the new rules came into power at the beginning of this year , but have only recently drawn attention as daycare centers have received letters reminding them that they need to sign contracts with gema before distributing sheet music to children to sing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if copies of music are made , the fee needs to be paid gema said that the need for licenses would not have any effect on singing in kindergartens .
" it does n't cost anything to sing in kindergartens , " said peter hempel .
" if a school does not make any copies of music , then of course they do n't need to pay anything . "
traditional songs are copyright-free the copyright rules only concern the rights for modern songs .
songs written by an author who has been dead for over 70 years are automatically in the public domain .
" for old songs , for traditional folk songs for example , it costs nothing , " said hempel .
fees start at 56 euros -lrb- $ 74 -rrb- for 500 copies of a song , a rate charged annually , not per child .
gema - the german abbreviation stands for the society for musical performing and mechanical reproduction rights - exists to make sure that the intellectual property of musicians is protected .
it is the collection agent for another group , vg musikedition , which monitors copyright for musicians and distributes the profits from the licensing fees back to its members .

this has triggered a copyright discussion in germany . german copyright rules require anyone who copies sheet music pay fees to germany 's music licensing agency , gema .
the organization has begun notifying kindergartens and other preschool facilities that if they reproduce music to be sung or performed , they must pay for a license .
" if a preschool wants to make its own copy of certain music - if the words of a song or the musical score is copied - then they need to buy a license , " gema spokesperson peter hempel told deutsche welle .
the rules have been in place for 25 years , but they have only recently drawn attention .
gema began at the beginning of 2010 to send out reminders to daycare centers stressing that they need to sign contracts before making copies of sheet music for the children to sing from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if copies of music are made , the fee needs to be paid gema said that the need for licenses would not have any effect on singing in kindergartens .
" it does n't cost anything to sing in kindergartens , " said peter hempel .
" if a kindergarten or school does not make any copies of music , then of course they do n't need to pay anything . "
traditional songs are copyright-free the copyright rules only concern the rights for modern songs .
songs written by an author who has been dead for over 70 years are automatically in the public domain .
" for old songs , for traditional folk songs for example , it costs nothing , " said hempel .
fees start at 56 euros -lrb- $ 74 -rrb- for 500 copies of a song , a rate charged annually , not per child .
gema - the german abbreviation stands for the society for musical performing and mechanical reproduction rights - exists to make sure that the intellectual property of musicians is protected .
it is the collection agent for another group , vg musikedition , which monitors copyright for musicians and distributes the profits from the licensing fees back to its members .

some commentators fear blurry boundaries are putting aid workers at deadly risk . the killing of an afghanistan-based german aid worker by the taliban over the weekend has sparked calls for a greater and more visible separation between development work and military forces in the country .
former united nations special representative to afghanistan and current member of the german bundestag tom koenigs stressed that aid workers are in more danger than ever .
" the workers ' neutrality is no longer being acknowledged a priori , partly because their work has been politicized more and more in recent years , " koenigs said in an interview with the daily koelner stadtanzeiger .
" the price for that is that the development workers are perceived as part of the war .
we should concentrate more on separating development work from military deployment . "
koenigs ' comments come just weeks after german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg called for troops in crisis regions to work more closely with humanitarian aid agencies on the ground .

one of the colleagues , an afghan translator , was also injured in the attack .
the kfw advisor is the latest in a series of aid workers to be targeted in afghanistan this year , which has seen a spike in the number deaths of civilian development workers .
attacks directed at un employees working in afghanistan have increased by more than 130 percent in 2010 compared to last year , according to the united nations department of safety and security .
in another high-profile case from september , aid worker linda norgrove of scotland was taken hostage and later killed during a us-led operation to secure her release .
she had been working for the american-based organization development alternatives inc .
risks ever-present kieran dwyer of the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan said his organization attempts to minimize risks for development workers by remaining in constant contact with civilian and government leaders about possible risks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister dirk niebel called the attack on the aid worker " cowardly " " but the security risks can only be mitigated by the way we operate , not eliminated , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's important to remember that not just foreign aid workers but also afghan aid and government workers are targeted by insurgents .
it is not only the rising number of attacks that concerns dwyer .
" insurgents also began to target more regions of the country in the last year , often attacking the so-called soft targets of unarmed government and humanitarian workers , " he added .
germany has 4,800 troops in afghanistan , most of whom are serving in the north of the country , where the attack on the kfw consultant took place .

moscow said claims of selective justice were " unacceptable . " russia has reacted to criticism over monday 's new guilty verdict against the jailed former oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky by telling the european union and the united states to stay out of its affairs . " we expect everyone to mind his own business , both at home and in the international arena , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" attempts to put pressure on the proceedings are unacceptable , " the ministry said , using unusually blunt language for a diplomatic statement .
khodorkovsky was convicted on monday of stealing oil from his former company , yukos , between 1999 and 2003 and laundering the proceeds .
the conviction drew international criticism , with the united states saying it was " deeply concerned " about the " selective application of justice . "
germany said the verdict was a step backwards for russia , while france called for the rule of law to be respected .
khodorkovsky vs putin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and khodorkovsky are seen as personal rivals critics and human rights activists regard the trial as having been politically motivated .
they say the aim is to sideline khodorkovsky because he financed opposition parties . once the richest man in russia , he was convicted of fraud in 2003 and sentenced to prison .
his jail term was due to expire in 2011 .
khodorkovsky is an outspoken opponent of russian prime minister vladimir putin , who was the country 's president when khodorkovsky was initially convicted .
the new prison sentence could put him behind bars beyond the 2012 presidential elections .
if the court follows the prosecutors ' calls , he could stay in jail until 2017 .
vladimir putin is widely expected to run again for the presidency in 2012 .
he served two terms in that office , from 2000 to 2008 .
the constitution barred him from serving a third , consecutive term .
however , from 2012 putin could again serve as president for another two terms .
full verdict expected by friday the reading of the full verdict is ongoing and expected to be completed by the end of the week , at the earliest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as yukos chief , khodorkovsky was the richest man in russia khodorkovsky 's defense team suggested the verdict would be pronounced on friday .
as the first 10 days of january are vacation days in russia , no newspapers will be published that could question the court 's impartiality . in a statement released on khodorkovsky 's website , he and his co-defendant , platon lebedev , thanked their supporters for protesting outside the court building .
" power without law is a stool without a leg .
it looks silly and its prospects are predictable , " the statement said .

moscow said claims of selective justice were " unacceptable . " russia has reacted to criticism over monday 's new guilty verdict against the jailed former oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky by telling the european union and the united states to stay out of its affairs . " we expect everyone to mind his own business , both at home and in the international arena , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" attempts to put pressure on the proceedings are unacceptable , " the ministry said , using unusually blunt language for a diplomatic statement .
khodorkovsky was convicted on monday of stealing oil from his former company , yukos , between 1999 and 2003 and laundering the proceeds .
the conviction drew international criticism , with the united states saying it was " deeply concerned " about the " selective application of justice . "

his jail term was due to expire in 2011 .
khodorkovsky is an outspoken opponent of russian prime minister vladimir putin , who was the country 's president when khodorkovsky was initially convicted .
the new prison sentence could put him behind bars beyond the 2012 presidential elections .
if the court follows the prosecutors ' calls , he could stay in jail until 2017 .

the mob injured one soldier with a machete and burned one of the convoy 's vehicles , the un said in a statement . the un human rights council says about 14,000 refugees have fled ivory coast to neighboring liberia over fears of renewed civil war . influential in west africa even before tuesday 's meeting , gbagbo responded to the threat of military force from ecowas by saying it would push ivory coast closer to civil war , and added that there would be consequences for countries that got involved . " he was clearly sending a warning to his neighbors , " paul-simon handy from the institute for strategic studies in south africa told deutsche welle .
" particularly to the leaders of the neighboring countries , saying any involvement in that war will have an impact on your own country . " a military conflict in the ivory coast could have serious consequences for the region .

" there has been a sharp rise in so-called electronic attacks on the networks of german government and local authorities , " he said .
" germany is a very high-tech country with considerable experience and know-how , so of course others will naturally try to get hold of this knowledge - china is playing a large role in this . "

but critics say the intiative may see higher prices at the pump and cause damage to the environment . as of january 1 , 2011 , german drivers will have the option to fuel up their cars with new super e10 , a biofuel with higher ethanol content .
the change is part of germany 's plan to incrementally decrease its carbon emissions , with the goal of an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
but for everyday german drivers , the cost of the new biofuel is still a relative unknown , and the subject of much speculation .
previously , biofuel in germany only had five percent ethanol content , whereas e10 packs a solid 10 percent ethanol , an increase that should prove more environmentally friendly .
the federal ministry for the environment , nature conservation and nuclear safety -lrb- bmu -rrb- estimates that around 90 percent of existing german cars will be e10-compatible .
those vehicles unable to run on e10 can keep using the five percent variety until it is phased out in 2013 .
e10 will be available from the more than 14,000 service stations throughout the country as of the first of the year .
according to the bmu , the higher ethanol gasoline will have a decreased impact on the environment in terms of carbon emissions and will reduce consumer reliance on diminishing oil reserves .
the initiative is also designed to bring germany into compliance with a european commission directive seeking an eu-wide greenhouse gas emission savings of 60 percent from 2018 onwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while they disagree on how much , most parties say e10 will cost more than regular gas more ethanol means more cost the cost to the consumer is one contentious issue that is being batted around between the various groups interested in the project .
as the cost of producing ethanol biofuel is higher than regular gasoline , the bmu expects the price at the pump to increase slightly as well .
" with the introduction of e10 come additional costs for the production of bioethanol and the maintenance of fuel quality , " the ministry said .
but the german association for the biofuel industry contended that prices will not increase significantly .
" ethanol will not be much more expensive than gasoline , " association president claus sauter told press agency dpa .
" in addition , the petroleum industry itself is interested in selling e10 , because it is legally obliged to bring biofuels to market . "
on the other side of the issue , the spokesman for bp europe told bonn 's general anzeiger newspaper , " for drivers , the price will always be higher , " estimating an increased cost of 50 percent over normal petrol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as food crops are replaced by biofuel production , the cost in carbon increases cost to the environment another bone of contention is the actual environmental impact of the new biofuel due to something called indirect land use .
this is essentially the consequence of changing the use of land in order to produce crops used in biofuel production .
as more arable land is used to produce biofuel , the increased land clearance to grow food crops has the knock-on effect of higher carbon emissions .
originally , the commission had anticipated enacting its directive 98/70 / ec , requiring member states to report on the greenhouse gas intensity of fuel and energy , starting on january 1 , 2011 .
according to the directive , suppliers are required to gradually reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent by the end of 2020 at the latest .
but shortly before the january kick-off date for the initiative , the european commission published a report on indirect land use change related to biofuels .
it found that the ramifications of indirect land use required more investigation before it could proceed with the directive .
" the potential effects of indirect land use need to be properly weighed in our biofuels policy .
it is in our interest to investigate this seriously and ensure legislation that avoids negative side effects , " energy commissioner guenther oettinger said .
the result of its findings led the commission to delay its biofuel directive until july of 2011 .
in germany , however , the bmu claims that many of the required elements for biofuel production are locally and sustainably grown .

in part two of a three-part series , dw examines how the country returned to military action in the balkans . war returned to germany 's doorstep when yugoslavia imploded in ethnic violence .
during the winter of 1994 , german officials agonized over whether to participate in a nato-led military intervention aimed at containing the war .
although the nation 's highest court had declared such interventions constitutional , germany remained deeply reluctant to use military force for any reason other than defense .
but enormous political and moral pressure pushed the kohl government and the opposition toward a shaky consensus in favor of military action against serbia .
this consensus faced its trial-by-fire when the social democrats and greens took the reins of power in 1998 .
in a twist of fate , the traditionally antiwar parties ordered germany 's first offensive military strike since world war ii .
the war next door by the fall of 1994 , the war in yugoslavia had reached a boiling point as serb forces began targeting nato aircraft and un peacekeepers .
the nato allies feared the worst and drew up plans to rescue the lightly armed peacekeepers in the event that the serbs launched an all-out attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl dragged his feet to avoid intervening in yugoslavia .
as nato prepared for a showdown , germany dragged its feet .
chancellor helmut kohl argued that since the third reich had occupied yugoslavia , it would be historically inappropriate for germany to intervene in the current conflict .
kohl was trying to prevent germany from getting involved in the conflict too quickly , according to karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats .
" that was an ineffectual attempt to throw up a firewall , " lamers said .
" kohl was much too intelligent to think that it would hold .
but it fit the disposition among the german people . "
kohl 's firewall began crumbling as the arrival of bosnian refugees started impacting german domestic politics , according to lamers .
and as the humanitarian situation worsened , nato began to lose its patience with bonn .
the allies pressured germany to send its tornado warplanes into the bosnian firestorm .
the tornados had a unique capability to locate and destroy serb radar installations , which would help cover a possible un withdrawal .
germany was the only european country that possessed such aircraft .
ultimately , strategic realities trumped political rhetoric and the kohl government assented to nato 's request .
but germany 's deeply divided parliament still had to approve the decision .
" you can always argue about the sense of using military force , because you never know what the result will be .
that 's the risk , " lamers said .
" but when all the countries in the community that we belong to say its necessary , we ca n't just say ' count me out . " '
winning the home front for the first time since the world war ii , a german government had decided to deploy its military to a war zone .
unwilling to shoulder the full political and moral responsibility for its historic decision , the kohl government reached out to the opposition social democrats and greens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the greens ' joschka fischer said force was justified to stop genocide the bosnian quagmire had thrown the social democratic party into an uproar .
the antiwar mainstream feared embarking down a slippery slope that could lead the country away from its peaceful foreign policy .
but a more hawkish minority supported using force as a last resort to rescue the un peacekeepers and stop the ethnic cleansing .
" in a 10-to-1 vote , the foreign and security policy experts supported the government 's proposal , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" we knew that the party had a different opinion .
there was considerable uproar .
in the end , around 50 social democrats voted with the government in favor of the bosnian mission and against their own party . "
green revolution as social democrats inched closer to the kohl government , the greens were facing a crisis of conscience that threatened to tear their party in two .
traditionally , the green party advocated a pacifist foreign policy rooted in the peaceful resolution of conflicts through international institutions like the un .
but the un 's failure to stop the ethnic cleansing in bosnia led to an ideological revolution within certain quarters of the party .
after serb forces massacred thousands of bosnian muslims in the town of srebrenica , green party whip joschka fischer declared that force was justified to stop genocide .
" with the balkan wars we realized for the first time that there are situations in which one has to intervene militarily , " said ludger volmer , former president of the green party who went on to serve as the country 's deputy foreign minister . " that was a difficult learning process . "
this learning process would end with the bundestag sending tornado warplanes as well as peacekeepers to bosnia .
against the historical and political odds , germany 's divided parties had forged a shaky consensus in favor of military intervention .
peaceniks in power after serving 16 years in the opposition , the social democrats and greens defeated the kohl government in the 1998 elections .
no sooner had the left-of-center coalition come to power than renewed ethnic violence erupted in yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's air war against serbia was an allied intervention while nato peacekeepers secured the precarious peace in bosnia , the breakaway province of kosovo careened toward war as ethnic albanians demanded independence from serbia .
germany and its nato allies pushed for a peaceful settlement .
but negotiations collapsed when both sides refused to compromise on kosovo 's political status .
in anticipation of this worst-case scenario , the kohl government had committed germany to participate in a nato air war against serbia .
now , social democratic chancellor gerhard schroeder and green party foreign minister joschka fischer had to decide whether they would honor their predecessor 's commitment .
air strikes hardly squared with the coalition 's platform of a foreign policy rooted in peaceful conflict resolution .
bombing belgrade when the security council stalled over russian and chinese objections , nato decided to launch its air war without a un mandate .
the nato allies accused serbia of ethnic cleansing and argued that time was of the essence in order to save innocent lives .
schroeder and fischer faced a nightmare scenario : an allied military intervention without un sanction .
" the new schroeder-fischer government agreed to participate for purely opportune reasons , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert and parliamentarian within the social democratic party .
" they knew that if they did n't participate , they would face foreign policy isolation from the outset .
that 's what i call the joke of history .
the german position changed irrevocably because the government had no choice but to say yes . "
with deep reservations , the former antiwar opposition ordered warplanes to bomb belgrade in germany 's first overt military strike since world war ii .
the shaky foreign policy consensus forged during the bosnian crisis had survived its trial-by-fire in kosovo .
" germany is not a military power and it does n't want to become one , " volmer said .
" you can not help but recognize that there are some conflicts for which you have to arm yourself and that there may be situations in which you have to intervene militarily .
but at its very core , germany has a remote relationship to armed force .
that 's a lesson from the second world war , from history . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 28.12.2010 germany 's struggle with military power in a changing world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the wall fell , the world changed - and the german military 's role along with it burdened by the genocidal legacy of national socialism , germany swore never again to wage war .
in part one of a three-part series , dw examines how germans overcame historic taboos about deploying their military abroad . in memory of the atrocities committed under the third reich , democratic west germany foreswore war as an instrument of its foreign policy .
its military served a single purpose : to help defend the nato allies in western europe and north america from a soviet attack .
but when the berlin wall fell , the world changed , as did germany 's role within it .
the government of chancellor helmut kohl had just finalized german reunification when a series of conflicts erupted in the persian gulf , yugoslavia and somalia .
as the international community intervened to contain these conflicts , germans faced a historically uncomfortable question : should a reunited and fully sovereign germany become a military power capable of using force on the world stage ? checkbook diplomacy as the us and its coalition partners launched air strikes to eject the iraqi military from kuwait in january 1991 , the streets of germany 's major cities filled with 250,000 protestors who opposed the us-led war against saddam hussein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after reunification , kohl used germany 's checkbook to show solidarity the protests expressed a deep-seated national aversion to war and militarism .
after living at the epicenter of international conflict for an entire century , german society had lost its taste for political violence .
" through the double catastrophe of the two -lsb- world -rsb- wars , the germans transformed themselves from a violent society into a post-heroic society , " said hans-ulrich klose , a bundestag representative and a leading foreign policy expert within the left-of-center social democratic party .
" many germans say that we 're the ones who learned the lessons of history and that others still have to learn those lessons . "
but the germans ' rejection of the american-led coalition , and a un-sanctioned military campaign that targeted an aggressive dictator , left chancellor helmut kohl 's government in a deeply uncomfortable position .
" the kohl government knew they had to contribute to the gulf war due to the principle of allied solidarity , " said karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" but they were at the same time aware of the growing opposition to the war within the electorate . " instead of sending troops to the persian gulf , bonn wrote the coalition partners a check for 17 billion marks -lrb- $ 12 billion , or 8 billion euros -rrb- and supplied logistical support . " we effectively bought ourselves out of the war with our financial contribution , " lamers said . opening pandora 's box the kohl government had been politically and legally boxed into a corner .
on top of vehement public opposition , the government faced a constitution that sanctioned war only in self-defense .
and since saddam hussein had neither attacked germany nor the nato allies , direct german military participation in the conflict was off-limits .
in an effort to reconcile germany 's laws with its international obligations , the center-right christian democratic union called for the " clarification " of two conflicting constitutional articles .
article 87 gave germany the right to field an army for national defense .
but article 24 also permitted germany to join collective security organizations to preserve world peace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faced a quandary during the 1991 gulf war many conservatives argued that article 24 sanctioned german participation in multilateral military operations - with or without a un mandate - that were not directly related to territorial defense . " the claim that the constitution forbids the german armed forces from participating in these kinds of deployments is a legal facade that hides the real political issue , " lamers said .
" in reality it was about the unwillingness and the incapability of the large majority of german citizens and voters to participate in warlike measures . "
partisan firestorm as the governing christian democrats pushed the constitutional question , the opposition social democrats faced internal divisions .
the party base limited its support to un peacekeeping missions while a small elite favored more aggressive military operations like the gulf war .
" the foreign and security policy experts actually wanted such operations as an option , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" but we could n't move our own parliamentary faction because they said the constitution did n't allow such operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boutros boutros-ghali asked germany to send peacekeepers to somalia meanwhile , the pacifist green party rejected military intervention in virtually any form .
" we feared the conservatives who were in power wanted to reconstruct a classic nation state with the capability to project power , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who later served as deputy foreign minister .
" we believed that non-military measures should be developed and given priority . "
even the christian democrats ' own coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , expressed reservations about operations without a un mandate .
fait accompli but world events overshadowed the partisan debate in germany .
the dust had hardly settled in the persian gulf when devastating civil wars broke out in yugoslavia and somalia .
in an attempt to contain violence in southeastern europe , nato and the west european union - a european defense organization - imposed a sea and air blockade on yugoslavia .
nato deployed awacs radar planes to patrol the skies of the balkan war zone .
with germans serving in the multinational crews that manned these aircraft , participation in the blockade was a foregone conclusion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , the constitutional court was asked to decide " we could n't just pull out , " lamers said .
" we were part of a larger whole and were not really free .
we would have risked enormous damage to our image and influence . "
while nato tried to stem the tide of violence in yugoslavia , the un sanctioned a us-led peacekeeping mission to stabilize somalia .
in a trip to bonn , then-un secretary general boutros boutros-ghali personally asked the german government to send peacekeepers to the war-torn east african nation .
with the political parties still in gridlock over the constitutional question , the kohl government decided to act without parliamentary approval .
kohl deployed ships and aircraft to yugoslavia and more than 1,000 soldiers to somalia .
foreign policy on trial politically outmaneuvered , the social democrats sued the kohl government in the federal constitutional court .
yet the party 's foreign and security policy experts worked with the government behind the scenes , according to voigt .
both the opposition and the government wanted to put the constitutional question to rest .
and since parliament could not reach a compromise , they agreed to resolve the political controversy in court .
" we internally agreed to create a case on un operations -lsb- somalia -rsb- , a case on nato operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- and a case on west european union operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- , " voigt said .
" the federal government conducted these operations , and we filed suits against them . "
however , the kohl government almost became a casualty of the legal battle when its coalition partner - the free democrats - sued it over the nato air blockade .
germany 's government now faced an uncertain future as the judges deliberated .
the kohl government dodged a bullet when the federal constitutional court ruled that germany could participate in un , nato and weu military operations worldwide .
but there was an important caveat : these operations had to be approved by a simple parliamentary majority . " we had to slowly learn that we 're a country that represents interests , and that we 're an ally and that carries consequences , " klose said .
" that was a tremendously difficult learning process that has in no way come to an end . "

" many germans say that we 're the ones who learned the lessons of history and that others still have to learn those lessons . "
but the germans ' rejection of the american-led coalition , and a un-sanctioned military campaign that targeted an aggressive dictator , left chancellor helmut kohl 's government in a deeply uncomfortable position .
" the kohl government knew they had to contribute to the gulf war due to the principle of allied solidarity , " said karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" but they were at the same time aware of the growing opposition to the war within the electorate . " instead of sending troops to the persian gulf , bonn wrote the coalition partners a check for 17 billion marks -lrb- $ 12 billion , or 8 billion euros -rrb- and supplied logistical support . " we effectively bought ourselves out of the war with our financial contribution , " lamers said . opening pandora 's box the kohl government had been politically and legally boxed into a corner .
on top of vehement public opposition , the government faced a constitution that sanctioned war only in self-defense .
and since saddam hussein had neither attacked germany nor the nato allies , direct german military participation in the conflict was off-limits .
in an effort to reconcile germany 's laws with its international obligations , the center-right christian democratic union called for the " clarification " of two conflicting constitutional articles .
article 87 gave germany the right to field an army for national defense .
but article 24 also permitted germany to join collective security organizations to preserve world peace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faced a quandary during the 1991 gulf war many conservatives argued that article 24 sanctioned german participation in multilateral military operations - with or without a un mandate - that were not directly related to territorial defense . " the claim that the constitution forbids the german armed forces from participating in these kinds of deployments is a legal facade that hides the real political issue , " lamers said .
" in reality it was about the unwillingness and the incapability of the large majority of german citizens and voters to participate in warlike measures . "
partisan firestorm as the governing christian democrats pushed the constitutional question , the opposition social democrats faced internal divisions .
the party base limited its support to un peacekeeping missions while a small elite favored more aggressive military operations like the gulf war .
" the foreign and security policy experts actually wanted such operations as an option , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" but we could n't move our own parliamentary faction because they said the constitution did n't allow such operations . "

" we believed that non-military measures should be developed and given priority . "
even the christian democrats ' own coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , expressed reservations about operations without a un mandate .
fait accompli but world events overshadowed the partisan debate in germany .
the dust had hardly settled in the persian gulf when devastating civil wars broke out in yugoslavia and somalia .
in an attempt to contain violence in southeastern europe , nato and the west european union - a european defense organization - imposed a sea and air blockade on yugoslavia .
nato deployed awacs radar planes to patrol the skies of the balkan war zone .
with germans serving in the multinational crews that manned these aircraft , participation in the blockade was a foregone conclusion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , the constitutional court was asked to decide " we could n't just pull out , " lamers said .
" we were part of a larger whole and were not really free .
we would have risked enormous damage to our image and influence . "
while nato tried to stem the tide of violence in yugoslavia , the un sanctioned a us-led peacekeeping mission to stabilize somalia .
in a trip to bonn , then-un secretary general boutros boutros-ghali personally asked the german government to send peacekeepers to the war-torn east african nation .
with the political parties still in gridlock over the constitutional question , the kohl government decided to act without parliamentary approval .
kohl deployed ships and aircraft to yugoslavia and more than 1,000 soldiers to somalia .
foreign policy on trial politically outmaneuvered , the social democrats sued the kohl government in the federal constitutional court .
yet the party 's foreign and security policy experts worked with the government behind the scenes , according to voigt .
both the opposition and the government wanted to put the constitutional question to rest .
and since parliament could not reach a compromise , they agreed to resolve the political controversy in court .
" we internally agreed to create a case on un operations -lsb- somalia -rsb- , a case on nato operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- and a case on west european union operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- , " voigt said .
" the federal government conducted these operations , and we filed suits against them . "
however , the kohl government almost became a casualty of the legal battle when its coalition partner - the free democrats - sued it over the nato air blockade .
germany 's government now faced an uncertain future as the judges deliberated .
the kohl government dodged a bullet when the federal constitutional court ruled that germany could participate in un , nato and weu military operations worldwide .
but there was an important caveat : these operations had to be approved by a simple parliamentary majority . " we had to slowly learn that we 're a country that represents interests , and that we 're an ally and that carries consequences , " klose said .
" that was a tremendously difficult learning process that has in no way come to an end . "

in part two of a three-part series , dw examines how the country returned to military action in the balkans . war returned to germany 's doorstep when yugoslavia imploded in ethnic violence .
during the winter of 1994 , german officials agonized over whether to participate in a nato-led military intervention aimed at containing the war .
although the nation 's highest court had declared such interventions constitutional , germany remained deeply reluctant to use military force for any reason other than defense .
but enormous political and moral pressure pushed the kohl government and the opposition toward a shaky consensus in favor of military action against serbia .
this consensus faced its trial-by-fire when the social democrats and greens took the reins of power in 1998 .
in a twist of fate , the traditionally antiwar parties ordered germany 's first offensive military strike since world war ii .
the war next door by the fall of 1994 , the war in yugoslavia had reached a boiling point as serb forces began targeting nato aircraft and un peacekeepers .
the nato allies feared the worst and drew up plans to rescue the lightly armed peacekeepers in the event that the serbs launched an all-out attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl dragged his feet to avoid intervening in yugoslavia .
as nato prepared for a showdown , germany dragged its feet .
chancellor helmut kohl argued that since the third reich had occupied yugoslavia , it would be historically inappropriate for germany to intervene in the current conflict .
kohl was trying to prevent germany from getting involved in the conflict too quickly , according to karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats .
" that was an ineffectual attempt to throw up a firewall , " lamers said .
" kohl was much too intelligent to think that it would hold .
but it fit the disposition among the german people . "
kohl 's firewall began crumbling as the arrival of bosnian refugees started impacting german domestic politics , according to lamers .
and as the humanitarian situation worsened , nato began to lose its patience with bonn .
the allies pressured germany to send its tornado warplanes into the bosnian firestorm .
the tornados had a unique capability to locate and destroy serb radar installations , which would help cover a possible un withdrawal .
germany was the only european country that possessed such aircraft .
ultimately , strategic realities trumped political rhetoric and the kohl government assented to nato 's request .
but germany 's deeply divided parliament still had to approve the decision .
" you can always argue about the sense of using military force , because you never know what the result will be .
that 's the risk , " lamers said .
" but when all the countries in the community that we belong to say its necessary , we ca n't just say ' count me out . " '
winning the home front for the first time since the world war ii , a german government had decided to deploy its military to a war zone .
unwilling to shoulder the full political and moral responsibility for its historic decision , the kohl government reached out to the opposition social democrats and greens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the greens ' joschka fischer said force was justified to stop genocide the bosnian quagmire had thrown the social democratic party into an uproar .
the antiwar mainstream feared embarking down a slippery slope that could lead the country away from its peaceful foreign policy .
but a more hawkish minority supported using force as a last resort to rescue the un peacekeepers and stop the ethnic cleansing .
" in a 10-to-1 vote , the foreign and security policy experts supported the government 's proposal , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" we knew that the party had a different opinion .
there was considerable uproar .
in the end , around 50 social democrats voted with the government in favor of the bosnian mission and against their own party . "
green revolution as social democrats inched closer to the kohl government , the greens were facing a crisis of conscience that threatened to tear their party in two .
traditionally , the green party advocated a pacifist foreign policy rooted in the peaceful resolution of conflicts through international institutions like the un .
but the un 's failure to stop the ethnic cleansing in bosnia led to an ideological revolution within certain quarters of the party .
after serb forces massacred thousands of bosnian muslims in the town of srebrenica , green party whip joschka fischer declared that force was justified to stop genocide .
" with the balkan wars we realized for the first time that there are situations in which one has to intervene militarily , " said ludger volmer , former president of the green party who went on to serve as the country 's deputy foreign minister . " that was a difficult learning process . "
this learning process would end with the bundestag sending tornado warplanes as well as peacekeepers to bosnia .
against the historical and political odds , germany 's divided parties had forged a shaky consensus in favor of military intervention .
peaceniks in power after serving 16 years in the opposition , the social democrats and greens defeated the kohl government in the 1998 elections .
no sooner had the left-of-center coalition come to power than renewed ethnic violence erupted in yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's air war against serbia was an allied intervention while nato peacekeepers secured the precarious peace in bosnia , the breakaway province of kosovo careened toward war as ethnic albanians demanded independence from serbia .
germany and its nato allies pushed for a peaceful settlement .
but negotiations collapsed when both sides refused to compromise on kosovo 's political status .
in anticipation of this worst-case scenario , the kohl government had committed germany to participate in a nato air war against serbia .
now , social democratic chancellor gerhard schroeder and green party foreign minister joschka fischer had to decide whether they would honor their predecessor 's commitment .
air strikes hardly squared with the coalition 's platform of a foreign policy rooted in peaceful conflict resolution .
bombing belgrade when the security council stalled over russian and chinese objections , nato decided to launch its air war without a un mandate .
the nato allies accused serbia of ethnic cleansing and argued that time was of the essence in order to save innocent lives .
schroeder and fischer faced a nightmare scenario : an allied military intervention without un sanction .
" the new schroeder-fischer government agreed to participate for purely opportune reasons , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert and parliamentarian within the social democratic party .
" they knew that if they did n't participate , they would face foreign policy isolation from the outset .
that 's what i call the joke of history .
the german position changed irrevocably because the government had no choice but to say yes . "
with deep reservations , the former antiwar opposition ordered warplanes to bomb belgrade in germany 's first overt military strike since world war ii .
the shaky foreign policy consensus forged during the bosnian crisis had survived its trial-by-fire in kosovo .
" germany is not a military power and it does n't want to become one , " volmer said .
" you can not help but recognize that there are some conflicts for which you have to arm yourself and that there may be situations in which you have to intervene militarily .
but at its very core , germany has a remote relationship to armed force .
that 's a lesson from the second world war , from history . "

in the last of a three-part series , dw examines the country 's decision to deploy its military in afghanistan , and the ' warlike conditions ' there . a political shockwave reverberated across the atlantic ocean after islamic terrorists razed the world trade center and part of the pentagon on september 11 , 2001 .
in keeping with germany 's responsibility as a nato member , chancellor gerhard schroeder declared unlimited solidarity with a wounded america .
schroeder 's declaration carried sweeping military consequences for germany .
only three years after his left-of-center coalition had participated in nato 's air war against serbia , he deployed soldiers for an ambitious stabilization mission in war-torn afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schroeder showed solidarity with the us in sending troops .
germany 's stabilization mission looked increasingly like a counterinsurgency as its soldiers faced a resurgent taliban .
and in september 2009 , tensions came to a head when a german colonel ordered an airstrike against two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the strike killed 142 people , laying bare the realities of the afghan conflict for the german public .
after years of whitewashing the conflict in afghanistan , berlin has been forced to acknowledge that its soldiers are fighting and dying under " warlike conditions . "
germany can never again claim that it will never wage war .
solidarity among allies in the days following september 11 , germany rallied behind the united states as the bush administration assembled a military coalition to retaliate against the perpetrators of the attacks in new york and washington d.c.
" initially , operation enduring freedom was mandated through the united nations while nato invoked article 5 for the first time , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who served as deputy foreign minister at that time .
" the usa had been attacked and article 5 required germany to make a contribution . "
but germany 's support for america went beyond legal obligations , according to volmer .
many germans felt a deep emotional bond with their historical ally , creating a political climate in which participation in an offensive military campaign could be openly discussed .
" the german people made spontaneous displays of solidarity with the american people , " volmer said .
" many germans said the americans helped us against hitler and protected us during the cold war and now we have to return the favor . "
this solidarity ran into obstacles on the political front , however .
although the german military had participated in the kosovo war of 1999 , anxiety about military force remained deeply rooted in the national psyche .
many social democrats and greens worried that germany would be dragged into an open ended , global war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years , flag-draped caskets began returning to germany but in a political power play , schroeder tied parliament 's vote on operation enduring freedom with a vote of confidence .
if antiwar skeptics among the social democrats and greens voted against the war , they would also be voting against their own government .
faced with the choice of political influence or principle , most social democrats and greens closed ranks and threw their confidence behind their coalition government .

" the next step in the discussion was to demand that the military strikes not be directed against the afghan people , " volmer said .
" instead , the afghans should benefit from the intervention . "
while oef had been tasked with rooting out the taliban and al-qaeda , the international security assistance force would seek to create a secure environment in which afghanistan could build a postwar future for itself .
berlin sought to keep oef and isaf - war and stabilization - clearly separated from one another with an emphasis on putting isaf in the lead .
" that again has to do with history , " said karl lamers , former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats . " we do n't do war .
we conduct other actions that demand the use of force . "
but berlin 's policy began to send mixed messages .
in 2004 , german soldiers set up shop in the northern afghan city of kunduz , where they assisted civilian reconstruction efforts .
however , they became increasingly entangled in ambushes , mortar attacks and running gun battles as the taliban made a comeback .
the distinction between stabilization and war had become blurred .
as the years passed , flag-draped caskets returned home , and terrorists increasingly targeted europe , the justification for the mission became more self-assertive .
slowly , german defense experts began to take ownership of the conflict by identifying it as being in the national interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz strike killed 142 and left many wounded in hospitals " later we recognized what defense minister -lrb- peter -rrb- struck had pointed out : we are also defending germany 's security on the hindu kush , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert within the social democratic party .
" this view was supported by the attacks in london and madrid and through the clear fact that there 's something like a home-grown but foreign-trained terrorism that threatens us all . "
acts of war in september of 2009 , the simmering security situation in northern afghanistan boiled over .
colonel georg klein , commander of the german soldiers in kunduz , ordered american bombers to eliminate two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the airstrike killed 142 people .
many of the dead were civilians .
klein defended his order by claiming that he had believed the tankers would be used as an explosive device against his soldiers .
however , the subsequent investigation by isaf indicated that klein targeted the people , not the tanker itself .
local taliban leaders may have been among the crowd .
a german officer had launched a preemptive strike against a perceived threat orchestrated by a human enemy .
germany had waged war in front of the entire international community .
a half truth in the aftermath of the kunduz bombing , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg acknowledged that the german army was operating under " warlike conditions . "
and after three soldiers died in a taliban ambush in april of 2010 , chancellor angela merkel made a similar admission .
during the nationally televised memorial service for the fallen , merkel expressed understanding for soldiers who said they were fighting in a war .
so what do observers think of politicians ' attempts to find a label just short of ' war ' for the unconventional conflict in afghanistan ?
according to lamers , it 's a legal sideshow - one that began with the debate over the gulf war , raged during the yugoslavia crisis , and has been partially exposed by the kunduz airstrike .
military force - however it may be labeled by the political establishment - is now a regular and tolerated feature of german foreign policy .
germany no longer faces a national historical dilemma of whether it can use force at all .
rather , it has returned to history and once again confronts the broader human question : under what circumstances is military force justified ?
" it 's a question for all of us that nobody can definitively answer yet , but which we have to discuss intensively with one another , " lamers said .
" how do we position ourselves in a world where there are still cases like afghanistan ?
how do we deal with that ?
do we just say that we ca n't do anything about it ?
or if we can do something , what exactly should we do ? "
considering its tainted history , germany will have to be especially careful in its search for an answer .

in the last of a three-part series , dw examines the country 's decision to deploy its military in afghanistan , and the ' warlike conditions ' there . a political shockwave reverberated across the atlantic ocean after islamic terrorists razed the world trade center and part of the pentagon on september 11 , 2001 .
in keeping with germany 's responsibility as a nato member , chancellor gerhard schroeder declared unlimited solidarity with a wounded america .
schroeder 's declaration carried sweeping military consequences for germany .
only three years after his left-of-center coalition had participated in nato 's air war against serbia , he deployed soldiers for an ambitious stabilization mission in war-torn afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schroeder showed solidarity with the us in sending troops .
germany 's stabilization mission looked increasingly like a counterinsurgency as its soldiers faced a resurgent taliban .
and in september 2009 , tensions came to a head when a german colonel ordered an airstrike against two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the strike killed 142 people , laying bare the realities of the afghan conflict for the german public .
after years of whitewashing the conflict in afghanistan , berlin has been forced to acknowledge that its soldiers are fighting and dying under " warlike conditions . "
germany can never again claim that it will never wage war .
solidarity among allies in the days following september 11 , germany rallied behind the united states as the bush administration assembled a military coalition to retaliate against the perpetrators of the attacks in new york and washington d.c.
" initially , operation enduring freedom was mandated through the united nations while nato invoked article 5 for the first time , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who served as deputy foreign minister at that time .
" the usa had been attacked and article 5 required germany to make a contribution . "
but germany 's support for america went beyond legal obligations , according to volmer .
many germans felt a deep emotional bond with their historical ally , creating a political climate in which participation in an offensive military campaign could be openly discussed .
" the german people made spontaneous displays of solidarity with the american people , " volmer said .
" many germans said the americans helped us against hitler and protected us during the cold war and now we have to return the favor . "

there are no easy answers but experts agree on one thing – climate education is in dire need of improvement . everyone is talking about climate change .
in recent years , global warming has been the subject of extensive research , press reports and conferences .
following the un climate summit in mexico earlier this month , the environmental question of the century would appear to be widely understood .
but impressions can be deceptive , and as a recent eu commission survey revealed , one quarter of europeans are climate skeptics .
almost half admit that they are inadequately informed about global warming .
“ there is broad superficial understanding , but to probe a little deeper is to reveal great gaps in the public knowledge , ” udo kuckartz of the university of marburg said .
“ we need new models for climate education , new approaches which turn environmental knowledge into environmental action . ”
from knowledge to action that leads to an important question - how can teachers address climate change in classrooms in a way that actually leads people to change their behavior and switch to a low-carbon lifestyle ?
educators and psychologists all over the globe are currently seeking answers to that question .
and in order to find them , they first need to establish which teaching models are already in use and which of them have proved successful in schools , universities and in further education .
bildunterschrift : learning by doing : children plant trees in flood-prone bangladesh gerhard de haan , a professor at the free university in berlin , says the greatest range of learning opportunities is in adult education .
he stresses the importance of grant programs , such as the one run by the humboldt foundation to encourage young researchers from developing and emerging nations to spend a year working on climate and energy projects at german universities .
“ such approaches are particularly effective because they are aimed at disseminators and come at it from an economic angle , ” de haan said .
“ foundations , companies and governments ought to offer many more grant programs . ”
udo kuckartz says there are already some signs that that is the way things are going .
“ there has been a lot of progress , often from large companies , ” he said .
but it is not only private enterprises that are seizing the initiative .
sometimes , as in the case of denmark which staged the un climate conference at the end of last year , governments offer grants to encourage foreign students to come to their country and learn about wind power or environmental engineering or chemistry .
new environmental programs over the past decade , kuckartz says , there 's been a huge increase in the number of environment related courses .
most , however , focus on climate and energy issues .
“ they are almost always scientific or environmental management programs , ” he said , adding that there are few which look at the issues from a sociological point of view .
two exceptions are a program about environment and education , at the rostock university in eastern germany , and another at berlin 's freie university , which looks at research in the future .
bildunterschrift : games are one way of teaching kids the links between climate change and species protection gerhard de haan believes schools could and should be doing more to enhance a general level of understanding of the issues surrounding climate change among children .
he points out that climate change is usually addressed only in geography classes in germany but says that it is actually “ increasingly being marginalized . ”
and in subjects such as biology , politics or social studies , teachers are by no means obliged to include climate issues and sustainability in the curriculum .
that partly has to do with germany 's federal structure in which each of the 16 states determine the content of the education they offer .
but that 's not the only reason .
experts say teachers themselves are not taught enough about climate issues during their own training .
in some places , there are regional initiatives which promote climate education in school and therefore try to get teachers up to speed .
a group of charities has teamed up with the german government to launch a further education program for teachers from the states of hesse , saarland and rhineland-palatinate .
but such schemes , which are often backed by unesco , are rare .
“ they only reach a maximum of five percent of schools , ” kuckartz said .
us the model for climate reporting the shortcomings on addressing climate change are n't just confined to the classrooms .
the media too are to blame .
experts say journalists - the main conduits for climate information reaching the masses – could also do with greater training in environmental issues .
unlike america , there are few universities and journalism schools in europe that offer courses on climate reporting .
across the atlantic , the picture is altogether more rounded ; there are already a number of environmental journalism programs on offer , and the society of environmental journalists -lrb- sej -rrb- is constantly working towards improving the standard of reporting on the subject .
that said , things are slowly improving in europe too .
programs such as deutsche welle 's annual global media forum in bonn is the largest european event of its kind .
its aim is to help journalists deepen their knowledge and sharpen their skills on issues surrounding global climate change .

in the last of a three-part series , dw examines the country 's decision to deploy its military in afghanistan , and the ' warlike conditions ' there . a political shockwave reverberated across the atlantic ocean after islamic terrorists razed the world trade center and part of the pentagon on september 11 , 2001 .
in keeping with germany 's responsibility as a nato member , chancellor gerhard schroeder declared unlimited solidarity with a wounded america .
schroeder 's declaration carried sweeping military consequences for germany .
only three years after his left-of-center coalition had participated in nato 's air war against serbia , he deployed soldiers for an ambitious stabilization mission in war-torn afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schroeder showed solidarity with the us in sending troops .
germany 's stabilization mission looked increasingly like a counterinsurgency as its soldiers faced a resurgent taliban .
and in september 2009 , tensions came to a head when a german colonel ordered an airstrike against two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the strike killed 142 people , laying bare the realities of the afghan conflict for the german public .
after years of whitewashing the conflict in afghanistan , berlin has been forced to acknowledge that its soldiers are fighting and dying under " warlike conditions . "
germany can never again claim that it will never wage war .
solidarity among allies in the days following september 11 , germany rallied behind the united states as the bush administration assembled a military coalition to retaliate against the perpetrators of the attacks in new york and washington d.c.
" initially , operation enduring freedom was mandated through the united nations while nato invoked article 5 for the first time , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who served as deputy foreign minister at that time .
" the usa had been attacked and article 5 required germany to make a contribution . "
but germany 's support for america went beyond legal obligations , according to volmer .
many germans felt a deep emotional bond with their historical ally , creating a political climate in which participation in an offensive military campaign could be openly discussed .
" the german people made spontaneous displays of solidarity with the american people , " volmer said .
" many germans said the americans helped us against hitler and protected us during the cold war and now we have to return the favor . "
this solidarity ran into obstacles on the political front , however .
although the german military had participated in the kosovo war of 1999 , anxiety about military force remained deeply rooted in the national psyche .
many social democrats and greens worried that germany would be dragged into an open ended , global war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years , flag-draped caskets began returning to germany but in a political power play , schroeder tied parliament 's vote on operation enduring freedom with a vote of confidence .
if antiwar skeptics among the social democrats and greens voted against the war , they would also be voting against their own government .
faced with the choice of political influence or principle , most social democrats and greens closed ranks and threw their confidence behind their coalition government .
the resolution passed , allocating 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom and saving the government from collapse . mixed message as the united states waged war in pursuit of the perpetrators of september 11 , the international community designed a stabilization force to ease the impact of the conflict on civilians .
" the next step in the discussion was to demand that the military strikes not be directed against the afghan people , " volmer said .
" instead , the afghans should benefit from the intervention . "
while oef had been tasked with rooting out the taliban and al-qaeda , the international security assistance force would seek to create a secure environment in which afghanistan could build a postwar future for itself .
berlin sought to keep oef and isaf - war and stabilization - clearly separated from one another with an emphasis on putting isaf in the lead .
" that again has to do with history , " said karl lamers , former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats . " we do n't do war .
we conduct other actions that demand the use of force . "
but berlin 's policy began to send mixed messages .
in 2004 , german soldiers set up shop in the northern afghan city of kunduz , where they assisted civilian reconstruction efforts .
however , they became increasingly entangled in ambushes , mortar attacks and running gun battles as the taliban made a comeback .
the distinction between stabilization and war had become blurred .
as the years passed , flag-draped caskets returned home , and terrorists increasingly targeted europe , the justification for the mission became more self-assertive .
slowly , german defense experts began to take ownership of the conflict by identifying it as being in the national interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz strike killed 142 and left many wounded in hospitals " later we recognized what defense minister -lrb- peter -rrb- struck had pointed out : we are also defending germany 's security on the hindu kush , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert within the social democratic party .
" this view was supported by the attacks in london and madrid and through the clear fact that there 's something like a home-grown but foreign-trained terrorism that threatens us all . "
acts of war in september of 2009 , the simmering security situation in northern afghanistan boiled over .
colonel georg klein , commander of the german soldiers in kunduz , ordered american bombers to eliminate two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the airstrike killed 142 people .
many of the dead were civilians .
klein defended his order by claiming that he had believed the tankers would be used as an explosive device against his soldiers .
however , the subsequent investigation by isaf indicated that klein targeted the people , not the tanker itself .
local taliban leaders may have been among the crowd .
a german officer had launched a preemptive strike against a perceived threat orchestrated by a human enemy .
germany had waged war in front of the entire international community .
a half truth in the aftermath of the kunduz bombing , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg acknowledged that the german army was operating under " warlike conditions . "
and after three soldiers died in a taliban ambush in april of 2010 , chancellor angela merkel made a similar admission .
during the nationally televised memorial service for the fallen , merkel expressed understanding for soldiers who said they were fighting in a war .
so what do observers think of politicians ' attempts to find a label just short of ' war ' for the unconventional conflict in afghanistan ?
according to lamers , it 's a legal sideshow - one that began with the debate over the gulf war , raged during the yugoslavia crisis , and has been partially exposed by the kunduz airstrike .
military force - however it may be labeled by the political establishment - is now a regular and tolerated feature of german foreign policy .
germany no longer faces a national historical dilemma of whether it can use force at all .
rather , it has returned to history and once again confronts the broader human question : under what circumstances is military force justified ?
" it 's a question for all of us that nobody can definitively answer yet , but which we have to discuss intensively with one another , " lamers said .
" how do we position ourselves in a world where there are still cases like afghanistan ?
how do we deal with that ?
do we just say that we ca n't do anything about it ?
or if we can do something , what exactly should we do ? "
considering its tainted history , germany will have to be especially careful in its search for an answer .

there are no easy answers but experts agree on one thing – climate education is in dire need of improvement . everyone is talking about climate change .
in recent years , global warming has been the subject of extensive research , press reports and conferences .

from knowledge to action that leads to an important question - how can teachers address climate change in classrooms in a way that actually leads people to change their behavior and switch to a low-carbon lifestyle ?
educators and psychologists all over the globe are currently seeking answers to that question .
and in order to find them , they first need to establish which teaching models are already in use and which of them have proved successful in schools , universities and in further education .

in the last of a three-part series , dw examines the country 's decision to deploy its military in afghanistan , and the ' warlike conditions ' there . a political shockwave reverberated across the atlantic ocean after islamic terrorists razed the world trade center and part of the pentagon on september 11 , 2001 .
in keeping with germany 's responsibility as a nato member , chancellor gerhard schroeder declared unlimited solidarity with a wounded america .
schroeder 's declaration carried sweeping military consequences for germany .
only three years after his left-of-center coalition had participated in nato 's air war against serbia , he deployed soldiers for an ambitious stabilization mission in war-torn afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schroeder showed solidarity with the us in sending troops .
germany 's stabilization mission looked increasingly like a counterinsurgency as its soldiers faced a resurgent taliban .
and in september 2009 , tensions came to a head when a german colonel ordered an airstrike against two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the strike killed 142 people , laying bare the realities of the afghan conflict for the german public .
after years of whitewashing the conflict in afghanistan , berlin has been forced to acknowledge that its soldiers are fighting and dying under " warlike conditions . "
germany can never again claim that it will never wage war .
solidarity among allies in the days following september 11 , germany rallied behind the united states as the bush administration assembled a military coalition to retaliate against the perpetrators of the attacks in new york and washington d.c.
" initially , operation enduring freedom was mandated through the united nations while nato invoked article 5 for the first time , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who served as deputy foreign minister at that time .
" the usa had been attacked and article 5 required germany to make a contribution . "
but germany 's support for america went beyond legal obligations , according to volmer .
many germans felt a deep emotional bond with their historical ally , creating a political climate in which participation in an offensive military campaign could be openly discussed .
" the german people made spontaneous displays of solidarity with the american people , " volmer said .
" many germans said the americans helped us against hitler and protected us during the cold war and now we have to return the favor . "
this solidarity ran into obstacles on the political front , however .
although the german military had participated in the kosovo war of 1999 , anxiety about military force remained deeply rooted in the national psyche .
many social democrats and greens worried that germany would be dragged into an open ended , global war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years , flag-draped caskets began returning to germany but in a political power play , schroeder tied parliament 's vote on operation enduring freedom with a vote of confidence .
if antiwar skeptics among the social democrats and greens voted against the war , they would also be voting against their own government .
faced with the choice of political influence or principle , most social democrats and greens closed ranks and threw their confidence behind their coalition government .
the resolution passed , allocating 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom and saving the government from collapse . mixed message as the united states waged war in pursuit of the perpetrators of september 11 , the international community designed a stabilization force to ease the impact of the conflict on civilians .
" the next step in the discussion was to demand that the military strikes not be directed against the afghan people , " volmer said .
" instead , the afghans should benefit from the intervention . "
while oef had been tasked with rooting out the taliban and al-qaeda , the international security assistance force would seek to create a secure environment in which afghanistan could build a postwar future for itself .
berlin sought to keep oef and isaf - war and stabilization - clearly separated from one another with an emphasis on putting isaf in the lead .
" that again has to do with history , " said karl lamers , former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats . " we do n't do war .
we conduct other actions that demand the use of force . "
but berlin 's policy began to send mixed messages .
in 2004 , german soldiers set up shop in the northern afghan city of kunduz , where they assisted civilian reconstruction efforts .
however , they became increasingly entangled in ambushes , mortar attacks and running gun battles as the taliban made a comeback .
the distinction between stabilization and war had become blurred .
as the years passed , flag-draped caskets returned home , and terrorists increasingly targeted europe , the justification for the mission became more self-assertive .
slowly , german defense experts began to take ownership of the conflict by identifying it as being in the national interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz strike killed 142 and left many wounded in hospitals " later we recognized what defense minister -lrb- peter -rrb- struck had pointed out : we are also defending germany 's security on the hindu kush , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert within the social democratic party .
" this view was supported by the attacks in london and madrid and through the clear fact that there 's something like a home-grown but foreign-trained terrorism that threatens us all . "
acts of war in september of 2009 , the simmering security situation in northern afghanistan boiled over .
colonel georg klein , commander of the german soldiers in kunduz , ordered american bombers to eliminate two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the airstrike killed 142 people .
many of the dead were civilians .
klein defended his order by claiming that he had believed the tankers would be used as an explosive device against his soldiers .
however , the subsequent investigation by isaf indicated that klein targeted the people , not the tanker itself .
local taliban leaders may have been among the crowd .
a german officer had launched a preemptive strike against a perceived threat orchestrated by a human enemy .
germany had waged war in front of the entire international community .
a half truth in the aftermath of the kunduz bombing , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg acknowledged that the german army was operating under " warlike conditions . "
and after three soldiers died in a taliban ambush in april of 2010 , chancellor angela merkel made a similar admission .
during the nationally televised memorial service for the fallen , merkel expressed understanding for soldiers who said they were fighting in a war .
so what do observers think of politicians ' attempts to find a label just short of ' war ' for the unconventional conflict in afghanistan ?
according to lamers , it 's a legal sideshow - one that began with the debate over the gulf war , raged during the yugoslavia crisis , and has been partially exposed by the kunduz airstrike .
military force - however it may be labeled by the political establishment - is now a regular and tolerated feature of german foreign policy .
germany no longer faces a national historical dilemma of whether it can use force at all .
rather , it has returned to history and once again confronts the broader human question : under what circumstances is military force justified ?
" it 's a question for all of us that nobody can definitively answer yet , but which we have to discuss intensively with one another , " lamers said .
" how do we position ourselves in a world where there are still cases like afghanistan ?
how do we deal with that ?
do we just say that we ca n't do anything about it ?
or if we can do something , what exactly should we do ? "
considering its tainted history , germany will have to be especially careful in its search for an answer .

an increased number of suicide attacks , devastating country-wide floods , a severe energy crisis , and an all-time high inflation , economic mismanagement and unemployment have shattered the lives of ordinary citizens .
the bloodiest year since 2001 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan remained in the grip of terror throughout 2010 terrorism continued to plague the islamic republic of pakistan in 2010 .
the year ended with one of the worst suicide attacks in the bajaur agency , one of the restive federally administered tribal areas or fata bordering afghanistan .
a burqa-clad woman blew herself up at the world food program 's aid distribution center on christmas day , killing nearly 50 people and wounding at least 100 .
2010 was the bloodiest year in pakistan since 9/11 .
nearly 1,300 people were killed and more than 2,500 injured in 52 suicide attacks since january .
with renewed suspicions about pakistan 's counter-terrorism efforts and the reports about possible us ground attacks inside pakistan , some analysts are of the opinion that things might get worse in pakistan in 2011 .
however , m. ziauddin , editor of pakistan 's english daily ' express tribune ' , thinks otherwise .
" perhaps things will continue as they are now .
most of the attacks now are confined to the fata .
the attacks in the urban areas have gone down in the last two or three months , " ziauddin told deutsche welle in an interview .
unprecedented floods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani flood survivors jostle for a sack of flour distributed by volunteers in july 2010 , the unprecedented country-wide floods inundated one-fifth of the country and left millions displaced .
it was a severe blow to a country whose economy relies on agricultural goods .
according to estimates , pakistan lost around 4 billion usd in structural damages , and approximately 500 million usd in wheat crop damages .
many economic experts are of the opinion that the effects of the floods on pakistan 's economy are so great that they will harm the progress of the country for years to come .
this might in turn lead to an increase in terrorist activities , many fear .
but m. ziauddin does not think the idea carries weight .
" yes , the economy is in very bad shape , and i do n't see any improvement in the immediate future .
as far as the militancy and floods are concerned , i do n't see a connection between the two , " said m. ziauddin .
continued political uncertainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks : pakistan 's army chief ashfaq pervez kayani calls the shots after more than two years in power , the civilian government still does not seem to be in control of things .
the corruption cases against president asif ali zardari and some cabinet members were a hot topic in the pakistani media throughout the year .
the tense relations between the executive and the judiciary continued to affect the political environment of the country .
veteran journalist m. ziauddin , however , thinks that despite problems the two institutions have found balance .
" i do n't see a major clash between the judiciary and the government any more .
as far as any political threat to the government is concerned , almost all political parties which contested the last elections are somehow stakeholders in the present set-up .
so , i do n't see any challenge to the government until the next elections . "
on the other hand , the pakistani army 's continued role in politics was highlighted by the recent wikileaks revelations .
the us diplomatic cables showed pakistan 's army chief ashfaq pervez kayani at one point mulling over deposing zardari and replacing him with a more ' military-friendly ' president .

a model for the agency could be the committee on foreign investment in the united states . the commissioner noted that china has the means to acquire substantial holdings in key european companies and could do so to gain access to their technological know-how or to exercise political leverage on eu member states . " it is a question of investments , but behind that there is also a strategic policy , to which europe should respond politically , " tajani added . rising investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese automaker geely acquired sweden 's volvo in summer 2010 china 's direct investments abroad have increased by 12 percent this year to a total of more than 37 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- .
that value is expected to rise considerably in 2011 . many of china 's foreign investments to date have been aimed at securing access to raw materials in latin america and africa .
but chinese companies are also keen on buying businesses in europe . one example came in the summer of 2010 , when chinese company geely purchased swedish premium carmaker volvo . in 2008 chinese maritime freight group cosco assumed control of two shipping terminals in the greek port of piraeus .
it said it plans to use the facility as a gateway for chinese exports to europe . chinese officials said last week that the government could invest in european sovereign debt to help the eurozone survive future crises if necessary . threat to open markets german economic minister rainer bruederle rejected tajani 's proposal for a new regulator and warned european countries against placing excessive controls on foreign investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maintaining open markets should be a priority for the eu , says bruederle " europe profits from the openness of its markets and offers attractive conditions for foreign investors , " bruederle said in a follow-up interview with the handelsblatt . bruederle said that while some checks may be necessary to address " security and public order concerns , " leaders should refrain from " hasty actions " . bruederle traveled to china in october to promote europe and germany in particular as prospects for chinese investors . legal controls the debate between tajani and bruederle takes up an issue highlighted by a 2008 amendment to germany 's foreign trade law . the amendment allows the economics minister to investigate or block the plans of a foreign entity seeking to buy 25 percent or more of the voting rights in a german company if the acquisition raises public order or security concerns . but no foreign investment has yet fulfilled the requirements for the law to come into play , a spokesman from the federal ministry of economics and technology told deutsche welle . author : greg wiser -lrb- dpa , afp , ap -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a model for the agency could be the committee on foreign investment in the united states . the commissioner noted that china has the means to acquire substantial holdings in key european companies and could do so to gain access to their technological know-how or to exercise political leverage on eu member states . " it is a question of investments , but behind that there is also a strategic policy , to which europe should respond politically , " tajani added . rising investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese automaker geely acquired sweden 's volvo in summer 2010 china 's direct investments abroad have increased by 12 percent this year to a total of more than 37 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- .
that value is expected to rise considerably in 2011 . many of china 's foreign investments to date have been aimed at securing access to raw materials in latin america and africa .
but chinese companies are also keen on buying businesses in europe . one example came in the summer of 2010 , when chinese company geely purchased swedish premium carmaker volvo . in 2008 chinese maritime freight group cosco assumed control of two shipping terminals in the greek port of piraeus .
it said it plans to use the facility as a gateway for chinese exports to europe . chinese officials said last week that the government could invest in european sovereign debt to help the eurozone survive future crises if necessary . threat to open markets german economic minister rainer bruederle rejected tajani 's proposal for a new regulator and warned european countries against placing excessive controls on foreign investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maintaining open markets should be a priority for the eu , says bruederle " europe profits from the openness of its markets and offers attractive conditions for foreign investors , " bruederle said in a follow-up interview with the handelsblatt . bruederle said that while some checks may be necessary to address " security and public order concerns , " leaders should refrain from " hasty actions " . bruederle traveled to china in october to promote europe and germany in particular as prospects for chinese investors . legal controls the debate between tajani and bruederle takes up an issue highlighted by a 2008 amendment to germany 's foreign trade law . the amendment allows the economics minister to investigate or block the plans of a foreign entity seeking to buy 25 percent or more of the voting rights in a german company if the acquisition raises public order or security concerns . but no foreign investment has yet fulfilled the requirements for the law to come into play , a spokesman from the federal ministry of economics and technology told deutsche welle . author : greg wiser -lrb- dpa , afp , ap -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 28.12.2010 china 's most popular blogger winds down his " party " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's famous blogger and top earning author han han is just 28 years old china ’ s most popular blogger , han han , has decided to discontinue his magazine " party " , apparently due to problems with the publisher and printing house . though it has barely just begun , han han is putting to rest his literary magazine , " party " . its first issue was released in july , 2010 and the second issue , planned for august , had been put on hold . while there have been no official statements blaming the chinese government and censorship , many observers suspect this is the real reason behind the shut-down .
" it may have been for bureaucratic reasons or political reasons , but i guess the government is not very interested in having a famous blogger and one of the most famous people in china leading a magazine or trying to push the limits of censorship because that is what he is doing on his blog , " says vincent brossel of reporters without borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of reporters without borders including vincent brossel -lrb- right -rrb- demonstrate for media freedom in beijing too big to challenge ?
brossel suspects it was in the government 's interest to put a hold to the magazine before it could become as popular as han han 's blog .
" maybe a magazine would be a big challenge because it will be very hard on a weekly basis for the government to censor what he is writing and publishing .
so i think they decided to use political pressure to stop the magazine before they have to go against it when it is already popular . "
han han , who is a champion race-car driver and has also gone into singing , became famous for his critical blog and for his novels .
his stardom began in 2000 with the release of the novel , " the triple gate " , in which he criticizes china ’ s school system .
his blog is among the most frequented in the world .
icon for the new china understandable then that beijing is edgy when it comes to the 28-year-old .
brossel believes while han han ’ s influence is far-reaching , the government does not have much to fear because , " han han is not a dissident .
he is someone who is a sort of icon for the new china who is really successful – young , rich and trying to be influential .
han han is also trying to improve things in china and is upset about the way the government is treating the bloggers and so many people in china . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cover of the literary magazine " party " brossel says han han wants to play a role in changing his country , but he will never challenge the government the way liu xiaobo and his friends do , " because he ’ s not giving an alternative , he is just criticizing the authorities and he wants the government to improve certain policies .
but he is not someone who is trying to organize people to create a political alternative . "
busy watchdogs while watchdogs in china are constantly on the lookout and busy shutting down websites , the internet is still the most effective and popular way of spreading ideas .
and younger generations are up to pace with ways of getting around much of the government ’ s censorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " party " was discontinued after only one issue " of course he will continue his blog because he is influential and also rich thanks to his blog .
and also his power is that he is supported by millions of people .
so the government can not treat him like they treat liu xiaobo , " brossel believes . " it is quite a different case .
i ’ m sure he will play his role to push the limits of the censorship and we expect that from him because he is inside the system but also trying to improve the way the chinese can express themselves . "
in the end , the chinese government has not been known to flinch at money and power when it comes to enemies of the state .
so for han han it will be critical to not step over that fine line .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 28.12.2010 germany 's struggle with military power in a changing world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the wall fell , the world changed - and the german military 's role along with it burdened by the genocidal legacy of national socialism , germany swore never again to wage war .
in part one of a three-part series , dw examines how germans overcame historic taboos about deploying their military abroad . in memory of the atrocities committed under the third reich , democratic west germany foreswore war as an instrument of its foreign policy .
its military served a single purpose : to help defend the nato allies in western europe and north america from a soviet attack .
but when the berlin wall fell , the world changed , as did germany 's role within it .
the government of chancellor helmut kohl had just finalized german reunification when a series of conflicts erupted in the persian gulf , yugoslavia and somalia .
as the international community intervened to contain these conflicts , germans faced a historically uncomfortable question : should a reunited and fully sovereign germany become a military power capable of using force on the world stage ? checkbook diplomacy as the us and its coalition partners launched air strikes to eject the iraqi military from kuwait in january 1991 , the streets of germany 's major cities filled with 250,000 protestors who opposed the us-led war against saddam hussein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after reunification , kohl used germany 's checkbook to show solidarity the protests expressed a deep-seated national aversion to war and militarism .
after living at the epicenter of international conflict for an entire century , german society had lost its taste for political violence .
" through the double catastrophe of the two -lsb- world -rsb- wars , the germans transformed themselves from a violent society into a post-heroic society , " said hans-ulrich klose , a bundestag representative and a leading foreign policy expert within the left-of-center social democratic party .
" many germans say that we 're the ones who learned the lessons of history and that others still have to learn those lessons . "
but the germans ' rejection of the american-led coalition , and a un-sanctioned military campaign that targeted an aggressive dictator , left chancellor helmut kohl 's government in a deeply uncomfortable position .
" the kohl government knew they had to contribute to the gulf war due to the principle of allied solidarity , " said karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" but they were at the same time aware of the growing opposition to the war within the electorate . " instead of sending troops to the persian gulf , bonn wrote the coalition partners a check for 17 billion marks -lrb- $ 12 billion , or 8 billion euros -rrb- and supplied logistical support . " we effectively bought ourselves out of the war with our financial contribution , " lamers said . opening pandora 's box the kohl government had been politically and legally boxed into a corner .
on top of vehement public opposition , the government faced a constitution that sanctioned war only in self-defense .
and since saddam hussein had neither attacked germany nor the nato allies , direct german military participation in the conflict was off-limits .
in an effort to reconcile germany 's laws with its international obligations , the center-right christian democratic union called for the " clarification " of two conflicting constitutional articles .
article 87 gave germany the right to field an army for national defense .
but article 24 also permitted germany to join collective security organizations to preserve world peace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faced a quandary during the 1991 gulf war many conservatives argued that article 24 sanctioned german participation in multilateral military operations - with or without a un mandate - that were not directly related to territorial defense . " the claim that the constitution forbids the german armed forces from participating in these kinds of deployments is a legal facade that hides the real political issue , " lamers said .
" in reality it was about the unwillingness and the incapability of the large majority of german citizens and voters to participate in warlike measures . "
partisan firestorm as the governing christian democrats pushed the constitutional question , the opposition social democrats faced internal divisions .
the party base limited its support to un peacekeeping missions while a small elite favored more aggressive military operations like the gulf war .
" the foreign and security policy experts actually wanted such operations as an option , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" but we could n't move our own parliamentary faction because they said the constitution did n't allow such operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boutros boutros-ghali asked germany to send peacekeepers to somalia meanwhile , the pacifist green party rejected military intervention in virtually any form .
" we feared the conservatives who were in power wanted to reconstruct a classic nation state with the capability to project power , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who later served as deputy foreign minister .
" we believed that non-military measures should be developed and given priority . "
even the christian democrats ' own coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , expressed reservations about operations without a un mandate .
fait accompli but world events overshadowed the partisan debate in germany .
the dust had hardly settled in the persian gulf when devastating civil wars broke out in yugoslavia and somalia .
in an attempt to contain violence in southeastern europe , nato and the west european union - a european defense organization - imposed a sea and air blockade on yugoslavia .
nato deployed awacs radar planes to patrol the skies of the balkan war zone .
with germans serving in the multinational crews that manned these aircraft , participation in the blockade was a foregone conclusion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , the constitutional court was asked to decide " we could n't just pull out , " lamers said .
" we were part of a larger whole and were not really free .
we would have risked enormous damage to our image and influence . "
while nato tried to stem the tide of violence in yugoslavia , the un sanctioned a us-led peacekeeping mission to stabilize somalia .
in a trip to bonn , then-un secretary general boutros boutros-ghali personally asked the german government to send peacekeepers to the war-torn east african nation .
with the political parties still in gridlock over the constitutional question , the kohl government decided to act without parliamentary approval .
kohl deployed ships and aircraft to yugoslavia and more than 1,000 soldiers to somalia .
foreign policy on trial politically outmaneuvered , the social democrats sued the kohl government in the federal constitutional court .
yet the party 's foreign and security policy experts worked with the government behind the scenes , according to voigt .
both the opposition and the government wanted to put the constitutional question to rest .
and since parliament could not reach a compromise , they agreed to resolve the political controversy in court .
" we internally agreed to create a case on un operations -lsb- somalia -rsb- , a case on nato operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- and a case on west european union operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- , " voigt said .
" the federal government conducted these operations , and we filed suits against them . "
however , the kohl government almost became a casualty of the legal battle when its coalition partner - the free democrats - sued it over the nato air blockade .
germany 's government now faced an uncertain future as the judges deliberated .
the kohl government dodged a bullet when the federal constitutional court ruled that germany could participate in un , nato and weu military operations worldwide .
but there was an important caveat : these operations had to be approved by a simple parliamentary majority . " we had to slowly learn that we 're a country that represents interests , and that we 're an ally and that carries consequences , " klose said .
" that was a tremendously difficult learning process that has in no way come to an end . "

" instead of sending troops to the persian gulf , bonn wrote the coalition partners a check for 17 billion marks -lrb- $ 12 billion , or 8 billion euros -rrb- and supplied logistical support . " we effectively bought ourselves out of the war with our financial contribution , " lamers said . opening pandora 's box the kohl government had been politically and legally boxed into a corner .
on top of vehement public opposition , the government faced a constitution that sanctioned war only in self-defense .
and since saddam hussein had neither attacked germany nor the nato allies , direct german military participation in the conflict was off-limits .
in an effort to reconcile germany 's laws with its international obligations , the center-right christian democratic union called for the " clarification " of two conflicting constitutional articles .
article 87 gave germany the right to field an army for national defense .
but article 24 also permitted germany to join collective security organizations to preserve world peace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faced a quandary during the 1991 gulf war many conservatives argued that article 24 sanctioned german participation in multilateral military operations - with or without a un mandate - that were not directly related to territorial defense . " the claim that the constitution forbids the german armed forces from participating in these kinds of deployments is a legal facade that hides the real political issue , " lamers said .
" in reality it was about the unwillingness and the incapability of the large majority of german citizens and voters to participate in warlike measures . "
partisan firestorm as the governing christian democrats pushed the constitutional question , the opposition social democrats faced internal divisions .
the party base limited its support to un peacekeeping missions while a small elite favored more aggressive military operations like the gulf war .
" the foreign and security policy experts actually wanted such operations as an option , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" but we could n't move our own parliamentary faction because they said the constitution did n't allow such operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boutros boutros-ghali asked germany to send peacekeepers to somalia meanwhile , the pacifist green party rejected military intervention in virtually any form .
" we feared the conservatives who were in power wanted to reconstruct a classic nation state with the capability to project power , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who later served as deputy foreign minister .
" we believed that non-military measures should be developed and given priority . "
even the christian democrats ' own coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , expressed reservations about operations without a un mandate .
fait accompli but world events overshadowed the partisan debate in germany .
the dust had hardly settled in the persian gulf when devastating civil wars broke out in yugoslavia and somalia .
in an attempt to contain violence in southeastern europe , nato and the west european union - a european defense organization - imposed a sea and air blockade on yugoslavia .
nato deployed awacs radar planes to patrol the skies of the balkan war zone .
with germans serving in the multinational crews that manned these aircraft , participation in the blockade was a foregone conclusion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , the constitutional court was asked to decide " we could n't just pull out , " lamers said .
" we were part of a larger whole and were not really free .
we would have risked enormous damage to our image and influence . "
while nato tried to stem the tide of violence in yugoslavia , the un sanctioned a us-led peacekeeping mission to stabilize somalia .
in a trip to bonn , then-un secretary general boutros boutros-ghali personally asked the german government to send peacekeepers to the war-torn east african nation .
with the political parties still in gridlock over the constitutional question , the kohl government decided to act without parliamentary approval .
kohl deployed ships and aircraft to yugoslavia and more than 1,000 soldiers to somalia .
foreign policy on trial politically outmaneuvered , the social democrats sued the kohl government in the federal constitutional court .
yet the party 's foreign and security policy experts worked with the government behind the scenes , according to voigt .
both the opposition and the government wanted to put the constitutional question to rest .
and since parliament could not reach a compromise , they agreed to resolve the political controversy in court .
" we internally agreed to create a case on un operations -lsb- somalia -rsb- , a case on nato operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- and a case on west european union operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- , " voigt said .
" the federal government conducted these operations , and we filed suits against them . "
however , the kohl government almost became a casualty of the legal battle when its coalition partner - the free democrats - sued it over the nato air blockade .
germany 's government now faced an uncertain future as the judges deliberated .
the kohl government dodged a bullet when the federal constitutional court ruled that germany could participate in un , nato and weu military operations worldwide .
but there was an important caveat : these operations had to be approved by a simple parliamentary majority . " we had to slowly learn that we 're a country that represents interests , and that we 're an ally and that carries consequences , " klose said .
" that was a tremendously difficult learning process that has in no way come to an end . "

in part two of a three-part series , dw examines how the country returned to military action in the balkans . war returned to germany 's doorstep when yugoslavia imploded in ethnic violence .
during the winter of 1994 , german officials agonized over whether to participate in a nato-led military intervention aimed at containing the war .
although the nation 's highest court had declared such interventions constitutional , germany remained deeply reluctant to use military force for any reason other than defense .
but enormous political and moral pressure pushed the kohl government and the opposition toward a shaky consensus in favor of military action against serbia .
this consensus faced its trial-by-fire when the social democrats and greens took the reins of power in 1998 .
in a twist of fate , the traditionally antiwar parties ordered germany 's first offensive military strike since world war ii .
the war next door by the fall of 1994 , the war in yugoslavia had reached a boiling point as serb forces began targeting nato aircraft and un peacekeepers .
the nato allies feared the worst and drew up plans to rescue the lightly armed peacekeepers in the event that the serbs launched an all-out attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl dragged his feet to avoid intervening in yugoslavia .
as nato prepared for a showdown , germany dragged its feet .
chancellor helmut kohl argued that since the third reich had occupied yugoslavia , it would be historically inappropriate for germany to intervene in the current conflict .
kohl was trying to prevent germany from getting involved in the conflict too quickly , according to karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats .
" that was an ineffectual attempt to throw up a firewall , " lamers said .
" kohl was much too intelligent to think that it would hold .
but it fit the disposition among the german people . "
kohl 's firewall began crumbling as the arrival of bosnian refugees started impacting german domestic politics , according to lamers .
and as the humanitarian situation worsened , nato began to lose its patience with bonn .
the allies pressured germany to send its tornado warplanes into the bosnian firestorm .
the tornados had a unique capability to locate and destroy serb radar installations , which would help cover a possible un withdrawal .
germany was the only european country that possessed such aircraft .
ultimately , strategic realities trumped political rhetoric and the kohl government assented to nato 's request .
but germany 's deeply divided parliament still had to approve the decision .
" you can always argue about the sense of using military force , because you never know what the result will be .
that 's the risk , " lamers said .
" but when all the countries in the community that we belong to say its necessary , we ca n't just say ' count me out . " '
winning the home front for the first time since the world war ii , a german government had decided to deploy its military to a war zone .
unwilling to shoulder the full political and moral responsibility for its historic decision , the kohl government reached out to the opposition social democrats and greens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the greens ' joschka fischer said force was justified to stop genocide the bosnian quagmire had thrown the social democratic party into an uproar .
the antiwar mainstream feared embarking down a slippery slope that could lead the country away from its peaceful foreign policy .
but a more hawkish minority supported using force as a last resort to rescue the un peacekeepers and stop the ethnic cleansing .
" in a 10-to-1 vote , the foreign and security policy experts supported the government 's proposal , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" we knew that the party had a different opinion .
there was considerable uproar .
in the end , around 50 social democrats voted with the government in favor of the bosnian mission and against their own party . "
green revolution as social democrats inched closer to the kohl government , the greens were facing a crisis of conscience that threatened to tear their party in two .
traditionally , the green party advocated a pacifist foreign policy rooted in the peaceful resolution of conflicts through international institutions like the un .
but the un 's failure to stop the ethnic cleansing in bosnia led to an ideological revolution within certain quarters of the party .
after serb forces massacred thousands of bosnian muslims in the town of srebrenica , green party whip joschka fischer declared that force was justified to stop genocide .
" with the balkan wars we realized for the first time that there are situations in which one has to intervene militarily , " said ludger volmer , former president of the green party who went on to serve as the country 's deputy foreign minister . " that was a difficult learning process . "
this learning process would end with the bundestag sending tornado warplanes as well as peacekeepers to bosnia .
against the historical and political odds , germany 's divided parties had forged a shaky consensus in favor of military intervention .
peaceniks in power after serving 16 years in the opposition , the social democrats and greens defeated the kohl government in the 1998 elections .
no sooner had the left-of-center coalition come to power than renewed ethnic violence erupted in yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's air war against serbia was an allied intervention while nato peacekeepers secured the precarious peace in bosnia , the breakaway province of kosovo careened toward war as ethnic albanians demanded independence from serbia .
germany and its nato allies pushed for a peaceful settlement .
but negotiations collapsed when both sides refused to compromise on kosovo 's political status .
in anticipation of this worst-case scenario , the kohl government had committed germany to participate in a nato air war against serbia .
now , social democratic chancellor gerhard schroeder and green party foreign minister joschka fischer had to decide whether they would honor their predecessor 's commitment .
air strikes hardly squared with the coalition 's platform of a foreign policy rooted in peaceful conflict resolution .
bombing belgrade when the security council stalled over russian and chinese objections , nato decided to launch its air war without a un mandate .
the nato allies accused serbia of ethnic cleansing and argued that time was of the essence in order to save innocent lives .
schroeder and fischer faced a nightmare scenario : an allied military intervention without un sanction .
" the new schroeder-fischer government agreed to participate for purely opportune reasons , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert and parliamentarian within the social democratic party .
" they knew that if they did n't participate , they would face foreign policy isolation from the outset .
that 's what i call the joke of history .
the german position changed irrevocably because the government had no choice but to say yes . "
with deep reservations , the former antiwar opposition ordered warplanes to bomb belgrade in germany 's first overt military strike since world war ii .
the shaky foreign policy consensus forged during the bosnian crisis had survived its trial-by-fire in kosovo .
" germany is not a military power and it does n't want to become one , " volmer said .
" you can not help but recognize that there are some conflicts for which you have to arm yourself and that there may be situations in which you have to intervene militarily .
but at its very core , germany has a remote relationship to armed force .
that 's a lesson from the second world war , from history . "

traditionally , the green party advocated a pacifist foreign policy rooted in the peaceful resolution of conflicts through international institutions like the un .
but the un 's failure to stop the ethnic cleansing in bosnia led to an ideological revolution within certain quarters of the party .
after serb forces massacred thousands of bosnian muslims in the town of srebrenica , green party whip joschka fischer declared that force was justified to stop genocide .
" with the balkan wars we realized for the first time that there are situations in which one has to intervene militarily , " said ludger volmer , former president of the green party who went on to serve as the country 's deputy foreign minister . " that was a difficult learning process . "
this learning process would end with the bundestag sending tornado warplanes as well as peacekeepers to bosnia .
against the historical and political odds , germany 's divided parties had forged a shaky consensus in favor of military intervention .

in part two of a three-part series , dw examines how the country returned to military action in the balkans . war returned to germany 's doorstep when yugoslavia imploded in ethnic violence .
during the winter of 1994 , german officials agonized over whether to participate in a nato-led military intervention aimed at containing the war .
although the nation 's highest court had declared such interventions constitutional , germany remained deeply reluctant to use military force for any reason other than defense .
but enormous political and moral pressure pushed the kohl government and the opposition toward a shaky consensus in favor of military action against serbia .
this consensus faced its trial-by-fire when the social democrats and greens took the reins of power in 1998 .
in a twist of fate , the traditionally antiwar parties ordered germany 's first offensive military strike since world war ii .
the war next door by the fall of 1994 , the war in yugoslavia had reached a boiling point as serb forces began targeting nato aircraft and un peacekeepers .
the nato allies feared the worst and drew up plans to rescue the lightly armed peacekeepers in the event that the serbs launched an all-out attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl dragged his feet to avoid intervening in yugoslavia .
as nato prepared for a showdown , germany dragged its feet .
chancellor helmut kohl argued that since the third reich had occupied yugoslavia , it would be historically inappropriate for germany to intervene in the current conflict .
kohl was trying to prevent germany from getting involved in the conflict too quickly , according to karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats .
" that was an ineffectual attempt to throw up a firewall , " lamers said .
" kohl was much too intelligent to think that it would hold .
but it fit the disposition among the german people . "
kohl 's firewall began crumbling as the arrival of bosnian refugees started impacting german domestic politics , according to lamers .
and as the humanitarian situation worsened , nato began to lose its patience with bonn .
the allies pressured germany to send its tornado warplanes into the bosnian firestorm .
the tornados had a unique capability to locate and destroy serb radar installations , which would help cover a possible un withdrawal .
germany was the only european country that possessed such aircraft .
ultimately , strategic realities trumped political rhetoric and the kohl government assented to nato 's request .
but germany 's deeply divided parliament still had to approve the decision .
" you can always argue about the sense of using military force , because you never know what the result will be .
that 's the risk , " lamers said .
" but when all the countries in the community that we belong to say its necessary , we ca n't just say ' count me out . " '
winning the home front for the first time since the world war ii , a german government had decided to deploy its military to a war zone .
unwilling to shoulder the full political and moral responsibility for its historic decision , the kohl government reached out to the opposition social democrats and greens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the greens ' joschka fischer said force was justified to stop genocide the bosnian quagmire had thrown the social democratic party into an uproar .
the antiwar mainstream feared embarking down a slippery slope that could the country away from its peaceful foreign policy .
but a more hawkish minority supported using force as a last resort to rescue the un peacekeepers and stop the ethnic cleansing .
" in a 10-to-1 vote , the foreign and security policy experts supported the government 's proposal , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" we knew that the party had a different opinion .
there was considerable uproar .
in the end , around 50 social democrats voted with the government in favor of the bosnian mission and against their own party . "
green revolution as social democrats inched closer to the kohl government , the greens were facing a crisis of conscience that threatened to tear their party in two .

in part one of a three-part series , dw examines how germans overcame historic taboos about deploying their military abroad . in memory of the atrocities committed under the third reich , democratic west germany foreswore war as an instrument of its foreign policy .
its military served a single purpose : to help defend the nato allies in western europe and north america from a soviet attack .
but when the berlin wall fell , the world changed , as did germany 's role within it .
the government of chancellor helmut kohl had just finalized german reunification when a series of conflicts erupted in the persian gulf , yugoslavia and somalia .
as the international community intervened to contain these conflicts , germans faced a historically uncomfortable question : should a reunited and fully sovereign germany become a military power capable of using force on the world stage ? checkbook diplomacy as the us and its coalition partners launched air strikes to eject the iraqi military from kuwait in january 1991 , the streets of germany 's major cities filled with 250,000 protestors who opposed the us-led war against saddam hussein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after reunification , kohl used germany 's checkbook to show solidarity the protests expressed a deep-seated national aversion to war and militarism .
after living at the epicenter of international conflict for an entire century , german society had lost its taste for political violence .
" through the double catastrophe of the two -lsb- world -rsb- wars , the germans transformed themselves from a violent society into a post-heroic society , " said hans-ulrich klose , a bundestag representative and a leading foreign policy expert within the left-of-center social democratic party .
" many germans say that we 're the ones who learned the lessons of history and that others still have to learn those lessons . "
but the germans ' rejection of the american-led coalition , and a un-sanctioned military campaign that targeted an aggressive dictator , left chancellor helmut kohl 's government in a deeply uncomfortable position .
" the kohl government knew they had to contribute to the gulf war due to the principle of allied solidarity , " said karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" but they were at the same time aware of the growing opposition to the war within the electorate . " instead of sending troops to the persian gulf , bonn wrote the coalition partners a check for 17 billion marks -lrb- $ 12 billion , or 8 billion euros -rrb- and supplied logistical support . " we effectively bought ourselves out of the war with our financial contribution , " lamers said . opening pandora 's box the kohl government had been politically and legally boxed into a corner .
on top of vehement public opposition , the government faced a constitution that sanctioned war only in self-defense .
and since saddam hussein had neither attacked germany nor the nato allies , direct german military participation in the conflict was off-limits .
in an effort to reconcile germany 's laws with its international obligations , the center-right christian democratic union called for the " clarification " of two conflicting constitutional articles .
article 87 gave germany the right to field an army for national defense .
but article 24 also permitted germany to join collective security organizations to preserve world peace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faced a quandary during the 1991 gulf war many conservatives argued that article 24 sanctioned german participation in multilateral military operations - with or without a un mandate - that were not directly related to territorial defense . " the claim that the constitution forbids the german armed forces from participating in these kinds of deployments is a legal facade that hides the real political issue , " lamers said .
" in reality it was about the unwillingness and the incapability of the large majority of german citizens and voters to participate in warlike measures . "
partisan firestorm as the governing christian democrats pushed the constitutional question , the opposition social democrats faced internal divisions .
the party base limited its support to un peacekeeping missions while a small elite favored more aggressive military operations like the gulf war .
" the foreign and security policy experts actually wanted such operations as an option , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" but we could n't move our own parliamentary faction because they said the constitution did n't allow such operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boutros boutros-ghali asked germany to send peacekeepers to somalia meanwhile , the pacifist green party rejected military intervention in virtually any form .
" we feared the conservatives who were in power wanted to reconstruct a classic nation state with the capability to project power , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who later served as deputy foreign minister .
" we believed that non-military measures should be developed and given priority . "
even the christian democrats ' own coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , expressed reservations about operations without a un mandate .
fait accompli but world events overshadowed the partisan debate in germany .
the dust had hardly settled in the persian gulf when devastating civil wars broke out in yugoslavia and somalia .
in an attempt to contain violence in southeastern europe , nato and the west european union - a european defense organization - imposed a sea and air blockade on yugoslavia .
nato deployed awacs radar planes to patrol the skies of the balkan war zone .
with germans serving in the multinational crews that manned these aircraft , participation in the blockade was a foregone conclusion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , the constitutional court was asked to decide " we could n't just pull out , " lamers said .
" we were part of a larger whole and were not really free .
we would have risked enormous damage to our image and influence . "
while nato tried to stem the tide of violence in yugoslavia , the un sanctioned a us-led peacekeeping mission to stabilize somalia .
in a trip to bonn , then-un secretary general boutros boutros-ghali personally asked the german government to send peacekeepers to the war-torn east african nation .
with the political parties still in gridlock over the constitutional question , the kohl government decided to act without parliamentary approval .
kohl deployed ships and aircraft to yugoslavia and more than 1,000 soldiers to somalia .
foreign policy on trial politically outmaneuvered , the social democrats sued the kohl government in the federal constitutional court .
yet the party 's foreign and security policy experts worked with the government behind the scenes , according to voigt .
both the opposition and the government wanted to put the constitutional question to rest .
and since parliament could not reach a compromise , they agreed to resolve the political controversy in court .
" we internally agreed to create a case on un operations -lsb- somalia -rsb- , a case on nato operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- and a case on west european union operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- , " voigt said .
" the federal government conducted these operations , and we filed suits against them . "
however , the kohl government almost became a casualty of the legal battle when its coalition partner - the free democrats - sued it over the nato air blockade .
germany 's government now faced an uncertain future as the judges deliberated .
the kohl government dodged a bullet when the federal constitutional court ruled that germany could participate in un , nato and weu military operations worldwide .
but there was an important caveat : these operations had to be approved by a simple parliamentary majority . " we had to slowly learn that we 're a country that represents interests , and that we 're an ally and that carries consequences , " klose said .
" that was a tremendously difficult learning process that has in no way come to an end . "

" we were part of a larger whole and were not really free .
we would have risked enormous damage to our image and influence . "
while nato tried to stem the tide of violence in yugoslavia , the un sanctioned a us-led peacekeeping mission to stabilize somalia .
in a trip to bonn , then-un secretary general boutros boutros-ghali personally asked the german government to send peacekeepers to the war-torn east african nation .
with the political parties still in gridlock over the constitutional question , the kohl government decided to act without parliamentary approval .
kohl deployed ships and aircraft to yugoslavia and more than 1,000 soldiers to somalia .
foreign policy on trial politically outmaneuvered , the social democrats sued the kohl government in the federal constitutional court .
yet the party 's foreign and security policy experts worked with the government behind the scenes , according to voigt .
both the opposition and the government wanted to put the constitutional question to rest .
and since parliament could not reach a compromise , they agreed to resolve the political controversy in court .
" we internally agreed to create a case on un operations -lsb- somalia -rsb- , a case on nato operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- and a case on west european union operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- , " voigt said .
" the federal government conducted these operations , and we filed suits against them . "
however , the kohl government almost became a casualty of the legal battle when its coalition partner - the free democrats - sued it over the nato air blockade .
germany 's government now faced an uncertain future as the judges deliberated .
the kohl government dodged a bullet when the federal constitutional court ruled that germany could participate in un , nato and weu military operations worldwide .
but there was an important caveat : these operations had to be approved by a simple parliamentary majority . " we had to slowly learn that we 're a country that represents interests , and that we 're an ally and that carries consequences , " klose said .
" that was a tremendously difficult learning process that has in no way come to an end . "

the most recent is pirateleaks.cz , launched by the czech pirate party . in the aftermath of the latest releases of information of secret documents by the infamous wikileaks , a crop of clones have popped up in europe .
one has been seeded by ex-wikileaks staffers , others were simply inspired by the original , but all of them want to make a difference .
wikileaks clones include the forthcoming openleaks in germany , with former wikileaks staffer , daniel domscheit-berg at the helm .
openleaks aims to democratize the process of leaking information and whistle-blowing and support the introduction of new legislation defending the rights of whistle-blowers .
other such websites include brusselsleaks.com , balkanleaks.eu , rospil.info and indoleaks.org , each hoping to blow the lid on corruption and secret documents in the european union , the balkans , russia and indonesia respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other sites , such as openleaks in germany plan to tackle transparency pirates of the czech republic in a café in prague , the public face of another secret whistle-blowing website demonstrated such a product to deutsche welle .
the czech pirate party announced earlier this month that it had created a new secret-leaking site called pirateleaks and it aims to do the same thing as wikileaks , only focusing in the czech republic .
the aim of the site is to encourage transparency in czech government .
" our sources are people who work with documents in the authorities , are journalists who are afraid to publish these documents because of political reasons , and are simply members of the public , " spokesman jakub michalek said .
the creators of pirateleaks will be hoping all those sources supply them with evidence of corruption .
the small amount of information released since this week 's launch has n't exactly rocked the czech political establishment – though the site has ruffled a few feathers , michalek added .
" the politicians are afraid to say that this is a bad thing , because we are working exactly in accordance with the law , " he said . " but on the other side there were also reactions like , ' this is outrageous , this should be banned , the site should be closed immediately . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirateleaks.cz wants to fight corruption within czech government members of the media who have been reporting on corruption within the czech republic welcomed the new site .
" i think it 's very good that we have another source of information , one that is setting as its goal finding documents that are normally not available , " prague-based journalist erik best told deutsche welle .
" and i think with the impetus , with the excitement in the west and all over the world with wikileaks , that connection is going to be a big benefit for the site . "
data protection in sweden pirateleaks next goal is to locate its servers in sweden , with either a fellow pirate organization or prq , the same hosting service that maintains wikileaks ' servers there .
prq prides itself on requiring hardly any personal information from its clients .
" we would like to move to sweden or a different place that is much safer , as soon as possible , " michalek said .
" because the services that we can get in sweden with a pirate isp , or the prq company , are much better , we can get a safer connection .
things can be with more anonymity than we can get here in the czech republic . "

but critics say the intiative may see higher prices at the pump and cause damage to the environment . as of january 1 , 2011 , german drivers will have the option to fuel up their cars with new super e10 , a biofuel with higher ethanol content .
the change is part of germany 's plan to incrementally decrease its carbon emissions , with the goal of an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
but for everyday german drivers , the cost of the new biofuel is still a relative unknown , and the subject of much speculation .
previously , biofuel in germany only had five percent ethanol content , whereas e10 packs a solid 10 percent ethanol , an increase that should prove more environmentally friendly .
the federal ministry for the environment , nature conservation and nuclear safety -lrb- bmu -rrb- estimates that around 90 percent of existing german cars will be e10-compatible .
those vehicles unable to run on e10 can keep using the five percent variety until it is phased out in 2013 .
e10 will be available from the more than 14,000 service stations throughout the country as of the first of the year .
according to the bmu , the higher ethanol gasoline will have a decreased impact on the environment in terms of carbon emissions and will reduce consumer reliance on diminishing oil reserves .
the initiative is also designed to bring germany into compliance with a european commission directive seeking an eu-wide greenhouse gas emission savings of 60 percent from 2018 onwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while they disagree on how much , most parties say e10 will cost more than regular gas more ethanol means more cost the cost to the consumer is one contentious issue that is being batted around between the various groups interested in the project .
as the cost of producing ethanol biofuel is higher than regular gasoline , the bmu expects the price at the pump to increase slightly as well .
" with the introduction of e10 come additional costs for the production of bioethanol and the maintenance of fuel quality , " the ministry said .
but the german association for the biofuel industry contended that prices will not increase significantly .
" ethanol will not be much more expensive than gasoline , " association president claus sauter told press agency dpa .
" in addition , the petroleum industry itself is interested in selling e10 , because it is legally obliged to bring biofuels to market . "
on the other side of the issue , the spokesman for bp europe told bonn 's general anzeiger newspaper , " for drivers , the price will always be higher , " estimating an increased cost of 50 percent over normal petrol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as food crops are replaced by biofuel production , the cost in carbon increases cost to the environment another bone of contention is the actual environmental impact of the new biofuel due to something called indirect land use .
this is essentially the consequence of changing the use of land in order to produce crops used in biofuel production .
as more arable land is used to produce biofuel , the increased land clearance to grow food crops has the knock-on effect of higher carbon emissions .
originally , the commission had anticipated enacting its directive 98/70 / ec , requiring member states to report on the greenhouse gas intensity of fuel and energy , starting on january 1 , 2011 .
according to the directive , suppliers are required to gradually reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent by the end of 2020 at the latest .
but shortly before the january kick-off date for the initiative , the european commission published a report on indirect land use change related to biofuels .
it found that the ramifications of indirect land use required more investigation before it could proceed with the directive .
" the potential effects of indirect land use need to be properly weighed in our biofuels policy .
it is in our interest to investigate this seriously and ensure legislation that avoids negative side effects , " energy commissioner guenther oettinger said .
the result of its findings led the commission to delay its biofuel directive until july of 2011 .
in germany , however , the bmu claims that many of the required elements for biofuel production are locally and sustainably grown .

but now they have to pay for a license if they want children to perform certain songs . a tightening of copyright rules means kindergartens now have to pay fees to germany 's music licensing agency , gema , to use songs that they reproduce and perform .
the organization has begun notifying creches and other daycare facilities that if they reproduce music to be sung or performed , they must pay for a license .
" if a preschool wants to make its own copy of certain music - if the words of a song or the musical score is copied - then they need to buy a license , " gema spokesperson peter hempel told deutsche welle .
the new rules came into power at the beginning of this year , but have only recently drawn attention as daycare centers have received letters reminding them that they need to sign contracts with gema before distributing sheet music to children to sing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if copies of music are made , the fee needs to be paid gema said that the need for licenses would not have any effect on singing in kindergartens .
" it does n't cost anything to sing in kindergartens , " said peter hempel .
" if a school does not make any copies of music , then of course they do n't need to pay anything . "
traditional songs are copyright-free the copyright rules only concern the rights for modern songs .
songs written by an author who has been dead for over 70 years are automatically in the public domain .
" for old songs , for traditional folk songs for example , it costs nothing , " said hempel .
fees start at 56 euros -lrb- $ 74 -rrb- for 500 copies of a song , a rate charged annually , not per child .
gema - the german abbreviation stands for the society for musical performing and mechanical reproduction rights - exists to make sure that the intellectual property of musicians is protected .
it is the collection agent for another group , vg musikedition , which monitors copyright for musicians and distributes the profits from the licensing fees back to its members .

the mob injured one soldier with a machete and burned one of the convoy 's vehicles , the un said in a statement . the un human rights council says about 14,000 refugees have fled ivory coast to neighboring liberia over fears of renewed civil war . influential in west africa even before tuesday 's meeting , gbagbo responded to the threat of military force from ecowas by saying it would push ivory coast closer to civil war , and added that there would be consequences for countries that got involved .

some commentators fear blurry boundaries are putting aid workers at deadly risk . the killing of an afghanistan-based german aid worker by the taliban over the weekend has sparked calls for a greater and more visible separation between development work and military forces in the country .
former united nations special representative to afghanistan and current member of the german bundestag tom koenigs stressed that aid workers are in more danger than ever .
" the workers ' neutrality is no longer being acknowledged a priori , partly because their work has been politicized more and more in recent years , " koenigs said in an interview with the daily koelner stadtanzeiger .
" the price for that is that the development workers are perceived as part of the war .
we should concentrate more on separating development work from military deployment . "
koenigs ' comments come just weeks after german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg called for troops in crisis regions to work more closely with humanitarian aid agencies on the ground .
targeting aid workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is still rebuilding the most recent victim of the insurgency , an engineer working as an advisor to the german development bank kfw , was fatally wounded while travelling in a vehicle with three colleagues .
one of the colleagues , an afghan translator , was also injured in the attack .
the kfw advisor is the latest in a series of aid workers to be targeted in afghanistan this year , which has seen a spike in the number deaths of civilian development workers .
attacks directed at un employees working in afghanistan have increased by more than 130 percent in 2010 compared to last year , according to the united nations department of safety and security .
in another high-profile case from september , aid worker linda norgrove of scotland was taken hostage and later killed during a us-led operation to secure her release .
she had been working for the american-based organization development alternatives inc .
risks ever-present kieran dwyer of the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan said his organization attempts to minimize risks for development workers by remaining in constant contact with civilian and government leaders about possible risks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister dirk niebel called the attack on the aid worker " cowardly " " but the security risks can only be mitigated by the way we operate , not eliminated , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's important to remember that not just foreign aid workers but also afghan aid and government workers are targeted by insurgents .
it is not only the rising number of attacks that concerns dwyer .
" insurgents also began to target more regions of the country in the last year , often attacking the so-called soft targets of unarmed government and humanitarian workers , " he added .
germany has 4,800 troops in afghanistan , most of whom are serving in the north of the country , where the attack on the kfw consultant took place .
berlin is to begin reducing troop numbers in afghanistan by the end of 2011 , and to pull out of the country completely within four years . author : greg wiser -lrb- dpa -rrb- editor : sophie tarr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this has triggered a copyright discussion in germany . german copyright rules require anyone who copies sheet music pay fees to germany 's music licensing agency , gema .
the organization has begun notifying kindergartens and other preschool facilities that if they reproduce music to be sung or performed , they must pay for a license .
" if a preschool wants to make its own copy of certain music - if the words of a song or the musical score is copied - then they need to buy a license , " gema spokesperson peter hempel told deutsche welle .
the rules have been in place for 25 years , but they have only recently drawn attention .
gema began at the beginning of 2010 to send out reminders to daycare centers stressing that they need to sign contracts before making copies of sheet music for the children to sing from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if copies of music are made , the fee needs to be paid gema said that the need for licenses would not have any effect on singing in kindergartens .
" it does n't cost anything to sing in kindergartens , " said peter hempel .
" if a kindergarten or school does not make any copies of music , then of course they do n't need to pay anything . "
traditional songs are copyright-free the copyright rules only concern the rights for modern songs .
songs written by an author who has been dead for over 70 years are automatically in the public domain .
" for old songs , for traditional folk songs for example , it costs nothing , " said hempel .
fees start at 56 euros -lrb- $ 74 -rrb- for 500 copies of a song , a rate charged annually , not per child .
gema - the german abbreviation stands for the society for musical performing and mechanical reproduction rights - exists to make sure that the intellectual property of musicians is protected .
it is the collection agent for another group , vg musikedition , which monitors copyright for musicians and distributes the profits from the licensing fees back to its members .

the case recalls the murder of former russian agent alexander litvinenko in 2006 . german prosecutors say they are investigating the possibility that a russian dissident couple living in germany could be the victims of a poisoning attack .
the news magazine focus reported earlier that the couple alerted police because they believed they were the target of an attack .
the magazine said that the couple , viktor and marina kalashnikov , had abnormally high concentrations of mercury in their blood .
the magazine said both have suffered health problems and that medical experts have recommended that the couple undergo further tests and be watched closely .
mercury poisoning can lead to kidney failure and problems with speech .
kremlin critics the kalashnikovs , who are journalists , have written articles in which they criticize the kremlin , especially its policy in chechnya .
they came to germany in september and now live in berlin .
they told focus they were sure the russian secret service was behind the suspected attack .
prosecutors said the case was being handled by a department specializing in politically motivated crimes .

the case recalls the murder of former russian agent alexander litvinenko in 2006 . german prosecutors say they are investigating the possibility that a russian dissident couple living in germany could be the victims of a poisoning attack .
the news magazine focus reported earlier that the couple alerted police because they believed they were the target of an attack .
the magazine said that the couple , viktor and marina kalashnikov , had abnormally high concentrations of mercury in their blood .
the magazine said both have suffered health problems and that medical experts have recommended that the couple undergo further tests and be watched closely .
mercury poisoning can lead to kidney failure and problems with speech .
kremlin critics the kalashnikovs , who are journalists , have written articles in which they criticize the kremlin , especially its policy in chechnya .
they came to germany in september and now live in berlin .
they told focus they were sure the russian secret service was behind the suspected attack .
prosecutors said the case was being handled by a department specializing in politically motivated crimes .

competitors from austria , poland and switzerland are considered to be among the favorites . the four hills tournament is a series of four ski jump competitions timed to ring in the new year .
the 59th edition of the competition starts in the german town of oberstdorf on wednesday , followed by the new year 's day jumps in garmisch-partenkirchen .
after that , the tournament moves to austria , with jumps in innsbruck on january 3 and in bishofshofen on january 6 .
at the end of the tournament , the competitor with the best overall score from the four events is declared the winner .
for german fans of ski jumping , it seems ages ago since sven hannawald swept the events of the four hills tournament in the 2001-02 competition .
he became the first ski jumper to win all four events of the tournament , a feat that has yet to be matched .
but if germany 's current form is anything to go by , they 'll be lucky to crack the top-10 in the overall standings , let alone win any of the events .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german pascal bodmer could crack the top 10 " of course we would rather go into the competition as one of the favourites , " said german ski jumping coach werner schuster .
" but it 's our goal for at least one of our ski jumpers to make it into the top 10 . "
the former stars of the german team , martin schmitt and michael uhrmann , are both 32 and not in very good form . schmitt 's best days on the hills may be behind him , but according to coach schuster , due to his experience - schmitt is competing in his 15th four hills tournament - he remains an important part of the team .
with schmitt no longer expected to reach the podium , it will be young up-and-coming ski jumpers such as severin freund and pascal bodmer who will likely be germany 's best hopes for cracking the top 10 . " the young guys are still really coachable , " schuster said .
" they 'll have to show what they can do at the first and second events in particular .
that 's where the wheat is separated from the chaff . "
austria 's morgenstern is the favorite the austrians , with their duo of thomas morgenstern and andreas kofler are considered to be favorites , and are going for their third consecutive overall win . morgenstern is on form , having won four consecutive world cup events this season .
he 's trying to go into the four hills as relaxed as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's thomas morgenstern is one of the favourites " i do n't wrack my brain over winning the tournament , " morgenstern said .
" i still just want to continue to have fun .
ski-jumping is not the most important part in my life . "
kofler , the defending four hills title holder , said he did n't feel any added pressure going into this year 's competition . " i can be calm about it and start with a lot of pleasant anticipation since i 've already won the tournament , " he said .
austria 's national coach , alexander pointer , is quite optimistic about a win .
" we do n't need to be overmodest , " he said .
" i see two exceptional athletes on the ski-jumping circuit at the moment : morgenstern and kofler . "
but there is some bad news for the austrian team as well .
gregor schlierenzauer , who has twice won the ski jumping world championship , will not be able to compete in the first two of the four tournament events due to an injured knee .
" it 's a tough decision for me .
but my head tells me that this is right thing to do for the long-term , " the 20-year-old schlierenzauer said .
schmitt wo n't quit after this year 's season polish ski jumper adam malysz and simon ammann from switzerland have set out to stop the austrian wave of success .
ammann , who has won four olympic titles - including two gold medals in vancouver - has yet to win the four hills tournament .
" the tournament is hugely attractive and its mystique gets bigger and bigger , as my chances of winning get " he said .
" so far , the tournament has been a tough nut to crack for me . "
a maximum of 57,000 euro -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- awaits the winner of the four hills tournament if he ties the record by german ski jumper hannawald .
in addition to the prize money , there will be a car worth some 30,000 euro -lrb- $ 40,000 -rrb- .

in the last of a three-part series , dw examines the country 's decision to deploy its military in afghanistan , and the ' warlike conditions ' there . a political shockwave reverberated across the atlantic ocean after islamic terrorists razed the world trade center and part of the pentagon on september 11 , 2001 .
in keeping with germany 's responsibility as a nato member , chancellor gerhard schroeder declared unlimited solidarity with a wounded america .
schroeder 's declaration carried sweeping military consequences for germany .
only three years after his left-of-center coalition had participated in nato 's air war against serbia , he deployed soldiers for an ambitious stabilization mission in war-torn afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schroeder showed solidarity with the us in sending troops .
germany 's stabilization mission looked increasingly like a counterinsurgency as its soldiers faced a resurgent taliban .
and in september 2009 , tensions came to a head when a german colonel ordered an airstrike against two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the strike killed 142 people , laying bare the realities of the afghan conflict for the german public .
after years of whitewashing the conflict in afghanistan , berlin has been forced to acknowledge that its soldiers are fighting and dying under " warlike conditions . "
germany can never again claim that it will never wage war .
solidarity among allies in the days following september 11 , germany rallied behind the united states as the bush administration assembled a military coalition to retaliate against the perpetrators of the attacks in new york and washington d.c.
" initially , operation enduring freedom was mandated through the united nations while nato invoked article 5 for the first time , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who served as deputy foreign minister at that time .
" the usa had been attacked and article 5 required germany to make a contribution . "
but germany 's support for america went beyond legal obligations , according to volmer .
many germans felt a deep emotional bond with their historical ally , creating a political climate in which participation in an offensive military campaign could be openly discussed .
" the german people made spontaneous displays of solidarity with the american people , " volmer said .
" many germans said the americans helped us against hitler and protected us during the cold war and now we have to return the favor . "
this solidarity ran into obstacles on the political front , however .
although the german military had participated in the kosovo war of 1999 , anxiety about military force remained deeply rooted in the national psyche .
many social democrats and greens worried that germany would be dragged into an open ended , global war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years , flag-draped caskets began returning to germany but in a political power play , schroeder tied parliament 's vote on operation enduring freedom with a vote of confidence .
if antiwar skeptics among the social democrats and greens voted against the war , they would also be voting against their own government .
faced with the choice of political influence or principle , most social democrats and greens closed ranks and threw their confidence behind their coalition government .
the resolution passed , allocating 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom and saving the government from collapse . mixed message as the united states waged war in pursuit of the perpetrators of september 11 , the international community designed a stabilization force to ease the impact of the conflict on civilians .
" the next step in the discussion was to demand that the military strikes not be directed against the afghan people , " volmer said .
" instead , the afghans should benefit from the intervention . "
while oef had been tasked with rooting out the taliban and al-qaeda , the international security assistance force would seek to create a secure environment in which afghanistan could build a postwar future for itself .
berlin sought to keep oef and isaf - war and stabilization - clearly separated from one another with an emphasis on putting isaf in the lead .
" that again has to do with history , " said karl lamers , former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats . " we do n't do war .
we conduct other actions that demand the use of force . "
but berlin 's policy began to send mixed messages .
in 2004 , german soldiers set up shop in the northern afghan city of kunduz , where they assisted civilian reconstruction efforts .
however , they became increasingly entangled in ambushes , mortar attacks and running gun battles as the taliban made a comeback .
the distinction between stabilization and war had become blurred .
as the years passed , flag-draped caskets returned home , and terrorists increasingly targeted europe , the justification for the mission became more self-assertive .
slowly , german defense experts began to take ownership of the conflict by identifying it as being in the national interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz strike killed 142 and left many wounded in hospitals " later we recognized what defense minister -lrb- peter -rrb- struck had pointed out : we are also defending germany 's security on the hindu kush , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert within the social democratic party .
" this view was supported by the attacks in london and madrid and through the clear fact that there 's something like a home-grown but foreign-trained terrorism that threatens us all . "
acts of war in september of 2009 , the simmering security situation in northern afghanistan boiled over .
colonel georg klein , commander of the german soldiers in kunduz , ordered american bombers to eliminate two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the airstrike killed 142 people .
many of the dead were civilians .
klein defended his order by claiming that he had believed the tankers would be used as an explosive device against his soldiers .
however , the subsequent investigation by isaf indicated that klein targeted the people , not the tanker itself .
local taliban leaders may have been among the crowd .
a german officer had launched a preemptive strike against a perceived threat orchestrated by a human enemy .
germany had waged war in front of the entire international community .
a half truth in the aftermath of the kunduz bombing , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg acknowledged that the german army was operating under " warlike conditions . "
and after three soldiers died in a taliban ambush in april of 2010 , chancellor angela merkel made a similar admission .
during the nationally televised memorial service for the fallen , merkel expressed understanding for soldiers who said they were fighting in a war .
so what do observers think of politicians ' attempts to find a label just short of ' war ' for the unconventional conflict in afghanistan ?
according to lamers , it 's a legal sideshow - one that began with the debate over the gulf war , raged during the yugoslavia crisis , and has been partially exposed by the kunduz airstrike .
military force - however it may be labeled by the political establishment - is now a regular and tolerated feature of german foreign policy .
germany no longer faces a national historical dilemma of whether it can use force at all .
rather , it has returned to history and once again confronts the broader human question : under what circumstances is military force justified ?
" it 's a question for all of us that nobody can definitively answer yet , but which we have to discuss intensively with one another , " lamers said .
" how do we position ourselves in a world where there are still cases like afghanistan ?
how do we deal with that ?
do we just say that we ca n't do anything about it ?
or if we can do something , what exactly should we do ? "
considering its tainted history , germany will have to be especially careful in its search for an answer .

moscow said claims of selective justice were " unacceptable . " russia has reacted to criticism over monday 's new guilty verdict against the jailed former oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky by telling the european union and the united states to stay out of its affairs . " we expect everyone to mind his own business , both at home and in the international arena , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" attempts to put pressure on the proceedings are unacceptable , " the ministry said , using unusually blunt language for a diplomatic statement .
khodorkovsky was convicted on monday of stealing oil from his former company , yukos , between 1999 and 2003 and laundering the proceeds .
the conviction drew international criticism , with the united states saying it was " deeply concerned " about the " selective application of justice . "
germany said the verdict was a step backwards for russia , while france called for the rule of law to be respected .
khodorkovsky vs putin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and khodorkovsky are seen as personal rivals critics and human rights activists regard the trial as having been politically motivated .
they say the aim is to sideline khodorkovsky because he financed opposition parties . once the richest man in russia , he was convicted of fraud in 2003 and sentenced to prison .
his jail term was due to expire in 2011 .
khodorkovsky is an outspoken opponent of russian prime minister vladimir putin , who was the country 's president when khodorkovsky was initially convicted .
the new prison sentence could put him behind bars beyond the 2012 presidential elections .
if the court follows the prosecutors ' calls , he could stay in jail until 2017 .
vladimir putin is widely expected to run again for the presidency in 2012 .
he served two terms in that office , from 2000 to 2008 .
the constitution barred him from serving a third , consecutive term .
however , from 2012 putin could again serve as president for another two terms .
full verdict expected by friday the reading of the full verdict is ongoing and expected to be completed by the end of the week , at the earliest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as yukos chief , khodorkovsky was the richest man in russia khodorkovsky 's defense team suggested the verdict would be pronounced on friday .
as the first 10 days of january are vacation days in russia , no newspapers will be published that could question the court 's impartiality . in a statement released on khodorkovsky 's website , he and his co-defendant , platon lebedev , thanked their supporters for protesting outside the court building .
" power without law is a stool without a leg .
it looks silly and its prospects are predictable , " the statement said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 28.12.2010 a good effort , but us foreign policy in 2010 has made little impact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : success in foreign policy was hard to come by for the us in 2010 the past year wasn ’ t a very successful one for us foreign policy .
analysts argue that the obama administration can claim only one major success and that the future doesn ’ t look much brighter either . the list of foreign policy issues demanding the attention of the white house and the state department in 2010 was impressive : aside from intractable challenges such as the war in afghanistan , international terrorism , iran ’ s nuclear program , efforts to close the guantanamo prison camp and nonproliferation of nuclear weapons , came a slew of other topics such as the revival of the middle east peace process , fulfilling the promise of the reset of relations with russia , preventing a full-scale war in the korean peninsula and managing the fallout of the wikileaks document dump .
taking a half-time tally of barack obama 's foreign policy in his first term , scholars interviewed by deutsche welle paint a bleak picture with only a few bright spots .
" i would say that his foreign policy was moderately good with no great achievements frankly , " says marcin zaborowski , director of the polish institute of international affairs in warsaw .
" we have n't really had a breakthrough not even in the past year , but in the two years of obama 's presidency which is not perhaps necessarily due to a lack of his leadership skills , but a reflection of the scale of problems that the united states is facing . "
stephen larrabee , a european security expert at the rand corporation in washington , gives obama a mixed half-time report card : " i would give him an a- for recognizing the basic problems and laying the foundations for their long-term resolution .
i would give him a c for actual results so far . "
long list of unresolved challenges larrabee and zaborowski cite the collapse of the us-brokered peace talks between israelis and palestinians and the unsuccessful efforts of diplomatic engagement with iran as major failures of us foreign policy .
what 's more , in the korean peninsula , earlier us hopes for an improvement of relations with the north korea were recently crushed by a military crisis that stopped only short of an all-out war between the two korean states . " i would say that the jury is still out , but the prognosis is not particularly good at the moment either for afghanistan nor for pakistan , " adds larrabee .
bildunterschrift : experts view the improved relations with russia as obama 's major achievement on china and india , obama has pretty much continued the policy of previous administrations , argue the experts , while they view positively the new nato strategy where the us was able to square the circle by uniting diverging european positions with washington 's wish for an updated blueprint of nato 's mission .
" that delivered what the us administration wanted while it reassured the europeans at the same time , " says zaborowski .
relations with russia asked to name the major successes in the international arena in the past year , both analysts come up with one and the same issue : " i think the biggest foreign policy achievement of this year and actually of the two years of the obama presidency is the relationship with russia , " argues zaborowski .
" the reset has been more or less successful . "
while the thawing of relations with russia is certainly not irreversible , the experts consider it so far as the only tangible result of obama 's foreign policy other than the more general achievement to have turned around the dismal image and perception of the us around the world .
the analysts also praise obama 's ability to spot and work on the multitude of pressing issues facing the world today and the hefty load of unsolved problems he inherited from his predecessor .
but , they argue , after nearly two years in office it will become increasingly difficult to convey that to the electorate in the us and people across the world who demand solutions . a stark reminder that obama now owns the problems , domestic and international , was delivered to the white house by the way of strong republican gains in the recent midterm elections .
" of course he will be judged and voted on what he has been able to do so far rather than the fact that he has laid the basis for important changes that will take a longer time , " says larrabee .
global power projection but time for foreign policy will be limited for obama in the next year , predicts larrabee : " he will really have to concentrate on internal and domestic affairs .
this will be a real case of ' it 's the economy stupid , ' that is , his first priority will have to be to try to improve the economy and particularly to lower the unemployment rate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us influence in the world is increasingly challenged by other powers looking ahead to the more distant future in 10 or 20 years time , both analysts see the trend of a relative decline of us weight around the world continuing , but caution against writing washington off .
" the united states is not where it was in the 1990s , " notes zaborowski .
" it is less powerful than it was .
but it does and will remain obviously the only superpower and a very powerful nation . "
due to the fact that other powers like india , china , brazil and turkey are going to continue to play a more important role , says larrabee , " this will mean that relative to where it is today , us influence may be somewhat less , but it still will be the most influential of all the powers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 28.12.2010 a good effort , but us foreign policy in 2010 has made little impact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : success in foreign policy was hard to come by for the us in 2010 the past year wasn ’ t a very successful one for us foreign policy .
analysts argue that the obama administration can claim only one major success and that the future doesn ’ t look much brighter either . the list of foreign policy issues demanding the attention of the white house and the state department in 2010 was impressive : aside from intractable challenges such as the war in afghanistan , international terrorism , iran ’ s nuclear program , efforts to close the guantanamo prison camp and nonproliferation of nuclear weapons , came a slew of other topics such as the revival of the middle east peace process , fulfilling the promise of the reset of relations with russia , preventing a full-scale war in the korean peninsula and managing the fallout of the wikileaks document dump .
taking a half-time tally of barack obama 's foreign policy in his first term , scholars interviewed by deutsche welle paint a bleak picture with only a few bright spots .
" i would say that his foreign policy was moderately good with no great achievements frankly , " says marcin zaborowski , director of the polish institute of international affairs in warsaw .
" we have n't really had a breakthrough not even in the past year , but in the two years of obama 's presidency which is not perhaps necessarily due to a lack of his leadership skills , but a reflection of the scale of problems that the united states is facing . "
stephen larrabee , a european security expert at the rand corporation in washington , gives obama a mixed half-time report card : " i would give him an a- for recognizing the basic problems and laying the foundations for their long-term resolution .
i would give him a c for actual results so far . "
long list of unresolved challenges larrabee and zaborowski cite the collapse of the us-brokered peace talks between israelis and palestinians and the unsuccessful efforts of diplomatic engagement with iran as major failures of us foreign policy .
what 's more , in the korean peninsula , earlier us hopes for an improvement of relations with the north korea were recently crushed by a military crisis that stopped only short of an all-out war between the two korean states . " i would say that the jury is still out , but the prognosis is not particularly good at the moment either for afghanistan nor for pakistan , " adds larrabee .
bildunterschrift : experts view the improved relations with russia as obama 's major achievement on china and india , obama has pretty much continued the policy of previous administrations , argue the experts , while they view positively the new nato strategy where the us was able to square the circle by uniting diverging european positions with washington 's wish for an updated blueprint of nato 's mission .
" that delivered what the us administration wanted while it reassured the europeans at the same time , " says zaborowski .
relations with russia asked to name the major successes in the international arena in the past year , both analysts come up with one and the same issue : " i think the biggest foreign policy achievement of this year and actually of the two years of the obama presidency is the relationship with russia , " argues zaborowski .
" the reset has been more or less successful . "
while the thawing of relations with russia is certainly not irreversible , the experts consider it so far as the only tangible result of obama 's foreign policy other than the more general achievement to have turned around the dismal image and perception of the us around the world .
the analysts also praise obama 's ability to spot and work on the multitude of pressing issues facing the world today and the hefty load of unsolved problems he inherited from his predecessor .
but , they argue , after nearly two years in office it will become increasingly difficult to convey that to the electorate in the us and people across the world who demand solutions . a stark reminder that obama now owns the problems , domestic and international , was delivered to the white house by the way of strong republican gains in the recent midterm elections .
" of course he will be judged and voted on what he has been able to do so far rather than the fact that he has laid the basis for important changes that will take a longer time , " says larrabee .
global power projection but time for foreign policy will be limited for obama in the next year , predicts larrabee : " he will really have to concentrate on internal and domestic affairs .
this will be a real case of ' it 's the economy stupid , ' that is , his first priority will have to be to try to improve the economy and particularly to lower the unemployment rate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us influence in the world is increasingly challenged by other powers looking ahead to the more distant future in 10 or 20 years time , both analysts see the trend of a relative decline of us weight around the world continuing , but caution against writing washington off .
" the united states is not where it was in the 1990s , " notes zaborowski .
" it is less powerful than it was .
but it does and will remain obviously the only superpower and a very powerful nation . "
due to the fact that other powers like india , china , brazil and turkey are going to continue to play a more important role , says larrabee , " this will mean that relative to where it is today , us influence may be somewhat less , but it still will be the most influential of all the powers . "

stephen larrabee , a european security expert at the rand corporation in washington , gives obama a mixed half-time report card : " i would give him an a- for recognizing the basic problems and laying the foundations for their long-term resolution .
i would give him a c for actual results so far . "
long list of unresolved challenges larrabee and zaborowski cite the collapse of the us-brokered peace talks between israelis and palestinians and the unsuccessful efforts of diplomatic engagement with iran as major failures of us foreign policy .
what 's more , in the korean peninsula , earlier us hopes for an improvement of relations with the north korea were recently crushed by a military crisis that stopped only short of an all-out war between the two korean states . " i would say that the jury is still out , but the prognosis is not particularly good at the moment either for afghanistan nor for pakistan , " adds larrabee .
bildunterschrift : experts view the improved relations with russia as obama 's major achievement on china and india , obama has pretty much continued the policy of previous administrations , argue the experts , while they view positively the new nato strategy where the us was able to square the circle by uniting diverging european positions with washington 's wish for an updated blueprint of nato 's mission .
" that delivered what the us administration wanted while it reassured the europeans at the same time , " says zaborowski .
relations with russia asked to name the major successes in the international arena in the past year , both analysts come up with one and the same issue : " i think the biggest foreign policy achievement of this year and actually of the two years of the obama presidency is the relationship with russia , " argues zaborowski .
" the reset has been more or less successful . "
while the thawing of relations with russia is certainly not irreversible , the experts consider it so far as the only tangible result of obama 's foreign policy other than the more general achievement to have turned around the dismal image and perception of the us around the world .
the analysts also praise obama 's ability to spot and work on the multitude of pressing issues facing the world today and the hefty load of unsolved problems he inherited from his predecessor .
but , they argue , after nearly two years in office it will become increasingly difficult to convey that to the electorate in the us and people across the world who demand solutions . a stark reminder that obama now owns the problems , domestic and international , was delivered to the white house by the way of strong republican gains in the recent midterm elections .
" of course he will be judged and voted on what he has been able to do so far rather than the fact that he has laid the basis for important changes that will take a longer time , " says larrabee .
global power projection but time for foreign policy will be limited for obama in the next year , predicts larrabee : " he will really have to concentrate on internal and domestic affairs .
this will be a real case of ' it 's the economy stupid , ' that is , his first priority will have to be to try to improve the economy and particularly to lower the unemployment rate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us influence in the world is increasingly challenged by other powers looking ahead to the more distant future in 10 or 20 years time , both analysts see the trend of a relative decline of us weight around the world continuing , but caution against writing washington off .
" the united states is not where it was in the 1990s , " notes zaborowski .
" it is less powerful than it was .
but it does and will remain obviously the only superpower and a very powerful nation . "
due to the fact that other powers like india , china , brazil and turkey are going to continue to play a more important role , says larrabee , " this will mean that relative to where it is today , us influence may be somewhat less , but it still will be the most influential of all the powers . "

analysts argue that the obama administration can claim only one major success and that the future doesn ’ t look much brighter either . the list of foreign policy issues demanding the attention of the white house and the state department in 2010 was impressive : aside from intractable challenges such as the war in afghanistan , international terrorism , iran ’ s nuclear program , efforts to close the guantanamo prison camp and nonproliferation of nuclear weapons , came a slew of other topics such as the revival of the middle east peace process , fulfilling the promise of the reset of relations with russia , preventing a full-scale war in the korean peninsula and managing the fallout of the wikileaks document dump .
taking a half-time tally of barack obama 's foreign policy in his first term , scholars interviewed by deutsche welle paint a bleak picture with only a few bright spots .
" i would say that his foreign policy was moderately good with no great achievements frankly , " says marcin zaborowski , director of the polish institute of international affairs in warsaw .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 28.12.2010 china 's most popular blogger winds down his " party " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's famous blogger and top earning author han han is just 28 years old china ’ s most popular blogger , han han , has decided to discontinue his magazine " party " , apparently due to problems with the publisher and printing house . though it has barely just begun , han han is putting to rest his literary magazine , " party " . its first issue was released in july , 2010 and the second issue , planned for august , had been put on hold . while there have been no official statements blaming the chinese government and censorship , many observers suspect this is the real reason behind the shut-down .
" it may have been for bureaucratic reasons or political reasons , but i guess the government is not very interested in having a famous blogger and one of the most famous people in china leading a magazine or trying to push the limits of censorship because that is what he is doing on his blog , " says vincent brossel of reporters without borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of reporters without borders including vincent brossel -lrb- right -rrb- demonstrate for media freedom in beijing too big to challenge ?
brossel suspects it was in the government 's interest to put a hold to the magazine before it could become as popular as han han 's blog .
" maybe a magazine would be a big challenge because it will be very hard on a weekly basis for the government to censor what he is writing and publishing .
so i think they decided to use political pressure to stop the magazine before they have to go against it when it is already popular . "
han han , who is a champion race-car driver and has also gone into singing , became famous for his critical blog and for his novels .
his stardom began in 2000 with the release of the novel , " the triple gate " , in which he criticizes china ’ s school system .
his blog is among the most frequented in the world .
icon for the new china understandable then that beijing is edgy when it comes to the 28-year-old .
brossel believes while han han ’ s influence is far-reaching , the government does not have much to fear because , " han han is not a dissident .
he is someone who is a sort of icon for the new china who is really successful – young , rich and trying to be influential .
han han is also trying to improve things in china and is upset about the way the government is treating the bloggers and so many people in china . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cover of the literary magazine " party " brossel says han han wants to play a role in changing his country , but he will never challenge the government the way liu xiaobo and his friends do , " because he ’ s not giving an alternative , he is just criticizing the authorities and he wants the government to improve certain policies .
but he is not someone who is trying to organize people to create a political alternative . "
busy watchdogs while watchdogs in china are constantly on the lookout and busy shutting down websites , the internet is still the most effective and popular way of spreading ideas .
and younger generations are up to pace with ways of getting around much of the government ’ s censorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " party " was discontinued after only one issue " of course he will continue his blog because he is influential and also rich thanks to his blog .
and also his power is that he is supported by millions of people .
so the government can not treat him like they treat liu xiaobo , " brossel believes . " it is quite a different case .
i ’ m sure he will play his role to push the limits of the censorship and we expect that from him because he is inside the system but also trying to improve the way the chinese can express themselves . "
in the end , the chinese government has not been known to flinch at money and power when it comes to enemies of the state .
so for han han it will be critical to not step over that fine line .

an increased number of suicide attacks , devastating country-wide floods , a severe energy crisis , and an all-time high inflation , economic mismanagement and unemployment have shattered the lives of ordinary citizens .
the bloodiest year since 2001 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan remained in the grip of terror throughout 2010 terrorism continued to plague the islamic republic of pakistan in 2010 .
the year ended with one of the worst suicide attacks in the bajaur agency , one of the restive federally administered tribal areas or fata bordering afghanistan .
a burqa-clad woman blew herself up at the world food program 's aid distribution center on christmas day , killing nearly 50 people and wounding at least 100 .
2010 was the bloodiest year in pakistan since 9/11 .
nearly 1,300 people were killed and more than 2,500 injured in 52 suicide attacks since january .
with renewed suspicions about pakistan 's counter-terrorism efforts and the reports about possible us ground attacks inside pakistan , some analysts are of the opinion that things might get worse in pakistan in 2011 .
however , m. ziauddin , editor of pakistan 's english daily ' express tribune ' , thinks otherwise .
" perhaps things will continue as they are now .
most of the attacks now are confined to the fata .
the attacks in the urban areas have gone down in the last two or three months , " ziauddin told deutsche welle in an interview .
unprecedented floods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani flood survivors jostle for a sack of flour distributed by volunteers in july 2010 , the unprecedented country-wide floods inundated one-fifth of the country and left millions displaced .
it was a severe blow to a country whose economy relies on agricultural goods .
according to estimates , pakistan lost around 4 billion usd in structural damages , and approximately 500 million usd in wheat crop damages .
many economic experts are of the opinion that the effects of the floods on pakistan 's economy are so great that they will harm the progress of the country for years to come .
this might in turn lead to an increase in terrorist activities , many fear .
but m. ziauddin does not think the idea carries weight .
" yes , the economy is in very bad shape , and i do n't see any improvement in the immediate future .
as far as the militancy and floods are concerned , i do n't see a connection between the two , " said m. ziauddin .
continued political uncertainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks : pakistan 's army chief ashfaq pervez kayani calls the shots after more than two years in power , the civilian government still does not seem to be in control of things .
the corruption cases against president asif ali zardari and some cabinet members were a hot topic in the pakistani media throughout the year .
the tense relations between the executive and the judiciary continued to affect the political environment of the country .
veteran journalist m. ziauddin , however , thinks that despite problems the two institutions have found balance .
" i do n't see a major clash between the judiciary and the government any more .
as far as any political threat to the government is concerned , almost all political parties which contested the last elections are somehow stakeholders in the present set-up .
so , i do n't see any challenge to the government until the next elections . "
on the other hand , the pakistani army 's continued role in politics was highlighted by the recent wikileaks revelations .
the us diplomatic cables showed pakistan 's army chief ashfaq pervez kayani at one point mulling over deposing zardari and replacing him with a more ' military-friendly ' president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 28.12.2010 chinese rate hike aims at cooling down the economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese central bank wants to take out liquidity from the market for the second time in two months , china 's central bank has raised its benchmark interest rate .
aimed at curbing growth and inflation , the measure is also likely to attract more capital to china . china 's economic growth is continuing unabated .
in 2009 and 2010 , the annual growth rate remained at about 10 percent .
but gu xuewu , a political scientist at bonn university , says this growth is not yet self-sustaining .
" the growth we have seen in china for the past two years can be ascribed to massive investment by the state . "
the central government in beijing has propped up the domestic economy with a stimulus of 460 billion euros .
at the same time , the banks handed out loans generously : in 2009 , they lent a record 10 billion yuan -lrb- one billion euros -rrb- to customers .
looking for the highest profit , investors have increasingly invested in real estate , which has pushed up housing prices .
this year , the government has tried on several occasions to counter overheating tendencies in the real estate market .
the central bank raised the minimum reserve ratio six times .
at present , the commercial banks must hold an unprecedented 19 percent of their deposits .
with this requirement , the central bank is trying to tighten liquidity .
inflation worries in october , the benchmark interest rate was raised for the first time since 2007 .
this is not only aimed at reducing the availability of credit but , more importantly , at dampening inflation .
in november , the inflation rate rose above five percent for the first time in two years .
food prices even rose by more than ten percent .
this affects the general public and could easily cause trouble .
by raising the benchmark interest rate by another 25 basis points to 5.81 percent , the chinese governments hopes to come to grips with this problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's poor , such as the migrant workers , are hardest hit by inflation but gu xuewu doubts whether raising the interest rate is going to help " because inflation is basically imported .
the prices for items such as raw materials , energy and grain - where china is highly dependent on the international markets - have gone up dramatically over the past weeks , with the americans pumping another 600 billion dollars into the economy . "
the lax monetary policy of the us federal reserve has not only driven up global energy prices , the american money is also constantly searching for lucrative investment , and a part of it is ending up , hardly surprising , in china .
" money will always move to the place that has higher interest rates , " says gu .
" and at present , this definitely is china , where you have interest rates of between five and six percent , compared to 0.25 percent in the united states . "
more pressure to raise the value of the yuan the recent interest rate hike is going to attract even more foreign money to china , gu believes .
and that will in turn increase the pressure for a higher value of the chinese currency , the yuan , also known as renminbi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the recent g20 summit in seoul , international leaders pressured china to let the value of the yuan appreciate the calls for a substantial revaluation of the yuan have grown louder after the november import and export figures were announced .
last month , the people 's republic exported products worth 150 billion us dollars and spent 130 billion dollars for imported goods , both record figures .
making the yuan more expensive would also help the government in fighting inflation .
but beijing continues to aim for a gradual appreciation , not an abrupt one .
rightly so , argues jens ruebbert , who works for deutsche bank in beijing .
" of course this is a balancing act between the need for currency revaluation and for protecting the domestic economy , in particular the exports .
it is a tightrope walk .
but i think the chinese should give more importance to protect jobs . "
whether china will be able to keep this balance and maintain its robust growth even without stimulus packages , will mainly depend on how successful it will be in shifting its export-based growth model to an economy also supported by strong domestic demand .

a model for the agency could be the committee on foreign investment in the united states . the commissioner noted that china has the means to acquire substantial holdings in key european companies and could do so to gain access to their technological know-how or to exercise political leverage on eu member states . " it is a question of investments , but behind that there is also a strategic policy , to which europe should respond politically , " tajani added . rising investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese automaker geely acquired sweden 's volvo in summer 2010 china 's direct investments abroad have increased by 12 percent this year to a total of more than 37 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- .
that value is expected to rise considerably in 2011 . many of china 's foreign investments to date have been aimed at securing access to raw materials in latin america and africa .
but chinese companies are also keen on buying businesses in europe . one example came in the summer of 2010 , when chinese company geely purchased swedish premium carmaker volvo . in 2008 chinese maritime freight group cosco assumed control of two shipping terminals in the greek port of piraeus .
it said it plans to use the facility as a gateway for chinese exports to europe . chinese officials said last week that the government could invest in european sovereign debt to help the eurozone survive future crises if necessary . threat to open markets german economic minister rainer bruederle rejected tajani 's proposal for a new regulator and warned european countries against placing excessive controls on foreign investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maintaining open markets should be a priority for the eu , says bruederle " europe profits from the openness of its markets and offers attractive conditions for foreign investors , " bruederle said in a follow-up interview with the handelsblatt . bruederle said that while some checks may be necessary to address " security and public order concerns , " leaders should refrain from " hasty actions " . bruederle traveled to china in october to promote europe and germany in particular as prospects for chinese investors . legal controls the debate between tajani and bruederle takes up an issue highlighted by a 2008 amendment to germany 's foreign trade law . the amendment allows the economics minister to investigate or block the plans of a foreign entity seeking to buy 25 percent or more of the voting rights in a german company if the acquisition raises public order or security concerns . but no foreign investment has yet fulfilled the requirements for the law to come into play , a spokesman from the federal ministry of economics and technology told deutsche welle . author : greg wiser -lrb- dpa , afp , ap -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a model for the agency could be the committee on foreign investment in the united states . the commissioner noted that china has the means to acquire substantial holdings in key european companies and could do so to gain access to their technological know-how or to exercise political leverage on eu member states . " it is a question of investments , but behind that there is also a strategic policy , to which europe should respond politically , " tajani added . rising investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese automaker geely acquired sweden 's volvo in summer 2010 china 's direct investments abroad have increased by 12 percent this year to a total of more than 37 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- .
that value is expected to rise considerably in 2011 . many of china 's foreign investments to date have been aimed at securing access to raw materials in latin america and africa .
but chinese companies are also keen on buying businesses in europe . one example came in the summer of 2010 , when chinese company geely purchased swedish premium carmaker volvo . in 2008 chinese maritime freight group cosco assumed control of two shipping terminals in the greek port of piraeus .
it said it plans to use the facility as a gateway for chinese exports to europe . chinese officials said last week that the government could invest in european sovereign debt to help the eurozone survive future crises if necessary . threat to open markets german economic minister rainer bruederle rejected tajani 's proposal for a new regulator and warned european countries against placing excessive controls on foreign investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maintaining open markets should be a priority for the eu , says bruederle " europe profits from the openness of its markets and offers attractive conditions for foreign investors , " bruederle said in a follow-up interview with the handelsblatt . bruederle said that while some checks may be necessary to address " security and public order concerns , " leaders should refrain from " hasty actions " . bruederle traveled to china in october to promote europe and germany in particular as prospects for chinese investors . legal controls the debate between tajani and bruederle takes up an issue highlighted by a 2008 amendment to germany 's foreign trade law . the amendment allows the economics minister to investigate or block the plans of a foreign entity seeking to buy 25 percent or more of the voting rights in a german company if the acquisition raises public order or security concerns . but no foreign investment has yet fulfilled the requirements for the law to come into play , a spokesman from the federal ministry of economics and technology told deutsche welle . author : greg wiser -lrb- dpa , afp , ap -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 28.12.2010 pakistan wrecked by floods and terrorism in 2010 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country-wide floods inundated one-fifth of the country and left millions displaced terrorism , floods and a dwindling economy haunted pakistan during 2010 and they are likely to mar the progress of the country in 2011 as well . 2010 , in many ways , has been the worst year for the people of pakistan in a long time .
an increased number of suicide attacks , devastating country-wide floods , a severe energy crisis , and an all-time high inflation , economic mismanagement and unemployment have shattered the lives of ordinary citizens .
the bloodiest year since 2001 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan remained in the grip of terror throughout 2010 terrorism continued to plague the islamic republic of pakistan in 2010 .
the year ended with one of the worst suicide attacks in the bajaur agency , one of the restive federally administered tribal areas or fata bordering afghanistan .
a burqa-clad woman blew herself up at the world food program 's aid distribution center on christmas day , killing nearly 50 people and wounding at least 100 .
2010 was the bloodiest year in pakistan since 9/11 .
nearly 1,300 people were killed and more than 2,500 injured in 52 suicide attacks since january .
with renewed suspicions about pakistan 's counter-terrorism efforts and the reports about possible us ground attacks inside pakistan , some analysts are of the opinion that things might get worse in pakistan in 2011 .
however , m. ziauddin , editor of pakistan 's english daily ' express tribune ' , thinks otherwise .
" perhaps things will continue as they are now .
most of the attacks now are confined to the fata .
the attacks in the urban areas have gone down in the last two or three months , " ziauddin told deutsche welle in an interview .
unprecedented floods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani flood survivors jostle for a sack of flour distributed by volunteers in july 2010 , the unprecedented country-wide floods inundated one-fifth of the country and left millions displaced .
it was a severe blow to a country whose economy relies on agricultural goods .
according to estimates , pakistan lost around 4 billion usd in structural damages , and approximately 500 million usd in wheat crop damages .
many economic experts are of the opinion that the effects of the floods on pakistan 's economy are so great that they will harm the progress of the country for years to come .
this might in turn lead to an increase in terrorist activities , many fear .
but m. ziauddin does not think the idea carries weight .
" yes , the economy is in very bad shape , and i do n't see any improvement in the immediate future .
as far as the militancy and floods are concerned , i do n't see a connection between the two , " said m. ziauddin .
continued political uncertainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks : pakistan 's army chief ashfaq pervez kayani calls the shots after more than two years in power , the civilian government still does not seem to be in control of things .
the corruption cases against president asif ali zardari and some cabinet members were a hot topic in the pakistani media throughout the year .
the tense relations between the executive and the judiciary continued to affect the political environment of the country .
veteran journalist m. ziauddin , however , thinks that despite problems the two institutions have found balance .
" i do n't see a major clash between the judiciary and the government any more .
as far as any political threat to the government is concerned , almost all political parties which contested the last elections are somehow stakeholders in the present set-up .
so , i do n't see any challenge to the government until the next elections . "
on the other hand , the pakistani army 's continued role in politics was highlighted by the recent wikileaks revelations .
the us diplomatic cables showed pakistan 's army chief ashfaq pervez kayani at one point mulling over deposing zardari and replacing him with a more ' military-friendly ' president .

an increased number of suicide attacks , devastating country-wide floods , a severe energy crisis , and an all-time high inflation , economic mismanagement and unemployment have shattered the lives of ordinary citizens .
the bloodiest year since 2001 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan remained in the grip of terror throughout 2010 terrorism continued to plague the islamic republic of pakistan in 2010 .
the year ended with one of the worst suicide attacks in the bajaur agency , one of the restive federally administered tribal areas or fata bordering afghanistan .
a burqa-clad woman blew herself up at the world food program 's aid distribution center on christmas day , killing nearly 50 people and wounding at least 100 .
2010 was the bloodiest year in pakistan since 9/11 .
nearly 1,300 people were killed and more than 2,500 injured in 52 suicide attacks since january .
with renewed suspicions about pakistan 's counter-terrorism efforts and the reports about possible us ground attacks inside pakistan , some analysts are of the opinion that things might get worse in pakistan in 2011 .
however , m. ziauddin , editor of pakistan 's english daily ' express tribune ' , thinks otherwise .
" perhaps things will continue as they are now .
most of the attacks now are confined to the fata .
the attacks in the urban areas have gone down in the last two or three months , " ziauddin told deutsche welle in an interview .
unprecedented floods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani flood survivors jostle for a sack of flour distributed by volunteers in july 2010 , the unprecedented country-wide floods inundated one-fifth of the country and left millions displaced .
it was a severe blow to a country whose economy relies on agricultural goods .
according to estimates , pakistan lost around 4 billion usd in structural damages , and approximately 500 million usd in wheat crop damages .
many economic experts are of the opinion that the effects of the floods on pakistan 's economy are so great that they will harm the progress of the country for years to come .
this might in turn lead to an increase in terrorist activities , many fear .
but m. ziauddin does not think the idea carries weight .
" yes , the economy is in very bad shape , and i do n't see any improvement in the immediate future .
as far as the militancy and floods are concerned , i do n't see a connection between the two , " said m. ziauddin .
continued political uncertainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks : pakistan 's army chief ashfaq pervez kayani calls the shots after more than two years in power , the civilian government still does not seem to be in control of things .
the corruption cases against president asif ali zardari and some cabinet members were a hot topic in the pakistani media throughout the year .
the tense relations between the executive and the judiciary continued to affect the political environment of the country .
veteran journalist m. ziauddin , however , thinks that despite problems the two institutions have found balance .
" i do n't see a major clash between the judiciary and the government any more .
as far as any political threat to the government is concerned , almost all political parties which contested the last elections are somehow stakeholders in the present set-up .
so , i do n't see any challenge to the government until the next elections . "
on the other hand , the pakistani army 's continued role in politics was highlighted by the recent wikileaks revelations .
the us diplomatic cables showed pakistan 's army chief ashfaq pervez kayani at one point mulling over deposing zardari and replacing him with a more ' military-friendly ' president .

german film personalities caroline link , doris dörrie , michael ballhaus , tom tykwer , wim wenders , dominik graf , christian petzold , andreas dresen , wolfgang kohlhaase and hanns zischler tell us what films played key roles in their lives and shaped their love and vision of cinema .

wim wenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom tykwer tom tykwer remembers how friedrich wilhelm murnau ‘ s “ nosferatu , a symphony of horror ” -lrb- 1922 -rrb- taught him the true meaning of fear . michael ballhaus discusses his collaboration with rainer werner fassbinder on “ the marriage of maria braun ” -lrb- 1978 -rrb- , and caroline link speaks of her admiration for edgar reitz and the way he tells the big and little stories of his first “ heimat ” -lrb- 1984 -rrb- series with such patience and love .
“ unforgettable images ” is a subjective approach to film history . it ’ s not so much the history of german film as a story of german film . but what exactly is german about german movies ? reporters michael althen and hans helmut prinzler have a go at answering that question , among others , in their homage to the german cinema . broadcasting hours : part 1 : dw-tv europe / africa sat 15.01.2011 - 18:30 utc sun 16.01.2011 - 06:30 utc mon 17.01.2011 - 12:30 utc berlin utc + 1 -pipe- cape town utc + 2 -pipe- moscow utc + 3 dw-tv north america sat 15.01.2011 - 20:30 utc sun 16.01.2011 - 12:30 utc mon 17.01.2011 - 00:30 utc san francisco utc -8 -pipe- edmonton utc -7 -pipe- new york utc -5 dw-tv latin america sat 15.01.2011 - 20:30 utc sun 16.01.2011 - 04:30 utc caracas utc -4,5 -pipe- la paz utc -4 -pipe- buenos aires utc -3 dw-tv arabia sat 15.01.2011 - 20:30 utc sun 16.01.2011 - 12:30 utc mon 17.01.2011 - 04:30 utc algiers utc + 1 -pipe- cairo utc + 2 -pipe- dubai utc + 4 dw-tv asia sat 15.01.2011 - 18:30 utc sun 16.01.2011 - 06:30 utc delhi utc + 5,5 -pipe- jakarta utc + 7 -pipe- hong kong utc + 8 dw-tv asia + sat 15.01.2011 - 19:00 utc sun 16.01.2011 - 13:00 utc sun 16.01.2011 - 17:00 utc sun 16.01.2011 - 20:30 utc mon 17.01.2011 - 06:30 utc mon 17.01.2011 - 14:30 utc mon 17.01.2011 - 21:30 utc delhi utc + 5,5 -pipe- jakarta utc + 7 -pipe- hong kong utc + 8 1/4 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 dw-tv europe live in focus - documentaries and reports we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 28.12.2010 china 's most popular blogger winds down his " party " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's famous blogger and top earning author han han is just 28 years old china ’ s most popular blogger , han han , has decided to discontinue his magazine " party " , apparently due to problems with the publisher and printing house . though it has barely just begun , han han is putting to rest his literary magazine , " party " . its first issue was released in july , 2010 and the second issue , planned for august , had been put on hold . while there have been no official statements blaming the chinese government and censorship , many observers suspect this is the real reason behind the shut-down .
" it may have been for bureaucratic reasons or political reasons , but i guess the government is not very interested in having a famous blogger and one of the most famous people in china leading a magazine or trying to push the limits of censorship because that is what he is doing on his blog , " says vincent brossel of reporters without borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of reporters without borders including vincent brossel -lrb- right -rrb- demonstrate for media freedom in beijing too big to challenge ?
brossel suspects it was in the government 's interest to put a hold to the magazine before it could become as popular as han han 's blog .
" maybe a magazine would be a big challenge because it will be very hard on a weekly basis for the government to censor what he is writing and publishing .
so i think they decided to use political pressure to stop the magazine before they have to go against it when it is already popular . "
han han , who is a champion race-car driver and has also gone into singing , became famous for his critical blog and for his novels .
his stardom began in 2000 with the release of the novel , " the triple gate " , in which he criticizes china ’ s school system .
his blog is among the most frequented in the world .
icon for the new china understandable then that beijing is edgy when it comes to the 28-year-old .
brossel believes while han han ’ s influence is far-reaching , the government does not have much to fear because , " han han is not a dissident .
he is someone who is a sort of icon for the new china who is really successful – young , rich and trying to be influential .
han han is also trying to improve things in china and is upset about the way the government is treating the bloggers and so many people in china . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cover of the literary magazine " party " brossel says han han wants to play a role in changing his country , but he will never challenge the government the way liu xiaobo and his friends do , " because he ’ s not giving an alternative , he is just criticizing the authorities and he wants the government to improve certain policies .
but he is not someone who is trying to organize people to create a political alternative . "
busy watchdogs while watchdogs in china are constantly on the lookout and busy shutting down websites , the internet is still the most effective and popular way of spreading ideas .
and younger generations are up to pace with ways of getting around much of the government ’ s censorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " party " was discontinued after only one issue " of course he will continue his blog because he is influential and also rich thanks to his blog .
and also his power is that he is supported by millions of people .
so the government can not treat him like they treat liu xiaobo , " brossel believes . " it is quite a different case .
i ’ m sure he will play his role to push the limits of the censorship and we expect that from him because he is inside the system but also trying to improve the way the chinese can express themselves . "
in the end , the chinese government has not been known to flinch at money and power when it comes to enemies of the state .
so for han han it will be critical to not step over that fine line .

an increased number of suicide attacks , devastating country-wide floods , a severe energy crisis , and an all-time high inflation , economic mismanagement and unemployment have shattered the lives of ordinary citizens .
the bloodiest year since 2001 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan remained in the grip of terror throughout 2010 terrorism continued to plague the islamic republic of pakistan in 2010 .
the year ended with one of the worst suicide attacks in the bajaur agency , one of the restive federally administered tribal areas or fata bordering afghanistan .
a burqa-clad woman blew herself up at the world food program 's aid distribution center on christmas day , killing nearly 50 people and wounding at least 100 .
2010 was the bloodiest year in pakistan since 9/11 .
nearly 1,300 people were killed and more than 2,500 injured in 52 suicide attacks since january .
with renewed suspicions about pakistan 's counter-terrorism efforts and the reports about possible us ground attacks inside pakistan , some analysts are of the opinion that things might get worse in pakistan in 2011 .
however , m. ziauddin , editor of pakistan 's english daily ' express tribune ' , thinks otherwise .
" perhaps things will continue as they are now .
most of the attacks now are confined to the fata .
the attacks in the urban areas have gone down in the last two or three months , " ziauddin told deutsche welle in an interview .
unprecedented floods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani flood survivors jostle for a sack of flour distributed by volunteers in july 2010 , the unprecedented country-wide floods inundated one-fifth of the country and left millions displaced .
it was a severe blow to a country whose economy relies on agricultural goods .
according to estimates , pakistan lost around 4 billion usd in structural damages , and approximately 500 million usd in wheat crop damages .
many economic experts are of the opinion that the effects of the floods on pakistan 's economy are so great that they will harm the progress of the country for years to come .
this might in turn lead to an increase in terrorist activities , many fear .
but m. ziauddin does not think the idea carries weight .
" yes , the economy is in very bad shape , and i do n't see any improvement in the immediate future .
as far as the militancy and floods are concerned , i do n't see a connection between the two , " said m. ziauddin .
continued political uncertainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks : pakistan 's army chief ashfaq pervez kayani calls the shots after more than two years in power , the civilian government still does not seem to be in control of things .
the corruption cases against president asif ali zardari and some cabinet members were a hot topic in the pakistani media throughout the year .
the tense relations between the executive and the judiciary continued to affect the political environment of the country .
veteran journalist m. ziauddin , however , thinks that despite problems the two institutions have found balance .
" i do n't see a major clash between the judiciary and the government any more .
as far as any political threat to the government is concerned , almost all political parties which contested the last elections are somehow stakeholders in the present set-up .
so , i do n't see any challenge to the government until the next elections . "
on the other hand , the pakistani army 's continued role in politics was highlighted by the recent wikileaks revelations .
the us diplomatic cables showed pakistan 's army chief ashfaq pervez kayani at one point mulling over deposing zardari and replacing him with a more ' military-friendly ' president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 28.12.2010 a good effort , but us foreign policy in 2010 has made little impact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : success in foreign policy was hard to come by for the us in 2010 the past year wasn ’ t a very successful one for us foreign policy .
analysts argue that the obama administration can claim only one major success and that the future doesn ’ t look much brighter either . the list of foreign policy issues demanding the attention of the white house and the state department in 2010 was impressive : aside from intractable challenges such as the war in afghanistan , international terrorism , iran ’ s nuclear program , efforts to close the guantanamo prison camp and nonproliferation of nuclear weapons , came a slew of other topics such as the revival of the middle east peace process , fulfilling the promise of the reset of relations with russia , preventing a full-scale war in the korean peninsula and managing the fallout of the wikileaks document dump .
taking a half-time tally of barack obama 's foreign policy in his first term , scholars interviewed by deutsche welle paint a bleak picture with only a few bright spots .
" i would say that his foreign policy was moderately good with no great achievements frankly , " says marcin zaborowski , director of the polish institute of international affairs in warsaw .
" we have n't really had a breakthrough not even in the past year , but in the two years of obama 's presidency which is not perhaps necessarily due to a lack of his leadership skills , but a reflection of the scale of problems that the united states is facing . "
stephen larrabee , a european security expert at the rand corporation in washington , gives obama a mixed half-time report card : " i would give him an a- for recognizing the basic problems and laying the foundations for their long-term resolution .
i would give him a c for actual results so far . "
long list of unresolved challenges larrabee and zaborowski cite the collapse of the us-brokered peace talks between israelis and palestinians and the unsuccessful efforts of diplomatic engagement with iran as major failures of us foreign policy .
what 's more , in the korean peninsula , earlier us hopes for an improvement of relations with the north korea were recently crushed by a military crisis that stopped only short of an all-out war between the two korean states . " i would say that the jury is still out , but the prognosis is not particularly good at the moment either for afghanistan nor for pakistan , " adds larrabee .
bildunterschrift : experts view the improved relations with russia as obama 's major achievement on china and india , obama has pretty much continued the policy of previous administrations , argue the experts , while they view positively the new nato strategy where the us was able to square the circle by uniting diverging european positions with washington 's wish for an updated blueprint of nato 's mission .
" that delivered what the us administration wanted while it reassured the europeans at the same time , " says zaborowski .
relations with russia asked to name the major successes in the international arena in the past year , both analysts come up with one and the same issue : " i think the biggest foreign policy achievement of this year and actually of the two years of the obama presidency is the relationship with russia , " argues zaborowski .
" the reset has been more or less successful . "
while the thawing of relations with russia is certainly not irreversible , the experts consider it so far as the only tangible result of obama 's foreign policy other than the more general achievement to have turned around the dismal image and perception of the us around the world .
the analysts also praise obama 's ability to spot and work on the multitude of pressing issues facing the world today and the hefty load of unsolved problems he inherited from his predecessor .
but , they argue , after nearly two years in office it will become increasingly difficult to convey that to the electorate in the us and people across the world who demand solutions . a stark reminder that obama now owns the problems , domestic and international , was delivered to the white house by the way of strong republican gains in the recent midterm elections .
" of course he will be judged and voted on what he has been able to do so far rather than the fact that he has laid the basis for important changes that will take a longer time , " says larrabee .
global power projection but time for foreign policy will be limited for obama in the next year , predicts larrabee : " he will really have to concentrate on internal and domestic affairs .
this will be a real case of ' it 's the economy stupid , ' that is , his first priority will have to be to try to improve the economy and particularly to lower the unemployment rate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us influence in the world is increasingly challenged by other powers looking ahead to the more distant future in 10 or 20 years time , both analysts see the trend of a relative decline of us weight around the world continuing , but caution against writing washington off .
" the united states is not where it was in the 1990s , " notes zaborowski .
" it is less powerful than it was .
but it does and will remain obviously the only superpower and a very powerful nation . "
due to the fact that other powers like india , china , brazil and turkey are going to continue to play a more important role , says larrabee , " this will mean that relative to where it is today , us influence may be somewhat less , but it still will be the most influential of all the powers . "

analysts argue that the obama administration can claim only one major success and that the future doesn ’ t look much brighter either . the list of foreign policy issues demanding the attention of the white house and the state department in 2010 was impressive : aside from intractable challenges such as the war in afghanistan , international terrorism , iran ’ s nuclear program , efforts to close the guantanamo prison camp and nonproliferation of nuclear weapons , came a slew of other topics such as the revival of the middle east peace process , fulfilling the promise of the reset of relations with russia , preventing a full-scale war in the korean peninsula and managing the fallout of the wikileaks document dump .
taking a half-time tally of barack obama 's foreign policy in his first term , scholars interviewed by deutsche welle paint a bleak picture with only a few bright spots .
" i would say that his foreign policy was moderately good with no great achievements frankly , " says marcin zaborowski , director of the polish institute of international affairs in warsaw .
" we have n't really had a breakthrough not even in the past year , but in the two years of obama 's presidency which is not perhaps necessarily due to a lack of his leadership skills , but a reflection of the scale of problems that the united states is facing . "
stephen larrabee , a european security expert at the rand corporation in washington , gives obama a mixed half-time report card : " i would give him an a- for recognizing the basic problems and laying the foundations for their long-term resolution .
i would give him a c for actual results so far . "
long list of unresolved challenges larrabee and zaborowski cite the collapse of the us-brokered peace talks between israelis and palestinians and the unsuccessful efforts of diplomatic engagement with iran as major failures of us foreign policy .
what 's more , in the korean peninsula , earlier us hopes for an improvement of relations with the north korea were recently crushed by a military crisis that stopped only short of an all-out war between the two korean states . " i would say that the jury is still out , but the prognosis is not particularly good at the moment either for afghanistan nor for pakistan , " adds larrabee .
bildunterschrift : experts view the improved relations with russia as obama 's major achievement on china and india , obama has pretty much continued the policy of previous administrations , argue the experts , while they view positively the new nato strategy where the us was able to square the circle by uniting diverging european positions with washington 's wish for an updated blueprint of nato 's mission .
" that delivered what the us administration wanted while it reassured the europeans at the same time , " says zaborowski .
relations with russia asked to name the major successes in the international arena in the past year , both analysts come up with one and the same issue : " i think the biggest foreign policy achievement of this year and actually of the two years of the obama presidency is the relationship with russia , " argues zaborowski .
" the reset has been more or less successful . "
while the thawing of relations with russia is certainly not irreversible , the experts consider it so far as the only tangible result of obama 's foreign policy other than the more general achievement to have turned around the dismal image and perception of the us around the world .
the analysts also praise obama 's ability to spot and work on the multitude of pressing issues facing the world today and the hefty load of unsolved problems he inherited from his predecessor .
but , they argue , after nearly two years in office it will become increasingly difficult to convey that to the electorate in the us and people across the world who demand solutions . a stark reminder that obama now owns the problems , domestic and international , was delivered to the white house by the way of strong republican gains in the recent midterm elections .
" of course he will be judged and voted on what he has been able to do so far rather than the fact that he has laid the basis for important changes that will take a longer time , " says larrabee .
global power projection but time for foreign policy will be limited for obama in the next year , predicts larrabee : " he will really have to concentrate on internal and domestic affairs .
this will be a real case of ' it 's the economy stupid , ' that is , his first priority will have to be to try to improve the economy and particularly to lower the unemployment rate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us influence in the world is increasingly challenged by other powers looking ahead to the more distant future in 10 or 20 years time , both analysts see the trend of a relative decline of us weight around the world continuing , but caution against writing washington off .
" the united states is not where it was in the 1990s , " notes zaborowski .
" it is less powerful than it was .
but it does and will remain obviously the only superpower and a very powerful nation . "
due to the fact that other powers like india , china , brazil and turkey are going to continue to play a more important role , says larrabee , " this will mean that relative to where it is today , us influence may be somewhat less , but it still will be the most influential of all the powers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 28.12.2010 germany acknowledges ' warlike situation ' in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has referred to ' warlike conditions ' in afghanistan burdened by its nazi legacy , germany swore never again to wage war .
in the last of a three-part series , dw examines the country 's decision to deploy its military in afghanistan , and the ' warlike conditions ' there . a political shockwave reverberated across the atlantic ocean after islamic terrorists razed the world trade center and part of the pentagon on september 11 , 2001 .
in keeping with germany 's responsibility as a nato member , chancellor gerhard schroeder declared unlimited solidarity with a wounded america .
schroeder 's declaration carried sweeping military consequences for germany .
only three years after his left-of-center coalition had participated in nato 's air war against serbia , he deployed soldiers for an ambitious stabilization mission in war-torn afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schroeder showed solidarity with the us in sending troops .
germany 's stabilization mission looked increasingly like a counterinsurgency as its soldiers faced a resurgent taliban .
and in september 2009 , tensions came to a head when a german colonel ordered an airstrike against two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the strike killed 142 people , laying bare the realities of the afghan conflict for the german public .
after years of whitewashing the conflict in afghanistan , berlin has been forced to acknowledge that its soldiers are fighting and dying under " warlike conditions . "
germany can never again claim that it will never wage war .
solidarity among allies in the days following september 11 , germany rallied behind the united states as the bush administration assembled a military coalition to retaliate against the perpetrators of the attacks in new york and washington d.c.
" initially , operation enduring freedom was mandated through the united nations while nato invoked article 5 for the first time , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who served as deputy foreign minister at that time .
" the usa had been attacked and article 5 required germany to make a contribution . "
but germany 's support for america went beyond legal obligations , according to volmer .
many germans felt a deep emotional bond with their historical ally , creating a political climate in which participation in an offensive military campaign could be openly discussed .
" the german people made spontaneous displays of solidarity with the american people , " volmer said .
" many germans said the americans helped us against hitler and protected us during the cold war and now we have to return the favor . "
this solidarity ran into obstacles on the political front , however .
although the german military had participated in the kosovo war of 1999 , anxiety about military force remained deeply rooted in the national psyche .
many social democrats and greens worried that germany would be dragged into an open ended , global war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years , flag-draped caskets began returning to germany but in a political power play , schroeder tied parliament 's vote on operation enduring freedom with a vote of confidence .
if antiwar skeptics among the social democrats and greens voted against the war , they would also be voting against their own government .
faced with the choice of political influence or principle , most social democrats and greens closed ranks and threw their confidence behind their coalition government .
the resolution passed , allocating 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom and saving the government from collapse . mixed message as the united states waged war in pursuit of the perpetrators of september 11 , the international community designed a stabilization force to ease the impact of the conflict on civilians .
" the next step in the discussion was to demand that the military strikes not be directed against the afghan people , " volmer said .
" instead , the afghans should benefit from the intervention . "
while oef had been tasked with rooting out the taliban and al-qaeda , the international security assistance force would seek to create a secure environment in which afghanistan could build a postwar future for itself .
berlin sought to keep oef and isaf - war and stabilization - clearly separated from one another with an emphasis on putting isaf in the lead .
" that again has to do with history , " said karl lamers , former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats . " we do n't do war .
we conduct other actions that demand the use of force . "
but berlin 's policy began to send mixed messages .
in 2004 , german soldiers set up shop in the northern afghan city of kunduz , where they assisted civilian reconstruction efforts .
however , they became increasingly entangled in ambushes , mortar attacks and running gun battles as the taliban made a comeback .
the distinction between stabilization and war had become blurred .
as the years passed , flag-draped caskets returned home , and terrorists increasingly targeted europe , the justification for the mission became more self-assertive .
slowly , german defense experts began to take ownership of the conflict by identifying it as being in the national interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz strike killed 142 and left many wounded in hospitals " later we recognized what defense minister -lrb- peter -rrb- struck had pointed out : we are also defending germany 's security on the hindu kush , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert within the social democratic party .
" this view was supported by the attacks in london and madrid and through the clear fact that there 's something like a home-grown but foreign-trained terrorism that threatens us all . "
acts of war in september of 2009 , the simmering security situation in northern afghanistan boiled over .
colonel georg klein , commander of the german soldiers in kunduz , ordered american bombers to eliminate two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the airstrike killed 142 people .
many of the dead were civilians .
klein defended his order by claiming that he had believed the tankers would be used as an explosive device against his soldiers .
however , the subsequent investigation by isaf indicated that klein targeted the people , not the tanker itself .
local taliban leaders may have been among the crowd .
a german officer had launched a preemptive strike against a perceived threat orchestrated by a human enemy .
germany had waged war in front of the entire international community .
a half truth in the aftermath of the kunduz bombing , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg acknowledged that the german army was operating under " warlike conditions . "
and after three soldiers died in a taliban ambush in april of 2010 , chancellor angela merkel made a similar admission .
during the nationally televised memorial service for the fallen , merkel expressed understanding for soldiers who said they were fighting in a war .
so what do observers think of politicians ' attempts to find a label just short of ' war ' for the unconventional conflict in afghanistan ?
according to lamers , it 's a legal sideshow - one that began with the debate over the gulf war , raged during the yugoslavia crisis , and has been partially exposed by the kunduz airstrike .
military force - however it may be labeled by the political establishment - is now a regular and tolerated feature of german foreign policy .
germany no longer faces a national historical dilemma of whether it can use force at all .
rather , it has returned to history and once again confronts the broader human question : under what circumstances is military force justified ?
" it 's a question for all of us that nobody can definitively answer yet , but which we have to discuss intensively with one another , " lamers said .
" how do we position ourselves in a world where there are still cases like afghanistan ?
how do we deal with that ?
do we just say that we ca n't do anything about it ?
or if we can do something , what exactly should we do ? "
considering its tainted history , germany will have to be especially careful in its search for an answer .

" this view was supported by the attacks in london and madrid and through the clear fact that there 's something like a home-grown but foreign-trained terrorism that threatens us all . "
acts of war in september of 2009 , the simmering security situation in northern afghanistan boiled over .
colonel georg klein , commander of the german soldiers in kunduz , ordered american bombers to eliminate two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the airstrike killed 142 people .
many of the dead were civilians .
klein defended his order by claiming that he had believed the tankers would be used as an explosive device against his soldiers .
however , the subsequent investigation by isaf indicated that klein targeted the people , not the tanker itself .
local taliban leaders may have been among the crowd .
a german officer had launched a preemptive strike against a perceived threat orchestrated by a human enemy .
germany had waged war in front of the entire international community .
a half truth in the aftermath of the kunduz bombing , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg acknowledged that the german army was operating under " warlike conditions . "
and after three soldiers died in a taliban ambush in april of 2010 , chancellor angela merkel made a similar admission .
during the nationally televised memorial service for the fallen , merkel expressed understanding for soldiers who said they were fighting in a war .
so what do observers think of politicians ' attempts to find a label just short of ' war ' for the unconventional conflict in afghanistan ?
according to lamers , it 's a legal sideshow - one that began with the debate over the gulf war , raged during the yugoslavia crisis , and has been partially exposed by the kunduz airstrike .
military force - however it may be labeled by the political establishment - is now a regular and tolerated feature of german foreign policy .
germany no longer faces a national historical dilemma of whether it can use force at all .
rather , it has returned to history and once again confronts the broader human question : under what circumstances is military force justified ?
" it 's a question for all of us that nobody can definitively answer yet , but which we have to discuss intensively with one another , " lamers said .
" how do we position ourselves in a world where there are still cases like afghanistan ?
how do we deal with that ?
do we just say that we ca n't do anything about it ?
or if we can do something , what exactly should we do ? "
considering its tainted history , germany will have to be especially careful in its search for an answer .

in the last of a three-part series , dw examines the country 's decision to deploy its military in afghanistan , and the ' warlike conditions ' there . a political shockwave reverberated across the atlantic ocean after islamic terrorists razed the world trade center and part of the pentagon on september 11 , 2001 .
in keeping with germany 's responsibility as a nato member , chancellor gerhard schroeder declared unlimited solidarity with a wounded america .
schroeder 's declaration carried sweeping military consequences for germany .
only three years after his left-of-center coalition had participated in nato 's air war against serbia , he deployed soldiers for an ambitious stabilization mission in war-torn afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schroeder showed solidarity with the us in sending troops .
germany 's stabilization mission looked increasingly like a counterinsurgency as its soldiers faced a resurgent taliban .
and in september 2009 , tensions came to a head when a german colonel ordered an airstrike against two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the strike killed 142 people , laying bare the realities of the afghan conflict for the german public .
after years of whitewashing the conflict in afghanistan , berlin has been forced to acknowledge that its soldiers are fighting and dying under " warlike conditions . "
germany can never again claim that it will never wage war .
solidarity among allies in the days following september 11 , germany rallied behind the united states as the bush administration assembled a military coalition to retaliate against the perpetrators of the attacks in new york and washington d.c.
" initially , operation enduring freedom was mandated through the united nations while nato invoked article 5 for the first time , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who served as deputy foreign minister at that time .
" the usa had been attacked and article 5 required germany to make a contribution . "
but germany 's support for america went beyond legal obligations , according to volmer .
many germans felt a deep emotional bond with their historical ally , creating a political climate in which participation in an offensive military campaign could be openly discussed .
" the german people made spontaneous displays of solidarity with the american people , " volmer said .
" many germans said the americans helped us against hitler and protected us during the cold war and now we have to return the favor . "
this solidarity ran into obstacles on the political front , however .
although the german military had participated in the kosovo war of 1999 , anxiety about military force remained deeply rooted in the national psyche .
many social democrats and greens worried that germany would be dragged into an open ended , global war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years , flag-draped caskets began returning to germany but in a political power play , schroeder tied parliament 's vote on operation enduring freedom with a vote of confidence .
if antiwar skeptics among the social democrats and greens voted against the war , they would also be voting against their own government .
faced with the choice of political influence or principle , most social democrats and greens closed ranks and threw their confidence behind their coalition government .
the resolution passed , allocating 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom and saving the government from collapse . mixed message as the united states waged war in pursuit of the perpetrators of september 11 , the international community designed a stabilization force to ease the impact of the conflict on civilians .
" the next step in the discussion was to demand that the military strikes not be directed against the afghan people , " volmer said .
" instead , the afghans should benefit from the intervention . "
while oef had been tasked with rooting out the taliban and al-qaeda , the international security assistance force would seek to create a secure environment in which afghanistan could build a postwar future for itself .
berlin sought to keep oef and isaf - war and stabilization - clearly separated from one another with an emphasis on putting isaf in the lead .
" that again has to do with history , " said karl lamers , former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats . " we do n't do war .
we conduct other actions that demand the use of force . "
but berlin 's policy began to send mixed messages .
in 2004 , german soldiers set up shop in the northern afghan city of kunduz , where they assisted civilian reconstruction efforts .
however , they became increasingly entangled in ambushes , mortar attacks and running gun battles as the taliban made a comeback .
the distinction between stabilization and war had become blurred .
as the years passed , flag-draped caskets returned home , and terrorists increasingly targeted europe , the justification for the mission became more self-assertive .
slowly , german defense experts began to take ownership of the conflict by identifying it as being in the national interest .

a model for the agency could be the committee on foreign investment in the united states . the commissioner noted that china has the means to acquire substantial holdings in key european companies and could do so to gain access to their technological know-how or to exercise political leverage on eu member states . " it is a question of investments , but behind that there is also a strategic policy , to which europe should respond politically , " tajani added . rising investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese automaker geely acquired sweden 's volvo in summer 2010 china 's direct investments abroad have increased by 12 percent this year to a total of more than 37 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- .
that value is expected to rise considerably in 2011 . many of china 's foreign investments to date have been aimed at securing access to raw materials in latin america and africa .
but chinese companies are also keen on buying businesses in europe . one example came in the summer of 2010 , when chinese company geely purchased swedish premium carmaker volvo . in 2008 chinese maritime freight group cosco assumed control of two shipping terminals in the greek port of piraeus .
it said it plans to use the facility as a gateway for chinese exports to europe . chinese officials said last week that the government could invest in european sovereign debt to help the eurozone survive future crises if necessary . threat to open markets german economic minister rainer bruederle rejected tajani 's proposal for a new regulator and warned european countries against placing excessive controls on foreign investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maintaining open markets should be a priority for the eu , says bruederle " europe profits from the openness of its markets and offers attractive conditions for foreign investors , " bruederle said in a follow-up interview with the handelsblatt . bruederle said that while some checks may be necessary to address " security and public order concerns , " leaders should refrain from " hasty actions " . bruederle traveled to china in october to promote europe and germany in particular as prospects for chinese investors . legal controls the debate between tajani and bruederle takes up an issue highlighted by a 2008 amendment to germany 's foreign trade law . the amendment allows the economics minister to investigate or block the plans of a foreign entity seeking to buy 25 percent or more of the voting rights in a german company if the acquisition raises public order or security concerns . but no foreign investment has yet fulfilled the requirements for the law to come into play , a spokesman from the federal ministry of economics and technology told deutsche welle . author : greg wiser -lrb- dpa , afp , ap -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the last of a three-part series , dw examines the country 's decision to deploy its military in afghanistan , and the ' warlike conditions ' there . a political shockwave reverberated across the atlantic ocean after islamic terrorists razed the world trade center and part of the pentagon on september 11 , 2001 .
in keeping with germany 's responsibility as a nato member , chancellor gerhard schroeder declared unlimited solidarity with a wounded america .
schroeder 's declaration carried sweeping military consequences for germany .
only three years after his left-of-center coalition had participated in nato 's air war against serbia , he deployed soldiers for an ambitious stabilization mission in war-torn afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schroeder showed solidarity with the us in sending troops .
germany 's stabilization mission looked increasingly like a counterinsurgency as its soldiers faced a resurgent taliban .
and in september 2009 , tensions came to a head when a german colonel ordered an airstrike against two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the strike killed 142 people , laying bare the realities of the afghan conflict for the german public .
after years of whitewashing the conflict in afghanistan , berlin has been forced to acknowledge that its soldiers are fighting and dying under " warlike conditions . "
germany can never again claim that it will never wage war .
solidarity among allies in the days following september 11 , germany rallied behind the united states as the bush administration assembled a military coalition to retaliate against the perpetrators of the attacks in new york and washington d.c.
" initially , operation enduring freedom was mandated through the united nations while nato invoked article 5 for the first time , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who served as deputy foreign minister at that time .
" the usa had been attacked and article 5 required germany to make a contribution . "
but germany 's support for america went beyond legal obligations , according to volmer .
many germans felt a deep emotional bond with their historical ally , creating a political climate in which participation in an offensive military campaign could be openly discussed .
" the german people made spontaneous displays of solidarity with the american people , " volmer said .
" many germans said the americans helped us against hitler and protected us during the cold war and now we have to return the favor . "
this solidarity ran into obstacles on the political front , however .
although the german military had participated in the kosovo war of 1999 , anxiety about military force remained deeply rooted in the national psyche .
many social democrats and greens worried that germany would be dragged into an open ended , global war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years , flag-draped caskets began returning to germany but in a political power play , schroeder tied parliament 's vote on operation enduring freedom with a vote of confidence .
if antiwar skeptics among the social democrats and greens voted against the war , they would also be voting against their own government .
faced with the choice of political influence or principle , most social democrats and greens closed ranks and threw their confidence behind their coalition government .
the resolution passed , allocating 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom and saving the government from collapse . mixed message as the united states waged war in pursuit of the perpetrators of september 11 , the international community designed a stabilization force to ease the impact of the conflict on civilians .
" the next step in the discussion was to demand that the military strikes not be directed against the afghan people , " volmer said .
" instead , the afghans should benefit from the intervention . "
while oef had been tasked with rooting out the taliban and al-qaeda , the international security assistance force would seek to create a secure environment in which afghanistan could build a postwar future for itself .
berlin sought to keep oef and isaf - war and stabilization - clearly separated from one another with an emphasis on putting isaf in the lead .
" that again has to do with history , " said karl lamers , former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats . " we do n't do war .
we conduct other actions that demand the use of force . "
but berlin 's policy began to send mixed messages .
in 2004 , german soldiers set up shop in the northern afghan city of kunduz , where they assisted civilian reconstruction efforts .
however , they became increasingly entangled in ambushes , mortar attacks and running gun battles as the taliban made a comeback .
the distinction between stabilization and war had become blurred .
as the years passed , flag-draped caskets returned home , and terrorists increasingly targeted europe , the justification for the mission became more self-assertive .
slowly , german defense experts began to take ownership of the conflict by identifying it as being in the national interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz strike killed 142 and left many wounded in hospitals " later we recognized what defense minister -lrb- peter -rrb- struck had pointed out : we are also defending germany 's security on the hindu kush , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert within the social democratic party .
" this view was supported by the attacks in london and madrid and through the clear fact that there 's something like a home-grown but foreign-trained terrorism that threatens us all . "
acts of war in september of 2009 , the simmering security situation in northern afghanistan boiled over .
colonel georg klein , commander of the german soldiers in kunduz , ordered american bombers to eliminate two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the airstrike killed 142 people .
many of the dead were civilians .
klein defended his order by claiming that he had believed the tankers would be used as an explosive device against his soldiers .
however , the subsequent investigation by isaf indicated that klein targeted the people , not the tanker itself .
local taliban leaders may have been among the crowd .
a german officer had launched a preemptive strike against a perceived threat orchestrated by a human enemy .
germany had waged war in front of the entire international community .
a half truth in the aftermath of the kunduz bombing , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg acknowledged that the german army was operating under " warlike conditions . "
and after three soldiers died in a taliban ambush in april of 2010 , chancellor angela merkel made a similar admission .
during the nationally televised memorial service for the fallen , merkel expressed understanding for soldiers who said they were fighting in a war .
so what do observers think of politicians ' attempts to find a label just short of ' war ' for the unconventional conflict in afghanistan ?
according to lamers , it 's a legal sideshow - one that began with the debate over the gulf war , raged during the yugoslavia crisis , and has been partially exposed by the kunduz airstrike .
military force - however it may be labeled by the political establishment - is now a regular and tolerated feature of german foreign policy .
germany no longer faces a national historical dilemma of whether it can use force at all .
rather , it has returned to history and once again confronts the broader human question : under what circumstances is military force justified ?
" it 's a question for all of us that nobody can definitively answer yet , but which we have to discuss intensively with one another , " lamers said .
" how do we position ourselves in a world where there are still cases like afghanistan ?
how do we deal with that ?
do we just say that we ca n't do anything about it ?
or if we can do something , what exactly should we do ? "
considering its tainted history , germany will have to be especially careful in its search for an answer .

in the last of a three-part series , dw examines the country 's decision to deploy its military in afghanistan , and the ' warlike conditions ' there . a political shockwave reverberated across the atlantic ocean after islamic terrorists razed the world trade center and part of the pentagon on september 11 , 2001 .
in keeping with germany 's responsibility as a nato member , chancellor gerhard schroeder declared unlimited solidarity with a wounded america .
schroeder 's declaration carried sweeping military consequences for germany .
only three years after his left-of-center coalition had participated in nato 's air war against serbia , he deployed soldiers for an ambitious stabilization mission in war-torn afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schroeder showed solidarity with the us in sending troops .
germany 's stabilization mission looked increasingly like a counterinsurgency as its soldiers faced a resurgent taliban .
and in september 2009 , tensions came to a head when a german colonel ordered an airstrike against two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the strike killed 142 people , laying bare the realities of the afghan conflict for the german public .
after years of whitewashing the conflict in afghanistan , berlin has been forced to acknowledge that its soldiers are fighting and dying under " warlike conditions . "
germany can never again claim that it will never wage war .
solidarity among allies in the days following september 11 , germany rallied behind the united states as the bush administration assembled a military coalition to retaliate against the perpetrators of the attacks in new york and washington d.c.
" initially , operation enduring freedom was mandated through the united nations while nato invoked article 5 for the first time , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who served as deputy foreign minister at that time .
" the usa had been attacked and article 5 required germany to make a contribution . "
but germany 's support for america went beyond legal obligations , according to volmer .
many germans felt a deep emotional bond with their historical ally , creating a political climate in which participation in an offensive military campaign could be openly discussed .
" the german people made spontaneous displays of solidarity with the american people , " volmer said .
" many germans said the americans helped us against hitler and protected us during the cold war and now we have to return the favor . "
this solidarity ran into obstacles on the political front , however .
although the german military had participated in the kosovo war of 1999 , anxiety about military force remained deeply rooted in the national psyche .
many social democrats and greens worried that germany would be dragged into an open ended , global war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years , flag-draped caskets began returning to germany but in a political power play , schroeder tied parliament 's vote on operation enduring freedom with a vote of confidence .
if antiwar skeptics among the social democrats and greens voted against the war , they would also be voting against their own government .
faced with the choice of political influence or principle , most social democrats and greens closed ranks and threw their confidence behind their coalition government .
the resolution passed , allocating 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom and saving the government from collapse . mixed message as the united states waged war in pursuit of the perpetrators of september 11 , the international community designed a stabilization force to ease the impact of the conflict on civilians .
" the next step in the discussion was to demand that the military strikes not be directed against the afghan people , " volmer said .
" instead , the afghans should benefit from the intervention . "
while oef had been tasked with rooting out the taliban and al-qaeda , the international security assistance force would seek to create a secure environment in which afghanistan could build a postwar future for itself .
berlin sought to keep oef and isaf - war and stabilization - clearly separated from one another with an emphasis on putting isaf in the lead .
" that again has to do with history , " said karl lamers , former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats . " we do n't do war .
we conduct other actions that demand the use of force . "
but berlin 's policy began to send mixed messages .
in 2004 , german soldiers set up shop in the northern afghan city of kunduz , where they assisted civilian reconstruction efforts .
however , they became increasingly entangled in ambushes , mortar attacks and running gun battles as the taliban made a comeback .
the distinction between stabilization and war had become blurred .
as the years passed , flag-draped caskets returned home , and terrorists increasingly targeted europe , the justification for the mission became more self-assertive .
slowly , german defense experts began to take ownership of the conflict by identifying it as being in the national interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz strike killed 142 and left many wounded in hospitals " later we recognized what defense minister -lrb- peter -rrb- struck had pointed out : we are also defending germany 's security on the hindu kush , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert within the social democratic party .
" this view was supported by the attacks in london and madrid and through the clear fact that there 's something like a home-grown but foreign-trained terrorism that threatens us all . "
acts of war in september of 2009 , the simmering security situation in northern afghanistan boiled over .
colonel georg klein , commander of the german soldiers in kunduz , ordered american bombers to eliminate two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the airstrike killed 142 people .
many of the dead were civilians .
klein defended his order by claiming that he had believed the tankers would be used as an explosive device against his soldiers .
however , the subsequent investigation by isaf indicated that klein targeted the people , not the tanker itself .
local taliban leaders may have been among the crowd .
a german officer had launched a preemptive strike against a perceived threat orchestrated by a human enemy .
germany had waged war in front of the entire international community .
a half truth in the aftermath of the kunduz bombing , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg acknowledged that the german army was operating under " warlike conditions . "
and after three soldiers died in a taliban ambush in april of 2010 , chancellor angela merkel made a similar admission .
during the nationally televised memorial service for the fallen , merkel expressed understanding for soldiers who said they were fighting in a war .
so what do observers think of politicians ' attempts to find a label just short of ' war ' for the unconventional conflict in afghanistan ?
according to lamers , it 's a legal sideshow - one that began with the debate over the gulf war , raged during the yugoslavia crisis , and has been partially exposed by the kunduz airstrike .
military force - however it may be labeled by the political establishment - is now a regular and tolerated feature of german foreign policy .
germany no longer faces a national historical dilemma of whether it can use force at all .
rather , it has returned to history and once again confronts the broader human question : under what circumstances is military force justified ?
" it 's a question for all of us that nobody can definitively answer yet , but which we have to discuss intensively with one another , " lamers said .
" how do we position ourselves in a world where there are still cases like afghanistan ?
how do we deal with that ?
do we just say that we ca n't do anything about it ?
or if we can do something , what exactly should we do ? "
considering its tainted history , germany will have to be especially careful in its search for an answer .

analysts argue that the obama administration can claim only one major success and that the future doesn ’ t look much brighter either . the list of foreign policy issues demanding the attention of the white house and the state department in 2010 was impressive : aside from intractable challenges such as the war in afghanistan , international terrorism , iran ’ s nuclear program , efforts to close the guantanamo prison camp and nonproliferation of nuclear weapons , came a slew of other topics such as the revival of the middle east peace process , fulfilling the promise of the reset of relations with russia , preventing a full-scale war in the korean peninsula and managing the fallout of the wikileaks document dump .
taking a half-time tally of barack obama 's foreign policy in his first term , scholars interviewed by deutsche welle paint a bleak picture with only a few bright spots .
" i would say that his foreign policy was moderately good with no great achievements frankly , " says marcin zaborowski , director of the polish institute of international affairs in warsaw .
" we have n't really had a breakthrough not even in the past year , but in the two years of obama 's presidency which is not perhaps necessarily due to a lack of his leadership skills , but a reflection of the scale of problems that the united states is facing . "
stephen larrabee , a european security expert at the rand corporation in washington , gives obama a mixed half-time report card : " i would give him an a- for recognizing the basic problems and laying the foundations for their long-term resolution .
i would give him a c for actual results so far . "
long list of unresolved challenges larrabee and zaborowski cite the collapse of the us-brokered peace talks between israelis and palestinians and the unsuccessful efforts of diplomatic engagement with iran as major failures of us foreign policy .
what 's more , in the korean peninsula , earlier us hopes for an improvement of relations with the north korea were recently crushed by a military crisis that stopped only short of an all-out war between the two korean states . " i would say that the jury is still out , but the prognosis is not particularly good at the moment either for afghanistan nor for pakistan , " adds larrabee .
bildunterschrift : experts view the improved relations with russia as obama 's major achievement on china and india , obama has pretty much continued the policy of previous administrations , argue the experts , while they view positively the new nato strategy where the us was able to square the circle by uniting diverging european positions with washington 's wish for an updated blueprint of nato 's mission .
" that delivered what the us administration wanted while it reassured the europeans at the same time , " says zaborowski .
relations with russia asked to name the major successes in the international arena in the past year , both analysts come up with one and the same issue : " i think the biggest foreign policy achievement of this year and actually of the two years of the obama presidency is the relationship with russia , " argues zaborowski .
" the reset has been more or less successful . "
while the thawing of relations with russia is certainly not irreversible , the experts consider it so far as the only tangible result of obama 's foreign policy other than the more general achievement to have turned around the dismal image and perception of the us around the world .
the analysts also praise obama 's ability to spot and work on the multitude of pressing issues facing the world today and the hefty load of unsolved problems he inherited from his predecessor .
but , they argue , after nearly two years in office it will become increasingly difficult to convey that to the electorate in the us and people across the world who demand solutions . a stark reminder that obama now owns the problems , domestic and international , was delivered to the white house by the way of strong republican gains in the recent midterm elections .
" of course he will be judged and voted on what he has been able to do so far rather than the fact that he has laid the basis for important changes that will take a longer time , " says larrabee .
global power projection but time for foreign policy will be limited for obama in the next year , predicts larrabee : " he will really have to concentrate on internal and domestic affairs .

analysts argue that the obama administration can claim only one major success and that the future doesn ’ t look much brighter either . the list of foreign policy issues demanding the attention of the white house and the state department in 2010 was impressive : aside from intractable challenges such as the war in afghanistan , international terrorism , iran ’ s nuclear program , efforts to close the guantanamo prison camp and nonproliferation of nuclear weapons , came a slew of other topics such as the revival of the middle east peace process , fulfilling the promise of the reset of relations with russia , preventing a full-scale war in the korean peninsula and managing the fallout of the wikileaks document dump .
taking a half-time tally of barack obama 's foreign policy in his first term , scholars interviewed by deutsche welle paint a bleak picture with only a few bright spots .
" i would say that his foreign policy was moderately good with no great achievements frankly , " says marcin zaborowski , director of the polish institute of international affairs in warsaw .
" we have n't really had a breakthrough not even in the past year , but in the two years of obama 's presidency which is not perhaps necessarily due to a lack of his leadership skills , but a reflection of the scale of problems that the united states is facing . "
stephen larrabee , a european security expert at the rand corporation in washington , gives obama a mixed half-time report card : " i would give him an a- for recognizing the basic problems and laying the foundations for their long-term resolution .
i would give him a c for actual results so far . "
long list of unresolved challenges larrabee and zaborowski cite the collapse of the us-brokered peace talks between israelis and palestinians and the unsuccessful efforts of diplomatic engagement with iran as major failures of us foreign policy .
what 's more , in the korean peninsula , earlier us hopes for an improvement of relations with the north korea were recently crushed by a military crisis that stopped only short of an all-out war between the two korean states . " i would say that the jury is still out , but the prognosis is not particularly good at the moment either for afghanistan nor for pakistan , " adds larrabee .
bildunterschrift : experts view the improved relations with russia as obama 's major achievement on china and india , obama has pretty much continued the policy of previous administrations , argue the experts , while they view positively the new nato strategy where the us was able to square the circle by uniting diverging european positions with washington 's wish for an updated blueprint of nato 's mission .
" that delivered what the us administration wanted while it reassured the europeans at the same time , " says zaborowski .
relations with russia asked to name the major successes in the international arena in the past year , both analysts come up with one and the same issue : " i think the biggest foreign policy achievement of this year and actually of the two years of the obama presidency is the relationship with russia , " argues zaborowski .
" the reset has been more or less successful . "
while the thawing of relations with russia is certainly not irreversible , the experts consider it so far as the only tangible result of obama 's foreign policy other than the more general achievement to have turned around the dismal image and perception of the us around the world .
the analysts also praise obama 's ability to spot and work on the multitude of pressing issues facing the world today and the hefty load of unsolved problems he inherited from his predecessor .
but , they argue , after nearly two years in office it will become increasingly difficult to convey that to the electorate in the us and people across the world who demand solutions . a stark reminder that obama now owns the problems , domestic and international , was delivered to the white house by the way of strong republican gains in the recent midterm elections .
" of course he will be judged and voted on what he has been able to do so far rather than the fact that he has laid the basis for important changes that will take a longer time , " says larrabee .
global power projection but time for foreign policy will be limited for obama in the next year , predicts larrabee : " he will really have to concentrate on internal and domestic affairs .
this will be a real case of ' it 's the economy stupid , ' that is , his first priority will have to be to try to improve the economy and particularly to lower the unemployment rate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us influence in the world is increasingly challenged by other powers looking ahead to the more distant future in 10 or 20 years time , both analysts see the trend of a relative decline of us weight around the world continuing , but caution against writing washington off .
" the united states is not where it was in the 1990s , " notes zaborowski .
" it is less powerful than it was .
but it does and will remain obviously the only superpower and a very powerful nation . "
due to the fact that other powers like india , china , brazil and turkey are going to continue to play a more important role , says larrabee , " this will mean that relative to where it is today , us influence may be somewhat less , but it still will be the most influential of all the powers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 28.12.2010 a good effort , but us foreign policy in 2010 has made little impact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : success in foreign policy was hard to come by for the us in 2010 the past year wasn ’ t a very successful one for us foreign policy .
analysts argue that the obama administration can claim only one major success and that the future doesn ’ t look much brighter either . the list of foreign policy issues demanding the attention of the white house and the state department in 2010 was impressive : aside from intractable challenges such as the war in afghanistan , international terrorism , iran ’ s nuclear program , efforts to close the guantanamo prison camp and nonproliferation of nuclear weapons , came a slew of other topics such as the revival of the middle east peace process , fulfilling the promise of the reset of relations with russia , preventing a full-scale war in the korean peninsula and managing the fallout of the wikileaks document dump .
taking a half-time tally of barack obama 's foreign policy in his first term , scholars interviewed by deutsche welle paint a bleak picture with only a few bright spots .
" i would say that his foreign policy was moderately good with no great achievements frankly , " says marcin zaborowski , director of the polish institute of international affairs in warsaw .
" we have n't really had a breakthrough not even in the past year , but in the two years of obama 's presidency which is not perhaps necessarily due to a lack of his leadership skills , but a reflection of the scale of problems that the united states is facing . "
stephen larrabee , a european security expert at the rand corporation in washington , gives obama a mixed half-time report card : " i would give him an a- for recognizing the basic problems and laying the foundations for their long-term resolution .
i would give him a c for actual results so far . "
long list of unresolved challenges larrabee and zaborowski cite the collapse of the us-brokered peace talks between israelis and palestinians and the unsuccessful efforts of diplomatic engagement with iran as major failures of us foreign policy .
what 's more , in the korean peninsula , earlier us hopes for an improvement of relations with the north korea were recently crushed by a military crisis that stopped only short of an all-out war between the two korean states . " i would say that the jury is still out , but the prognosis is not particularly good at the moment either for afghanistan nor for pakistan , " adds larrabee .
bildunterschrift : experts view the improved relations with russia as obama 's major achievement on china and india , obama has pretty much continued the policy of previous administrations , argue the experts , while they view positively the new nato strategy where the us was able to square the circle by uniting diverging european positions with washington 's wish for an updated blueprint of nato 's mission .
" that delivered what the us administration wanted while it reassured the europeans at the same time , " says zaborowski .
relations with russia asked to name the major successes in the international arena in the past year , both analysts come up with one and the same issue : " i think the biggest foreign policy achievement of this year and actually of the two years of the obama presidency is the relationship with russia , " argues zaborowski .
" the reset has been more or less successful . "
while the thawing of relations with russia is certainly not irreversible , the experts consider it so far as the only tangible result of obama 's foreign policy other than the more general achievement to have turned around the dismal image and perception of the us around the world .
the analysts also praise obama 's ability to spot and work on the multitude of pressing issues facing the world today and the hefty load of unsolved problems he inherited from his predecessor .
but , they argue , after nearly two years in office it will become increasingly difficult to convey that to the electorate in the us and people across the world who demand solutions . a stark reminder that obama now owns the problems , domestic and international , was delivered to the white house by the way of strong republican gains in the recent midterm elections .
" of course he will be judged and voted on what he has been able to do so far rather than the fact that he has laid the basis for important changes that will take a longer time , " says larrabee .
global power projection but time for foreign policy will be limited for obama in the next year , predicts larrabee : " he will really have to concentrate on internal and domestic affairs .
this will be a real case of ' it 's the economy stupid , ' that is , his first priority will have to be to try to improve the economy and particularly to lower the unemployment rate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us influence in the world is increasingly challenged by other powers looking ahead to the more distant future in 10 or 20 years time , both analysts see the trend of a relative decline of us weight around the world continuing , but caution against writing washington off .
" the united states is not where it was in the 1990s , " notes zaborowski .
" it is less powerful than it was .
but it does and will remain obviously the only superpower and a very powerful nation . "
due to the fact that other powers like india , china , brazil and turkey are going to continue to play a more important role , says larrabee , " this will mean that relative to where it is today , us influence may be somewhat less , but it still will be the most influential of all the powers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 28.12.2010 the balkan dilemma : germany returns to military action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reality trumped rhetoric : germany agreed to use force in the yugoslavia burdened by the genocidal legacy of national socialism , germany swore never again to wage war .
in part two of a three-part series , dw examines how the country returned to military action in the balkans . war returned to germany 's doorstep when yugoslavia imploded in ethnic violence .
during the winter of 1994 , german officials agonized over whether to participate in a nato-led military intervention aimed at containing the war .
although the nation 's highest court had declared such interventions constitutional , germany remained deeply reluctant to use military force for any reason other than defense .
but enormous political and moral pressure pushed the kohl government and the opposition toward a shaky consensus in favor of military action against serbia .
this consensus faced its trial-by-fire when the social democrats and greens took the reins of power in 1998 .
in a twist of fate , the traditionally antiwar parties ordered germany 's first offensive military strike since world war ii .
the war next door by the fall of 1994 , the war in yugoslavia had reached a boiling point as serb forces began targeting nato aircraft and un peacekeepers .
the nato allies feared the worst and drew up plans to rescue the lightly armed peacekeepers in the event that the serbs launched an all-out attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl dragged his feet to avoid intervening in yugoslavia .
as nato prepared for a showdown , germany dragged its feet .
chancellor helmut kohl argued that since the third reich had occupied yugoslavia , it would be historically inappropriate for germany to intervene in the current conflict .
kohl was trying to prevent germany from getting involved in the conflict too quickly , according to karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats .
" that was an ineffectual attempt to throw up a firewall , " lamers said .
" kohl was much too intelligent to think that it would hold .
but it fit the disposition among the german people . "
kohl 's firewall began crumbling as the arrival of bosnian refugees started impacting german domestic politics , according to lamers .
and as the humanitarian situation worsened , nato began to lose its patience with bonn .
the allies pressured germany to send its tornado warplanes into the bosnian firestorm .
the tornados had a unique capability to locate and destroy serb radar installations , which would help cover a possible un withdrawal .
germany was the only european country that possessed such aircraft .
ultimately , strategic realities trumped political rhetoric and the kohl government assented to nato 's request .
but germany 's deeply divided parliament still had to approve the decision .
" you can always argue about the sense of using military force , because you never know what the result will be .
that 's the risk , " lamers said .
" but when all the countries in the community that we belong to say its necessary , we ca n't just say ' count me out . " '
winning the home front for the first time since the world war ii , a german government had decided to deploy its military to a war zone .
unwilling to shoulder the full political and moral responsibility for its historic decision , the kohl government reached out to the opposition social democrats and greens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the greens ' joschka fischer said force was justified to stop genocide the bosnian quagmire had thrown the social democratic party into an uproar .
the antiwar mainstream feared embarking down a slippery slope that could lead the country away from its peaceful foreign policy .
but a more hawkish minority supported using force as a last resort to rescue the un peacekeepers and stop the ethnic cleansing .
" in a 10-to-1 vote , the foreign and security policy experts supported the government 's proposal , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" we knew that the party had a different opinion .
there was considerable uproar .
in the end , around 50 social democrats voted with the government in favor of the bosnian mission and against their own party . "
green revolution as social democrats inched closer to the kohl government , the greens were facing a crisis of conscience that threatened to tear their party in two .
traditionally , the green party advocated a pacifist foreign policy rooted in the peaceful resolution of conflicts through international institutions like the un .
but the un 's failure to stop the ethnic cleansing in bosnia led to an ideological revolution within certain quarters of the party .
after serb forces massacred thousands of bosnian muslims in the town of srebrenica , green party whip joschka fischer declared that force was justified to stop genocide .
" with the balkan wars we realized for the first time that there are situations in which one has to intervene militarily , " said ludger volmer , former president of the green party who went on to serve as the country 's deputy foreign minister . " that was a difficult learning process . "
this learning process would end with the bundestag sending tornado warplanes as well as peacekeepers to bosnia .
against the historical and political odds , germany 's divided parties had forged a shaky consensus in favor of military intervention .
peaceniks in power after serving 16 years in the opposition , the social democrats and greens defeated the kohl government in the 1998 elections .
no sooner had the left-of-center coalition come to power than renewed ethnic violence erupted in yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's air war against serbia was an allied intervention while nato peacekeepers secured the precarious peace in bosnia , the breakaway province of kosovo careened toward war as ethnic albanians demanded independence from serbia .
germany and its nato allies pushed for a peaceful settlement .
but negotiations collapsed when both sides refused to compromise on kosovo 's political status .
in anticipation of this worst-case scenario , the kohl government had committed germany to participate in a nato air war against serbia .
now , social democratic chancellor gerhard schroeder and green party foreign minister joschka fischer had to decide whether they would honor their predecessor 's commitment .
air strikes hardly squared with the coalition 's platform of a foreign policy rooted in peaceful conflict resolution .
bombing belgrade when the security council stalled over russian and chinese objections , nato decided to launch its air war without a un mandate .
the nato allies accused serbia of ethnic cleansing and argued that time was of the essence in order to save innocent lives .
schroeder and fischer faced a nightmare scenario : an allied military intervention without un sanction .
" the new schroeder-fischer government agreed to participate for purely opportune reasons , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert and parliamentarian within the social democratic party .
" they knew that if they did n't participate , they would face foreign policy isolation from the outset .
that 's what i call the joke of history .
the german position changed irrevocably because the government had no choice but to say yes . "
with deep reservations , the former antiwar opposition ordered warplanes to bomb belgrade in germany 's first overt military strike since world war ii .
the shaky foreign policy consensus forged during the bosnian crisis had survived its trial-by-fire in kosovo .
" germany is not a military power and it does n't want to become one , " volmer said .
" you can not help but recognize that there are some conflicts for which you have to arm yourself and that there may be situations in which you have to intervene militarily .
but at its very core , germany has a remote relationship to armed force .
that 's a lesson from the second world war , from history . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 28.12.2010 germany 's struggle with military power in a changing world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the wall fell , the world changed - and the german military 's role along with it burdened by the genocidal legacy of national socialism , germany swore never again to wage war .
in part one of a three-part series , dw examines how germans overcame historic taboos about deploying their military abroad . in memory of the atrocities committed under the third reich , democratic west germany foreswore war as an instrument of its foreign policy .
its military served a single purpose : to help defend the nato allies in western europe and north america from a soviet attack .
but when the berlin wall fell , the world changed , as did germany 's role within it .
the government of chancellor helmut kohl had just finalized german reunification when a series of conflicts erupted in the persian gulf , yugoslavia and somalia .
as the international community intervened to contain these conflicts , germans faced a historically uncomfortable question : should a reunited and fully sovereign germany become a military power capable of using force on the world stage ? checkbook diplomacy as the us and its coalition partners launched air strikes to eject the iraqi military from kuwait in january 1991 , the streets of germany 's major cities filled with 250,000 protestors who opposed the us-led war against saddam hussein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after reunification , kohl used germany 's checkbook to show solidarity the protests expressed a deep-seated national aversion to war and militarism .
after living at the epicenter of international conflict for an entire century , german society had lost its taste for political violence .
" through the double catastrophe of the two -lsb- world -rsb- wars , the germans transformed themselves from a violent society into a post-heroic society , " said hans-ulrich klose , a bundestag representative and a leading foreign policy expert within the left-of-center social democratic party .
" many germans say that we 're the ones who learned the lessons of history and that others still have to learn those lessons . "
but the germans ' rejection of the american-led coalition , and a un-sanctioned military campaign that targeted an aggressive dictator , left chancellor helmut kohl 's government in a deeply uncomfortable position .
" the kohl government knew they had to contribute to the gulf war due to the principle of allied solidarity , " said karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" but they were at the same time aware of the growing opposition to the war within the electorate . " instead of sending troops to the persian gulf , bonn wrote the coalition partners a check for 17 billion marks -lrb- $ 12 billion , or 8 billion euros -rrb- and supplied logistical support . " we effectively bought ourselves out of the war with our financial contribution , " lamers said . opening pandora 's box the kohl government had been politically and legally boxed into a corner .
on top of vehement public opposition , the government faced a constitution that sanctioned war only in self-defense .
and since saddam hussein had neither attacked germany nor the nato allies , direct german military participation in the conflict was off-limits .
in an effort to reconcile germany 's laws with its international obligations , the center-right christian democratic union called for the " clarification " of two conflicting constitutional articles .
article 87 gave germany the right to field an army for national defense .
but article 24 also permitted germany to join collective security organizations to preserve world peace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faced a quandary during the 1991 gulf war many conservatives argued that article 24 sanctioned german participation in multilateral military operations - with or without a un mandate - that were not directly related to territorial defense . " the claim that the constitution forbids the german armed forces from participating in these kinds of deployments is a legal facade that hides the real political issue , " lamers said .
" in reality it was about the unwillingness and the incapability of the large majority of german citizens and voters to participate in warlike measures . "
partisan firestorm as the governing christian democrats pushed the constitutional question , the opposition social democrats faced internal divisions .
the party base limited its support to un peacekeeping missions while a small elite favored more aggressive military operations like the gulf war .
" the foreign and security policy experts actually wanted such operations as an option , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" but we could n't move our own parliamentary faction because they said the constitution did n't allow such operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boutros boutros-ghali asked germany to send peacekeepers to somalia meanwhile , the pacifist green party rejected military intervention in virtually any form .
" we feared the conservatives who were in power wanted to reconstruct a classic nation state with the capability to project power , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who later served as deputy foreign minister .
" we believed that non-military measures should be developed and given priority . "
even the christian democrats ' own coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , expressed reservations about operations without a un mandate .
fait accompli but world events overshadowed the partisan debate in germany .
the dust had hardly settled in the persian gulf when devastating civil wars broke out in yugoslavia and somalia .
in an attempt to contain violence in southeastern europe , nato and the west european union - a european defense organization - imposed a sea and air blockade on yugoslavia .
nato deployed awacs radar planes to patrol the skies of the balkan war zone .
with germans serving in the multinational crews that manned these aircraft , participation in the blockade was a foregone conclusion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , the constitutional court was asked to decide " we could n't just pull out , " lamers said .
" we were part of a larger whole and were not really free .
we would have risked enormous damage to our image and influence . "
while nato tried to stem the tide of violence in yugoslavia , the un sanctioned a us-led peacekeeping mission to stabilize somalia .
in a trip to bonn , then-un secretary general boutros boutros-ghali personally asked the german government to send peacekeepers to the war-torn east african nation .
with the political parties still in gridlock over the constitutional question , the kohl government decided to act without parliamentary approval .
kohl deployed ships and aircraft to yugoslavia and more than 1,000 soldiers to somalia .
foreign policy on trial politically outmaneuvered , the social democrats sued the kohl government in the federal constitutional court .
yet the party 's foreign and security policy experts worked with the government behind the scenes , according to voigt .
both the opposition and the government wanted to put the constitutional question to rest .
and since parliament could not reach a compromise , they agreed to resolve the political controversy in court .
" we internally agreed to create a case on un operations -lsb- somalia -rsb- , a case on nato operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- and a case on west european union operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- , " voigt said .
" the federal government conducted these operations , and we filed suits against them . "
however , the kohl government almost became a casualty of the legal battle when its coalition partner - the free democrats - sued it over the nato air blockade .
germany 's government now faced an uncertain future as the judges deliberated .
the kohl government dodged a bullet when the federal constitutional court ruled that germany could participate in un , nato and weu military operations worldwide .
but there was an important caveat : these operations had to be approved by a simple parliamentary majority . " we had to slowly learn that we 're a country that represents interests , and that we 're an ally and that carries consequences , " klose said .
" that was a tremendously difficult learning process that has in no way come to an end . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 28.12.2010 a good effort , but us foreign policy in 2010 has made little impact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : success in foreign policy was hard to come by for the us in 2010 the past year wasn ’ t a very successful one for us foreign policy .
analysts argue that the obama administration can claim only one major success and that the future doesn ’ t look much brighter either . the list of foreign policy issues demanding the attention of the white house and the state department in 2010 was impressive : aside from intractable challenges such as the war in afghanistan , international terrorism , iran ’ s nuclear program , efforts to close the guantanamo prison camp and nonproliferation of nuclear weapons , came a slew of other topics such as the revival of the middle east peace process , fulfilling the promise of the reset of relations with russia , preventing a full-scale war in the korean peninsula and managing the fallout of the wikileaks document dump .
taking a half-time tally of barack obama 's foreign policy in his first term , scholars interviewed by deutsche welle paint a bleak picture with only a few bright spots .
" i would say that his foreign policy was moderately good with no great achievements frankly , " says marcin zaborowski , director of the polish institute of international affairs in warsaw .
" we have n't really had a breakthrough not even in the past year , but in the two years of obama 's presidency which is not perhaps necessarily due to a lack of his leadership skills , but a reflection of the scale of problems that the united states is facing . "
stephen larrabee , a european security expert at the rand corporation in washington , gives obama a mixed half-time report card : " i would give him an a- for recognizing the basic problems and laying the foundations for their long-term resolution .
i would give him a c for actual results so far . "
long list of unresolved challenges larrabee and zaborowski cite the collapse of the us-brokered peace talks between israelis and palestinians and the unsuccessful efforts of diplomatic engagement with iran as major failures of us foreign policy .
what 's more , in the korean peninsula , earlier us hopes for an improvement of relations with the north korea were recently crushed by a military crisis that stopped only short of an all-out war between the two korean states . " i would say that the jury is still out , but the prognosis is not particularly good at the moment either for afghanistan nor for pakistan , " adds larrabee .
bildunterschrift : experts view the improved relations with russia as obama 's major achievement on china and india , obama has pretty much continued the policy of previous administrations , argue the experts , while they view positively the new nato strategy where the us was able to square the circle by uniting diverging european positions with washington 's wish for an updated blueprint of nato 's mission .
" that delivered what the us administration wanted while it reassured the europeans at the same time , " says zaborowski .
relations with russia asked to name the major successes in the international arena in the past year , both analysts come up with one and the same issue : " i think the biggest foreign policy achievement of this year and actually of the two years of the obama presidency is the relationship with russia , " argues zaborowski .
" the reset has been more or less successful . "
while the thawing of relations with russia is certainly not irreversible , the experts consider it so far as the only tangible result of obama 's foreign policy other than the more general achievement to have turned around the dismal image and perception of the us around the world .
the analysts also praise obama 's ability to spot and work on the multitude of pressing issues facing the world today and the hefty load of unsolved problems he inherited from his predecessor .
but , they argue , after nearly two years in office it will become increasingly difficult to convey that to the electorate in the us and people across the world who demand solutions . a stark reminder that obama now owns the problems , domestic and international , was delivered to the white house by the way of strong republican gains in the recent midterm elections .
" of course he will be judged and voted on what he has been able to do so far rather than the fact that he has laid the basis for important changes that will take a longer time , " says larrabee .
global power projection but time for foreign policy will be limited for obama in the next year , predicts larrabee : " he will really have to concentrate on internal and domestic affairs .
this will be a real case of ' it 's the economy stupid , ' that is , his first priority will have to be to try to improve the economy and particularly to lower the unemployment rate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us influence in the world is increasingly challenged by other powers looking ahead to the more distant future in 10 or 20 years time , both analysts see the trend of a relative decline of us weight around the world continuing , but caution against writing washington off .
" the united states is not where it was in the 1990s , " notes zaborowski .
" it is less powerful than it was .
but it does and will remain obviously the only superpower and a very powerful nation . "
due to the fact that other powers like india , china , brazil and turkey are going to continue to play a more important role , says larrabee , " this will mean that relative to where it is today , us influence may be somewhat less , but it still will be the most influential of all the powers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 28.12.2010 pakistan wrecked by floods and terrorism in 2010 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country-wide floods inundated one-fifth of the country and left millions displaced terrorism , floods and a dwindling economy haunted pakistan during 2010 and they are likely to mar the progress of the country in 2011 as well . 2010 , in many ways , has been the worst year for the people of pakistan in a long time .
an increased number of suicide attacks , devastating country-wide floods , a severe energy crisis , and an all-time high inflation , economic mismanagement and unemployment have shattered the lives of ordinary citizens .
the bloodiest year since 2001 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan remained in the grip of terror throughout 2010 terrorism continued to plague the islamic republic of pakistan in 2010 .
the year ended with one of the worst suicide attacks in the bajaur agency , one of the restive federally administered tribal areas or fata bordering afghanistan .
a burqa-clad woman blew herself up at the world food program 's aid distribution center on christmas day , killing nearly 50 people and wounding at least 100 .
2010 was the bloodiest year in pakistan since 9/11 .
nearly 1,300 people were killed and more than 2,500 injured in 52 suicide attacks since january .
with renewed suspicions about pakistan 's counter-terrorism efforts and the reports about possible us ground attacks inside pakistan , some analysts are of the opinion that things might get worse in pakistan in 2011 .
however , m. ziauddin , editor of pakistan 's english daily ' express tribune ' , thinks otherwise .
" perhaps things will continue as they are now .
most of the attacks now are confined to the fata .
the attacks in the urban areas have gone down in the last two or three months , " ziauddin told deutsche welle in an interview .
unprecedented floods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani flood survivors jostle for a sack of flour distributed by volunteers in july 2010 , the unprecedented country-wide floods inundated one-fifth of the country and left millions displaced .
it was a severe blow to a country whose economy relies on agricultural goods .
according to estimates , pakistan lost around 4 billion usd in structural damages , and approximately 500 million usd in wheat crop damages .
many economic experts are of the opinion that the effects of the floods on pakistan 's economy are so great that they will harm the progress of the country for years to come .
this might in turn lead to an increase in terrorist activities , many fear .
but m. ziauddin does not think the idea carries weight .
" yes , the economy is in very bad shape , and i do n't see any improvement in the immediate future .
as far as the militancy and floods are concerned , i do n't see a connection between the two , " said m. ziauddin .
continued political uncertainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks : pakistan 's army chief ashfaq pervez kayani calls the shots after more than two years in power , the civilian government still does not seem to be in control of things .
the corruption cases against president asif ali zardari and some cabinet members were a hot topic in the pakistani media throughout the year .
the tense relations between the executive and the judiciary continued to affect the political environment of the country .
veteran journalist m. ziauddin , however , thinks that despite problems the two institutions have found balance .
" i do n't see a major clash between the judiciary and the government any more .
as far as any political threat to the government is concerned , almost all political parties which contested the last elections are somehow stakeholders in the present set-up .
so , i do n't see any challenge to the government until the next elections . "
on the other hand , the pakistani army 's continued role in politics was highlighted by the recent wikileaks revelations .
the us diplomatic cables showed pakistan 's army chief ashfaq pervez kayani at one point mulling over deposing zardari and replacing him with a more ' military-friendly ' president .

a model for the agency could be the committee on foreign investment in the united states . the commissioner noted that china has the means to acquire substantial holdings in key european companies and could do so to gain access to their technological know-how or to exercise political leverage on eu member states . " it is a question of investments , but behind that there is also a strategic policy , to which europe should respond politically , " tajani added . rising investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese automaker geely acquired sweden 's volvo in summer 2010 china 's direct investments abroad have increased by 12 percent this year to a total of more than 37 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- .
that value is expected to rise considerably in 2011 . many of china 's foreign investments to date have been aimed at securing access to raw materials in latin america and africa .
but chinese companies are also keen on buying businesses in europe . one example came in the summer of 2010 , when chinese company geely purchased swedish premium carmaker volvo . in 2008 chinese maritime freight group cosco assumed control of two shipping terminals in the greek port of piraeus .
it said it plans to use the facility as a gateway for chinese exports to europe . chinese officials said last week that the government could invest in european sovereign debt to help the eurozone survive future crises if necessary . threat to open markets german economic minister rainer bruederle rejected tajani 's proposal for a new regulator and warned european countries against placing excessive controls on foreign investment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maintaining open markets should be a priority for the eu , says bruederle " europe profits from the openness of its markets and offers attractive conditions for foreign investors , " bruederle said in a follow-up interview with the handelsblatt . bruederle said that while some checks may be necessary to address " security and public order concerns , " leaders should refrain from " hasty actions " . bruederle traveled to china in october to promote europe and germany in particular as prospects for chinese investors . legal controls the debate between tajani and bruederle takes up an issue highlighted by a 2008 amendment to germany 's foreign trade law . the amendment allows the economics minister to investigate or block the plans of a foreign entity seeking to buy 25 percent or more of the voting rights in a german company if the acquisition raises public order or security concerns . but no foreign investment has yet fulfilled the requirements for the law to come into play , a spokesman from the federal ministry of economics and technology told deutsche welle . author : greg wiser -lrb- dpa , afp , ap -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in part one of a three-part series , dw examines how germans overcame historic taboos about deploying their military abroad . in memory of the atrocities committed under the third reich , democratic west germany foreswore war as an instrument of its foreign policy .
its military served a single purpose : to help defend the nato allies in western europe and north america from a soviet attack .
but when the berlin wall fell , the world changed , as did germany 's role within it .
the government of chancellor helmut kohl had just finalized german reunification when a series of conflicts erupted in the persian gulf , yugoslavia and somalia .
as the international community intervened to contain these conflicts , germans faced a historically uncomfortable question : should a reunited and fully sovereign germany become a military power capable of using force on the world stage ? checkbook diplomacy as the us and its coalition partners launched air strikes to eject the iraqi military from kuwait in january 1991 , the streets of germany 's major cities filled with 250,000 protestors who opposed the us-led war against saddam hussein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after reunification , kohl used germany 's checkbook to show solidarity the protests expressed a deep-seated national aversion to war and militarism .
after living at the epicenter of international conflict for an entire century , german society had lost its taste for political violence .
" through the double catastrophe of the two -lsb- world -rsb- wars , the germans transformed themselves from a violent society into a post-heroic society , " said hans-ulrich klose , a bundestag representative and a leading foreign policy expert within the left-of-center social democratic party .
" many germans say that we 're the ones who learned the lessons of history and that others still have to learn those lessons . "
but the germans ' rejection of the american-led coalition , and a un-sanctioned military campaign that targeted an aggressive dictator , left chancellor helmut kohl 's government in a deeply uncomfortable position .
" the kohl government knew they had to contribute to the gulf war due to the principle of allied solidarity , " said karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" but they were at the same time aware of the growing opposition to the war within the electorate . " instead of sending troops to the persian gulf , bonn wrote the coalition partners a check for 17 billion marks -lrb- $ 12 billion , or 8 billion euros -rrb- and supplied logistical support . " we effectively bought ourselves out of the war with our financial contribution , " lamers said . opening pandora 's box the kohl government had been politically and legally boxed into a corner .
on top of vehement public opposition , the government faced a constitution that sanctioned war only in self-defense .
and since saddam hussein had neither attacked germany nor the nato allies , direct german military participation in the conflict was off-limits .
in an effort to reconcile germany 's laws with its international obligations , the center-right christian democratic union called for the " clarification " of two conflicting constitutional articles .
article 87 gave germany the right to field an army for national defense .
but article 24 also permitted germany to join collective security organizations to preserve world peace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faced a quandary during the 1991 gulf war many conservatives argued that article 24 sanctioned german participation in multilateral military operations - with or without a un mandate - that were not directly related to territorial defense . " the claim that the constitution forbids the german armed forces from participating in these kinds of deployments is a legal facade that hides the real political issue , " lamers said .
" in reality it was about the unwillingness and the incapability of the large majority of german citizens and voters to participate in warlike measures . "
partisan firestorm as the governing christian democrats pushed the constitutional question , the opposition social democrats faced internal divisions .
the party base limited its support to un peacekeeping missions while a small elite favored more aggressive military operations like the gulf war .
" the foreign and security policy experts actually wanted such operations as an option , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" but we could n't move our own parliamentary faction because they said the constitution did n't allow such operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boutros boutros-ghali asked germany to send peacekeepers to somalia meanwhile , the pacifist green party rejected military intervention in virtually any form .
" we feared the conservatives who were in power wanted to reconstruct a classic nation state with the capability to project power , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who later served as deputy foreign minister .
" we believed that non-military measures should be developed and given priority . "
even the christian democrats ' own coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , expressed reservations about operations without a un mandate .
fait accompli but world events overshadowed the partisan debate in germany .
the dust had hardly settled in the persian gulf when devastating civil wars broke out in yugoslavia and somalia .
in an attempt to contain violence in southeastern europe , nato and the west european union - a european defense organization - imposed a sea and air blockade on yugoslavia .
nato deployed awacs radar planes to patrol the skies of the balkan war zone .
with germans serving in the multinational crews that manned these aircraft , participation in the blockade was a foregone conclusion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , the constitutional court was asked to decide " we could n't just pull out , " lamers said .
" we were part of a larger whole and were not really free .
we would have risked enormous damage to our image and influence . "
while nato tried to stem the tide of violence in yugoslavia , the un sanctioned a us-led peacekeeping mission to stabilize somalia .
in a trip to bonn , then-un secretary general boutros boutros-ghali personally asked the german government to send peacekeepers to the war-torn east african nation .
with the political parties still in gridlock over the constitutional question , the kohl government decided to act without parliamentary approval .
kohl deployed ships and aircraft to yugoslavia and more than 1,000 soldiers to somalia .
foreign policy on trial politically outmaneuvered , the social democrats sued the kohl government in the federal constitutional court .
yet the party 's foreign and security policy experts worked with the government behind the scenes , according to voigt .
both the opposition and the government wanted to put the constitutional question to rest .
and since parliament could not reach a compromise , they agreed to resolve the political controversy in court .
" we internally agreed to create a case on un operations -lsb- somalia -rsb- , a case on nato operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- and a case on west european union operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- , " voigt said .
" the federal government conducted these operations , and we filed suits against them . "
however , the kohl government almost became a casualty of the legal battle when its coalition partner - the free democrats - sued it over the nato air blockade .
germany 's government now faced an uncertain future as the judges deliberated .
the kohl government dodged a bullet when the federal constitutional court ruled that germany could participate in un , nato and weu military operations worldwide .
but there was an important caveat : these operations had to be approved by a simple parliamentary majority . " we had to slowly learn that we 're a country that represents interests , and that we 're an ally and that carries consequences , " klose said .
" that was a tremendously difficult learning process that has in no way come to an end . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 28.12.2010 the balkan dilemma : germany returns to military action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reality trumped rhetoric : germany agreed to use force in the yugoslavia burdened by the genocidal legacy of national socialism , germany swore never again to wage war .
in part two of a three-part series , dw examines how the country returned to military action in the balkans . war returned to germany 's doorstep when yugoslavia imploded in ethnic violence .
during the winter of 1994 , german officials agonized over whether to participate in a nato-led military intervention aimed at containing the war .
although the nation 's highest court had declared such interventions constitutional , germany remained deeply reluctant to use military force for any reason other than defense .
but enormous political and moral pressure pushed the kohl government and the opposition toward a shaky consensus in favor of military action against serbia .
this consensus faced its trial-by-fire when the social democrats and greens took the reins of power in 1998 .
in a twist of fate , the traditionally antiwar parties ordered germany 's first offensive military strike since world war ii .
the war next door by the fall of 1994 , the war in yugoslavia had reached a boiling point as serb forces began targeting nato aircraft and un peacekeepers .
the nato allies feared the worst and drew up plans to rescue the lightly armed peacekeepers in the event that the serbs launched an all-out attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl dragged his feet to avoid intervening in yugoslavia .
as nato prepared for a showdown , germany dragged its feet .
chancellor helmut kohl argued that since the third reich had occupied yugoslavia , it would be historically inappropriate for germany to intervene in the current conflict .
kohl was trying to prevent germany from getting involved in the conflict too quickly , according to karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats .
" that was an ineffectual attempt to throw up a firewall , " lamers said .
" kohl was much too intelligent to think that it would hold .
but it fit the disposition among the german people . "
kohl 's firewall began crumbling as the arrival of bosnian refugees started impacting german domestic politics , according to lamers .
and as the humanitarian situation worsened , nato began to lose its patience with bonn .
the allies pressured germany to send its tornado warplanes into the bosnian firestorm .
the tornados had a unique capability to locate and destroy serb radar installations , which would help cover a possible un withdrawal .
germany was the only european country that possessed such aircraft .
ultimately , strategic realities trumped political rhetoric and the kohl government assented to nato 's request .
but germany 's deeply divided parliament still had to approve the decision .
" you can always argue about the sense of using military force , because you never know what the result will be .
that 's the risk , " lamers said .
" but when all the countries in the community that we belong to say its necessary , we ca n't just say ' count me out . " '
winning the home front for the first time since the world war ii , a german government had decided to deploy its military to a war zone .
unwilling to shoulder the full political and moral responsibility for its historic decision , the kohl government reached out to the opposition social democrats and greens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the greens ' joschka fischer said force was justified to stop genocide the bosnian quagmire had thrown the social democratic party into an uproar .
the antiwar mainstream feared embarking down a slippery slope that could the country away from its peaceful foreign policy .
but a more hawkish minority supported using force as a last resort to rescue the un peacekeepers and stop the ethnic cleansing .
" in a 10-to-1 vote , the foreign and security policy experts supported the government 's proposal , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" we knew that the party had a different opinion .
there was considerable uproar .
in the end , around 50 social democrats voted with the government in favor of the bosnian mission and against their own party . "
green revolution as social democrats inched closer to the kohl government , the greens were facing a crisis of conscience that threatened to tear their party in two .
traditionally , the green party advocated a pacifist foreign policy rooted in the peaceful resolution of conflicts through international institutions like the un .
but the un 's failure to stop the ethnic cleansing in bosnia led to an ideological revolution within certain quarters of the party .

in part two of a three-part series , dw examines how the country returned to military action in the balkans . war returned to germany 's doorstep when yugoslavia imploded in ethnic violence .
during the winter of 1994 , german officials agonized over whether to participate in a nato-led military intervention aimed at containing the war .
although the nation 's highest court had declared such interventions constitutional , germany remained deeply reluctant to use military force for any reason other than defense .
but enormous political and moral pressure pushed the kohl government and the opposition toward a shaky consensus in favor of military action against serbia .
this consensus faced its trial-by-fire when the social democrats and greens took the reins of power in 1998 .
in a twist of fate , the traditionally antiwar parties ordered germany 's first offensive military strike since world war ii .
the war next door by the fall of 1994 , the war in yugoslavia had reached a boiling point as serb forces began targeting nato aircraft and un peacekeepers .
the nato allies feared the worst and drew up plans to rescue the lightly armed peacekeepers in the event that the serbs launched an all-out attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl dragged his feet to avoid intervening in yugoslavia .
as nato prepared for a showdown , germany dragged its feet .
chancellor helmut kohl argued that since the third reich had occupied yugoslavia , it would be historically inappropriate for germany to intervene in the current conflict .
kohl was trying to prevent germany from getting involved in the conflict too quickly , according to karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats .
" that was an ineffectual attempt to throw up a firewall , " lamers said .
" kohl was much too intelligent to think that it would hold .
but it fit the disposition among the german people . "
kohl 's firewall began crumbling as the arrival of bosnian refugees started impacting german domestic politics , according to lamers .
and as the humanitarian situation worsened , nato began to lose its patience with bonn .
the allies pressured germany to send its tornado warplanes into the bosnian firestorm .
the tornados had a unique capability to locate and destroy serb radar installations , which would help cover a possible un withdrawal .
germany was the only european country that possessed such aircraft .
ultimately , strategic realities trumped political rhetoric and the kohl government assented to nato 's request .
but germany 's deeply divided parliament still had to approve the decision .
" you can always argue about the sense of using military force , because you never know what the result will be .
that 's the risk , " lamers said .
" but when all the countries in the community that we belong to say its necessary , we ca n't just say ' count me out . " '
winning the home front for the first time since the world war ii , a german government had decided to deploy its military to a war zone .
unwilling to shoulder the full political and moral responsibility for its historic decision , the kohl government reached out to the opposition social democrats and greens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the greens ' joschka fischer said force was justified to stop genocide the bosnian quagmire had thrown the social democratic party into an uproar .
the antiwar mainstream feared embarking down a slippery slope that could lead the country away from its peaceful foreign policy .
but a more hawkish minority supported using force as a last resort to rescue the un peacekeepers and stop the ethnic cleansing .
" in a 10-to-1 vote , the foreign and security policy experts supported the government 's proposal , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" we knew that the party had a different opinion .
there was considerable uproar .
in the end , around 50 social democrats voted with the government in favor of the bosnian mission and against their own party . "
green revolution as social democrats inched closer to the kohl government , the greens were facing a crisis of conscience that threatened to tear their party in two .
traditionally , the green party advocated a pacifist foreign policy rooted in the peaceful resolution of conflicts through international institutions like the un .
but the un 's failure to stop the ethnic cleansing in bosnia led to an ideological revolution within certain quarters of the party .
after serb forces massacred thousands of bosnian muslims in the town of srebrenica , green party whip joschka fischer declared that force was justified to stop genocide .

in part one of a three-part series , dw examines how germans overcame historic taboos about deploying their military abroad . in memory of the atrocities committed under the third reich , democratic west germany foreswore war as an instrument of its foreign policy .
its military served a single purpose : to help defend the nato allies in western europe and north america from a soviet attack .
but when the berlin wall fell , the world changed , as did germany 's role within it .
the government of chancellor helmut kohl had just finalized german reunification when a series of conflicts erupted in the persian gulf , yugoslavia and somalia .
as the international community intervened to contain these conflicts , germans faced a historically uncomfortable question : should a reunited and fully sovereign germany become a military power capable of using force on the world stage ? checkbook diplomacy as the us and its coalition partners launched air strikes to eject the iraqi military from kuwait in january 1991 , the streets of germany 's major cities filled with 250,000 protestors who opposed the us-led war against saddam hussein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after reunification , kohl used germany 's checkbook to show solidarity the protests expressed a deep-seated national aversion to war and militarism .
after living at the epicenter of international conflict for an entire century , german society had lost its taste for political violence .
" through the double catastrophe of the two -lsb- world -rsb- wars , the germans transformed themselves from a violent society into a post-heroic society , " said hans-ulrich klose , a bundestag representative and a leading foreign policy expert within the left-of-center social democratic party .
" many germans say that we 're the ones who learned the lessons of history and that others still have to learn those lessons . "
but the germans ' rejection of the american-led coalition , and a un-sanctioned military campaign that targeted an aggressive dictator , left chancellor helmut kohl 's government in a deeply uncomfortable position .
" the kohl government knew they had to contribute to the gulf war due to the principle of allied solidarity , " said karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" but they were at the same time aware of the growing opposition to the war within the electorate . " instead of sending troops to the persian gulf , bonn wrote the coalition partners a check for 17 billion marks -lrb- $ 12 billion , or 8 billion euros -rrb- and supplied logistical support . " we effectively bought ourselves out of the war with our financial contribution , " lamers said . opening pandora 's box the kohl government had been politically and legally boxed into a corner .
on top of vehement public opposition , the government faced a constitution that sanctioned war only in self-defense .
and since saddam hussein had neither attacked germany nor the nato allies , direct german military participation in the conflict was off-limits .
in an effort to reconcile germany 's laws with its international obligations , the center-right christian democratic union called for the " clarification " of two conflicting constitutional articles .
article 87 gave germany the right to field an army for national defense .
but article 24 also permitted germany to join collective security organizations to preserve world peace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faced a quandary during the 1991 gulf war many conservatives argued that article 24 sanctioned german participation in multilateral military operations - with or without a un mandate - that were not directly related to territorial defense . " the claim that the constitution forbids the german armed forces from participating in these kinds of deployments is a legal facade that hides the real political issue , " lamers said .
" in reality it was about the unwillingness and the incapability of the large majority of german citizens and voters to participate in warlike measures . "
partisan firestorm as the governing christian democrats pushed the constitutional question , the opposition social democrats faced internal divisions .
the party base limited its support to un peacekeeping missions while a small elite favored more aggressive military operations like the gulf war .
" the foreign and security policy experts actually wanted such operations as an option , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" but we could n't move our own parliamentary faction because they said the constitution did n't allow such operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boutros boutros-ghali asked germany to send peacekeepers to somalia meanwhile , the pacifist green party rejected military intervention in virtually any form .
" we feared the conservatives who were in power wanted to reconstruct a classic nation state with the capability to project power , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who later served as deputy foreign minister .
" we believed that non-military measures should be developed and given priority . "
even the christian democrats ' own coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , expressed reservations about operations without a un mandate .
fait accompli but world events overshadowed the partisan debate in germany .
the dust had hardly settled in the persian gulf when devastating civil wars broke out in yugoslavia and somalia .
in an attempt to contain violence in southeastern europe , nato and the west european union - a european defense organization - imposed a sea and air blockade on yugoslavia .
nato deployed awacs radar planes to patrol the skies of the balkan war zone .
with germans serving in the multinational crews that manned these aircraft , participation in the blockade was a foregone conclusion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , the constitutional court was asked to decide " we could n't just pull out , " lamers said .
" we were part of a larger whole and were not really free .
we would have risked enormous damage to our image and influence . "
while nato tried to stem the tide of violence in yugoslavia , the un sanctioned a us-led peacekeeping mission to stabilize somalia .
in a trip to bonn , then-un secretary general boutros boutros-ghali personally asked the german government to send peacekeepers to the war-torn east african nation .
with the political parties still in gridlock over the constitutional question , the kohl government decided to act without parliamentary approval .
kohl deployed ships and aircraft to yugoslavia and more than 1,000 soldiers to somalia .
foreign policy on trial politically outmaneuvered , the social democrats sued the kohl government in the federal constitutional court .
yet the party 's foreign and security policy experts worked with the government behind the scenes , according to voigt .
both the opposition and the government wanted to put the constitutional question to rest .
and since parliament could not reach a compromise , they agreed to resolve the political controversy in court .
" we internally agreed to create a case on un operations -lsb- somalia -rsb- , a case on nato operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- and a case on west european union operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- , " voigt said .
" the federal government conducted these operations , and we filed suits against them . "
however , the kohl government almost became a casualty of the legal battle when its coalition partner - the free democrats - sued it over the nato air blockade .
germany 's government now faced an uncertain future as the judges deliberated .
the kohl government dodged a bullet when the federal constitutional court ruled that germany could participate in un , nato and weu military operations worldwide .
but there was an important caveat : these operations had to be approved by a simple parliamentary majority . " we had to slowly learn that we 're a country that represents interests , and that we 're an ally and that carries consequences , " klose said .
" that was a tremendously difficult learning process that has in no way come to an end . "

in part one of a three-part series , dw examines how germans overcame historic taboos about deploying their military abroad . in memory of the atrocities committed under the third reich , democratic west germany foreswore war as an instrument of its foreign policy .
its military served a single purpose : to help defend the nato allies in western europe and north america from a soviet attack .
but when the berlin wall fell , the world changed , as did germany 's role within it .
the government of chancellor helmut kohl had just finalized german reunification when a series of conflicts erupted in the persian gulf , yugoslavia and somalia .
as the international community intervened to contain these conflicts , germans faced a historically uncomfortable question : should a reunited and fully sovereign germany become a military power capable of using force on the world stage ? checkbook diplomacy as the us and its coalition partners launched air strikes to eject the iraqi military from kuwait in january 1991 , the streets of germany 's major cities filled with 250,000 protestors who opposed the us-led war against saddam hussein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after reunification , kohl used germany 's checkbook to show solidarity the protests expressed a deep-seated national aversion to war and militarism .
after living at the epicenter of international conflict for an entire century , german society had lost its taste for political violence .
" through the double catastrophe of the two -lsb- world -rsb- wars , the germans transformed themselves from a violent society into a post-heroic society , " said hans-ulrich klose , a bundestag representative and a leading foreign policy expert within the left-of-center social democratic party .
" many germans say that we 're the ones who learned the lessons of history and that others still have to learn those lessons . "
but the germans ' rejection of the american-led coalition , and a un-sanctioned military campaign that targeted an aggressive dictator , left chancellor helmut kohl 's government in a deeply uncomfortable position .
" the kohl government knew they had to contribute to the gulf war due to the principle of allied solidarity , " said karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" but they were at the same time aware of the growing opposition to the war within the electorate . " instead of sending troops to the persian gulf , bonn wrote the coalition partners a check for 17 billion marks -lrb- $ 12 billion , or 8 billion euros -rrb- and supplied logistical support . " we effectively bought ourselves out of the war with our financial contribution , " lamers said . opening pandora 's box the kohl government had been politically and legally boxed into a corner .
on top of vehement public opposition , the government faced a constitution that sanctioned war only in self-defense .
and since saddam hussein had neither attacked germany nor the nato allies , direct german military participation in the conflict was off-limits .
in an effort to reconcile germany 's laws with its international obligations , the center-right christian democratic union called for the " clarification " of two conflicting constitutional articles .
article 87 gave germany the right to field an army for national defense .
but article 24 also permitted germany to join collective security organizations to preserve world peace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faced a quandary during the 1991 gulf war many conservatives argued that article 24 sanctioned german participation in multilateral military operations - with or without a un mandate - that were not directly related to territorial defense . " the claim that the constitution forbids the german armed forces from participating in these kinds of deployments is a legal facade that hides the real political issue , " lamers said .
" in reality it was about the unwillingness and the incapability of the large majority of german citizens and voters to participate in warlike measures . "
partisan firestorm as the governing christian democrats pushed the constitutional question , the opposition social democrats faced internal divisions .
the party base limited its support to un peacekeeping missions while a small elite favored more aggressive military operations like the gulf war .
" the foreign and security policy experts actually wanted such operations as an option , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" but we could n't move our own parliamentary faction because they said the constitution did n't allow such operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boutros boutros-ghali asked germany to send peacekeepers to somalia meanwhile , the pacifist green party rejected military intervention in virtually any form .
" we feared the conservatives who were in power wanted to reconstruct a classic nation state with the capability to project power , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who later served as deputy foreign minister .
" we believed that non-military measures should be developed and given priority . "
even the christian democrats ' own coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , expressed reservations about operations without a un mandate .
fait accompli but world events overshadowed the partisan debate in germany .
the dust had hardly settled in the persian gulf when devastating civil wars broke out in yugoslavia and somalia .
in an attempt to contain violence in southeastern europe , nato and the west european union - a european defense organization - imposed a sea and air blockade on yugoslavia .
nato deployed awacs radar planes to patrol the skies of the balkan war zone .
with germans serving in the multinational crews that manned these aircraft , participation in the blockade was a foregone conclusion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , the constitutional court was asked to decide " we could n't just pull out , " lamers said .
" we were part of a larger whole and were not really free .
we would have risked enormous damage to our image and influence . "
while nato tried to stem the tide of violence in yugoslavia , the un sanctioned a us-led peacekeeping mission to stabilize somalia .
in a trip to bonn , then-un secretary general boutros boutros-ghali personally asked the german government to send peacekeepers to the war-torn east african nation .
with the political parties still in gridlock over the constitutional question , the kohl government decided to act without parliamentary approval .
kohl deployed ships and aircraft to yugoslavia and more than 1,000 soldiers to somalia .
foreign policy on trial politically outmaneuvered , the social democrats sued the kohl government in the federal constitutional court .
yet the party 's foreign and security policy experts worked with the government behind the scenes , according to voigt .
both the opposition and the government wanted to put the constitutional question to rest .
and since parliament could not reach a compromise , they agreed to resolve the political controversy in court .
" we internally agreed to create a case on un operations -lsb- somalia -rsb- , a case on nato operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- and a case on west european union operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- , " voigt said .
" the federal government conducted these operations , and we filed suits against them . "
however , the kohl government almost became a casualty of the legal battle when its coalition partner - the free democrats - sued it over the nato air blockade .
germany 's government now faced an uncertain future as the judges deliberated .
the kohl government dodged a bullet when the federal constitutional court ruled that germany could participate in un , nato and weu military operations worldwide .
but there was an important caveat : these operations had to be approved by a simple parliamentary majority . " we had to slowly learn that we 're a country that represents interests , and that we 're an ally and that carries consequences , " klose said .
" that was a tremendously difficult learning process that has in no way come to an end . "

in part two of a three-part series , dw examines how the country returned to military action in the balkans . war returned to germany 's doorstep when yugoslavia imploded in ethnic violence .
during the winter of 1994 , german officials agonized over whether to participate in a nato-led military intervention aimed at containing the war .
although the nation 's highest court had declared such interventions constitutional , germany remained deeply reluctant to use military force for any reason other than defense .
but enormous political and moral pressure pushed the kohl government and the opposition toward a shaky consensus in favor of military action against serbia .
this consensus faced its trial-by-fire when the social democrats and greens took the reins of power in 1998 .
in a twist of fate , the traditionally antiwar parties ordered germany 's first offensive military strike since world war ii .
the war next door by the fall of 1994 , the war in yugoslavia had reached a boiling point as serb forces began targeting nato aircraft and un peacekeepers .
the nato allies feared the worst and drew up plans to rescue the lightly armed peacekeepers in the event that the serbs launched an all-out attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl dragged his feet to avoid intervening in yugoslavia .
as nato prepared for a showdown , germany dragged its feet .
chancellor helmut kohl argued that since the third reich had occupied yugoslavia , it would be historically inappropriate for germany to intervene in the current conflict .
kohl was trying to prevent germany from getting involved in the conflict too quickly , according to karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats .
" that was an ineffectual attempt to throw up a firewall , " lamers said .
" kohl was much too intelligent to think that it would hold .
but it fit the disposition among the german people . "
kohl 's firewall began crumbling as the arrival of bosnian refugees started impacting german domestic politics , according to lamers .
and as the humanitarian situation worsened , nato began to lose its patience with bonn .
the allies pressured germany to send its tornado warplanes into the bosnian firestorm .
the tornados had a unique capability to locate and destroy serb radar installations , which would help cover a possible un withdrawal .
germany was the only european country that possessed such aircraft .
ultimately , strategic realities trumped political rhetoric and the kohl government assented to nato 's request .
but germany 's deeply divided parliament still had to approve the decision .
" you can always argue about the sense of using military force , because you never know what the result will be .
that 's the risk , " lamers said .
" but when all the countries in the community that we belong to say its necessary , we ca n't just say ' count me out . " '
winning the home front for the first time since the world war ii , a german government had decided to deploy its military to a war zone .
unwilling to shoulder the full political and moral responsibility for its historic decision , the kohl government reached out to the opposition social democrats and greens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the greens ' joschka fischer said force was justified to stop genocide the bosnian quagmire had thrown the social democratic party into an uproar .
the antiwar mainstream feared embarking down a slippery slope that could the country away from its peaceful foreign policy .
but a more hawkish minority supported using force as a last resort to rescue the un peacekeepers and stop the ethnic cleansing .
" in a 10-to-1 vote , the foreign and security policy experts supported the government 's proposal , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" we knew that the party had a different opinion .
there was considerable uproar .
in the end , around 50 social democrats voted with the government in favor of the bosnian mission and against their own party . "
green revolution as social democrats inched closer to the kohl government , the greens were facing a crisis of conscience that threatened to tear their party in two .
traditionally , the green party advocated a pacifist foreign policy rooted in the peaceful resolution of conflicts through international institutions like the un .
but the un 's failure to stop the ethnic cleansing in bosnia led to an ideological revolution within certain quarters of the party .
after serb forces massacred thousands of bosnian muslims in the town of srebrenica , green party whip joschka fischer declared that force was justified to stop genocide .
" with the balkan wars we realized for the first time that there are situations in which one has to intervene militarily , " said ludger volmer , former president of the green party who went on to serve as the country 's deputy foreign minister . " that was a difficult learning process . "
this learning process would end with the bundestag sending tornado warplanes as well as peacekeepers to bosnia .
against the historical and political odds , germany 's divided parties had forged a shaky consensus in favor of military intervention .
peaceniks in power after serving 16 years in the opposition , the social democrats and greens defeated the kohl government in the 1998 elections .
no sooner had the left-of-center coalition come to power than renewed ethnic violence erupted in yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's air war against serbia was an allied intervention while nato peacekeepers secured the precarious peace in bosnia , the breakaway province of kosovo careened toward war as ethnic albanians demanded independence from serbia .
germany and its nato allies pushed for a peaceful settlement .
but negotiations collapsed when both sides refused to compromise on kosovo 's political status .
in anticipation of this worst-case scenario , the kohl government had committed germany to participate in a nato air war against serbia .
now , social democratic chancellor gerhard schroeder and green party foreign minister joschka fischer had to decide whether they would honor their predecessor 's commitment .
air strikes hardly squared with the coalition 's platform of a foreign policy rooted in peaceful conflict resolution .
bombing belgrade when the security council stalled over russian and chinese objections , nato decided to launch its air war without a un mandate .
the nato allies accused serbia of ethnic cleansing and argued that time was of the essence in order to save innocent lives .
schroeder and fischer faced a nightmare scenario : an allied military intervention without un sanction .
" the new schroeder-fischer government agreed to participate for purely opportune reasons , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert and parliamentarian within the social democratic party .
" they knew that if they did n't participate , they would face foreign policy isolation from the outset .
that 's what i call the joke of history .
the german position changed irrevocably because the government had no choice but to say yes . "
with deep reservations , the former antiwar opposition ordered warplanes to bomb belgrade in germany 's first overt military strike since world war ii .
the shaky foreign policy consensus forged during the bosnian crisis had survived its trial-by-fire in kosovo .
" germany is not a military power and it does n't want to become one , " volmer said .
" you can not help but recognize that there are some conflicts for which you have to arm yourself and that there may be situations in which you have to intervene militarily .
but at its very core , germany has a remote relationship to armed force .
that 's a lesson from the second world war , from history . "

its military served a single purpose : to help defend the nato allies in western europe and north america from a soviet attack .
but when the berlin wall fell , the world changed , as did germany 's role within it .
the government of chancellor helmut kohl had just finalized german reunification when a series of conflicts erupted in the persian gulf , yugoslavia and somalia .
as the international community intervened to contain these conflicts , germans faced a historically uncomfortable question : should a reunited and fully sovereign germany become a military power capable of using force on the world stage ? checkbook diplomacy as the us and its coalition partners launched air strikes to eject the iraqi military from kuwait in january 1991 , the streets of germany 's major cities filled with 250,000 protestors who opposed the us-led war against saddam hussein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after reunification , kohl used germany 's checkbook to show solidarity the protests expressed a deep-seated national aversion to war and militarism .
after living at the epicenter of international conflict for an entire century , german society had lost its taste for political violence .
" through the double catastrophe of the two -lsb- world -rsb- wars , the germans transformed themselves from a violent society into a post-heroic society , " said hans-ulrich klose , a bundestag representative and a leading foreign policy expert within the left-of-center social democratic party .
" many germans say that we 're the ones who learned the lessons of history and that others still have to learn those lessons . "
but the germans ' rejection of the american-led coalition , and a un-sanctioned military campaign that targeted an aggressive dictator , left chancellor helmut kohl 's government in a deeply uncomfortable position .
" the kohl government knew they had to contribute to the gulf war due to the principle of allied solidarity , " said karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" but they were at the same time aware of the growing opposition to the war within the electorate . " instead of sending troops to the persian gulf , bonn wrote the coalition partners a check for 17 billion marks -lrb- $ 12 billion , or 8 billion euros -rrb- and supplied logistical support . " we effectively bought ourselves out of the war with our financial contribution , " lamers said . opening pandora 's box the kohl government had been politically and legally boxed into a corner .
on top of vehement public opposition , the government faced a constitution that sanctioned war only in self-defense .
and since saddam hussein had neither attacked germany nor the nato allies , direct german military participation in the conflict was off-limits .
in an effort to reconcile germany 's laws with its international obligations , the center-right christian democratic union called for the " clarification " of two conflicting constitutional articles .
article 87 gave germany the right to field an army for national defense .
but article 24 also permitted germany to join collective security organizations to preserve world peace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faced a quandary during the 1991 gulf war many conservatives argued that article 24 sanctioned german participation in multilateral military operations - with or without a un mandate - that were not directly related to territorial defense . " the claim that the constitution forbids the german armed forces from participating in these kinds of deployments is a legal facade that hides the real political issue , " lamers said .
" in reality it was about the unwillingness and the incapability of the large majority of german citizens and voters to participate in warlike measures . "
partisan firestorm as the governing christian democrats pushed the constitutional question , the opposition social democrats faced internal divisions .
the party base limited its support to un peacekeeping missions while a small elite favored more aggressive military operations like the gulf war .
" the foreign and security policy experts actually wanted such operations as an option , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" but we could n't move our own parliamentary faction because they said the constitution did n't allow such operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boutros boutros-ghali asked germany to send peacekeepers to somalia meanwhile , the pacifist green party rejected military intervention in virtually any form .
" we feared the conservatives who were in power wanted to reconstruct a classic nation state with the capability to project power , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who later served as deputy foreign minister .
" we believed that non-military measures should be developed and given priority . "
even the christian democrats ' own coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , expressed reservations about operations without a un mandate .
fait accompli but world events overshadowed the partisan debate in germany .
the dust had hardly settled in the persian gulf when devastating civil wars broke out in yugoslavia and somalia .
in an attempt to contain violence in southeastern europe , nato and the west european union - a european defense organization - imposed a sea and air blockade on yugoslavia .
nato deployed awacs radar planes to patrol the skies of the balkan war zone .
with germans serving in the multinational crews that manned these aircraft , participation in the blockade was a foregone conclusion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , the constitutional court was asked to decide " we could n't just pull out , " lamers said .
" we were part of a larger whole and were not really free .
we would have risked enormous damage to our image and influence . "
while nato tried to stem the tide of violence in yugoslavia , the un sanctioned a us-led peacekeeping mission to stabilize somalia .
in a trip to bonn , then-un secretary general boutros boutros-ghali personally asked the german government to send peacekeepers to the war-torn east african nation .
with the political parties still in gridlock over the constitutional question , the kohl government decided to act without parliamentary approval .
kohl deployed ships and aircraft to yugoslavia and more than 1,000 soldiers to somalia .
foreign policy on trial politically outmaneuvered , the social democrats sued the kohl government in the federal constitutional court .
yet the party 's foreign and security policy experts worked with the government behind the scenes , according to voigt .
both the opposition and the government wanted to put the constitutional question to rest .
and since parliament could not reach a compromise , they agreed to resolve the political controversy in court .
" we internally agreed to create a case on un operations -lsb- somalia -rsb- , a case on nato operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- and a case on west european union operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- , " voigt said .
" the federal government conducted these operations , and we filed suits against them . "
however , the kohl government almost became a casualty of the legal battle when its coalition partner - the free democrats - sued it over the nato air blockade .
germany 's government now faced an uncertain future as the judges deliberated .
the kohl government dodged a bullet when the federal constitutional court ruled that germany could participate in un , nato and weu military operations worldwide .
but there was an important caveat : these operations had to be approved by a simple parliamentary majority . " we had to slowly learn that we 're a country that represents interests , and that we 're an ally and that carries consequences , " klose said .
" that was a tremendously difficult learning process that has in no way come to an end . "

in part two of a three-part series , dw examines how the country returned to military action in the balkans . war returned to germany 's doorstep when yugoslavia imploded in ethnic violence .
during the winter of 1994 , german officials agonized over whether to participate in a nato-led military intervention aimed at containing the war .
although the nation 's highest court had declared such interventions constitutional , germany remained deeply reluctant to use military force for any reason other than defense .
but enormous political and moral pressure pushed the kohl government and the opposition toward a shaky consensus in favor of military action against serbia .
this consensus faced its trial-by-fire when the social democrats and greens took the reins of power in 1998 .
in a twist of fate , the traditionally antiwar parties ordered germany 's first offensive military strike since world war ii .
the war next door by the fall of 1994 , the war in yugoslavia had reached a boiling point as serb forces began targeting nato aircraft and un peacekeepers .
the nato allies feared the worst and drew up plans to rescue the lightly armed peacekeepers in the event that the serbs launched an all-out attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl dragged his feet to avoid intervening in yugoslavia .
as nato prepared for a showdown , germany dragged its feet .
chancellor helmut kohl argued that since the third reich had occupied yugoslavia , it would be historically inappropriate for germany to intervene in the current conflict .
kohl was trying to prevent germany from getting involved in the conflict too quickly , according to karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats .
" that was an ineffectual attempt to throw up a firewall , " lamers said .
" kohl was much too intelligent to think that it would hold .
but it fit the disposition among the german people . "
kohl 's firewall began crumbling as the arrival of bosnian refugees started impacting german domestic politics , according to lamers .
and as the humanitarian situation worsened , nato began to lose its patience with bonn .
the allies pressured germany to send its tornado warplanes into the bosnian firestorm .
the tornados had a unique capability to locate and destroy serb radar installations , which would help cover a possible un withdrawal .
germany was the only european country that possessed such aircraft .
ultimately , strategic realities trumped political rhetoric and the kohl government assented to nato 's request .
but germany 's deeply divided parliament still had to approve the decision .
" you can always argue about the sense of using military force , because you never know what the result will be .
that 's the risk , " lamers said .
" but when all the countries in the community that we belong to say its necessary , we ca n't just say ' count me out . " '
winning the home front for the first time since the world war ii , a german government had decided to deploy its military to a war zone .
unwilling to shoulder the full political and moral responsibility for its historic decision , the kohl government reached out to the opposition social democrats and greens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the greens ' joschka fischer said force was justified to stop genocide the bosnian quagmire had thrown the social democratic party into an uproar .
the antiwar mainstream feared embarking down a slippery slope that could lead the country away from its peaceful foreign policy .
but a more hawkish minority supported using force as a last resort to rescue the un peacekeepers and stop the ethnic cleansing .
" in a 10-to-1 vote , the foreign and security policy experts supported the government 's proposal , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" we knew that the party had a different opinion .
there was considerable uproar .
in the end , around 50 social democrats voted with the government in favor of the bosnian mission and against their own party . "
green revolution as social democrats inched closer to the kohl government , the greens were facing a crisis of conscience that threatened to tear their party in two .
traditionally , the green party advocated a pacifist foreign policy rooted in the peaceful resolution of conflicts through international institutions like the un .
but the un 's failure to stop the ethnic cleansing in bosnia led to an ideological revolution within certain quarters of the party .
after serb forces massacred thousands of bosnian muslims in the town of srebrenica , green party whip joschka fischer declared that force was justified to stop genocide .
" with the balkan wars we realized for the first time that there are situations in which one has to intervene militarily , " said ludger volmer , former president of the green party who went on to serve as the country 's deputy foreign minister . " that was a difficult learning process . "
this learning process would end with the bundestag sending tornado warplanes as well as peacekeepers to bosnia .
against the historical and political odds , germany 's divided parties had forged a shaky consensus in favor of military intervention .
peaceniks in power after serving 16 years in the opposition , the social democrats and greens defeated the kohl government in the 1998 elections .
no sooner had the left-of-center coalition come to power than renewed ethnic violence erupted in yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's air war against serbia was an allied intervention while nato peacekeepers secured the precarious peace in bosnia , the breakaway province of kosovo careened toward war as ethnic albanians demanded independence from serbia .
germany and its nato allies pushed for a peaceful settlement .
but negotiations collapsed when both sides refused to compromise on kosovo 's political status .
in anticipation of this worst-case scenario , the kohl government had committed germany to participate in a nato air war against serbia .
now , social democratic chancellor gerhard schroeder and green party foreign minister joschka fischer had to decide whether they would honor their predecessor 's commitment .
air strikes hardly squared with the coalition 's platform of a foreign policy rooted in peaceful conflict resolution .
bombing belgrade when the security council stalled over russian and chinese objections , nato decided to launch its air war without a un mandate .
the nato allies accused serbia of ethnic cleansing and argued that time was of the essence in order to save innocent lives .
schroeder and fischer faced a nightmare scenario : an allied military intervention without un sanction .
" the new schroeder-fischer government agreed to participate for purely opportune reasons , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert and parliamentarian within the social democratic party .
" they knew that if they did n't participate , they would face foreign policy isolation from the outset .
that 's what i call the joke of history .
the german position changed irrevocably because the government had no choice but to say yes . "
with deep reservations , the former antiwar opposition ordered warplanes to bomb belgrade in germany 's first overt military strike since world war ii .
the shaky foreign policy consensus forged during the bosnian crisis had survived its trial-by-fire in kosovo .
" germany is not a military power and it does n't want to become one , " volmer said .
" you can not help but recognize that there are some conflicts for which you have to arm yourself and that there may be situations in which you have to intervene militarily .
but at its very core , germany has a remote relationship to armed force .
that 's a lesson from the second world war , from history . "

kohl was trying to prevent germany from getting involved in the conflict too quickly , according to karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats .
" that was an ineffectual attempt to throw up a firewall , " lamers said .
" kohl was much too intelligent to think that it would hold .
but it fit the disposition among the german people . "
kohl 's firewall began crumbling as the arrival of bosnian refugees started impacting german domestic politics , according to lamers .
and as the humanitarian situation worsened , nato began to lose its patience with bonn .
the allies pressured germany to send its tornado warplanes into the bosnian firestorm .
the tornados had a unique capability to locate and destroy serb radar installations , which would help cover a possible un withdrawal .
germany was the only european country that possessed such aircraft .
ultimately , strategic realities trumped political rhetoric and the kohl government assented to nato 's request .
but germany 's deeply divided parliament still had to approve the decision .
" you can always argue about the sense of using military force , because you never know what the result will be .
that 's the risk , " lamers said .
" but when all the countries in the community that we belong to say its necessary , we ca n't just say ' count me out . " '
winning the home front for the first time since the world war ii , a german government had decided to deploy its military to a war zone .
unwilling to shoulder the full political and moral responsibility for its historic decision , the kohl government reached out to the opposition social democrats and greens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the greens ' joschka fischer said force was justified to stop genocide the bosnian quagmire had thrown the social democratic party into an uproar .
the antiwar mainstream feared embarking down a slippery slope that could lead the country away from its peaceful foreign policy .
but a more hawkish minority supported using force as a last resort to rescue the un peacekeepers and stop the ethnic cleansing .
" in a 10-to-1 vote , the foreign and security policy experts supported the government 's proposal , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" we knew that the party had a different opinion .
there was considerable uproar .
in the end , around 50 social democrats voted with the government in favor of the bosnian mission and against their own party . "
green revolution as social democrats inched closer to the kohl government , the greens were facing a crisis of conscience that threatened to tear their party in two .
traditionally , the green party advocated a pacifist foreign policy rooted in the peaceful resolution of conflicts through international institutions like the un .
but the un 's failure to stop the ethnic cleansing in bosnia led to an ideological revolution within certain quarters of the party .
after serb forces massacred thousands of bosnian muslims in the town of srebrenica , green party whip joschka fischer declared that force was justified to stop genocide .
" with the balkan wars we realized for the first time that there are situations in which one has to intervene militarily , " said ludger volmer , former president of the green party who went on to serve as the country 's deputy foreign minister . " that was a difficult learning process . "
this learning process would end with the bundestag sending tornado warplanes as well as peacekeepers to bosnia .
against the historical and political odds , germany 's divided parties had forged a shaky consensus in favor of military intervention .
peaceniks in power after serving 16 years in the opposition , the social democrats and greens defeated the kohl government in the 1998 elections .
no sooner had the left-of-center coalition come to power than renewed ethnic violence erupted in yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's air war against serbia was an allied intervention while nato peacekeepers secured the precarious peace in bosnia , the breakaway province of kosovo careened toward war as ethnic albanians demanded independence from serbia .
germany and its nato allies pushed for a peaceful settlement .
but negotiations collapsed when both sides refused to compromise on kosovo 's political status .
in anticipation of this worst-case scenario , the kohl government had committed germany to participate in a nato air war against serbia .
now , social democratic chancellor gerhard schroeder and green party foreign minister joschka fischer had to decide whether they would honor their predecessor 's commitment .
air strikes hardly squared with the coalition 's platform of a foreign policy rooted in peaceful conflict resolution .
bombing belgrade when the security council stalled over russian and chinese objections , nato decided to launch its air war without a un mandate .
the nato allies accused serbia of ethnic cleansing and argued that time was of the essence in order to save innocent lives .
schroeder and fischer faced a nightmare scenario : an allied military intervention without un sanction .
" the new schroeder-fischer government agreed to participate for purely opportune reasons , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert and parliamentarian within the social democratic party .
" they knew that if they did n't participate , they would face foreign policy isolation from the outset .
that 's what i call the joke of history .
the german position changed irrevocably because the government had no choice but to say yes . "
with deep reservations , the former antiwar opposition ordered warplanes to bomb belgrade in germany 's first overt military strike since world war ii .
the shaky foreign policy consensus forged during the bosnian crisis had survived its trial-by-fire in kosovo .
" germany is not a military power and it does n't want to become one , " volmer said .
" you can not help but recognize that there are some conflicts for which you have to arm yourself and that there may be situations in which you have to intervene militarily .
but at its very core , germany has a remote relationship to armed force .
that 's a lesson from the second world war , from history . "

in part two of a three-part series , dw examines how the country returned to military action in the balkans . war returned to germany 's doorstep when yugoslavia imploded in ethnic violence .
during the winter of 1994 , german officials agonized over whether to participate in a nato-led military intervention aimed at containing the war .
although the nation 's highest court had declared such interventions constitutional , germany remained deeply reluctant to use military force for any reason other than defense .
but enormous political and moral pressure pushed the kohl government and the opposition toward a shaky consensus in favor of military action against serbia .
this consensus faced its trial-by-fire when the social democrats and greens took the reins of power in 1998 .
in a twist of fate , the traditionally antiwar parties ordered germany 's first offensive military strike since world war ii .
the war next door by the fall of 1994 , the war in yugoslavia had reached a boiling point as serb forces began targeting nato aircraft and un peacekeepers .
the nato allies feared the worst and drew up plans to rescue the lightly armed peacekeepers in the event that the serbs launched an all-out attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl dragged his feet to avoid intervening in yugoslavia .

in part one of a three-part series , dw examines how germans overcame historic taboos about deploying their military abroad . in memory of the atrocities committed under the third reich , democratic west germany foreswore war as an instrument of its foreign policy .
its military served a single purpose : to help defend the nato allies in western europe and north america from a soviet attack .
but when the berlin wall fell , the world changed , as did germany 's role within it .
the government of chancellor helmut kohl had just finalized german reunification when a series of conflicts erupted in the persian gulf , yugoslavia and somalia .
as the international community intervened to contain these conflicts , germans faced a historically uncomfortable question : should a reunited and fully sovereign germany become a military power capable of using force on the world stage ? checkbook diplomacy as the us and its coalition partners launched air strikes to eject the iraqi military from kuwait in january 1991 , the streets of germany 's major cities filled with 250,000 protestors who opposed the us-led war against saddam hussein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after reunification , kohl used germany 's checkbook to show solidarity the protests expressed a deep-seated national aversion to war and militarism .
after living at the epicenter of international conflict for an entire century , german society had lost its taste for political violence .
" through the double catastrophe of the two -lsb- world -rsb- wars , the germans transformed themselves from a violent society into a post-heroic society , " said hans-ulrich klose , a bundestag representative and a leading foreign policy expert within the left-of-center social democratic party .
" many germans say that we 're the ones who learned the lessons of history and that others still have to learn those lessons . "
but the germans ' rejection of the american-led coalition , and a un-sanctioned military campaign that targeted an aggressive dictator , left chancellor helmut kohl 's government in a deeply uncomfortable position .
" the kohl government knew they had to contribute to the gulf war due to the principle of allied solidarity , " said karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" but they were at the same time aware of the growing opposition to the war within the electorate . " instead of sending troops to the persian gulf , bonn wrote the coalition partners a check for 17 billion marks -lrb- $ 12 billion , or 8 billion euros -rrb- and supplied logistical support . " we effectively bought ourselves out of the war with our financial contribution , " lamers said . opening pandora 's box the kohl government had been politically and legally boxed into a corner .
on top of vehement public opposition , the government faced a constitution that sanctioned war only in self-defense .
and since saddam hussein had neither attacked germany nor the nato allies , direct german military participation in the conflict was off-limits .
in an effort to reconcile germany 's laws with its international obligations , the center-right christian democratic union called for the " clarification " of two conflicting constitutional articles .
article 87 gave germany the right to field an army for national defense .
but article 24 also permitted germany to join collective security organizations to preserve world peace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faced a quandary during the 1991 gulf war many conservatives argued that article 24 sanctioned german participation in multilateral military operations - with or without a un mandate - that were not directly related to territorial defense . " the claim that the constitution forbids the german armed forces from participating in these kinds of deployments is a legal facade that hides the real political issue , " lamers said .
" in reality it was about the unwillingness and the incapability of the large majority of german citizens and voters to participate in warlike measures . "
partisan firestorm as the governing christian democrats pushed the constitutional question , the opposition social democrats faced internal divisions .
the party base limited its support to un peacekeeping missions while a small elite favored more aggressive military operations like the gulf war .
" the foreign and security policy experts actually wanted such operations as an option , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" but we could n't move our own parliamentary faction because they said the constitution did n't allow such operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boutros boutros-ghali asked germany to send peacekeepers to somalia meanwhile , the pacifist green party rejected military intervention in virtually any form .
" we feared the conservatives who were in power wanted to reconstruct a classic nation state with the capability to project power , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who later served as deputy foreign minister .
" we believed that non-military measures should be developed and given priority . "
even the christian democrats ' own coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , expressed reservations about operations without a un mandate .
fait accompli but world events overshadowed the partisan debate in germany .
the dust had hardly settled in the persian gulf when devastating civil wars broke out in yugoslavia and somalia .
in an attempt to contain violence in southeastern europe , nato and the west european union - a european defense organization - imposed a sea and air blockade on yugoslavia .
nato deployed awacs radar planes to patrol the skies of the balkan war zone .
with germans serving in the multinational crews that manned these aircraft , participation in the blockade was a foregone conclusion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , the constitutional court was asked to decide " we could n't just pull out , " lamers said .
" we were part of a larger whole and were not really free .
we would have risked enormous damage to our image and influence . "
while nato tried to stem the tide of violence in yugoslavia , the un sanctioned a us-led peacekeeping mission to stabilize somalia .
in a trip to bonn , then-un secretary general boutros boutros-ghali personally asked the german government to send peacekeepers to the war-torn east african nation .
with the political parties still in gridlock over the constitutional question , the kohl government decided to act without parliamentary approval .
kohl deployed ships and aircraft to yugoslavia and more than 1,000 soldiers to somalia .
foreign policy on trial politically outmaneuvered , the social democrats sued the kohl government in the federal constitutional court .
yet the party 's foreign and security policy experts worked with the government behind the scenes , according to voigt .
both the opposition and the government wanted to put the constitutional question to rest .
and since parliament could not reach a compromise , they agreed to resolve the political controversy in court .
" we internally agreed to create a case on un operations -lsb- somalia -rsb- , a case on nato operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- and a case on west european union operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- , " voigt said .
" the federal government conducted these operations , and we filed suits against them . "
however , the kohl government almost became a casualty of the legal battle when its coalition partner - the free democrats - sued it over the nato air blockade .
germany 's government now faced an uncertain future as the judges deliberated .
the kohl government dodged a bullet when the federal constitutional court ruled that germany could participate in un , nato and weu military operations worldwide .
but there was an important caveat : these operations had to be approved by a simple parliamentary majority . " we had to slowly learn that we 're a country that represents interests , and that we 're an ally and that carries consequences , " klose said .
" that was a tremendously difficult learning process that has in no way come to an end . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faced a quandary during the 1991 gulf war many conservatives argued that article 24 sanctioned german participation in multilateral military operations - with or without a un mandate - that were not directly related to territorial defense . " the claim that the constitution forbids the german armed forces from participating in these kinds of deployments is a legal facade that hides the real political issue , " lamers said .
" in reality it was about the unwillingness and the incapability of the large majority of german citizens and voters to participate in warlike measures . "
partisan firestorm as the governing christian democrats pushed the constitutional question , the opposition social democrats faced internal divisions .
the party base limited its support to un peacekeeping missions while a small elite favored more aggressive military operations like the gulf war .
" the foreign and security policy experts actually wanted such operations as an option , " said karsten voigt , former foreign policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" but we could n't move our own parliamentary faction because they said the constitution did n't allow such operations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boutros boutros-ghali asked germany to send peacekeepers to somalia meanwhile , the pacifist green party rejected military intervention in virtually any form .
" we feared the conservatives who were in power wanted to reconstruct a classic nation state with the capability to project power , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who later served as deputy foreign minister .
" we believed that non-military measures should be developed and given priority . "
even the christian democrats ' own coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , expressed reservations about operations without a un mandate .
fait accompli but world events overshadowed the partisan debate in germany .
the dust had hardly settled in the persian gulf when devastating civil wars broke out in yugoslavia and somalia .
in an attempt to contain violence in southeastern europe , nato and the west european union - a european defense organization - imposed a sea and air blockade on yugoslavia .
nato deployed awacs radar planes to patrol the skies of the balkan war zone .
with germans serving in the multinational crews that manned these aircraft , participation in the blockade was a foregone conclusion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the end , the constitutional court was asked to decide " we could n't just pull out , " lamers said .
" we were part of a larger whole and were not really free .
we would have risked enormous damage to our image and influence . "
while nato tried to stem the tide of violence in yugoslavia , the un sanctioned a us-led peacekeeping mission to stabilize somalia .
in a trip to bonn , then-un secretary general boutros boutros-ghali personally asked the german government to send peacekeepers to the war-torn east african nation .
with the political parties still in gridlock over the constitutional question , the kohl government decided to act without parliamentary approval .
kohl deployed ships and aircraft to yugoslavia and more than 1,000 soldiers to somalia .
foreign policy on trial politically outmaneuvered , the social democrats sued the kohl government in the federal constitutional court .
yet the party 's foreign and security policy experts worked with the government behind the scenes , according to voigt .
both the opposition and the government wanted to put the constitutional question to rest .
and since parliament could not reach a compromise , they agreed to resolve the political controversy in court .
" we internally agreed to create a case on un operations -lsb- somalia -rsb- , a case on nato operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- and a case on west european union operations -lsb- yugoslavia -rsb- , " voigt said .
" the federal government conducted these operations , and we filed suits against them . "
however , the kohl government almost became a casualty of the legal battle when its coalition partner - the free democrats - sued it over the nato air blockade .
germany 's government now faced an uncertain future as the judges deliberated .
the kohl government dodged a bullet when the federal constitutional court ruled that germany could participate in un , nato and weu military operations worldwide .
but there was an important caveat : these operations had to be approved by a simple parliamentary majority . " we had to slowly learn that we 're a country that represents interests , and that we 're an ally and that carries consequences , " klose said .
" that was a tremendously difficult learning process that has in no way come to an end . "

its military served a single purpose : to help defend the nato allies in western europe and north america from a soviet attack .
but when the berlin wall fell , the world changed , as did germany 's role within it .
the government of chancellor helmut kohl had just finalized german reunification when a series of conflicts erupted in the persian gulf , yugoslavia and somalia .
as the international community intervened to contain these conflicts , germans faced a historically uncomfortable question : should a reunited and fully sovereign germany become a military power capable of using force on the world stage ? checkbook diplomacy as the us and its coalition partners launched air strikes to eject the iraqi military from kuwait in january 1991 , the streets of germany 's major cities filled with 250,000 protestors who opposed the us-led war against saddam hussein .

after living at the epicenter of international conflict for an entire century , german society had lost its taste for political violence .
" through the double catastrophe of the two -lsb- world -rsb- wars , the germans transformed themselves from a violent society into a post-heroic society , " said hans-ulrich klose , a bundestag representative and a leading foreign policy expert within the left-of-center social democratic party .
" many germans say that we 're the ones who learned the lessons of history and that others still have to learn those lessons . "
but the germans ' rejection of the american-led coalition , and a un-sanctioned military campaign that targeted an aggressive dictator , left chancellor helmut kohl 's government in a deeply uncomfortable position .
" the kohl government knew they had to contribute to the gulf war due to the principle of allied solidarity , " said karl lamers , the former foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats .
" but they were at the same time aware of the growing opposition to the war within the electorate . " instead of sending troops to the persian gulf , bonn wrote the coalition partners a check for 17 billion marks -lrb- $ 12 billion , or 8 billion euros -rrb- and supplied logistical support .

in 1806 , hegel described him as an iconic " world-soul , " and even his enemies could not quite shake off the fascination for the emperor who at first seemed to be invincible .
but poets and artists of his time also portrayed napoleon as a heartless warmonger , a ridiculous caricature , and even as satan 's eldest son .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show examines the emperor from various angles in " napoleon and europe , dream and trauma " the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany takes on napoleon in the context of his time .
the exhibition gives visitors with a critical and multifaceted look at a challenging topic .
the historic exhibition was done in cooperation with the musee de l 'armee in paris , where it will be shown in the spring of 2012 .
it will be the first comprehensive exhibition about napoleon in france for over 40 years .
" up to now in france , it 's been quite impossible to have a reasonable point of view about napoleon , " robert bresse , director of the musee de l 'armee , told deutsche welle .
" so , it 's really important to have an exhibition in paris that was built outside of france . "
master of propaganda as one of the exhibition 's 12 chapters illuminates , napoleon was a master of image cultivation and propaganda through artworks such as busts and paintings .
and napoleon 's image continues to be influenced by propaganda , the exhibit 's curator says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : napoleon 's myth lives on in marlon brando 's mantle from the movie desiree " part of the exhibition is the coronation mantle marlon brando wore when he played napoleon , revealing how much the official iconography of napoleon 's time has been passed on by film history and our popular culture , " said benedicte savoy , curator of the exhibition .
and , of course , there were napoleon 's wars .
his ambitious plans to unify europe under his command resulted in strategic triumphs , such as the battle of the three emperors in 1805 .
but they also led to his disastrous defeat and eventual downfall after the battle of waterloo in 1815 .
a generation of veterans other exhibitions have dealt thoroughly with the millions of victims who were killed in the napoleonic wars .
but ' napoleon and europe ' takes a closer look at the survivors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a living example of napoleon 's soldiers at the museum in bonn " nobody thinks of those who were wounded , " angelica francke , director of the exhibition , told deutsche welle .
" but those people , the veterans , were present in the streets for decades after napoleon was exiled .
so we dedicate a part of the exhibition to them . "
napoleon 's influence remains a part of europe up to the present day .
the exhibit shows how he implemented new standards like the metric system , connected european cities through a system of roads and telegraph lines , and , of course , introduced the napoleonic code , the civil rights opus still applied in france .
napoleon 's controversial impact on europe but napoleon 's impact on the face of europe was dark as well .
one part of the exhibit focuses one the theft of artworks from archives and museums of the conquered regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the young emperor : napoleon age 27 however , even this systematic theft has more than one side to it , according to erich pelzer , a historian at the university of mannheim .
" napoleon is never one-dimensional , he 's always controversial , " pelzer told deutsche welle .
" many artworks that could n't be stored in the louvre were redistributed to other european cities , helping a new ' europe of culture ' to emerge .
in fact , the theft of archives reflects a core phenomenon of napoleon : he creates something new without changing the actual substance , " pelzer said . napoleon 's impact on europe remains as controversial as napoleon himself .
and by taking a pan-european approach to its subject , the exhibition " napoleon and europe " offers a variety of new insights .

competitors from austria , poland and switzerland are considered to be among the favorites . the four hills tournament is a series of four ski jump competitions timed to ring in the new year .
the 59th edition of the competition starts in the german town of oberstdorf on wednesday , followed by the new year 's day jumps in garmisch-partenkirchen .
after that , the tournament moves to austria , with jumps in innsbruck on january 3 and in bishofshofen on january 6 .
at the end of the tournament , the competitor with the best overall score from the four events is declared the winner .
for german fans of ski jumping , it seems ages ago since sven hannawald swept the events of the four hills tournament in the 2001-02 competition .
he became the first ski jumper to win all four events of the tournament , a feat that has yet to be matched .
but if germany 's current form is anything to go by , they 'll be lucky to crack the top-10 in the overall standings , let alone win any of the events .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german pascal bodmer could crack the top 10 " of course we would rather go into the competition as one of the favourites , " said german ski jumping coach werner schuster .
" but it 's our goal for at least one of our ski jumpers to make it into the top 10 . "
the former stars of the german team , martin schmitt and michael uhrmann , are both 32 and not in very good form . schmitt 's best days on the hills may be behind him , but according to coach schuster , due to his experience - schmitt is competing in his 15th four hills tournament - he remains an important part of the team .
with schmitt no longer expected to reach the podium , it will be young up-and-coming ski jumpers such as severin freund and pascal bodmer who will likely be germany 's best hopes for cracking the top 10 . " the young guys are still really coachable , " schuster said .
" they 'll have to show what they can do at the first and second events in particular .
that 's where the wheat is separated from the chaff . "
austria 's morgenstern is the favorite the austrians , with their duo of thomas morgenstern and andreas kofler are considered to be favorites , and are going for their third consecutive overall win . morgenstern is on form , having won four consecutive world cup events this season .
he 's trying to go into the four hills as relaxed as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's thomas morgenstern is one of the favourites " i do n't wrack my brain over winning the tournament , " morgenstern said .
" i still just want to continue to have fun .
ski-jumping is not the most important part in my life . "
kofler , the defending four hills title holder , said he did n't feel any added pressure going into this year 's competition . " i can be calm about it and start with a lot of pleasant anticipation since i 've already won the tournament , " he said .
austria 's national coach , alexander pointer , is quite optimistic about a win .
" we do n't need to be overmodest , " he said .
" i see two exceptional athletes on the ski-jumping circuit at the moment : morgenstern and kofler . "
but there is some bad news for the austrian team as well .
gregor schlierenzauer , who has twice won the ski jumping world championship , will not be able to compete in the first two of the four tournament events due to an injured knee .
" it 's a tough decision for me .
but my head tells me that this is right thing to do for the long-term , " the 20-year-old schlierenzauer said .
schmitt wo n't quit after this year 's season polish ski jumper adam malysz and simon ammann from switzerland have set out to stop the austrian wave of success .
ammann , who has won four olympic titles - including two gold medals in vancouver - has yet to win the four hills tournament .
" the tournament is hugely attractive and its mystique gets bigger and bigger , as my chances of winning get " he said .
" so far , the tournament has been a tough nut to crack for me . "
a maximum of 57,000 euro -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- awaits the winner of the four hills tournament if he ties the record by german ski jumper hannawald .
in addition to the prize money , there will be a car worth some 30,000 euro -lrb- $ 40,000 -rrb- .

some commentators fear blurry boundaries are putting aid workers at deadly risk . the killing of an afghanistan-based german aid worker by the taliban over the weekend has sparked calls for a greater and more visible separation between development work and military forces in the country .
former united nations special representative to afghanistan and current member of the german bundestag tom koenigs stressed that aid workers are in more danger than ever .
" the workers ' neutrality is no longer being acknowledged a priori , partly because their work has been politicized more and more in recent years , " koenigs said in an interview with the daily koelner stadtanzeiger .
" the price for that is that the development workers are perceived as part of the war .
we should concentrate more on separating development work from military deployment . "
koenigs ' comments come just weeks after german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg called for troops in crisis regions to work more closely with humanitarian aid agencies on the ground .
targeting aid workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is still rebuilding the most recent victim of the insurgency , an engineer working as an advisor to the german development bank kfw , was fatally wounded while travelling in a vehicle with three colleagues .
one of the colleagues , an afghan translator , was also injured in the attack .
the kfw advisor is the latest in a series of aid workers to be targeted in afghanistan this year , which has seen a spike in the number deaths of civilian development workers .
attacks directed at un employees working in afghanistan have increased by more than 130 percent in 2010 compared to last year , according to the united nations department of safety and security .
in another high-profile case from september , aid worker linda norgrove of scotland was taken hostage and later killed during a us-led operation to secure her release .
she had been working for the american-based organization development alternatives inc .
risks ever-present kieran dwyer of the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan said his organization attempts to minimize risks for development workers by remaining in constant contact with civilian and government leaders about possible risks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister dirk niebel called the attack on the aid worker " cowardly " " but the security risks can only be mitigated by the way we operate , not eliminated , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's important to remember that not just foreign aid workers but also afghan aid and government workers are targeted by insurgents .
it is not only the rising number of attacks that concerns dwyer .
" insurgents also began to target more regions of the country in the last year , often attacking the so-called soft targets of unarmed government and humanitarian workers , " he added .
germany has 4,800 troops in afghanistan , most of whom are serving in the north of the country , where the attack on the kfw consultant took place .
berlin is to begin reducing troop numbers in afghanistan by the end of 2011 , and to pull out of the country completely within four years . author : greg wiser -lrb- dpa -rrb- editor : sophie tarr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics say the intiative may see higher prices at the pump and cause damage to the environment . as of january 1 , 2011 , german drivers will have the option to fuel up their cars with new super e10 , a biofuel with higher ethanol content .
the change is part of germany 's plan to incrementally decrease its carbon emissions , with the goal of an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
but for everyday german drivers , the cost of the new biofuel is still a relative unknown , and the subject of much speculation .
previously , biofuel in germany only had five percent ethanol content , whereas e10 packs a solid 10 percent ethanol , an increase that should prove more environmentally friendly .
the federal ministry for the environment , nature conservation and nuclear safety -lrb- bmu -rrb- estimates that around 90 percent of existing german cars will be e10-compatible .
those vehicles unable to run on e10 can keep using the five percent variety until it is phased out in 2013 .
e10 will be available from the more than 14,000 service stations throughout the country as of the first of the year .
according to the bmu , the higher ethanol gasoline will have a decreased impact on the environment in terms of carbon emissions and will reduce consumer reliance on diminishing oil reserves .
the initiative is also designed to bring germany into compliance with a european commission directive seeking an eu-wide greenhouse gas emission savings of 60 percent from 2018 onwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while they disagree on how much , most parties say e10 will cost more than regular gas more ethanol means more cost the cost to the consumer is one contentious issue that is being batted around between the various groups interested in the project .
as the cost of producing ethanol biofuel is higher than regular gasoline , the bmu expects the price at the pump to increase slightly as well .
" with the introduction of e10 come additional costs for the production of bioethanol and the maintenance of fuel quality , " the ministry said .
but the german association for the biofuel industry contended that prices will not increase significantly .
" ethanol will not be much more expensive than gasoline , " association president claus sauter told press agency dpa .
" in addition , the petroleum industry itself is interested in selling e10 , because it is legally obliged to bring biofuels to market . "
on the other side of the issue , the spokesman for bp europe told bonn 's general anzeiger newspaper , " for drivers , the price will always be higher , " estimating an increased cost of 50 percent over normal petrol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as food crops are replaced by biofuel production , the cost in carbon increases cost to the environment another bone of contention is the actual environmental impact of the new biofuel due to something called indirect land use .
this is essentially the consequence of changing the use of land in order to produce crops used in biofuel production .
as more arable land is used to produce biofuel , the increased land clearance to grow food crops has the knock-on effect of higher carbon emissions .
originally , the commission had anticipated enacting its directive 98/70 / ec , requiring member states to report on the greenhouse gas intensity of fuel and energy , starting on january 1 , 2011 .
according to the directive , suppliers are required to gradually reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent by the end of 2020 at the latest .
but shortly before the january kick-off date for the initiative , the european commission published a report on indirect land use change related to biofuels .
it found that the ramifications of indirect land use required more investigation before it could proceed with the directive .
" the potential effects of indirect land use need to be properly weighed in our biofuels policy .
it is in our interest to investigate this seriously and ensure legislation that avoids negative side effects , " energy commissioner guenther oettinger said .
the result of its findings led the commission to delay its biofuel directive until july of 2011 .
in germany , however , the bmu claims that many of the required elements for biofuel production are locally and sustainably grown .

in 1806 , hegel described him as an iconic " world-soul , " and even his enemies could not quite shake off the fascination for the emperor who at first seemed to be invincible .
but poets and artists of his time also portrayed napoleon as a heartless warmonger , a ridiculous caricature , and even as satan 's eldest son .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show examines the emperor from various angles in " napoleon and europe , dream and trauma " the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany takes on napoleon in the context of his time .
the exhibition gives visitors with a critical and multifaceted look at a challenging topic .
the historic exhibition was done in cooperation with the musee de l 'armee in paris , where it will be shown in the spring of 2012 .
it will be the first comprehensive exhibition about napoleon in france for over 40 years .
" up to now in france , it 's been quite impossible to have a reasonable point of view about napoleon , " robert bresse , director of the musee de l 'armee , told deutsche welle .
" so , it 's really important to have an exhibition in paris that was built outside of france . "
master of propaganda as one of the exhibition 's 12 chapters illuminates , napoleon was a master of image cultivation and propaganda through artworks such as busts and paintings .
and napoleon 's image continues to be influenced by propaganda , the exhibit 's curator says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : napoleon 's myth lives on in marlon brando 's mantle from the movie desiree " part of the exhibition is the coronation mantle marlon brando wore when he played napoleon , revealing how much the official iconography of napoleon 's time has been passed on by film history and our popular culture , " said benedicte savoy , curator of the exhibition .
and , of course , there were napoleon 's wars .
his ambitious plans to unify europe under his command resulted in strategic triumphs , such as the battle of the three emperors in 1805 .
but they also led to his disastrous defeat and eventual downfall after the battle of waterloo in 1815 .
a generation of veterans other exhibitions have dealt thoroughly with the millions of victims who were killed in the napoleonic wars .
but ' napoleon and europe ' takes a closer look at the survivors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a living example of napoleon 's soldiers at the museum in bonn " nobody thinks of those who were wounded , " angelica francke , director of the exhibition , told deutsche welle .
" but those people , the veterans , were present in the streets for decades after napoleon was exiled .
so we dedicate a part of the exhibition to them . "
napoleon 's influence remains a part of europe up to the present day .
the exhibit shows how he implemented new standards like the metric system , connected european cities through a system of roads and telegraph lines , and , of course , introduced the napoleonic code , the civil rights opus still applied in france .
napoleon 's controversial impact on europe but napoleon 's impact on the face of europe was dark as well .
one part of the exhibit focuses one the theft of artworks from archives and museums of the conquered regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the young emperor : napoleon age 27 however , even this systematic theft has more than one side to it , according to erich pelzer , a historian at the university of mannheim .
" napoleon is never one-dimensional , he 's always controversial , " pelzer told deutsche welle .
" many artworks that could n't be stored in the louvre were redistributed to other european cities , helping a new ' europe of culture ' to emerge .
in fact , the theft of archives reflects a core phenomenon of napoleon : he creates something new without changing the actual substance , " pelzer said . napoleon 's impact on europe remains as controversial as napoleon himself .
and by taking a pan-european approach to its subject , the exhibition " napoleon and europe " offers a variety of new insights .

the most recent is pirateleaks.cz , launched by the czech pirate party . in the aftermath of the latest releases of information of secret documents by the infamous wikileaks , a crop of clones have popped up in europe .
one has been seeded by ex-wikileaks staffers , others were simply inspired by the original , but all of them want to make a difference .
wikileaks clones include the forthcoming openleaks in germany , with former wikileaks staffer , daniel domscheit-berg at the helm .
openleaks aims to democratize the process of leaking information and whistle-blowing and support the introduction of new legislation defending the rights of whistle-blowers .
other such websites include brusselsleaks.com , balkanleaks.eu , rospil.info and indoleaks.org , each hoping to blow the lid on corruption and secret documents in the european union , the balkans , russia and indonesia respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other sites , such as openleaks in germany plan to tackle transparency pirates of the czech republic in a café in prague , the public face of another secret whistle-blowing website demonstrated such a product to deutsche welle .
the czech pirate party announced earlier this month that it had created a new secret-leaking site called pirateleaks and it aims to do the same thing as wikileaks , only focusing in the czech republic .
the aim of the site is to encourage transparency in czech government .
" our sources are people who work with documents in the authorities , are journalists who are afraid to publish these documents because of political reasons , and are simply members of the public , " spokesman jakub michalek said .
the creators of pirateleaks will be hoping all those sources supply them with evidence of corruption .
the small amount of information released since this week 's launch has n't exactly rocked the czech political establishment – though the site has ruffled a few feathers , michalek added .
" the politicians are afraid to say that this is a bad thing , because we are working exactly in accordance with the law , " he said . " but on the other side there were also reactions like , ' this is outrageous , this should be banned , the site should be closed immediately . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirateleaks.cz wants to fight corruption within czech government members of the media who have been reporting on corruption within the czech republic welcomed the new site .
" i think it 's very good that we have another source of information , one that is setting as its goal finding documents that are normally not available , " prague-based journalist erik best told deutsche welle .
" and i think with the impetus , with the excitement in the west and all over the world with wikileaks , that connection is going to be a big benefit for the site . "
data protection in sweden pirateleaks next goal is to locate its servers in sweden , with either a fellow pirate organization or prq , the same hosting service that maintains wikileaks ' servers there .
prq prides itself on requiring hardly any personal information from its clients .
" we would like to move to sweden or a different place that is much safer , as soon as possible , " michalek said .
" because the services that we can get in sweden with a pirate isp , or the prq company , are much better , we can get a safer connection .
things can be with more anonymity than we can get here in the czech republic . "

the most recent is pirateleaks.cz , launched by the czech pirate party . in the aftermath of the latest releases of information of secret documents by the infamous wikileaks , a crop of clones have popped up in europe .
one has been seeded by ex-wikileaks staffers , others were simply inspired by the original , but all of them want to make a difference .
wikileaks clones include the forthcoming openleaks in germany , with former wikileaks staffer , daniel domscheit-berg at the helm .
openleaks aims to democratize the process of leaking information and whistle-blowing and support the introduction of new legislation defending the rights of whistle-blowers .
other such websites include brusselsleaks.com , balkanleaks.eu , rospil.info and indoleaks.org , each hoping to blow the lid on corruption and secret documents in the european union , the balkans , russia and indonesia respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other sites , such as openleaks in germany plan to tackle transparency pirates of the czech republic in a café in prague , the public face of another secret whistle-blowing website demonstrated such a product to deutsche welle .
the czech pirate party announced earlier this month that it had created a new secret-leaking site called pirateleaks and it aims to do the same thing as wikileaks , only focusing in the czech republic .
the aim of the site is to encourage transparency in czech government .
" our sources are people who work with documents in the authorities , are journalists who are afraid to publish these documents because of political reasons , and are simply members of the public , " spokesman jakub michalek said .
the creators of pirateleaks will be hoping all those sources supply them with evidence of corruption .
the small amount of information released since this week 's launch has n't exactly rocked the czech political establishment – though the site has ruffled a few feathers , michalek added .
" the politicians are afraid to say that this is a bad thing , because we are working exactly in accordance with the law , " he said . " but on the other side there were also reactions like , ' this is outrageous , this should be banned , the site should be closed immediately . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirateleaks.cz wants to fight corruption within czech government members of the media who have been reporting on corruption within the czech republic welcomed the new site .
" i think it 's very good that we have another source of information , one that is setting as its goal finding documents that are normally not available , " prague-based journalist erik best told deutsche welle .
" and i think with the impetus , with the excitement in the west and all over the world with wikileaks , that connection is going to be a big benefit for the site . "
data protection in sweden pirateleaks next goal is to locate its servers in sweden , with either a fellow pirate organization or prq , the same hosting service that maintains wikileaks ' servers there .
prq prides itself on requiring hardly any personal information from its clients .
" we would like to move to sweden or a different place that is much safer , as soon as possible , " michalek said .
" because the services that we can get in sweden with a pirate isp , or the prq company , are much better , we can get a safer connection .
things can be with more anonymity than we can get here in the czech republic . "

moscow said claims of selective justice were " unacceptable . " russia has reacted to criticism over monday 's new guilty verdict against the jailed former oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky by telling the european union and the united states to stay out of its affairs . " we expect everyone to mind his own business , both at home and in the international arena , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" attempts to put pressure on the proceedings are unacceptable , " the ministry said , using unusually blunt language for a diplomatic statement .
khodorkovsky was convicted on monday of stealing oil from his former company , yukos , between 1999 and 2003 and laundering the proceeds .
the conviction drew international criticism , with the united states saying it was " deeply concerned " about the " selective application of justice . "
germany said the verdict was a step backwards for russia , while france called for the rule of law to be respected .

his jail term was due to expire in 2011 .
khodorkovsky is an outspoken opponent of russian prime minister vladimir putin , who was the country 's president when khodorkovsky was initially convicted .
the new prison sentence could put him behind bars beyond the 2012 presidential elections .
if the court follows the prosecutors ' calls , he could stay in jail until 2017 .
vladimir putin is widely expected to run again for the presidency in 2012 .
he served two terms in that office , from 2000 to 2008 .
the constitution barred him from serving a third , consecutive term .
however , from 2012 putin could again serve as president for another two terms .

in the last of a three-part series , dw examines the country 's decision to deploy its military in afghanistan , and the ' warlike conditions ' there . a political shockwave reverberated across the atlantic ocean after islamic terrorists razed the world trade center and part of the pentagon on september 11 , 2001 .
in keeping with germany 's responsibility as a nato member , chancellor gerhard schroeder declared unlimited solidarity with a wounded america .
schroeder 's declaration carried sweeping military consequences for germany .
only three years after his left-of-center coalition had participated in nato 's air war against serbia , he deployed soldiers for an ambitious stabilization mission in war-torn afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schroeder showed solidarity with the us in sending troops .
germany 's stabilization mission looked increasingly like a counterinsurgency as its soldiers faced a resurgent taliban .
and in september 2009 , tensions came to a head when a german colonel ordered an airstrike against two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the strike killed 142 people , laying bare the realities of the afghan conflict for the german public .
after years of whitewashing the conflict in afghanistan , berlin has been forced to acknowledge that its soldiers are fighting and dying under " warlike conditions . "
germany can never again claim that it will never wage war .
solidarity among allies in the days following september 11 , germany rallied behind the united states as the bush administration assembled a military coalition to retaliate against the perpetrators of the attacks in new york and washington d.c.
" initially , operation enduring freedom was mandated through the united nations while nato invoked article 5 for the first time , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who served as deputy foreign minister at that time .
" the usa had been attacked and article 5 required germany to make a contribution . "
but germany 's support for america went beyond legal obligations , according to volmer .
many germans felt a deep emotional bond with their historical ally , creating a political climate in which participation in an offensive military campaign could be openly discussed .
" the german people made spontaneous displays of solidarity with the american people , " volmer said .
" many germans said the americans helped us against hitler and protected us during the cold war and now we have to return the favor . "
this solidarity ran into obstacles on the political front , however .
although the german military had participated in the kosovo war of 1999 , anxiety about military force remained deeply rooted in the national psyche .
many social democrats and greens worried that germany would be dragged into an open ended , global war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years , flag-draped caskets began returning to germany but in a political power play , schroeder tied parliament 's vote on operation enduring freedom with a vote of confidence .
if antiwar skeptics among the social democrats and greens voted against the war , they would also be voting against their own government .
faced with the choice of political influence or principle , most social democrats and greens closed ranks and threw their confidence behind their coalition government .
the resolution passed , allocating 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom and saving the government from collapse . mixed message as the united states waged war in pursuit of the perpetrators of september 11 , the international community designed a stabilization force to ease the impact of the conflict on civilians .
" the next step in the discussion was to demand that the military strikes not be directed against the afghan people , " volmer said .
" instead , the afghans should benefit from the intervention . "
while oef had been tasked with rooting out the taliban and al-qaeda , the international security assistance force would seek to create a secure environment in which afghanistan could build a postwar future for itself .
berlin sought to keep oef and isaf - war and stabilization - clearly separated from one another with an emphasis on putting isaf in the lead .
" that again has to do with history , " said karl lamers , former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats . " we do n't do war .
we conduct other actions that demand the use of force . "
but berlin 's policy began to send mixed messages .
in 2004 , german soldiers set up shop in the northern afghan city of kunduz , where they assisted civilian reconstruction efforts .
however , they became increasingly entangled in ambushes , mortar attacks and running gun battles as the taliban made a comeback .
the distinction between stabilization and war had become blurred .
as the years passed , flag-draped caskets returned home , and terrorists increasingly targeted europe , the justification for the mission became more self-assertive .
slowly , german defense experts began to take ownership of the conflict by identifying it as being in the national interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz strike killed 142 and left many wounded in hospitals " later we recognized what defense minister -lrb- peter -rrb- struck had pointed out : we are also defending germany 's security on the hindu kush , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert within the social democratic party .
" this view was supported by the attacks in london and madrid and through the clear fact that there 's something like a home-grown but foreign-trained terrorism that threatens us all . "
acts of war in september of 2009 , the simmering security situation in northern afghanistan boiled over .
colonel georg klein , commander of the german soldiers in kunduz , ordered american bombers to eliminate two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the airstrike killed 142 people .
many of the dead were civilians .
klein defended his order by claiming that he had believed the tankers would be used as an explosive device against his soldiers .
however , the subsequent investigation by isaf indicated that klein targeted the people , not the tanker itself .
local taliban leaders may have been among the crowd .
a german officer had launched a preemptive strike against a perceived threat orchestrated by a human enemy .
germany had waged war in front of the entire international community .
a half truth in the aftermath of the kunduz bombing , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg acknowledged that the german army was operating under " warlike conditions . "
and after three soldiers died in a taliban ambush in april of 2010 , chancellor angela merkel made a similar admission .
during the nationally televised memorial service for the fallen , merkel expressed understanding for soldiers who said they were fighting in a war .
so what do observers think of politicians ' attempts to find a label just short of ' war ' for the unconventional conflict in afghanistan ?
according to lamers , it 's a legal sideshow - one that began with the debate over the gulf war , raged during the yugoslavia crisis , and has been partially exposed by the kunduz airstrike .
military force - however it may be labeled by the political establishment - is now a regular and tolerated feature of german foreign policy .
germany no longer faces a national historical dilemma of whether it can use force at all .
rather , it has returned to history and once again confronts the broader human question : under what circumstances is military force justified ?
" it 's a question for all of us that nobody can definitively answer yet , but which we have to discuss intensively with one another , " lamers said .
" how do we position ourselves in a world where there are still cases like afghanistan ?
how do we deal with that ?
do we just say that we ca n't do anything about it ?
or if we can do something , what exactly should we do ? "
considering its tainted history , germany will have to be especially careful in its search for an answer .

this has triggered a copyright discussion in germany . german copyright rules require anyone who copies sheet music pay fees to germany 's music licensing agency , gema .
the organization has begun notifying kindergartens and other preschool facilities that if they reproduce music to be sung or performed , they must pay for a license .
" if a preschool wants to make its own copy of certain music - if the words of a song or the musical score is copied - then they need to buy a license , " gema spokesperson peter hempel told deutsche welle .
the rules have been in place for 25 years , but they have only recently drawn attention .
gema began at the beginning of 2010 to send out reminders to daycare centers stressing that they need to sign contracts before making copies of sheet music for the children to sing from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if copies of music are made , the fee needs to be paid gema said that the need for licenses would not have any effect on singing in kindergartens .
" it does n't cost anything to sing in kindergartens , " said peter hempel .
" if a kindergarten or school does not make any copies of music , then of course they do n't need to pay anything . "
traditional songs are copyright-free the copyright rules only concern the rights for modern songs .
songs written by an author who has been dead for over 70 years are automatically in the public domain .
" for old songs , for traditional folk songs for example , it costs nothing , " said hempel .

but now they have to pay for a license if they want children to perform certain songs . a tightening of copyright rules means kindergartens now have to pay fees to germany 's music licensing agency , gema , to use songs that they reproduce and perform .
the organization has begun notifying creches and other daycare facilities that if they reproduce music to be sung or performed , they must pay for a license .
" if a preschool wants to make its own copy of certain music - if the words of a song or the musical score is copied - then they need to buy a license , " gema spokesperson peter hempel told deutsche welle .
the new rules came into power at the beginning of this year , but have only recently drawn attention as daycare centers have received letters reminding them that they need to sign contracts with gema before distributing sheet music to children to sing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if copies of music are made , the fee needs to be paid gema said that the need for licenses would not have any effect on singing in kindergartens .
" it does n't cost anything to sing in kindergartens , " said peter hempel .
" if a school does not make any copies of music , then of course they do n't need to pay anything . "
traditional songs are copyright-free the copyright rules only concern the rights for modern songs .
songs written by an author who has been dead for over 70 years are automatically in the public domain .
" for old songs , for traditional folk songs for example , it costs nothing , " said hempel .

in the last of a three-part series , dw examines the country 's decision to deploy its military in afghanistan , and the ' warlike conditions ' there . a political shockwave reverberated across the atlantic ocean after islamic terrorists razed the world trade center and part of the pentagon on september 11 , 2001 .
in keeping with germany 's responsibility as a nato member , chancellor gerhard schroeder declared unlimited solidarity with a wounded america .
schroeder 's declaration carried sweeping military consequences for germany .
only three years after his left-of-center coalition had participated in nato 's air war against serbia , he deployed soldiers for an ambitious stabilization mission in war-torn afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schroeder showed solidarity with the us in sending troops .
germany 's stabilization mission looked increasingly like a counterinsurgency as its soldiers faced a resurgent taliban .
and in september 2009 , tensions came to a head when a german colonel ordered an airstrike against two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the strike killed 142 people , laying bare the realities of the afghan conflict for the german public .
after years of whitewashing the conflict in afghanistan , berlin has been forced to acknowledge that its soldiers are fighting and dying under " warlike conditions . "
germany can never again claim that it will never wage war .
solidarity among allies in the days following september 11 , germany rallied behind the united states as the bush administration assembled a military coalition to retaliate against the perpetrators of the attacks in new york and washington d.c.
" initially , operation enduring freedom was mandated through the united nations while nato invoked article 5 for the first time , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who served as deputy foreign minister at that time .
" the usa had been attacked and article 5 required germany to make a contribution . "
but germany 's support for america went beyond legal obligations , according to volmer .
many germans felt a deep emotional bond with their historical ally , creating a political climate in which participation in an offensive military campaign could be openly discussed .
" the german people made spontaneous displays of solidarity with the american people , " volmer said .
" many germans said the americans helped us against hitler and protected us during the cold war and now we have to return the favor . "
this solidarity ran into obstacles on the political front , however .
although the german military had participated in the kosovo war of 1999 , anxiety about military force remained deeply rooted in the national psyche .
many social democrats and greens worried that germany would be dragged into an open ended , global war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years , flag-draped caskets began returning to germany but in a political power play , schroeder tied parliament 's vote on operation enduring freedom with a vote of confidence .
if antiwar skeptics among the social democrats and greens voted against the war , they would also be voting against their own government .
faced with the choice of political influence or principle , most social democrats and greens closed ranks and threw their confidence behind their coalition government .
the resolution passed , allocating 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom and saving the government from collapse . mixed message as the united states waged war in pursuit of the perpetrators of september 11 , the international community designed a stabilization force to ease the impact of the conflict on civilians .
" the next step in the discussion was to demand that the military strikes not be directed against the afghan people , " volmer said .
" instead , the afghans should benefit from the intervention . "
while oef had been tasked with rooting out the taliban and al-qaeda , the international security assistance force would seek to create a secure environment in which afghanistan could build a postwar future for itself .
berlin sought to keep oef and isaf - war and stabilization - clearly separated from one another with an emphasis on putting isaf in the lead .
" that again has to do with history , " said karl lamers , former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats . " we do n't do war .
we conduct other actions that demand the use of force . "
but berlin 's policy began to send mixed messages .
in 2004 , german soldiers set up shop in the northern afghan city of kunduz , where they assisted civilian reconstruction efforts .
however , they became increasingly entangled in ambushes , mortar attacks and running gun battles as the taliban made a comeback .
the distinction between stabilization and war had become blurred .
as the years passed , flag-draped caskets returned home , and terrorists increasingly targeted europe , the justification for the mission became more self-assertive .
slowly , german defense experts began to take ownership of the conflict by identifying it as being in the national interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz strike killed 142 and left many wounded in hospitals " later we recognized what defense minister -lrb- peter -rrb- struck had pointed out : we are also defending germany 's security on the hindu kush , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert within the social democratic party .
" this view was supported by the attacks in london and madrid and through the clear fact that there 's something like a home-grown but foreign-trained terrorism that threatens us all . "
acts of war in september of 2009 , the simmering security situation in northern afghanistan boiled over .
colonel georg klein , commander of the german soldiers in kunduz , ordered american bombers to eliminate two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the airstrike killed 142 people .
many of the dead were civilians .
klein defended his order by claiming that he had believed the tankers would be used as an explosive device against his soldiers .
however , the subsequent investigation by isaf indicated that klein targeted the people , not the tanker itself .
local taliban leaders may have been among the crowd .
a german officer had launched a preemptive strike against a perceived threat orchestrated by a human enemy .
germany had waged war in front of the entire international community .
a half truth in the aftermath of the kunduz bombing , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg acknowledged that the german army was operating under " warlike conditions . "
and after three soldiers died in a taliban ambush in april of 2010 , chancellor angela merkel made a similar admission .
during the nationally televised memorial service for the fallen , merkel expressed understanding for soldiers who said they were fighting in a war .
so what do observers think of politicians ' attempts to find a label just short of ' war ' for the unconventional conflict in afghanistan ?
according to lamers , it 's a legal sideshow - one that began with the debate over the gulf war , raged during the yugoslavia crisis , and has been partially exposed by the kunduz airstrike .
military force - however it may be labeled by the political establishment - is now a regular and tolerated feature of german foreign policy .
germany no longer faces a national historical dilemma of whether it can use force at all .
rather , it has returned to history and once again confronts the broader human question : under what circumstances is military force justified ?
" it 's a question for all of us that nobody can definitively answer yet , but which we have to discuss intensively with one another , " lamers said .
" how do we position ourselves in a world where there are still cases like afghanistan ?
how do we deal with that ?
do we just say that we ca n't do anything about it ?
or if we can do something , what exactly should we do ? "
considering its tainted history , germany will have to be especially careful in its search for an answer .

there are no easy answers but experts agree on one thing – climate education is in dire need of improvement . everyone is talking about climate change .
in recent years , global warming has been the subject of extensive research , press reports and conferences .
following the un climate summit in mexico earlier this month , the environmental question of the century would appear to be widely understood .
but impressions can be deceptive , and as a recent eu commission survey revealed , one quarter of europeans are climate skeptics .
almost half admit that they are inadequately informed about global warming .
“ there is broad superficial understanding , but to probe a little deeper is to reveal great gaps in the public knowledge , ” udo kuckartz of the university of marburg said .
“ we need new models for climate education , new approaches which turn environmental knowledge into environmental action . ”
from knowledge to action that leads to an important question - how can teachers address climate change in classrooms in a way that actually leads people to change their behavior and switch to a low-carbon lifestyle ?
educators and psychologists all over the globe are currently seeking answers to that question .
and in order to find them , they first need to establish which teaching models are already in use and which of them have proved successful in schools , universities and in further education .
bildunterschrift : learning by doing : children plant trees in flood-prone bangladesh gerhard de haan , a professor at the free university in berlin , says the greatest range of learning opportunities is in adult education .
he stresses the importance of grant programs , such as the one run by the humboldt foundation to encourage young researchers from developing and emerging nations to spend a year working on climate and energy projects at german universities .
“ such approaches are particularly effective because they are aimed at disseminators and come at it from an economic angle , ” de haan said .
“ foundations , companies and governments ought to offer many more grant programs . ”
udo kuckartz says there are already some signs that that is the way things are going .
“ there has been a lot of progress , often from large companies , ” he said .
but it is not only private enterprises that are seizing the initiative .
sometimes , as in the case of denmark which staged the un climate conference at the end of last year , governments offer grants to encourage foreign students to come to their country and learn about wind power or environmental engineering or chemistry .
new environmental programs over the past decade , kuckartz says , there 's been a huge increase in the number of environment related courses .
most , however , focus on climate and energy issues .
“ they are almost always scientific or environmental management programs , ” he said , adding that there are few which look at the issues from a sociological point of view .
two exceptions are a program about environment and education , at the rostock university in eastern germany , and another at berlin 's freie university , which looks at research in the future .
bildunterschrift : games are one way of teaching kids the links between climate change and species protection gerhard de haan believes schools could and should be doing more to enhance a general level of understanding of the issues surrounding climate change among children .
he points out that climate change is usually addressed only in geography classes in germany but says that it is actually “ increasingly being marginalized . ”
and in subjects such as biology , politics or social studies , teachers are by no means obliged to include climate issues and sustainability in the curriculum .
that partly has to do with germany 's federal structure in which each of the 16 states determine the content of the education they offer .
but that 's not the only reason .
experts say teachers themselves are not taught enough about climate issues during their own training .
in some places , there are regional initiatives which promote climate education in school and therefore try to get teachers up to speed .
a group of charities has teamed up with the german government to launch a further education program for teachers from the states of hesse , saarland and rhineland-palatinate .
but such schemes , which are often backed by unesco , are rare .
“ they only reach a maximum of five percent of schools , ” kuckartz said .
us the model for climate reporting the shortcomings on addressing climate change are n't just confined to the classrooms .
the media too are to blame .
experts say journalists - the main conduits for climate information reaching the masses – could also do with greater training in environmental issues .
unlike america , there are few universities and journalism schools in europe that offer courses on climate reporting .
across the atlantic , the picture is altogether more rounded ; there are already a number of environmental journalism programs on offer , and the society of environmental journalists -lrb- sej -rrb- is constantly working towards improving the standard of reporting on the subject .
that said , things are slowly improving in europe too .
programs such as deutsche welle 's annual global media forum in bonn is the largest european event of its kind .
its aim is to help journalists deepen their knowledge and sharpen their skills on issues surrounding global climate change .

the most recent is pirateleaks.cz , launched by the czech pirate party . in the aftermath of the latest releases of information of secret documents by the infamous wikileaks , a crop of clones have popped up in europe .
one has been seeded by ex-wikileaks staffers , others were simply inspired by the original , but all of them want to make a difference .
wikileaks clones include the forthcoming openleaks in germany , with former wikileaks staffer , daniel domscheit-berg at the helm .
openleaks aims to democratize the process of leaking information and whistle-blowing and support the introduction of new legislation defending the rights of whistle-blowers .
other such websites include brusselsleaks.com , balkanleaks.eu , rospil.info and indoleaks.org , each hoping to blow the lid on corruption and secret documents in the european union , the balkans , russia and indonesia respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other sites , such as openleaks in germany plan to tackle transparency pirates of the czech republic in a café in prague , the public face of another secret whistle-blowing website demonstrated such a product to deutsche welle .
the czech pirate party announced earlier this month that it had created a new secret-leaking site called pirateleaks and it aims to do the same thing as wikileaks , only focusing in the czech republic .
the aim of the site is to encourage transparency in czech government .
" our sources are people who work with documents in the authorities , are journalists who are afraid to publish these documents because of political reasons , and are simply members of the public , " spokesman jakub michalek said .
the creators of pirateleaks will be hoping all those sources supply them with evidence of corruption .
the small amount of information released since this week 's launch has n't exactly rocked the czech political establishment – though the site has ruffled a few feathers , michalek added .
" the politicians are afraid to say that this is a bad thing , because we are working exactly in accordance with the law , " he said . " but on the other side there were also reactions like , ' this is outrageous , this should be banned , the site should be closed immediately . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirateleaks.cz wants to fight corruption within czech government members of the media who have been reporting on corruption within the czech republic welcomed the new site .
" i think it 's very good that we have another source of information , one that is setting as its goal finding documents that are normally not available , " prague-based journalist erik best told deutsche welle .
" and i think with the impetus , with the excitement in the west and all over the world with wikileaks , that connection is going to be a big benefit for the site . "
data protection in sweden pirateleaks next goal is to locate its servers in sweden , with either a fellow pirate organization or prq , the same hosting service that maintains wikileaks ' servers there .
prq prides itself on requiring hardly any personal information from its clients .
" we would like to move to sweden or a different place that is much safer , as soon as possible , " michalek said .
" because the services that we can get in sweden with a pirate isp , or the prq company , are much better , we can get a safer connection .
things can be with more anonymity than we can get here in the czech republic . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 28.12.2010 wikileaks clones popping up in europe and beyond großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks ' recent releases have inspired more activists the perceived successes of wikileaks have catalyzed would-be whistle-blowers to launch their own crusades for transparency .
the most recent is pirateleaks.cz , launched by the czech pirate party . in the aftermath of the latest releases of information of secret documents by the infamous wikileaks , a crop of clones have popped up in europe .
one has been seeded by ex-wikileaks staffers , others were simply inspired by the original , but all of them want to make a difference .
wikileaks clones include the forthcoming openleaks in germany , with former wikileaks staffer , daniel domscheit-berg at the helm .
openleaks aims to democratize the process of leaking information and whistle-blowing and support the introduction of new legislation defending the rights of whistle-blowers .
other such websites include brusselsleaks.com , balkanleaks.eu , rospil.info and indoleaks.org , each hoping to blow the lid on corruption and secret documents in the european union , the balkans , russia and indonesia respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other sites , such as openleaks in germany plan to tackle transparency pirates of the czech republic in a café in prague , the public face of another secret whistle-blowing website demonstrated such a product to deutsche welle .
the czech pirate party announced earlier this month that it had created a new secret-leaking site called pirateleaks and it aims to do the same thing as wikileaks , only focusing in the czech republic .
the aim of the site is to encourage transparency in czech government .
" our sources are people who work with documents in the authorities , are journalists who are afraid to publish these documents because of political reasons , and are simply members of the public , " spokesman jakub michalek said .
the creators of pirateleaks will be hoping all those sources supply them with evidence of corruption .
the small amount of information released since this week 's launch has n't exactly rocked the czech political establishment – though the site has ruffled a few feathers , michalek added .
" the politicians are afraid to say that this is a bad thing , because we are working exactly in accordance with the law , " he said . " but on the other side there were also reactions like , ' this is outrageous , this should be banned , the site should be closed immediately . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirateleaks.cz wants to fight corruption within czech government members of the media who have been reporting on corruption within the czech republic welcomed the new site .
" i think it 's very good that we have another source of information , one that is setting as its goal finding documents that are normally not available , " prague-based journalist erik best told deutsche welle .
" and i think with the impetus , with the excitement in the west and all over the world with wikileaks , that connection is going to be a big benefit for the site . "
data protection in sweden pirateleaks next goal is to locate its servers in sweden , with either a fellow pirate organization or prq , the same hosting service that maintains wikileaks ' servers there .
prq prides itself on requiring hardly any personal information from its clients .
" we would like to move to sweden or a different place that is much safer , as soon as possible , " michalek said .
" because the services that we can get in sweden with a pirate isp , or the prq company , are much better , we can get a safer connection .
things can be with more anonymity than we can get here in the czech republic . "

moscow said claims of selective justice were " unacceptable . " russia has reacted to criticism over monday 's new guilty verdict against the jailed former oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky by telling the european union and the united states to stay out of its affairs . " we expect everyone to mind his own business , both at home and in the international arena , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" attempts to put pressure on the proceedings are unacceptable , " the ministry said , using unusually blunt language for a diplomatic statement .
khodorkovsky was convicted on monday of stealing oil from his former company , yukos , between 1999 and 2003 and laundering the proceeds .
the conviction drew international criticism , with the united states saying it was " deeply concerned " about the " selective application of justice . "
germany said the verdict was a step backwards for russia , while france called for the rule of law to be respected .
khodorkovsky vs putin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and khodorkovsky are seen as personal rivals critics and human rights activists regard the trial as having been politically motivated .
they say the aim is to sideline khodorkovsky because he financed opposition parties . once the richest man in russia , he was convicted of fraud in 2003 and sentenced to prison .
his jail term was due to expire in 2011 .
khodorkovsky is an outspoken opponent of russian prime minister vladimir putin , who was the country 's president when khodorkovsky was initially convicted .
the new prison sentence could put him behind bars beyond the 2012 presidential elections .
if the court follows the prosecutors ' calls , he could stay in jail until 2017 .
vladimir putin is widely expected to run again for the presidency in 2012 .
he served two terms in that office , from 2000 to 2008 .
the constitution barred him from serving a third , consecutive term .
however , from 2012 putin could again serve as president for another two terms .
full verdict expected by friday the reading of the full verdict is ongoing and expected to be completed by the end of the week , at the earliest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as yukos chief , khodorkovsky was the richest man in russia khodorkovsky 's defense team suggested the verdict would be pronounced on friday .
as the first 10 days of january are vacation days in russia , no newspapers will be published that could question the court 's impartiality . in a statement released on khodorkovsky 's website , he and his co-defendant , platon lebedev , thanked their supporters for protesting outside the court building .
" power without law is a stool without a leg .
it looks silly and its prospects are predictable , " the statement said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 28.12.2010 franco-german exhibition highlights napoleon 's ambiguous glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many faces of the emperor : napoleon in his coronation garment a new exhibition at a national museum in bonn takes on the myth of napoleon with a critical and multifaceted approach , revealing the complexity of napoleon and his time . a world of opinions exists about napoleon and his time , and that has always been the case .
in 1806 , hegel described him as an iconic " world-soul , " and even his enemies could not quite shake off the fascination for the emperor who at first seemed to be invincible .
but poets and artists of his time also portrayed napoleon as a heartless warmonger , a ridiculous caricature , and even as satan 's eldest son .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show examines the emperor from various angles in " napoleon and europe , dream and trauma " the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany takes on napoleon in the context of his time .
the exhibition gives visitors with a critical and multifaceted look at a challenging topic .
the historic exhibition was done in cooperation with the musee de l 'armee in paris , where it will be shown in the spring of 2012 .
it will be the first comprehensive exhibition about napoleon in france for over 40 years .
" up to now in france , it 's been quite impossible to have a reasonable point of view about napoleon , " robert bresse , director of the musee de l 'armee , told deutsche welle .
" so , it 's really important to have an exhibition in paris that was built outside of france . "
master of propaganda as one of the exhibition 's 12 chapters illuminates , napoleon was a master of image cultivation and propaganda through artworks such as busts and paintings .
and napoleon 's image continues to be influenced by propaganda , the exhibit 's curator says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : napoleon 's myth lives on in marlon brando 's mantle from the movie desiree " part of the exhibition is the coronation mantle marlon brando wore when he played napoleon , revealing how much the official iconography of napoleon 's time has been passed on by film history and our popular culture , " said benedicte savoy , curator of the exhibition .
and , of course , there were napoleon 's wars .
his ambitious plans to unify europe under his command resulted in strategic triumphs , such as the battle of the three emperors in 1805 .
but they also led to his disastrous defeat and eventual downfall after the battle of waterloo in 1815 .
a generation of veterans other exhibitions have dealt thoroughly with the millions of victims who were killed in the napoleonic wars .
but ' napoleon and europe ' takes a closer look at the survivors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a living example of napoleon 's soldiers at the museum in bonn " nobody thinks of those who were wounded , " angelica francke , director of the exhibition , told deutsche welle .
" but those people , the veterans , were present in the streets for decades after napoleon was exiled .
so we dedicate a part of the exhibition to them . "
napoleon 's influence remains a part of europe up to the present day .
the exhibit shows how he implemented new standards like the metric system , connected european cities through a system of roads and telegraph lines , and , of course , introduced the napoleonic code , the civil rights opus still applied in france .

in 1806 , hegel described him as an iconic " world-soul , " and even his enemies could not quite shake off the fascination for the emperor who at first seemed to be invincible .
but poets and artists of his time also portrayed napoleon as a heartless warmonger , a ridiculous caricature , and even as satan 's eldest son .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show examines the emperor from various angles in " napoleon and europe , dream and trauma " the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany takes on napoleon in the context of his time .
the exhibition gives visitors with a critical and multifaceted look at a challenging topic .
the historic exhibition was done in cooperation with the musee de l 'armee in paris , where it will be shown in the spring of 2012 .
it will be the first comprehensive exhibition about napoleon in france for over 40 years .
" up to now in france , it 's been quite impossible to have a reasonable point of view about napoleon , " robert bresse , director of the musee de l 'armee , told deutsche welle .
" so , it 's really important to have an exhibition in paris that was built outside of france . "
master of propaganda as one of the exhibition 's 12 chapters illuminates , napoleon was a master of image cultivation and propaganda through artworks such as busts and paintings .
and napoleon 's image continues to be influenced by propaganda , the exhibit 's curator says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : napoleon 's myth lives on in marlon brando 's mantle from the movie desiree " part of the exhibition is the coronation mantle marlon brando wore when he played napoleon , revealing how much the official iconography of napoleon 's time has been passed on by film history and our popular culture , " said benedicte savoy , curator of the exhibition .
and , of course , there were napoleon 's wars .
his ambitious plans to unify europe under his command resulted in strategic triumphs , such as the battle of the three emperors in 1805 .
but they also led to his disastrous defeat and eventual downfall after the battle of waterloo in 1815 .
a generation of veterans other exhibitions have dealt thoroughly with the millions of victims who were killed in the napoleonic wars .
but ' napoleon and europe ' takes a closer look at the survivors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a living example of napoleon 's soldiers at the museum in bonn " nobody thinks of those who were wounded , " angelica francke , director of the exhibition , told deutsche welle .
" but those people , the veterans , were present in the streets for decades after napoleon was exiled .
so we dedicate a part of the exhibition to them . "
napoleon 's influence remains a part of europe up to the present day .
the exhibit shows how he implemented new standards like the metric system , connected european cities through a system of roads and telegraph lines , and , of course , introduced the napoleonic code , the civil rights opus still applied in france .
napoleon 's controversial impact on europe but napoleon 's impact on the face of europe was dark as well .
one part of the exhibit focuses one the theft of artworks from archives and museums of the conquered regions .

in the last of a three-part series , dw examines the country 's decision to deploy its military in afghanistan , and the ' warlike conditions ' there . a political shockwave reverberated across the atlantic ocean after islamic terrorists razed the world trade center and part of the pentagon on september 11 , 2001 .
in keeping with germany 's responsibility as a nato member , chancellor gerhard schroeder declared unlimited solidarity with a wounded america .
schroeder 's declaration carried sweeping military consequences for germany .
only three years after his left-of-center coalition had participated in nato 's air war against serbia , he deployed soldiers for an ambitious stabilization mission in war-torn afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schroeder showed solidarity with the us in sending troops .
germany 's stabilization mission looked increasingly like a counterinsurgency as its soldiers faced a resurgent taliban .
and in september 2009 , tensions came to a head when a german colonel ordered an airstrike against two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the strike killed 142 people , laying bare the realities of the afghan conflict for the german public .
after years of whitewashing the conflict in afghanistan , berlin has been forced to acknowledge that its soldiers are fighting and dying under " warlike conditions . "
germany can never again claim that it will never wage war .
solidarity among allies in the days following september 11 , germany rallied behind the united states as the bush administration assembled a military coalition to retaliate against the perpetrators of the attacks in new york and washington d.c.
" initially , operation enduring freedom was mandated through the united nations while nato invoked article 5 for the first time , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who served as deputy foreign minister at that time .
" the usa had been attacked and article 5 required germany to make a contribution . "
but germany 's support for america went beyond legal obligations , according to volmer .
many germans felt a deep emotional bond with their historical ally , creating a political climate in which participation in an offensive military campaign could be openly discussed .
" the german people made spontaneous displays of solidarity with the american people , " volmer said .
" many germans said the americans helped us against hitler and protected us during the cold war and now we have to return the favor . "
this solidarity ran into obstacles on the political front , however .
although the german military had participated in the kosovo war of 1999 , anxiety about military force remained deeply rooted in the national psyche .
many social democrats and greens worried that germany would be dragged into an open ended , global war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years , flag-draped caskets began returning to germany but in a political power play , schroeder tied parliament 's vote on operation enduring freedom with a vote of confidence .
if antiwar skeptics among the social democrats and greens voted against the war , they would also be voting against their own government .
faced with the choice of political influence or principle , most social democrats and greens closed ranks and threw their confidence behind their coalition government .
the resolution passed , allocating 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom and saving the government from collapse . mixed message as the united states waged war in pursuit of the perpetrators of september 11 , the international community designed a stabilization force to ease the impact of the conflict on civilians .
" the next step in the discussion was to demand that the military strikes not be directed against the afghan people , " volmer said .
" instead , the afghans should benefit from the intervention . "
while oef had been tasked with rooting out the taliban and al-qaeda , the international security assistance force would seek to create a secure environment in which afghanistan could build a postwar future for itself .
berlin sought to keep oef and isaf - war and stabilization - clearly separated from one another with an emphasis on putting isaf in the lead .
" that again has to do with history , " said karl lamers , former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats . " we do n't do war .
we conduct other actions that demand the use of force . "
but berlin 's policy began to send mixed messages .
in 2004 , german soldiers set up shop in the northern afghan city of kunduz , where they assisted civilian reconstruction efforts .
however , they became increasingly entangled in ambushes , mortar attacks and running gun battles as the taliban made a comeback .
the distinction between stabilization and war had become blurred .
as the years passed , flag-draped caskets returned home , and terrorists increasingly targeted europe , the justification for the mission became more self-assertive .
slowly , german defense experts began to take ownership of the conflict by identifying it as being in the national interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz strike killed 142 and left many wounded in hospitals " later we recognized what defense minister -lrb- peter -rrb- struck had pointed out : we are also defending germany 's security on the hindu kush , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert within the social democratic party .
" this view was supported by the attacks in london and madrid and through the clear fact that there 's something like a home-grown but foreign-trained terrorism that threatens us all . "
acts of war in september of 2009 , the simmering security situation in northern afghanistan boiled over .
colonel georg klein , commander of the german soldiers in kunduz , ordered american bombers to eliminate two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the airstrike killed 142 people .
many of the dead were civilians .
klein defended his order by claiming that he had believed the tankers would be used as an explosive device against his soldiers .
however , the subsequent investigation by isaf indicated that klein targeted the people , not the tanker itself .
local taliban leaders may have been among the crowd .
a german officer had launched a preemptive strike against a perceived threat orchestrated by a human enemy .
germany had waged war in front of the entire international community .
a half truth in the aftermath of the kunduz bombing , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg acknowledged that the german army was operating under " warlike conditions . "
and after three soldiers died in a taliban ambush in april of 2010 , chancellor angela merkel made a similar admission .
during the nationally televised memorial service for the fallen , merkel expressed understanding for soldiers who said they were fighting in a war .
so what do observers think of politicians ' attempts to find a label just short of ' war ' for the unconventional conflict in afghanistan ?
according to lamers , it 's a legal sideshow - one that began with the debate over the gulf war , raged during the yugoslavia crisis , and has been partially exposed by the kunduz airstrike .
military force - however it may be labeled by the political establishment - is now a regular and tolerated feature of german foreign policy .
germany no longer faces a national historical dilemma of whether it can use force at all .
rather , it has returned to history and once again confronts the broader human question : under what circumstances is military force justified ?
" it 's a question for all of us that nobody can definitively answer yet , but which we have to discuss intensively with one another , " lamers said .
" how do we position ourselves in a world where there are still cases like afghanistan ?
how do we deal with that ?
do we just say that we ca n't do anything about it ?
or if we can do something , what exactly should we do ? "
considering its tainted history , germany will have to be especially careful in its search for an answer .

the organization has begun notifying kindergartens and other preschool facilities that if they reproduce music to be sung or performed , they must pay for a license .
" if a preschool wants to make its own copy of certain music - if the words of a song or the musical score is copied - then they need to buy a license , " gema spokesperson peter hempel told deutsche welle .
the rules have been in place for 25 years , but they have only recently drawn attention .
gema began at the beginning of 2010 to send out reminders to daycare centers stressing that they need to sign contracts before making copies of sheet music for the children to sing from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if copies of music are made , the fee needs to be paid gema said that the need for licenses would not have any effect on singing in kindergartens .
" it does n't cost anything to sing in kindergartens , " said peter hempel .
" if a kindergarten or school does not make any copies of music , then of course they do n't need to pay anything . "
traditional songs are copyright-free the copyright rules only concern the rights for modern songs .
songs written by an author who has been dead for over 70 years are automatically in the public domain .
" for old songs , for traditional folk songs for example , it costs nothing , " said hempel .
fees start at 56 euros -lrb- $ 74 -rrb- for 500 copies of a song , a rate charged annually , not per child .
gema - the german abbreviation stands for the society for musical performing and mechanical reproduction rights - exists to make sure that the intellectual property of musicians is protected .
it is the collection agent for another group , vg musikedition , which monitors copyright for musicians and distributes the profits from the licensing fees back to its members .

in the last of a three-part series , dw examines the country 's decision to deploy its military in afghanistan , and the ' warlike conditions ' there . a political shockwave reverberated across the atlantic ocean after islamic terrorists razed the world trade center and part of the pentagon on september 11 , 2001 .
in keeping with germany 's responsibility as a nato member , chancellor gerhard schroeder declared unlimited solidarity with a wounded america .
schroeder 's declaration carried sweeping military consequences for germany .
only three years after his left-of-center coalition had participated in nato 's air war against serbia , he deployed soldiers for an ambitious stabilization mission in war-torn afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schroeder showed solidarity with the us in sending troops .
germany 's stabilization mission looked increasingly like a counterinsurgency as its soldiers faced a resurgent taliban .
and in september 2009 , tensions came to a head when a german colonel ordered an airstrike against two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the strike killed 142 people , laying bare the realities of the afghan conflict for the german public .
after years of whitewashing the conflict in afghanistan , berlin has been forced to acknowledge that its soldiers are fighting and dying under " warlike conditions . "
germany can never again claim that it will never wage war .
solidarity among allies in the days following september 11 , germany rallied behind the united states as the bush administration assembled a military coalition to retaliate against the perpetrators of the attacks in new york and washington d.c.
" initially , operation enduring freedom was mandated through the united nations while nato invoked article 5 for the first time , " said ludger volmer , former chairman of the green party who served as deputy foreign minister at that time .
" the usa had been attacked and article 5 required germany to make a contribution . "
but germany 's support for america went beyond legal obligations , according to volmer .
many germans felt a deep emotional bond with their historical ally , creating a political climate in which participation in an offensive military campaign could be openly discussed .
" the german people made spontaneous displays of solidarity with the american people , " volmer said .
" many germans said the americans helped us against hitler and protected us during the cold war and now we have to return the favor . "
this solidarity ran into obstacles on the political front , however .
although the german military had participated in the kosovo war of 1999 , anxiety about military force remained deeply rooted in the national psyche .
many social democrats and greens worried that germany would be dragged into an open ended , global war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over the years , flag-draped caskets began returning to germany but in a political power play , schroeder tied parliament 's vote on operation enduring freedom with a vote of confidence .
if antiwar skeptics among the social democrats and greens voted against the war , they would also be voting against their own government .
faced with the choice of political influence or principle , most social democrats and greens closed ranks and threw their confidence behind their coalition government .
the resolution passed , allocating 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom and saving the government from collapse . mixed message as the united states waged war in pursuit of the perpetrators of september 11 , the international community designed a stabilization force to ease the impact of the conflict on civilians .
" the next step in the discussion was to demand that the military strikes not be directed against the afghan people , " volmer said .
" instead , the afghans should benefit from the intervention . "
while oef had been tasked with rooting out the taliban and al-qaeda , the international security assistance force would seek to create a secure environment in which afghanistan could build a postwar future for itself .
berlin sought to keep oef and isaf - war and stabilization - clearly separated from one another with an emphasis on putting isaf in the lead .
" that again has to do with history , " said karl lamers , former foreign policy spokesman for the christian democrats . " we do n't do war .
we conduct other actions that demand the use of force . "
but berlin 's policy began to send mixed messages .
in 2004 , german soldiers set up shop in the northern afghan city of kunduz , where they assisted civilian reconstruction efforts .
however , they became increasingly entangled in ambushes , mortar attacks and running gun battles as the taliban made a comeback .
the distinction between stabilization and war had become blurred .
as the years passed , flag-draped caskets returned home , and terrorists increasingly targeted europe , the justification for the mission became more self-assertive .
slowly , german defense experts began to take ownership of the conflict by identifying it as being in the national interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz strike killed 142 and left many wounded in hospitals " later we recognized what defense minister -lrb- peter -rrb- struck had pointed out : we are also defending germany 's security on the hindu kush , " said hans-ulrich klose , a leading foreign policy expert within the social democratic party .
" this view was supported by the attacks in london and madrid and through the clear fact that there 's something like a home-grown but foreign-trained terrorism that threatens us all . "
acts of war in september of 2009 , the simmering security situation in northern afghanistan boiled over .
colonel georg klein , commander of the german soldiers in kunduz , ordered american bombers to eliminate two taliban-hijacked fuel tankers .
the airstrike killed 142 people .
many of the dead were civilians .
klein defended his order by claiming that he had believed the tankers would be used as an explosive device against his soldiers .
however , the subsequent investigation by isaf indicated that klein targeted the people , not the tanker itself .
local taliban leaders may have been among the crowd .
a german officer had launched a preemptive strike against a perceived threat orchestrated by a human enemy .
germany had waged war in front of the entire international community .
a half truth in the aftermath of the kunduz bombing , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg acknowledged that the german army was operating under " warlike conditions . "
and after three soldiers died in a taliban ambush in april of 2010 , chancellor angela merkel made a similar admission .
during the nationally televised memorial service for the fallen , merkel expressed understanding for soldiers who said they were fighting in a war .
so what do observers think of politicians ' attempts to find a label just short of ' war ' for the unconventional conflict in afghanistan ?
according to lamers , it 's a legal sideshow - one that began with the debate over the gulf war , raged during the yugoslavia crisis , and has been partially exposed by the kunduz airstrike .
military force - however it may be labeled by the political establishment - is now a regular and tolerated feature of german foreign policy .
germany no longer faces a national historical dilemma of whether it can use force at all .
rather , it has returned to history and once again confronts the broader human question : under what circumstances is military force justified ?
" it 's a question for all of us that nobody can definitively answer yet , but which we have to discuss intensively with one another , " lamers said .
" how do we position ourselves in a world where there are still cases like afghanistan ?
how do we deal with that ?
do we just say that we ca n't do anything about it ?
or if we can do something , what exactly should we do ? "
considering its tainted history , germany will have to be especially careful in its search for an answer .

moscow said claims of selective justice were " unacceptable . " russia has reacted to criticism over monday 's new guilty verdict against the jailed former oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky by telling the european union and the united states to stay out of its affairs . " we expect everyone to mind his own business , both at home and in the international arena , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" attempts to put pressure on the proceedings are unacceptable , " the ministry said , using unusually blunt language for a diplomatic statement .
khodorkovsky was convicted on monday of stealing oil from his former company , yukos , between 1999 and 2003 and laundering the proceeds .
the conviction drew international criticism , with the united states saying it was " deeply concerned " about the " selective application of justice . "
germany said the verdict was a step backwards for russia , while france called for the rule of law to be respected .
khodorkovsky vs putin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and khodorkovsky are seen as personal rivals critics and human rights activists regard the trial as having been politically motivated .
they say the aim is to sideline khodorkovsky because he financed opposition parties . once the richest man in russia , he was convicted of fraud in 2003 and sentenced to prison .
his jail term was due to expire in 2011 .
khodorkovsky is an outspoken opponent of russian prime minister vladimir putin , who was the country 's president when khodorkovsky was initially convicted .
the new prison sentence could put him behind bars beyond the 2012 presidential elections .
if the court follows the prosecutors ' calls , he could stay in jail until 2017 .
vladimir putin is widely expected to run again for the presidency in 2012 .
he served two terms in that office , from 2000 to 2008 .
the constitution barred him from serving a third , consecutive term .
however , from 2012 putin could again serve as president for another two terms .
full verdict expected by friday the reading of the full verdict is ongoing and expected to be completed by the end of the week , at the earliest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as yukos chief , khodorkovsky was the richest man in russia khodorkovsky 's defense team suggested the verdict would be pronounced on friday .
as the first 10 days of january are vacation days in russia , no newspapers will be published that could question the court 's impartiality . in a statement released on khodorkovsky 's website , he and his co-defendant , platon lebedev , thanked their supporters for protesting outside the court building .
" power without law is a stool without a leg .
it looks silly and its prospects are predictable , " the statement said .

but critics say the intiative may see higher prices at the pump and cause damage to the environment . as of january 1 , 2011 , german drivers will have the option to fuel up their cars with new super e10 , a biofuel with higher ethanol content .
the change is part of germany 's plan to incrementally decrease its carbon emissions , with the goal of an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
but for everyday german drivers , the cost of the new biofuel is still a relative unknown , and the subject of much speculation .
previously , biofuel in germany only had five percent ethanol content , whereas e10 packs a solid 10 percent ethanol , an increase that should prove more environmentally friendly .
the federal ministry for the environment , nature conservation and nuclear safety -lrb- bmu -rrb- estimates that around 90 percent of existing german cars will be e10-compatible .
those vehicles unable to run on e10 can keep using the five percent variety until it is phased out in 2013 .
e10 will be available from the more than 14,000 service stations throughout the country as of the first of the year .
according to the bmu , the higher ethanol gasoline will have a decreased impact on the environment in terms of carbon emissions and will reduce consumer reliance on diminishing oil reserves .
the initiative is also designed to bring germany into compliance with a european commission directive seeking an eu-wide greenhouse gas emission savings of 60 percent from 2018 onwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while they disagree on how much , most parties say e10 will cost more than regular gas more ethanol means more cost the cost to the consumer is one contentious issue that is being batted around between the various groups interested in the project .
as the cost of producing ethanol biofuel is higher than regular gasoline , the bmu expects the price at the pump to increase slightly as well .
" with the introduction of e10 come additional costs for the production of bioethanol and the maintenance of fuel quality , " the ministry said .
but the german association for the biofuel industry contended that prices will not increase significantly .
" ethanol will not be much more expensive than gasoline , " association president claus sauter told press agency dpa .
" in addition , the petroleum industry itself is interested in selling e10 , because it is legally obliged to bring biofuels to market . "
on the other side of the issue , the spokesman for bp europe told bonn 's general anzeiger newspaper , " for drivers , the price will always be higher , " estimating an increased cost of 50 percent over normal petrol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as food crops are replaced by biofuel production , the cost in carbon increases cost to the environment another bone of contention is the actual environmental impact of the new biofuel due to something called indirect land use .
this is essentially the consequence of changing the use of land in order to produce crops used in biofuel production .
as more arable land is used to produce biofuel , the increased land clearance to grow food crops has the knock-on effect of higher carbon emissions .
originally , the commission had anticipated enacting its directive 98/70 / ec , requiring member states to report on the greenhouse gas intensity of fuel and energy , starting on january 1 , 2011 .
according to the directive , suppliers are required to gradually reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent by the end of 2020 at the latest .
but shortly before the january kick-off date for the initiative , the european commission published a report on indirect land use change related to biofuels .
it found that the ramifications of indirect land use required more investigation before it could proceed with the directive .
" the potential effects of indirect land use need to be properly weighed in our biofuels policy .
it is in our interest to investigate this seriously and ensure legislation that avoids negative side effects , " energy commissioner guenther oettinger said .
the result of its findings led the commission to delay its biofuel directive until july of 2011 .
in germany , however , the bmu claims that many of the required elements for biofuel production are locally and sustainably grown .

originally , the commission had anticipated enacting its directive 98/70 / ec , requiring member states to report on the greenhouse gas intensity of fuel and energy , starting on january 1 , 2011 .
according to the directive , suppliers are required to gradually reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent by the end of 2020 at the latest .
but shortly before the january kick-off date for the initiative , the european commission published a report on indirect land use change related to biofuels .
it found that the ramifications of indirect land use required more investigation before it could proceed with the directive .
" the potential effects of indirect land use need to be properly weighed in our biofuels policy .
it is in our interest to investigate this seriously and ensure legislation that avoids negative side effects , " energy commissioner guenther oettinger said .
the result of its findings led the commission to delay its biofuel directive until july of 2011 .
in germany , however , the bmu claims that many of the required elements for biofuel production are locally and sustainably grown .

competitors from austria , poland and switzerland are considered to be among the favorites . the four hills tournament is a series of four ski jump competitions timed to ring in the new year .
the 59th edition of the competition starts in the german town of oberstdorf on wednesday , followed by the new year 's day jumps in garmisch-partenkirchen .
after that , the tournament moves to austria , with jumps in innsbruck on january 3 and in bishofshofen on january 6 .
at the end of the tournament , the competitor with the best overall score from the four events is declared the winner .
for german fans of ski jumping , it seems ages ago since sven hannawald swept the events of the four hills tournament in the 2001-02 competition .
he became the first ski jumper to win all four events of the tournament , a feat that has yet to be matched .
but if germany 's current form is anything to go by , they 'll be lucky to crack the top-10 in the overall standings , let alone win any of the events .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german pascal bodmer could crack the top 10 " of course we would rather go into the competition as one of the favourites , " said german ski jumping coach werner schuster .
" but it 's our goal for at least one of our ski jumpers to make it into the top 10 . "
the former stars of the german team , martin schmitt and michael uhrmann , are both 32 and not in very good form . schmitt 's best days on the hills may be behind him , but according to coach schuster , due to his experience - schmitt is competing in his 15th four hills tournament - he remains an important part of the team .
with schmitt no longer expected to reach the podium , it will be young up-and-coming ski jumpers such as severin freund and pascal bodmer who will likely be germany 's best hopes for cracking the top 10 . " the young guys are still really coachable , " schuster said .
" they 'll have to show what they can do at the first and second events in particular .
that 's where the wheat is separated from the chaff . "
austria 's morgenstern is the favorite the austrians , with their duo of thomas morgenstern and andreas kofler are considered to be favorites , and are going for their third consecutive overall win . morgenstern is on form , having won four consecutive world cup events this season .
he 's trying to go into the four hills as relaxed as possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's thomas morgenstern is one of the favourites " i do n't wrack my brain over winning the tournament , " morgenstern said .
" i still just want to continue to have fun .
ski-jumping is not the most important part in my life . "
kofler , the defending four hills title holder , said he did n't feel any added pressure going into this year 's competition . " i can be calm about it and start with a lot of pleasant anticipation since i 've already won the tournament , " he said .
austria 's national coach , alexander pointer , is quite optimistic about a win .
" we do n't need to be overmodest , " he said .
" i see two exceptional athletes on the ski-jumping circuit at the moment : morgenstern and kofler . "
but there is some bad news for the austrian team as well .
gregor schlierenzauer , who has twice won the ski jumping world championship , will not be able to compete in the first two of the four tournament events due to an injured knee .
" it 's a tough decision for me .
but my head tells me that this is right thing to do for the long-term , " the 20-year-old schlierenzauer said .
schmitt wo n't quit after this year 's season polish ski jumper adam malysz and simon ammann from switzerland have set out to stop the austrian wave of success .
ammann , who has won four olympic titles - including two gold medals in vancouver - has yet to win the four hills tournament .
" the tournament is hugely attractive and its mystique gets bigger and bigger , as my chances of winning get " he said .
" so far , the tournament has been a tough nut to crack for me . "

in 1806 , hegel described him as an iconic " world-soul , " and even his enemies could not quite shake off the fascination for the emperor who at first seemed to be invincible .
but poets and artists of his time also portrayed napoleon as a heartless warmonger , a ridiculous caricature , and even as satan 's eldest son .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show examines the emperor from various angles in " napoleon and europe , dream and trauma " the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany takes on napoleon in the context of his time .
the exhibition gives visitors with a critical and multifaceted look at a challenging topic .
the historic exhibition was done in cooperation with the musee de l 'armee in paris , where it will be shown in the spring of 2012 .
it will be the first comprehensive exhibition about napoleon in france for over 40 years .
" up to now in france , it 's been quite impossible to have a reasonable point of view about napoleon , " robert bresse , director of the musee de l 'armee , told deutsche welle .
" so , it 's really important to have an exhibition in paris that was built outside of france . "
master of propaganda as one of the exhibition 's 12 chapters illuminates , napoleon was a master of image cultivation and propaganda through artworks such as busts and paintings .
and napoleon 's image continues to be influenced by propaganda , the exhibit 's curator says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : napoleon 's myth lives on in marlon brando 's mantle from the movie desiree " part of the exhibition is the coronation mantle marlon brando wore when he played napoleon , revealing how much the official iconography of napoleon 's time has been passed on by film history and our popular culture , " said benedicte savoy , curator of the exhibition .
and , of course , there were napoleon 's wars .
his ambitious plans to unify europe under his command resulted in strategic triumphs , such as the battle of the three emperors in 1805 .
but they also led to his disastrous defeat and eventual downfall after the battle of waterloo in 1815 .
a generation of veterans other exhibitions have dealt thoroughly with the millions of victims who were killed in the napoleonic wars .
but ' napoleon and europe ' takes a closer look at the survivors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a living example of napoleon 's soldiers at the museum in bonn " nobody thinks of those who were wounded , " angelica francke , director of the exhibition , told deutsche welle .
" but those people , the veterans , were present in the streets for decades after napoleon was exiled .
so we dedicate a part of the exhibition to them . "
napoleon 's influence remains a part of europe up to the present day .
the exhibit shows how he implemented new standards like the metric system , connected european cities through a system of roads and telegraph lines , and , of course , introduced the napoleonic code , the civil rights opus still applied in france .
napoleon 's controversial impact on europe but napoleon 's impact on the face of europe was dark as well .
one part of the exhibit focuses one the theft of artworks from archives and museums of the conquered regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the young emperor : napoleon age 27 however , even this systematic theft has more than one side to it , according to erich pelzer , a historian at the university of mannheim .
" napoleon is never one-dimensional , he 's always controversial , " pelzer told deutsche welle .
" many artworks that could n't be stored in the louvre were redistributed to other european cities , helping a new ' europe of culture ' to emerge .
in fact , the theft of archives reflects a core phenomenon of napoleon : he creates something new without changing the actual substance , " pelzer said . napoleon 's impact on europe remains as controversial as napoleon himself .
and by taking a pan-european approach to its subject , the exhibition " napoleon and europe " offers a variety of new insights .

some commentators fear blurry boundaries are putting aid workers at deadly risk . the killing of an afghanistan-based german aid worker by the taliban over the weekend has sparked calls for a greater and more visible separation between development work and military forces in the country .
former united nations special representative to afghanistan and current member of the german bundestag tom koenigs stressed that aid workers are in more danger than ever .
" the workers ' neutrality is no longer being acknowledged a priori , partly because their work has been politicized more and more in recent years , " koenigs said in an interview with the daily koelner stadtanzeiger .
" the price for that is that the development workers are perceived as part of the war .
we should concentrate more on separating development work from military deployment . "
koenigs ' comments come just weeks after german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg called for troops in crisis regions to work more closely with humanitarian aid agencies on the ground .
targeting aid workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is still rebuilding the most recent victim of the insurgency , an engineer working as an advisor to the german development bank kfw , was fatally wounded while travelling in a vehicle with three colleagues .
one of the colleagues , an afghan translator , was also injured in the attack .
the kfw advisor is the latest in a series of aid workers to be targeted in afghanistan this year , which has seen a spike in the number deaths of civilian development workers .
attacks directed at un employees working in afghanistan have increased by more than 130 percent in 2010 compared to last year , according to the united nations department of safety and security .
in another high-profile case from september , aid worker linda norgrove of scotland was taken hostage and later killed during a us-led operation to secure her release .
she had been working for the american-based organization development alternatives inc .
risks ever-present kieran dwyer of the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan said his organization attempts to minimize risks for development workers by remaining in constant contact with civilian and government leaders about possible risks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister dirk niebel called the attack on the aid worker " cowardly " " but the security risks can only be mitigated by the way we operate , not eliminated , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's important to remember that not just foreign aid workers but also afghan aid and government workers are targeted by insurgents .
it is not only the rising number of attacks that concerns dwyer .
" insurgents also began to target more regions of the country in the last year , often attacking the so-called soft targets of unarmed government and humanitarian workers , " he added .
germany has 4,800 troops in afghanistan , most of whom are serving in the north of the country , where the attack on the kfw consultant took place .
berlin is to begin reducing troop numbers in afghanistan by the end of 2011 , and to pull out of the country completely within four years . author : greg wiser -lrb- dpa -rrb- editor : sophie tarr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the most recent is pirateleaks.cz , launched by the czech pirate party . in the aftermath of the latest releases of information of secret documents by the infamous wikileaks , a crop of clones have popped up in europe .
one has been seeded by ex-wikileaks staffers , others were simply inspired by the original , but all of them want to make a difference .
wikileaks clones include the forthcoming openleaks in germany , with former wikileaks staffer , daniel domscheit-berg at the helm .
openleaks aims to democratize the process of leaking information and whistle-blowing and support the introduction of new legislation defending the rights of whistle-blowers .
other such websites include brusselsleaks.com , balkanleaks.eu , rospil.info and indoleaks.org , each hoping to blow the lid on corruption and secret documents in the european union , the balkans , russia and indonesia respectively .

the czech pirate party announced earlier this month that it had created a new secret-leaking site called pirateleaks and it aims to do the same thing as wikileaks , only focusing in the czech republic .
the aim of the site is to encourage transparency in czech government .
" our sources are people who work with documents in the authorities , are journalists who are afraid to publish these documents because of political reasons , and are simply members of the public , " spokesman jakub michalek said .
the creators of pirateleaks will be hoping all those sources supply them with evidence of corruption .
the small amount of information released since this week 's launch has n't exactly rocked the czech political establishment – though the site has ruffled a few feathers , michalek added .
" the politicians are afraid to say that this is a bad thing , because we are working exactly in accordance with the law , " he said . " but on the other side there were also reactions like , ' this is outrageous , this should be banned , the site should be closed immediately . " '

" i think it 's very good that we have another source of information , one that is setting as its goal finding documents that are normally not available , " prague-based journalist erik best told deutsche welle .
" and i think with the impetus , with the excitement in the west and all over the world with wikileaks , that connection is going to be a big benefit for the site . "

prq prides itself on requiring hardly any personal information from its clients .
" we would like to move to sweden or a different place that is much safer , as soon as possible , " michalek said .
" because the services that we can get in sweden with a pirate isp , or the prq company , are much better , we can get a safer connection .
things can be with more anonymity than we can get here in the czech republic . "
