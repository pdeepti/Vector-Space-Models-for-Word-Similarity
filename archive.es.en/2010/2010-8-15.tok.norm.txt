program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.08.2010 westerwelle sees room for tax cuts on back of robust growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle has renewed his party 's calls for tax cuts german vice chancellor guido westerwelle says there 's " room for maneuver " for tax cuts in the light of data showing europe 's largest economy posted its strongest quarterly growth in more than 20 years . german vice chancellor guido westerwelle said he was committed to using any increase in revenue from germany 's bumper economic growth to ease the tax burden on germany 's middle classes .
" this government is unwavering in its commitment to relieve the burden on the middle class in the interests of growth , job creation and fairness , " he told german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag .
" where there is room for maneuver , it must be used . "
germany 's strong economic growth of 2.2 percent in the second quarter this year is expected to spur a sharp increase in tax revenues .
analysts at the kiel institute for the world economy estimate that the government could take in 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- more than expected this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strong exports fuelled the rapid growth announced this week westerwelle said that the ruling coalition , in which his party the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are the junior partner , should take a share of the credit for germany 's best quarterly growth results since reunification in 1992 .
figures released on friday showed that germany 's economy grew at its fastest rate for more than 20 years from april to june , outpacing eurozone neighbors and britain .
" our government is good for the economy , the labor market and prosperity .
this has quite obviously made an important contribution to the current economic and employment miracle in germany , " westerwelle said .
in the interview , westerwelle - who is also foreign minister - also announced that plans were being drawn up to simplify the tax system .
need to slash deficit the need to address national budget deficits in the light of the greek debt crisis has meant that german chancellor angela merkel 's coalition is unable to deliver on pre-election promises of tax cuts , choosing instead to slash public spending .
the government hopes to save 80 billion euros by 2014 and in june unveiled the largest package of austerity measures in the country 's history , with deep cuts in social welfare programs and the public sector .
westerwelle 's comments on tax cuts are not likely to go down well in germany with some politicians already calling to ease the impact of budget cuts on the poorer members of society .
the budget expert from the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , carsten schneider has called for the government to take a " more social approach " to its policies as a result of the growth boost .

-lrb- 13.08.2010 -rrb- germany 's free democrats risk coalition rift by pushing tax cuts germany 's free democrats - junior partners in chancellor merkel 's government - have proposed 16 billion euros worth of tax cuts likely to deepen divisions with merkel 's christian democrats .

swiss media reports said extra security staff had been hired to protect the floats and revelers .
measures to prevent repeat of german stampede the new rules were aimed at preventing a repeat of the panic that led to a stampede when participants crowded into an underpass on the way to the entrance of the love parade in the western german city of duisburg last month .
21 people were killed in the accident , many of them suffocated , and more than 300 were injured , making it one of the deadliest public events in germany in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mourners in zurich observed a minute of silence for love parade victims the incident raised accusations of negligence against event organizers , politicians and the police .
at the zurich festival , fans took part in a street parade accompanied by booming electronic music , early in the afternoon - following some 30 floats through the streets of switzerland 's economic center .
organizers stopped the floats and turned the music off at precisely 5 pm local time and revelers observed a moment of silence to remember those killed at germany 's love parade .
djs later played music at seven separate stages on the shores of lake zurich .
police reported late on saturday that the event had been generally calm .
the parade has been held every year in the city since it first began in 1992 . richard connor -lrb- dpa / afp / ap -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this government is unwavering in its commitment to relieve the burden on the middle class in the interests of growth , job creation and fairness , " he told german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag .
" where there is room for maneuver , it must be used . "
germany 's strong economic growth of 2.2 percent in the second quarter this year is expected to spur a sharp increase in tax revenues .
analysts at the kiel institute for the world economy estimate that the government could take in 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- more than expected this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strong exports fuelled the rapid growth announced this week westerwelle said that the ruling coalition , in which his party the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are the junior partner , should take a share of the credit for germany 's best quarterly growth results since reunification in 1992 .
figures released on friday showed that germany 's economy grew at its fastest rate for more than 20 years from april to june , outpacing eurozone neighbors and britain .

" this government is unwavering in its commitment to relieve the burden on the middle class in the interests of growth , job creation and fairness , " he told german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag .
" where there is room for maneuver , it must be used . "
germany 's strong economic growth of 2.2 percent in the second quarter this year is expected to spur a sharp increase in tax revenues .
analysts at the kiel institute for the world economy estimate that the government could take in 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- more than expected this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strong exports fuelled the rapid growth announced this week westerwelle said that the ruling coalition , in which his party the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are the junior partner , should take a share of the credit for germany 's best quarterly growth results since reunification in 1992 .
figures released on friday showed that germany 's economy grew at its fastest rate for more than 20 years from april to june , outpacing eurozone neighbors and britain .
" our government is good for the economy , the labor market and prosperity .
this has quite obviously made an important contribution to the current economic and employment miracle in germany , " westerwelle said .
in the interview , westerwelle - who is also foreign minister - also announced that plans were being drawn up to simplify the tax system .
need to slash deficit the need to address national budget deficits in the light of the greek debt crisis has meant that german chancellor angela merkel 's coalition is unable to deliver on pre-election promises of tax cuts , choosing instead to slash public spending .
the government hopes to save 80 billion euros by 2014 and in june unveiled the largest package of austerity measures in the country 's history , with deep cuts in social welfare programs and the public sector .
westerwelle 's comments on tax cuts are not likely to go down well in germany with some politicians already calling to ease the impact of budget cuts on the poorer members of society .
the budget expert from the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , carsten schneider has called for the government to take a " more social approach " to its policies as a result of the growth boost .

severe drought and wildfires have destroyed the harvest and ravaged agricultural land . a ban on russian grain exports went into effect on sunday , as authorities try to reduce the chance of a food shortage following the destruction of crops in wildfires .
an estimated 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- of agricultural land has been devastated by the fires following the worst heat wave in russian history .
russia is one of the world 's biggest producers of wheat , barley and rye .
however a quarter of the country 's crops have been destroyed , according to president dmitry medvedev .
prime minister vladimir putin banned grain exports in an attempt to keep domestic food costs down , however there is concern that the crop levels are not even enough to supply domestic demand .
putin said the grain crop could be as low as 60 million ton , and 79 million ton is needed to meet domestic consumption .
data from the agricultural ministry shows that even if the ban is lifted , there may not be enough grain to export .
consumers vs exporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread prices are likely to rise in the short term as a result of the ban , world wheat prices have rocketed to a two-year high and there are worries about a crisis in global food supplies .
in a statement , first deputy prime minister viktor zubkov stressed that the government needed to balance the interests of grain traders with the need to maintain stability on the domestic food market .
" we understand the anxiety of our exporters , " he said .
" the ban is a temporary measure . "
" furthermore , we are continually monitoring and analyzing grain , feed and seed supplies on the domestic market , " he added .
some within russia have criticized the ban , saying it will take the country years to regain its international market position and risks driving domestic grain producers out of business .

egypt is its largest market , followed by turkey , syria , iran and libya .
in addition to affecting the cost of such food staples as bread , a shortage or hike in the price of grain is expected to have a knock-on effect across several european industries .
in farming , more expensive grain could push up animal feed costs and force farmers to slaughter livestock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer producers say they wo n't feel effects until 2012 european brewing giants such as anheuser-busch inbev have said the rising grain prices will not hit the group until 2012 , as they buy their barley and other grains far in advance .
although europe 's biggest food groups nestle , unilever and danone have said they will be cushioned from the rise in grain prices , smaller and private-label food groups are likely to suffer .
those who are big wheat users such as dutch bakery group csm , or british bread and cake maker premier foods have already suggested they may have to increase prices .
leaders divided on ban the ban came into force on sunday and is due to last until december 31 .
however the russian leadership have different ideas about whether the ban will be extended or lifted .
first deputy prime minister zubkov has said they will discuss after october 1 whether to extend the grain export ban into next year .
an optimistic medvedev has said the ban could be lifted earlier if the harvest permits .
but a more cautious putin has said the ban could last into 2011 .

severe drought and wildfires have destroyed the harvest and ravaged agricultural land . a ban on russian grain exports went into effect on sunday , as authorities try to reduce the chance of a food shortage following the destruction of crops in wildfires .
an estimated 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- of agricultural land has been devastated by the fires following the worst heat wave in russian history .
russia is one of the world 's biggest producers of wheat , barley and rye .
however a quarter of the country 's crops have been destroyed , according to president dmitry medvedev .
prime minister vladimir putin banned grain exports in an attempt to keep domestic food costs down , however there is concern that the crop levels are not even enough to supply domestic demand .
putin said the grain crop could be as low as 60 million ton , and 79 million ton is needed to meet domestic consumption .
data from the agricultural ministry shows that even if the ban is lifted , there may not be enough grain to export .
consumers vs exporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread prices are likely to rise in the short term as a result of the ban , world wheat prices have rocketed to a two-year high and there are worries about a crisis in global food supplies .
in a statement , first deputy prime minister viktor zubkov stressed that the government needed to balance the interests of grain traders with the need to maintain stability on the domestic food market .
" we understand the anxiety of our exporters , " he said .
" the ban is a temporary measure . "
" furthermore , we are continually monitoring and analyzing grain , feed and seed supplies on the domestic market , " he added .
some within russia have criticized the ban , saying it will take the country years to regain its international market position and risks driving domestic grain producers out of business .

egypt is its largest market , followed by turkey , syria , iran and libya .
in addition to affecting the cost of such food staples as bread , a shortage or hike in the price of grain is expected to have a knock-on effect across several european industries .
in farming , more expensive grain could push up animal feed costs and force farmers to slaughter livestock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer producers say they wo n't feel effects until 2012 european brewing giants such as anheuser-busch inbev have said the rising grain prices will not hit the group until 2012 , as they buy their barley and other grains far in advance .
although europe 's biggest food groups nestle , unilever and danone have said they will be cushioned from the rise in grain prices , smaller and private-label food groups are likely to suffer .
those who are big wheat users such as dutch bakery group csm , or british bread and cake maker premier foods have already suggested they may have to increase prices .
leaders divided on ban the ban came into force on sunday and is due to last until december 31 .
however the russian leadership have different ideas about whether the ban will be extended or lifted .
first deputy prime minister zubkov has said they will discuss after october 1 whether to extend the grain export ban into next year .
an optimistic medvedev has said the ban could be lifted earlier if the harvest permits .
but a more cautious putin has said the ban could last into 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 15.08.2010 russia begins ban on grain exports after fires devastate crops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heatwave and blazes have destroyed at least a third of crops a ban on russian wheat and grain exports went in to effect on sunday , and is expected to last until the end of the year .
severe drought and wildfires have destroyed the harvest and ravaged agricultural land . a ban on russian grain exports went into effect on sunday , as authorities try to reduce the chance of a food shortage following the destruction of crops in wildfires .
an estimated 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- of agricultural land has been devastated by the fires following the worst heat wave in russian history .
russia is one of the world 's biggest producers of wheat , barley and rye .
however a quarter of the country 's crops have been destroyed , according to president dmitry medvedev .
prime minister vladimir putin banned grain exports in an attempt to keep domestic food costs down , however there is concern that the crop levels are not even enough to supply domestic demand .
putin said the grain crop could be as low as 60 million ton , and 79 million ton is needed to meet domestic consumption .
data from the agricultural ministry shows that even if the ban is lifted , there may not be enough grain to export .
consumers vs exporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread prices are likely to rise in the short term as a result of the ban , world wheat prices have rocketed to a two-year high and there are worries about a crisis in global food supplies .
in a statement , first deputy prime minister viktor zubkov stressed that the government needed to balance the interests of grain traders with the need to maintain stability on the domestic food market .
" we understand the anxiety of our exporters , " he said .
" the ban is a temporary measure . "
" furthermore , we are continually monitoring and analyzing grain , feed and seed supplies on the domestic market , " he added .
some within russia have criticized the ban , saying it will take the country years to regain its international market position and risks driving domestic grain producers out of business .
knock-on effects in europe , middle east the type of wheat russia produces is best suited to making unleavened bread , and much of its wheat is imported to the middle east .
egypt is its largest market , followed by turkey , syria , iran and libya .
in addition to affecting the cost of such food staples as bread , a shortage or hike in the price of grain is expected to have a knock-on effect across several european industries .
in farming , more expensive grain could push up animal feed costs and force farmers to slaughter livestock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer producers say they wo n't feel effects until 2012 european brewing giants such as anheuser-busch inbev have said the rising grain prices will not hit the group until 2012 , as they buy their barley and other grains far in advance .
although europe 's biggest food groups nestle , unilever and danone have said they will be cushioned from the rise in grain prices , smaller and private-label food groups are likely to suffer .
those who are big wheat users such as dutch bakery group csm , or british bread and cake maker premier foods have already suggested they may have to increase prices .
leaders divided on ban the ban came into force on sunday and is due to last until december 31 .
however the russian leadership have different ideas about whether the ban will be extended or lifted .
first deputy prime minister zubkov has said they will discuss after october 1 whether to extend the grain export ban into next year .
an optimistic medvedev has said the ban could be lifted earlier if the harvest permits .
but a more cautious putin has said the ban could last into 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 15.08.2010 russia begins ban on grain exports after fires devastate crops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heatwave and blazes have destroyed at least a third of crops a ban on russian wheat and grain exports went in to effect on sunday , and is expected to last until the end of the year .
severe drought and wildfires have destroyed the harvest and ravaged agricultural land . a ban on russian grain exports went into effect on sunday , as authorities try to reduce the chance of a food shortage following the destruction of crops in wildfires .
an estimated 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- of agricultural land has been devastated by the fires following the worst heat wave in russian history .
russia is one of the world 's biggest producers of wheat , barley and rye .
however a quarter of the country 's crops have been destroyed , according to president dmitry medvedev .
prime minister vladimir putin banned grain exports in an attempt to keep domestic food costs down , however there is concern that the crop levels are not even enough to supply domestic demand .
putin said the grain crop could be as low as 60 million ton , and 79 million ton is needed to meet domestic consumption .
data from the agricultural ministry shows that even if the ban is lifted , there may not be enough grain to export .
consumers vs exporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread prices are likely to rise in the short term as a result of the ban , world wheat prices have rocketed to a two-year high and there are worries about a crisis in global food supplies .
in a statement , first deputy prime minister viktor zubkov stressed that the government needed to balance the interests of grain traders with the need to maintain stability on the domestic food market .
" we understand the anxiety of our exporters , " he said .
" the ban is a temporary measure . "
" furthermore , we are continually monitoring and analyzing grain , feed and seed supplies on the domestic market , " he added .
some within russia have criticized the ban , saying it will take the country years to regain its international market position and risks driving domestic grain producers out of business .
knock-on effects in europe , middle east the type of wheat russia produces is best suited to making unleavened bread , and much of its wheat is imported to the middle east .
egypt is its largest market , followed by turkey , syria , iran and libya .
in addition to affecting the cost of such food staples as bread , a shortage or hike in the price of grain is expected to have a knock-on effect across several european industries .
in farming , more expensive grain could push up animal feed costs and force farmers to slaughter livestock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer producers say they wo n't feel effects until 2012 european brewing giants such as anheuser-busch inbev have said the rising grain prices will not hit the group until 2012 , as they buy their barley and other grains far in advance .
although europe 's biggest food groups nestle , unilever and danone have said they will be cushioned from the rise in grain prices , smaller and private-label food groups are likely to suffer .
those who are big wheat users such as dutch bakery group csm , or british bread and cake maker premier foods have already suggested they may have to increase prices .
leaders divided on ban the ban came into force on sunday and is due to last until december 31 .
however the russian leadership have different ideas about whether the ban will be extended or lifted .
first deputy prime minister zubkov has said they will discuss after october 1 whether to extend the grain export ban into next year .
an optimistic medvedev has said the ban could be lifted earlier if the harvest permits .
but a more cautious putin has said the ban could last into 2011 .

however a quarter of the country 's crops have been destroyed , according to president dmitry medvedev .
prime minister vladimir putin banned grain exports in an attempt to keep domestic food costs down , however there is concern that the crop levels are not even enough to supply domestic demand .
putin said the grain crop could be as low as 60 million ton , and 79 million ton is needed to meet domestic consumption .
data from the agricultural ministry shows that even if the ban is lifted , there may not be enough grain to export .
consumers vs exporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread prices are likely to rise in the short term as a result of the ban , world wheat prices have rocketed to a two-year high and there are worries about a crisis in global food supplies .
in a statement , first deputy prime minister viktor zubkov stressed that the government needed to balance the interests of grain traders with the need to maintain stability on the domestic food market .
" we understand the anxiety of our exporters , " he said .
" the ban is a temporary measure . "
" furthermore , we are continually monitoring and analyzing grain , feed and seed supplies on the domestic market , " he added .
some within russia have criticized the ban , saying it will take the country years to regain its international market position and risks driving domestic grain producers out of business .
knock-on effects in europe , middle east the type of wheat russia produces is best suited to making unleavened bread , and much of its wheat is imported to the middle east .
egypt is its largest market , followed by turkey , syria , iran and libya .
in addition to affecting the cost of such food staples as bread , a shortage or hike in the price of grain is expected to have a knock-on effect across several european industries .
in farming , more expensive grain could push up animal feed costs and force farmers to slaughter livestock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer producers say they wo n't feel effects until 2012 european brewing giants such as anheuser-busch inbev have said the rising grain prices will not hit the group until 2012 , as they buy their barley and other grains far in advance .
although europe 's biggest food groups nestle , unilever and danone have said they will be cushioned from the rise in grain prices , smaller and private-label food groups are likely to suffer .
those who are big wheat users such as dutch bakery group csm , or british bread and cake maker premier foods have already suggested they may have to increase prices .
leaders divided on ban the ban came into force on sunday and is due to last until december 31 .
however the russian leadership have different ideas about whether the ban will be extended or lifted .
first deputy prime minister zubkov has said they will discuss after october 1 whether to extend the grain export ban into next year .
an optimistic medvedev has said the ban could be lifted earlier if the harvest permits .
but a more cautious putin has said the ban could last into 2011 .

following international condemnation , the government is now facing flak closer to home . french police carried out their latest raid on an illegal roma campsite on saturday , as criticism of its policy mounted .
a lawmaker from french president nicolas sarkozy 's ruling ump party , jean-pierre grand , said the government 's policy was " disgraceful " and " reminiscent of roundups during the war . " the latest raid took place in an eastern paris suburb . sarkozy has alleged the illegal camps are centers of trafficking and prostitution .
grand , a representative for the southern herault region , said he had learned that , after arriving early in the morning , the authorities began to " break up families , sending men to one side and women and children on the other , and threatening to separate mothers and children . "
international condemnation france is home to hundreds of thousands of roma or travelling people who are part of long-established communities .
the other main roma population is made up of recent immigrants , mainly from romania and bulgaria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister hortefeux said 40 camps had been dismantled the crackdown is seen to be a response to last month 's attack on a police station in the loire valley town of saint-aignan by a group of young roma .
france 's dismantling of illegal roma camps as part of a crackdown on crime backed by sarkozy has triggered condemnation by the united nations and the council of europe .
on thursday , the vice president of france 's human rights league malik salemkour said that there was a problem of " institutionalized racism " in the country .
the united nations committee on the elimination of racial discrimination is also investigating how travelling communities such as the roma are treated . one committee member said that the french measures were reminiscent of the period of france 's vichy government , which collaborated with nazis occupiers during the second world war .
france defends policy but france 's un ambassador , jacques pellet , rejected accusations that his government had a racist approach to the roma .
he told the meeting on thursday that the " extremely precarious financial situation " of the minority , as well as their roots outside france made " integration difficult . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tactics were likened to those used in vichy france under marshal petain french interior minister brice hortefeux said on thursday that more than 40 roma camps had already been dismantled - a week after authorities embarked on a plan to get rid of illegal camps and enforce mass deportations .
roma , many of whom come from bulgaria or romania , are estimated to total 15,000 in number .
as european union citizens they are entitled to stay in france , but can be deported if they commit a crime .

swiss media reports said extra security staff had been hired to protect the floats and revelers .
measures to prevent repeat of german stampede the new rules were aimed at preventing a repeat of the panic that led to a stampede when participants crowded into an underpass on the way to the entrance of the love parade in the western german city of duisburg last month .
21 people were killed in the accident , many of them suffocated , and more than 300 were injured , making it one of the deadliest public events in germany in recent years .

at the zurich festival , fans took part in a street parade accompanied by booming electronic music , early in the afternoon - following some 30 floats through the streets of switzerland 's economic center .
organizers stopped the floats and turned the music off at precisely 5 pm local time and revelers observed a moment of silence to remember those killed at germany 's love parade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 15.08.2010 russia begins ban on grain exports after fires devastate crops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heatwave and blazes have destroyed at least a third of crops a ban on russian wheat and grain exports went in to effect on sunday , and is expected to last until the end of the year .
severe drought and wildfires have destroyed the harvest and ravaged agricultural land . a ban on russian grain exports went into effect on sunday , as authorities try to reduce the chance of a food shortage following the destruction of crops in wildfires .
an estimated 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- of agricultural land has been devastated by the fires following the worst heat wave in russian history .
russia is one of the world 's biggest producers of wheat , barley and rye .
however a quarter of the country 's crops have been destroyed , according to president dmitry medvedev .
prime minister vladimir putin banned grain exports in an attempt to keep domestic food costs down , however there is concern that the crop levels are not even enough to supply domestic demand .
putin said the grain crop could be as low as 60 million ton , and 79 million ton is needed to meet domestic consumption .
data from the agricultural ministry shows that even if the ban is lifted , there may not be enough grain to export .
consumers vs exporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread prices are likely to rise in the short term as a result of the ban , world wheat prices have rocketed to a two-year high and there are worries about a crisis in global food supplies .
in a statement , first deputy prime minister viktor zubkov stressed that the government needed to balance the interests of grain traders with the need to maintain stability on the domestic food market .
" we understand the anxiety of our exporters , " he said .
" the ban is a temporary measure . "
" furthermore , we are continually monitoring and analyzing grain , feed and seed supplies on the domestic market , " he added .

severe drought and wildfires have destroyed the harvest and ravaged agricultural land . a ban on russian grain exports went into effect on sunday , as authorities try to reduce the chance of a food shortage following the destruction of crops in wildfires .
an estimated 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- of agricultural land has been devastated by the fires following the worst heat wave in russian history .
russia is one of the world 's biggest producers of wheat , barley and rye .
however a quarter of the country 's crops have been destroyed , according to president dmitry medvedev .
prime minister vladimir putin banned grain exports in an attempt to keep domestic food costs down , however there is concern that the crop levels are not even enough to supply domestic demand .
putin said the grain crop could be as low as 60 million ton , and 79 million ton is needed to meet domestic consumption .
data from the agricultural ministry shows that even if the ban is lifted , there may not be enough grain to export .
consumers vs exporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread prices are likely to rise in the short term as a result of the ban , world wheat prices have rocketed to a two-year high and there are worries about a crisis in global food supplies .
in a statement , first deputy prime minister viktor zubkov stressed that the government needed to balance the interests of grain traders with the need to maintain stability on the domestic food market .
" we understand the anxiety of our exporters , " he said .
" the ban is a temporary measure . "
" furthermore , we are continually monitoring and analyzing grain , feed and seed supplies on the domestic market , " he added .
some within russia have criticized the ban , saying it will take the country years to regain its international market position and risks driving domestic grain producers out of business .
knock-on effects in europe , middle east the type of wheat russia produces is best suited to making unleavened bread , and much of its wheat is imported to the middle east .
egypt is its largest market , followed by turkey , syria , iran and libya .
in addition to affecting the cost of such food staples as bread , a shortage or hike in the price of grain is expected to have a knock-on effect across several european industries .
in farming , more expensive grain could push up animal feed costs and force farmers to slaughter livestock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer producers say they wo n't feel effects until 2012 european brewing giants such as anheuser-busch inbev have said the rising grain prices will not hit the group until 2012 , as they buy their barley and other grains far in advance .
although europe 's biggest food groups nestle , unilever and danone have said they will be cushioned from the rise in grain prices , smaller and private-label food groups are likely to suffer .
those who are big wheat users such as dutch bakery group csm , or british bread and cake maker premier foods have already suggested they may have to increase prices .
leaders divided on ban the ban came into force on sunday and is due to last until december 31 .
however the russian leadership have different ideas about whether the ban will be extended or lifted .
first deputy prime minister zubkov has said they will discuss after october 1 whether to extend the grain export ban into next year .
an optimistic medvedev has said the ban could be lifted earlier if the harvest permits .
but a more cautious putin has said the ban could last into 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 15.08.2010 russia begins ban on grain exports after fires devastate crops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heatwave and blazes have destroyed at least a third of crops a ban on russian wheat and grain exports went in to effect on sunday , and is expected to last until the end of the year .
severe drought and wildfires have destroyed the harvest and ravaged agricultural land . a ban on russian grain exports went into effect on sunday , as authorities try to reduce the chance of a food shortage following the destruction of crops in wildfires .
an estimated 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- of agricultural land has been devastated by the fires following the worst heat wave in russian history .
russia is one of the world 's biggest producers of wheat , barley and rye .
however a quarter of the country 's crops have been destroyed , according to president dmitry medvedev .
prime minister vladimir putin banned grain exports in an attempt to keep domestic food costs down , however there is concern that the crop levels are not even enough to supply domestic demand .
putin said the grain crop could be as low as 60 million ton , and 79 million ton is needed to meet domestic consumption .
data from the agricultural ministry shows that even if the ban is lifted , there may not be enough grain to export .
consumers vs exporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread prices are likely to rise in the short term as a result of the ban , world wheat prices have rocketed to a two-year high and there are worries about a crisis in global food supplies .
in a statement , first deputy prime minister viktor zubkov stressed that the government needed to balance the interests of grain traders with the need to maintain stability on the domestic food market .
" we understand the anxiety of our exporters , " he said .
" the ban is a temporary measure . "
" furthermore , we are continually monitoring and analyzing grain , feed and seed supplies on the domestic market , " he added .
some within russia have criticized the ban , saying it will take the country years to regain its international market position and risks driving domestic grain producers out of business .
knock-on effects in europe , middle east the type of wheat russia produces is best suited to making unleavened bread , and much of its wheat is imported to the middle east .
egypt is its largest market , followed by turkey , syria , iran and libya .
in addition to affecting the cost of such food staples as bread , a shortage or hike in the price of grain is expected to have a knock-on effect across several european industries .
in farming , more expensive grain could push up animal feed costs and force farmers to slaughter livestock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer producers say they wo n't feel effects until 2012 european brewing giants such as anheuser-busch inbev have said the rising grain prices will not hit the group until 2012 , as they buy their barley and other grains far in advance .
although europe 's biggest food groups nestle , unilever and danone have said they will be cushioned from the rise in grain prices , smaller and private-label food groups are likely to suffer .
those who are big wheat users such as dutch bakery group csm , or british bread and cake maker premier foods have already suggested they may have to increase prices .
leaders divided on ban the ban came into force on sunday and is due to last until december 31 .
however the russian leadership have different ideas about whether the ban will be extended or lifted .
first deputy prime minister zubkov has said they will discuss after october 1 whether to extend the grain export ban into next year .
an optimistic medvedev has said the ban could be lifted earlier if the harvest permits .
but a more cautious putin has said the ban could last into 2011 .

france 's dismantling of illegal roma camps as part of a crackdown on crime backed by sarkozy has triggered condemnation by the united nations and the council of europe .

following international condemnation , the government is now facing flak closer to home . french police carried out their latest raid on an illegal roma campsite on saturday , as criticism of its policy mounted .
a lawmaker from french president nicolas sarkozy 's ruling ump party , jean-pierre grand , said the government 's policy was " disgraceful " and " reminiscent of roundups during the war . " the latest raid took place in an eastern paris suburb . sarkozy has alleged the illegal camps are centers of trafficking and prostitution .
grand , a representative for the southern herault region , said he had learned that , after arriving early in the morning , the authorities began to " break up families , sending men to one side and women and children on the other , and threatening to separate mothers and children . "

swiss media reports said extra security staff had been hired to protect the floats and revelers .
measures to prevent repeat of german stampede the new rules were aimed at preventing a repeat of the panic that led to a stampede when participants crowded into an underpass on the way to the entrance of the love parade in the western german city of duisburg last month .

at the zurich festival , fans took part in a street parade accompanied by booming electronic music , early in the afternoon - following some 30 floats through the streets of switzerland 's economic center .
organizers stopped the floats and turned the music off at precisely 5 pm local time and revelers observed a moment of silence to remember those killed at germany 's love parade .

swiss media reports said extra security staff had been hired to protect the floats and revelers .
measures to prevent repeat of german stampede the new rules were aimed at preventing a repeat of the panic that led to a stampede when participants crowded into an underpass on the way to the entrance of the love parade in the western german city of duisburg last month .
21 people were killed in the accident , many of them suffocated , and more than 300 were injured , making it one of the deadliest public events in germany in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mourners in zurich observed a minute of silence for love parade victims the incident raised accusations of negligence against event organizers , politicians and the police .
at the zurich festival , fans took part in a street parade accompanied by booming electronic music , early in the afternoon - following some 30 floats through the streets of switzerland 's economic center .
organizers stopped the floats and turned the music off at precisely 5 pm local time and revelers observed a moment of silence to remember those killed at germany 's love parade .
djs later played music at seven separate stages on the shores of lake zurich .
police reported late on saturday that the event had been generally calm .
the parade has been held every year in the city since it first began in 1992 . richard connor -lrb- dpa / afp / ap -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this government is unwavering in its commitment to relieve the burden on the middle class in the interests of growth , job creation and fairness , " he told german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag .
" where there is room for maneuver , it must be used . "
germany 's strong economic growth of 2.2 percent in the second quarter this year is expected to spur a sharp increase in tax revenues .
analysts at the kiel institute for the world economy estimate that the government could take in 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- more than expected this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strong exports fuelled the rapid growth announced this week westerwelle said that the ruling coalition , in which his party the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are the junior partner , should take a share of the credit for germany 's best quarterly growth results since reunification in 1992 .
figures released on friday showed that germany 's economy grew at its fastest rate for more than 20 years from april to june , outpacing eurozone neighbors and britain .
" our government is good for the economy , the labor market and prosperity .
this has quite obviously made an important contribution to the current economic and employment miracle in germany , " westerwelle said .
in the interview , westerwelle - who is also foreign minister - also announced that plans were being drawn up to simplify the tax system .
need to slash deficit the need to address national budget deficits in the light of the greek debt crisis has meant that german chancellor angela merkel 's coalition is unable to deliver on pre-election promises of tax cuts , choosing instead to slash public spending .
the government hopes to save 80 billion euros by 2014 and in june unveiled the largest package of austerity measures in the country 's history , with deep cuts in social welfare programs and the public sector .
westerwelle 's comments on tax cuts are not likely to go down well in germany with some politicians already calling to ease the impact of budget cuts on the poorer members of society .
the budget expert from the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , carsten schneider has called for the government to take a " more social approach " to its policies as a result of the growth boost .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 15.08.2010 russia begins ban on grain exports after fires devastate crops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heatwave and blazes have destroyed at least a third of crops a ban on russian wheat and grain exports went in to effect on sunday , and is expected to last until the end of the year .
severe drought and wildfires have destroyed the harvest and ravaged agricultural land . a ban on russian grain exports went into effect on sunday , as authorities try to reduce the chance of a food shortage following the destruction of crops in wildfires .
an estimated 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- of agricultural land has been devastated by the fires following the worst heat wave in russian history .
russia is one of the world 's biggest producers of wheat , barley and rye .
however a quarter of the country 's crops have been destroyed , according to president dmitry medvedev .
prime minister vladimir putin banned grain exports in an attempt to keep domestic food costs down , however there is concern that the crop levels are not even enough to supply domestic demand .
putin said the grain crop could be as low as 60 million ton , and 79 million ton is needed to meet domestic consumption .
data from the agricultural ministry shows that even if the ban is lifted , there may not be enough grain to export .
consumers vs exporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread prices are likely to rise in the short term as a result of the ban , world wheat prices have rocketed to a two-year high and there are worries about a crisis in global food supplies .
in a statement , first deputy prime minister viktor zubkov stressed that the government needed to balance the interests of grain traders with the need to maintain stability on the domestic food market .
" we understand the anxiety of our exporters , " he said .
" the ban is a temporary measure . "
" furthermore , we are continually monitoring and analyzing grain , feed and seed supplies on the domestic market , " he added .
some within russia have criticized the ban , saying it will take the country years to regain its international market position and risks driving domestic grain producers out of business .
knock-on effects in europe , middle east the type of wheat russia produces is best suited to making unleavened bread , and much of its wheat is imported to the middle east .
egypt is its largest market , followed by turkey , syria , iran and libya .
in addition to affecting the cost of such food staples as bread , a shortage or hike in the price of grain is expected to have a knock-on effect across several european industries .
in farming , more expensive grain could push up animal feed costs and force farmers to slaughter livestock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer producers say they wo n't feel effects until 2012 european brewing giants such as anheuser-busch inbev have said the rising grain prices will not hit the group until 2012 , as they buy their barley and other grains far in advance .
although europe 's biggest food groups nestle , unilever and danone have said they will be cushioned from the rise in grain prices , smaller and private-label food groups are likely to suffer .
those who are big wheat users such as dutch bakery group csm , or british bread and cake maker premier foods have already suggested they may have to increase prices .
leaders divided on ban the ban came into force on sunday and is due to last until december 31 .
however the russian leadership have different ideas about whether the ban will be extended or lifted .
first deputy prime minister zubkov has said they will discuss after october 1 whether to extend the grain export ban into next year .
an optimistic medvedev has said the ban could be lifted earlier if the harvest permits .
but a more cautious putin has said the ban could last into 2011 .

severe drought and wildfires have destroyed the harvest and ravaged agricultural land . a ban on russian grain exports went into effect on sunday , as authorities try to reduce the chance of a food shortage following the destruction of crops in wildfires .
an estimated 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- of agricultural land has been devastated by the fires following the worst heat wave in russian history .
russia is one of the world 's biggest producers of wheat , barley and rye .
however a quarter of the country 's crops have been destroyed , according to president dmitry medvedev .
prime minister vladimir putin banned grain exports in an attempt to keep domestic food costs down , however there is concern that the crop levels are not even enough to supply domestic demand .
putin said the grain crop could be as low as 60 million ton , and 79 million ton is needed to meet domestic consumption .
data from the agricultural ministry shows that even if the ban is lifted , there may not be enough grain to export .
consumers vs exporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread prices are likely to rise in the short term as a result of the ban , world wheat prices have rocketed to a two-year high and there are worries about a crisis in global food supplies .
in a statement , first deputy prime minister viktor zubkov stressed that the government needed to balance the interests of grain traders with the need to maintain stability on the domestic food market .
" we understand the anxiety of our exporters , " he said .
" the ban is a temporary measure . "
" furthermore , we are continually monitoring and analyzing grain , feed and seed supplies on the domestic market , " he added .
some within russia have criticized the ban , saying it will take the country years to regain its international market position and risks driving domestic grain producers out of business .

egypt is its largest market , followed by turkey , syria , iran and libya .
in addition to affecting the cost of such food staples as bread , a shortage or hike in the price of grain is expected to have a knock-on effect across several european industries .
in farming , more expensive grain could push up animal feed costs and force farmers to slaughter livestock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer producers say they wo n't feel effects until 2012 european brewing giants such as anheuser-busch inbev have said the rising grain prices will not hit the group until 2012 , as they buy their barley and other grains far in advance .
although europe 's biggest food groups nestle , unilever and danone have said they will be cushioned from the rise in grain prices , smaller and private-label food groups are likely to suffer .
those who are big wheat users such as dutch bakery group csm , or british bread and cake maker premier foods have already suggested they may have to increase prices .
leaders divided on ban the ban came into force on sunday and is due to last until december 31 .
however the russian leadership have different ideas about whether the ban will be extended or lifted .
first deputy prime minister zubkov has said they will discuss after october 1 whether to extend the grain export ban into next year .
an optimistic medvedev has said the ban could be lifted earlier if the harvest permits .
but a more cautious putin has said the ban could last into 2011 .

severe drought and wildfires have destroyed the harvest and ravaged agricultural land . a ban on russian grain exports went into effect on sunday , as authorities try to reduce the chance of a food shortage following the destruction of crops in wildfires .
an estimated 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- of agricultural land has been devastated by the fires following the worst heat wave in russian history .
russia is one of the world 's biggest producers of wheat , barley and rye .
however a quarter of the country 's crops have been destroyed , according to president dmitry medvedev .
prime minister vladimir putin banned grain exports in an attempt to keep domestic food costs down , however there is concern that the crop levels are not even enough to supply domestic demand .
putin said the grain crop could be as low as 60 million ton , and 79 million ton is needed to meet domestic consumption .
data from the agricultural ministry shows that even if the ban is lifted , there may not be enough grain to export .
consumers vs exporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread prices are likely to rise in the short term as a result of the ban , world wheat prices have rocketed to a two-year high and there are worries about a crisis in global food supplies .
in a statement , first deputy prime minister viktor zubkov stressed that the government needed to balance the interests of grain traders with the need to maintain stability on the domestic food market .
" we understand the anxiety of our exporters , " he said .
" the ban is a temporary measure . "
" furthermore , we are continually monitoring and analyzing grain , feed and seed supplies on the domestic market , " he added .
some within russia have criticized the ban , saying it will take the country years to regain its international market position and risks driving domestic grain producers out of business .

egypt is its largest market , followed by turkey , syria , iran and libya .
in addition to affecting the cost of such food staples as bread , a shortage or hike in the price of grain is expected to have a knock-on effect across several european industries .
in farming , more expensive grain could push up animal feed costs and force farmers to slaughter livestock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer producers say they wo n't feel effects until 2012 european brewing giants such as anheuser-busch inbev have said the rising grain prices will not hit the group until 2012 , as they buy their barley and other grains far in advance .
although europe 's biggest food groups nestle , unilever and danone have said they will be cushioned from the rise in grain prices , smaller and private-label food groups are likely to suffer .
those who are big wheat users such as dutch bakery group csm , or british bread and cake maker premier foods have already suggested they may have to increase prices .
leaders divided on ban the ban came into force on sunday and is due to last until december 31 .
however the russian leadership have different ideas about whether the ban will be extended or lifted .
first deputy prime minister zubkov has said they will discuss after october 1 whether to extend the grain export ban into next year .
an optimistic medvedev has said the ban could be lifted earlier if the harvest permits .
but a more cautious putin has said the ban could last into 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.08.2010 westerwelle sees room for tax cuts on back of robust growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle has renewed his party 's calls for tax cuts german vice chancellor guido westerwelle says there 's " room for maneuver " for tax cuts in the light of data showing europe 's largest economy posted its strongest quarterly growth in more than 20 years . german vice chancellor guido westerwelle said he was committed to using any increase in revenue from germany 's bumper economic growth to ease the tax burden on germany 's middle classes .
" this government is unwavering in its commitment to relieve the burden on the middle class in the interests of growth , job creation and fairness , " he told german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag .
" where there is room for maneuver , it must be used . "
germany 's strong economic growth of 2.2 percent in the second quarter this year is expected to spur a sharp increase in tax revenues .
analysts at the kiel institute for the world economy estimate that the government could take in 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- more than expected this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strong exports fuelled the rapid growth announced this week westerwelle said that the ruling coalition , in which his party the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are the junior partner , should take a share of the credit for germany 's best quarterly growth results since reunification in 1992 .
figures released on friday showed that germany 's economy grew at its fastest rate for more than 20 years from april to june , outpacing eurozone neighbors and britain .
" our government is good for the economy , the labor market and prosperity .
this has quite obviously made an important contribution to the current economic and employment miracle in germany , " westerwelle said .
in the interview , westerwelle - who is also foreign minister - also announced that plans were being drawn up to simplify the tax system .
need to slash deficit the need to address national budget deficits in the light of the greek debt crisis has meant that german chancellor angela merkel 's coalition is unable to deliver on pre-election promises of tax cuts , choosing instead to slash public spending .
the government hopes to save 80 billion euros by 2014 and in june unveiled the largest package of austerity measures in the country 's history , with deep cuts in social welfare programs and the public sector .
westerwelle 's comments on tax cuts are not likely to go down well in germany with some politicians already calling to ease the impact of budget cuts on the poorer members of society .
the budget expert from the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , carsten schneider has called for the government to take a " more social approach " to its policies as a result of the growth boost .

dw-world.de german economy eclipses growth forecasts official figures released friday show germany 's largest single-quarter economic growth since reunification in 1990 .

following international condemnation , the government is now facing flak closer to home . french police carried out their latest raid on an illegal roma campsite on saturday , as criticism of its policy mounted .
a lawmaker from french president nicolas sarkozy 's ruling ump party , jean-pierre grand , said the government 's policy was " disgraceful " and " reminiscent of roundups during the war . " the latest raid took place in an eastern paris suburb . sarkozy has alleged the illegal camps are centers of trafficking and prostitution .
grand , a representative for the southern herault region , said he had learned that , after arriving early in the morning , the authorities began to " break up families , sending men to one side and women and children on the other , and threatening to separate mothers and children . "
international condemnation france is home to hundreds of thousands of roma or travelling people who are part of long-established communities .
the other main roma population is made up of recent immigrants , mainly from romania and bulgaria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister hortefeux said 40 camps had been dismantled the crackdown is seen to be a response to last month 's attack on a police station in the loire valley town of saint-aignan by a group of young roma .
france 's dismantling of illegal roma camps as part of a crackdown on crime backed by sarkozy has triggered condemnation by the united nations and the council of europe .
on thursday , the vice president of france 's human rights league malik salemkour said that there was a problem of " institutionalized racism " in the country .
the united nations committee on the elimination of racial discrimination is also investigating how travelling communities such as the roma are treated . one committee member said that the french measures were reminiscent of the period of france 's vichy government , which collaborated with nazis occupiers during the second world war .
france defends policy but france 's un ambassador , jacques pellet , rejected accusations that his government had a racist approach to the roma .
he told the meeting on thursday that the " extremely precarious financial situation " of the minority , as well as their roots outside france made " integration difficult . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tactics were likened to those used in vichy france under marshal petain french interior minister brice hortefeux said on thursday that more than 40 roma camps had already been dismantled - a week after authorities embarked on a plan to get rid of illegal camps and enforce mass deportations .
roma , many of whom come from bulgaria or romania , are estimated to total 15,000 in number .
as european union citizens they are entitled to stay in france , but can be deported if they commit a crime .

severe drought and wildfires have destroyed the harvest and ravaged agricultural land . a ban on russian grain exports went into effect on sunday , as authorities try to reduce the chance of a food shortage following the destruction of crops in wildfires .
an estimated 10 million hectares -lrb- 24.7 million acres -rrb- of agricultural land has been devastated by the fires following the worst heat wave in russian history .
russia is one of the world 's biggest producers of wheat , barley and rye .
however a quarter of the country 's crops have been destroyed , according to president dmitry medvedev .
prime minister vladimir putin banned grain exports in an attempt to keep domestic food costs down , however there is concern that the crop levels are not even enough to supply domestic demand .
putin said the grain crop could be as low as 60 million ton , and 79 million ton is needed to meet domestic consumption .
data from the agricultural ministry shows that even if the ban is lifted , there may not be enough grain to export .
consumers vs exporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread prices are likely to rise in the short term as a result of the ban , world wheat prices have rocketed to a two-year high and there are worries about a crisis in global food supplies .
in a statement , first deputy prime minister viktor zubkov stressed that the government needed to balance the interests of grain traders with the need to maintain stability on the domestic food market .
" we understand the anxiety of our exporters , " he said .
" the ban is a temporary measure . "
" furthermore , we are continually monitoring and analyzing grain , feed and seed supplies on the domestic market , " he added .
some within russia have criticized the ban , saying it will take the country years to regain its international market position and risks driving domestic grain producers out of business .
knock-on effects in europe , middle east the type of wheat russia produces is best suited to making unleavened bread , and much of its wheat is imported to the middle east .
egypt is its largest market , followed by turkey , syria , iran and libya .
in addition to affecting the cost of such food staples as bread , a shortage or hike in the price of grain is expected to have a knock-on effect across several european industries .
in farming , more expensive grain could push up animal feed costs and force farmers to slaughter livestock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer producers say they wo n't feel effects until 2012 european brewing giants such as anheuser-busch inbev have said the rising grain prices will not hit the group until 2012 , as they buy their barley and other grains far in advance .
although europe 's biggest food groups nestle , unilever and danone have said they will be cushioned from the rise in grain prices , smaller and private-label food groups are likely to suffer .
those who are big wheat users such as dutch bakery group csm , or british bread and cake maker premier foods have already suggested they may have to increase prices .
leaders divided on ban the ban came into force on sunday and is due to last until december 31 .
however the russian leadership have different ideas about whether the ban will be extended or lifted .
first deputy prime minister zubkov has said they will discuss after october 1 whether to extend the grain export ban into next year .
an optimistic medvedev has said the ban could be lifted earlier if the harvest permits .
but a more cautious putin has said the ban could last into 2011 .

germany 's strong economic growth of 2.2 percent in the second quarter this year is expected to spur a sharp increase in tax revenues .

" this government is unwavering in its commitment to relieve the burden on the middle class in the interests of growth , job creation and fairness , " he told german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag .
" where there is room for maneuver , it must be used . "
germany 's strong economic growth of 2.2 percent in the second quarter this year is expected to spur a sharp increase in tax revenues .
analysts at the kiel institute for the world economy estimate that the government could take in 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- more than expected this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strong exports fuelled the rapid growth announced this week westerwelle said that the ruling coalition , in which his party the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are the junior partner , should take a share of the credit for germany 's best quarterly growth results since reunification in 1992 .
figures released on friday showed that germany 's economy grew at its fastest rate for more than 20 years from april to june , outpacing eurozone neighbors and britain .
" our government is good for the economy , the labor market and prosperity .
this has quite obviously made an important contribution to the current economic and employment miracle in germany , " westerwelle said .
in the interview , westerwelle - who is also foreign minister - also announced that plans were being drawn up to simplify the tax system .
need to slash deficit the need to address national budget deficits in the light of the greek debt crisis has meant that german chancellor angela merkel 's coalition is unable to deliver on pre-election promises of tax cuts , choosing instead to slash public spending .
