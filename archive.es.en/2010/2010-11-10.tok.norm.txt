now the german company says it 's in a position to outgrow its us rival and dominate the market by 2015 .
consumers in the united states are central to its plans . after weathering a difficult year in 2009 and pinning its hopes on the 2010 world cup in south africa , german sporting goods company adidas has surged ahead in profits and now says it wants to outperform leading rival nike .
adidas wants to grow faster than nike through 2015 and increase its turnover by 45-50 percent to 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.4 billion -rrb- .
" we 're hoping this faster rate of growth will let us lay a foundation to be the market leader at a later point in time , " an adidas spokeswoman told deutsche welle .
nike , however , is moving forward with goals of its own .
it hopes to generate 19.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- in revenue by 2015 .
in the first nine months of 2010 , adidas primarily grew in the united states , china and russia , according to the company 's spokeswoman .
most of the growth was generated in the sports style , fashion and lifestyle sectors , as well as the reebok brand , which it bought in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa world cup gave adidas a major sales boost adidas maintains a consistent marketing budget of 13 to 14 percent of its overall turnover.the bavarian-based company now plans to market new clothing designs for teenagers every two weeks .
it also plans to aggressively pursue the young customers on the internet using social networking .
us market vital according to matt powell , an analyst at sportsonesource - a research and data firm based in charlotte , north carolina - the key market for both adidas and nike is the united states .
" the us does about half of the athletic footwear and apparel business in the world , " he told deutsche welle .
" so you 've got the us versus the rest of the world , if you will .
now you 've got some markets – especially china – which are growing very quickly .
but that pales in comparison to the us . "
powell also said that both adidas and reebok had been losing market share in footwear " until very recently . "
" i really think that part of why adidas has struggled in the us is because they really do n't have a clear understanding of what the us consumer wants , " he said . " -lrb- but -rrb- i think they 're doing a much better job today than they were five years ago . "
what the us consumer really wants is fashion , powell said , adding that most athletic footwear " is n't used for sports . "
growth in north america and china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is also a rapidly growing market for adidas and nike some of the highlights of adidas ' quarterly exchange-rate-adjusted figures include a 10 percent increase in turnover for the adidas brand , and a 14 percent increase for the reebok brand .
the company 's overall third-quarter turnover increased in all regions , specifically 14 percent in north america and 9 percent in china .
powell said he believes there is a chance adidas could grow faster than nike in the next five years .
" historically the numbers would say it 's doable , but it 's a pretty steep hill to climb . "

sarkozy wasted no time in signing the bill on wednesday , just hours after the court ruling .
he said in a statement that while he heard the concerns expressed by opponents during the debate , it was his " duty " to ensure the pension fund 's integrity .
" with this law , our redistributive pension system has been saved , " he said .
" french citizens can now be assured that they can count on their retirement and that pension payments will be maintained . "
sarkozy 's right-of-center government insisted the reform , which raises the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the full retirement age from 65 to 67 , was necessary to fill a major budget gap as france 's population ages and few workers are paying into the system .
the law will gradually come into effect in july 2011 and will be fully enacted by 2018 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive strikes and protests against the reform disrupted society socialists vow a repeal opposition socialists and other parties asked the country 's highest court to examine the constitutionality of the law on november 2 , saying it contradicted france 's principles of equality .
the court rejected the challenge , but the socialists have vowed to repeal the law if they win the next presidential election in 2012 .
" the president is confusing appearance with reality , he thinks that by putting his head down and charging forward without listening , he 's showing courage , " said socialist leader martine aubry .
" it would have been courage to put in place a reform that really solves the problem of retirement . "
as the reform was in debate in the legislature , massive protests and nationwide strikes crippled the country 's transportation system and all but shut down the oil industry , leaving many gas stations without fuel for cars .
unions have called for another day of strikes on november 23 , but it was unclear how many would take part , as the public opposition to the bill was running out of steam toward the end of the debate .

lidl has come under particular fire over pay and practices . supermarkets across germany are popular places to buy clothes .
prices are cheap : you can buy a men 's shirt for seven euros -lrb- nine us dollars -rrb- or a pair of women 's trousers for under 10 euros .
however two women from bangladesh are currently on a speaking tour of germany to highlight how these cheap prices come at a human cost .
26-year-old jessmin begum and 36-year-old arifa akter both work as seamstresses in clothes factories in dhaka that make clothes for european stores .
they say the working conditions are terrible and the pay is inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers complain about cramped conditions , dirty water and tough bosses " i 'm proud of my work , especially when i see people here wearing my clothes , " said begum , who works for a factory that supplies clothes to german-based supermarket chain lidl .
" but it makes me mad that what we get for our work in bangladesh is nothing . "
not a living wage as a seamstress , jessmin begum earns around 35 euros a month -lrb- just under 4,000 bangladesh taka -rrb- .
the monthly rent for a one room apartment in dhaka is around 25 euros a month .
" it is not even close to the living wage we have calculated , " said khorshed alam from the campaigning group alternative movement for resources and freedom society -lrb- amrf -rrb- .
with calculations based on someone working a 12- to 14-hour day , the amrf estimates around 5,000 taka a month -lrb- 52 euros -rrb- is necessary for a single worker .
a family needs to earn around 9-10,000 taka .
dirty water , mean bosses , unpaid overtime the two seamstresses are using their tour of germany to highlight how bad working conditions are in the factories .
" the drinking water is dirty and we are packed in with little space between the machines , " said begum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessmin begum has been working as a seamstress in dhaka for eight years " our supervisors insult us and put us under pressure to work harder .
almost every day i do overtime and i hardly ever come home much earlier than midnight , " she added .
the workers have no sick pay or other benefits , so most seamstresses continue to work even when ill .
highlighting the problem jessmin and arifa 's tour of germany was organized by the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- , which campaigns worldwide to promote better working conditions and fair wages .
the ccc wants international corporations to stick to their pledges to provide better labor conditions .
" for years companies have been saying they are willing to meet certain standards , but it 's only on paper , not in actions , " said the ccc 's gisela burckhardt .
" we want a proper legal framework so that companies can see the impact of their activities on the environment and people in other countries , " burckhardt argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this dhaka garment factory was visited by the ccc in 2009 khorshed alam from the amrf added that it is also the responsibility of the bangladeshi government to monitor the brands which manufacture clothes in the country , and to ensure they implement local labor laws .
making consumers aware in addition to putting pressure on manufacturers and local governments , the tour aims to give consumers more awareness of the origin of their cheap shirts and trousers .
" i came here because the people who buy our products have no idea where they came from , or how much we suffer , " said begum .
the amrf want consumers to question companies like lidl who sell cheap clothes , while claiming they pay their workers well .
in response to the claims , a spokesperson for lidl said they completely oppose any form of child labor and violations of workers ' rights .
they also added that lidl was the first german discount store to join the business social compliance initiative which works to improve working conditions in supply networks worldwide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 10.11.2010 security flaw discovered in german digital id card software großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new electronic id card was released on november 1 one day after its release , the software used to read new german id cards is shown to be vulnerable to attack .
the federal office for information security has removed links to the program from its website . jan schejbal , a german computer security researcher living in sweden , on tuesday described a way to hack the new electronic german id card software .
the federal office responsible for the program stopped allowing the software to be downloaded on wednesday . the new cards , which became available november 1 and will gradually replace current german cards , contain an rfid wireless chip - the same kind found in many contactless security or payment keycards .
the chip stores digital versions of the card holder 's photo , name , address , date of birth , height , eye and hair color and location of issuance . the interior ministry and the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- have claimed the cards will help the government provide easy-to-use digital signatures and other government services , as well as protection against online scams and phishing attacks .
germans can also use the ids in place of a passport when traveling within the european union . spoofing the server but to be useful to individuals , the digital information on the cards needs to be accessed with a card reader .
it 's the ausweisapp -lrb- " id app " -rrb- software that runs the card reader which is flawed , according to schejbal . after downloading the first version of ausweisapp from a german government website , he noticed a major flaw when the program checks for updates .
the software does not verify the origin of a digital security -lrb- ssl -rrb- certificate , which leaves the program open to a spoof attack that conceivably could lead to the download of malicious software . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia has had digital id cards for eight years " the electronic id itself may have quite a high security level , " said schejbal in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" however , this security becomes worthless if the framework which is used to access this secure core is insecure and allows compromising overall security . " had the new electronic id card already been widely used , the security flaw in updating would have been significant , according to karsten nohl , an independent security expert based in berlin . " fortunately , that is not the case and the bug can be fixed swiftly , " he told deutsche welle .
" this vulnerability is another reminder of the complexity of the id card security system , not all of which has been tested rigorously . " in a statement to the german tech news website heise.de , the bsi said it was looking into the update issue .
it also removed the software from its website to prevent more people from downloading the flawed program . " the media has been made aware of a perceived vulnerability in the software ausweisapp necessary for the eid feature of the new id card , " it wrote .
bsi did not reply to deutsche welle 's request for comment .
" if a vulnerability exists in the software , the bsi will provide a new version of the software without delay and will inform the public accordingly . " digital id cards expanding across europe digital ids have been spreading across the continent in recent years .
estonia has had one for nearly a decade , with a slew of electronic government services , and legally binding digital signatures to go along with it .
belgium , sweden , spain , portugal all currently have electronic id cards , and there are plans in place to release such cards in luxembourg and the czech republic . while schejbal added that he is not opposed to the concept of an electronic id , he advised germans to avoid the cards for as long as possible . " it is not secure , and it will put the user at risk , " he wrote .

now the german company says it 's in a position to outgrow its us rival and dominate the market by 2015 .
consumers in the united states are central to its plans . after weathering a difficult year in 2009 and pinning its hopes on the 2010 world cup in south africa , german sporting goods company adidas has surged ahead in profits and now says it wants to outperform leading rival nike .
adidas wants to grow faster than nike through 2015 and increase its turnover by 45-50 percent to 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.4 billion -rrb- .
" we 're hoping this faster rate of growth will let us lay a foundation to be the market leader at a later point in time , " an adidas spokeswoman told deutsche welle .
nike , however , is moving forward with goals of its own .
it hopes to generate 19.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- in revenue by 2015 .
in the first nine months of 2010 , adidas primarily grew in the united states , china and russia , according to the company 's spokeswoman .
most of the growth was generated in the sports style , fashion and lifestyle sectors , as well as the reebok brand , which it bought in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa world cup gave adidas a major sales boost adidas maintains a consistent marketing budget of 13 to 14 percent of its overall turnover.the bavarian-based company now plans to market new clothing designs for teenagers every two weeks .
it also plans to aggressively pursue the young customers on the internet using social networking .
us market vital according to matt powell , an analyst at sportsonesource - a research and data firm based in charlotte , north carolina - the key market for both adidas and nike is the united states .
" the us does about half of the athletic footwear and apparel business in the world , " he told deutsche welle .
" so you 've got the us versus the rest of the world , if you will .
now you 've got some markets – especially china – which are growing very quickly .
but that pales in comparison to the us . "
powell also said that both adidas and reebok had been losing market share in footwear " until very recently . "
" i really think that part of why adidas has struggled in the us is because they really do n't have a clear understanding of what the us consumer wants , " he said . " -lrb- but -rrb- i think they 're doing a much better job today than they were five years ago . "
what the us consumer really wants is fashion , powell said , adding that most athletic footwear " is n't used for sports . "
growth in north america and china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is also a rapidly growing market for adidas and nike some of the highlights of adidas ' quarterly exchange-rate-adjusted figures include a 10 percent increase in turnover for the adidas brand , and a 14 percent increase for the reebok brand .
the company 's overall third-quarter turnover increased in all regions , specifically 14 percent in north america and 9 percent in china .
powell said he believes there is a chance adidas could grow faster than nike in the next five years .
" historically the numbers would say it 's doable , but it 's a pretty steep hill to climb . "

lidl has come under particular fire over pay and practices . supermarkets across germany are popular places to buy clothes .
prices are cheap : you can buy a men 's shirt for seven euros -lrb- nine us dollars -rrb- or a pair of women 's trousers for under 10 euros .
however two women from bangladesh are currently on a speaking tour of germany to highlight how these cheap prices come at a human cost .
26-year-old jessmin begum and 36-year-old arifa akter both work as seamstresses in clothes factories in dhaka that make clothes for european stores .
they say the working conditions are terrible and the pay is inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers complain about cramped conditions , dirty water and tough bosses " i 'm proud of my work , especially when i see people here wearing my clothes , " said begum , who works for a factory that supplies clothes to german-based supermarket chain lidl .
" but it makes me mad that what we get for our work in bangladesh is nothing . "
not a living wage as a seamstress , jessmin begum earns around 35 euros a month -lrb- just under 4,000 bangladesh taka -rrb- .
the monthly rent for a one room apartment in dhaka is around 25 euros a month .
" it is not even close to the living wage we have calculated , " said khorshed alam from the campaigning group alternative movement for resources and freedom society -lrb- amrf -rrb- .
with calculations based on someone working a 12- to 14-hour day , the amrf estimates around 5,000 taka a month -lrb- 52 euros -rrb- is necessary for a single worker .
a family needs to earn around 9-10,000 taka .
dirty water , mean bosses , unpaid overtime the two seamstresses are using their tour of germany to highlight how bad working conditions are in the factories .
" the drinking water is dirty and we are packed in with little space between the machines , " said begum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessmin begum has been working as a seamstress in dhaka for eight years " our supervisors insult us and put us under pressure to work harder .
almost every day i do overtime and i hardly ever come home much earlier than midnight , " she added .
the workers have no sick pay or other benefits , so most seamstresses continue to work even when ill .
highlighting the problem jessmin and arifa 's tour of germany was organized by the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- , which campaigns worldwide to promote better working conditions and fair wages .
the ccc wants international corporations to stick to their pledges to provide better labor conditions .
" for years companies have been saying they are willing to meet certain standards , but it 's only on paper , not in actions , " said the ccc 's gisela burckhardt .
" we want a proper legal framework so that companies can see the impact of their activities on the environment and people in other countries , " burckhardt argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this dhaka garment factory was visited by the ccc in 2009 khorshed alam from the amrf added that it is also the responsibility of the bangladeshi government to monitor the brands which manufacture clothes in the country , and to ensure they implement local labor laws .
making consumers aware in addition to putting pressure on manufacturers and local governments , the tour aims to give consumers more awareness of the origin of their cheap shirts and trousers .
" i came here because the people who buy our products have no idea where they came from , or how much we suffer , " said begum .
the amrf want consumers to question companies like lidl who sell cheap clothes , while claiming they pay their workers well .
in response to the claims , a spokesperson for lidl said they completely oppose any form of child labor and violations of workers ' rights .

with the spotlight on south korea , the government there has taken a number of steps to ensure the forum goes off without a hitch . south korea is in the grips of g20 fever.television ads play around the clock proclaiming korea ’ s readiness to host the summit .
banners hung around seoul urge residents to say hello and be extra courteous to the visiting foreigners .
the south korean government is taking preparations for the g20 very seriously .
it ’ s the largest international gathering the country has held since the 2002 world cup .
this week ’ s summit also marks the first time a non-g8 and asian nation has hosted the economic forum .
south korea proud to host g20 and considering that several decades ago , south korea was one of the world ’ s poorest nations , its quick rise to the top makes it a model for other nations to emulate , says un secretary general ban ki moon .
the former south korean foreign minister says he ’ s proud of his nation ’ s accomplishments that have been made in the light of its division and war with north korea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea has undertaken the largest-ever security operation he spoke during a press briefing today in seoul : " i think we meet at a critical moment , the spotlight is on korea and is the first g20 summit in an emerging market economy .
korea is a bridge between the developed and developing world .
this role has never been more necessary and important and so there is something very special about this g20 moment . "
activists protest against " unequal economic policies " but some opposed to the g20 are using this moment to raise attention what they call its flawed economic policies .
an umbrella organization representing 80 south korean labor and civic groups says the top economies have done little to help the world ’ s poor and offset global unemployment , which they say is the highest in years .
chun hyoung baek of the civic group people ’ s solidarity for participatory democracy delivered the activists ’ official statement .
she spoke through an interpreter : " we call upon the g20 to regulate financial capital , which have brought suffering to so many people .
we call on the g20 to tax speculators and use the revenues to expand welfare .
the g20 has revamped the international monetary fund whose structural adjustment programs have devastated the lives of people all around the world . "
and now as the g20 gets under way , korean and foreign activists are taking their message to the streets of seoul .
earlier this week , tens of thousands of protesters rallied against the g20 .
they were met by squads of korean riot police , who have been put on high alert ahead of the summit .
security tight in seoul some reports say the police used pepper spray to hold demonstrators back .
to keep protests like this under control and away from the g20 venues , seoul authorities have created a two kilometer buffer zone around the convention center .
it ’ s the largest security operation the nation has undertaken , according to the national police agency .
but south korea ’ s measures have only aggravated some protestors .
kim young hoon , president of the korean confederation of trade unions , says that president lee myung bak is denying their right to protest during the summit .
violence between trade unions and police has erupted in the past during anti free trade rallies .
police have been criticized for turning water cannons on protestors .
bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate in seoul to draw attention to global poverty issues and kim says that he can not ensure that his members won ’ t resort to violence again , if police prevent them from demonstrating : " excessive use of force to crack down on demonstrations and rallies , to crack down and oppress our rights , will induce or provoke the demonstrations to become violent , that nobody wants . "
south korean riot police are prepared to confront activist groups on thursday , the first day of the g20 summit , as protestors plan to march through the capital .

sarkozy wasted no time in signing the bill on wednesday , just hours after the court ruling .
he said in a statement that while he heard the concerns expressed by opponents during the debate , it was his " duty " to ensure the pension fund 's integrity .
" with this law , our redistributive pension system has been saved , " he said .
" french citizens can now be assured that they can count on their retirement and that pension payments will be maintained . "
sarkozy 's right-of-center government insisted the reform , which raises the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the full retirement age from 65 to 67 , was necessary to fill a major budget gap as france 's population ages and few workers are paying into the system .
the law will gradually come into effect in july 2011 and will be fully enacted by 2018 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive strikes and protests against the reform disrupted society socialists vow a repeal opposition socialists and other parties asked the country 's highest court to examine the constitutionality of the law on november 2 , saying it contradicted france 's principles of equality .
the court rejected the challenge , but the socialists have vowed to repeal the law if they win the next presidential election in 2012 .
" the president is confusing appearance with reality , he thinks that by putting his head down and charging forward without listening , he 's showing courage , " said socialist leader martine aubry .
" it would have been courage to put in place a reform that really solves the problem of retirement . "
as the reform was in debate in the legislature , massive protests and nationwide strikes crippled the country 's transportation system and all but shut down the oil industry , leaving many gas stations without fuel for cars .
unions have called for another day of strikes on november 23 , but it was unclear how many would take part , as the public opposition to the bill was running out of steam toward the end of the debate .

lidl has come under particular fire over pay and practices . supermarkets across germany are popular places to buy clothes .
prices are cheap : you can buy a men 's shirt for seven euros -lrb- nine us dollars -rrb- or a pair of women 's trousers for under 10 euros .
however two women from bangladesh are currently on a speaking tour of germany to highlight how these cheap prices come at a human cost .
26-year-old jessmin begum and 36-year-old arifa akter both work as seamstresses in clothes factories in dhaka that make clothes for european stores .
they say the working conditions are terrible and the pay is inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers complain about cramped conditions , dirty water and tough bosses " i 'm proud of my work , especially when i see people here wearing my clothes , " said begum , who works for a factory that supplies clothes to german-based supermarket chain lidl .
" but it makes me mad that what we get for our work in bangladesh is nothing . "
not a living wage as a seamstress , jessmin begum earns around 35 euros a month -lrb- just under 4,000 bangladesh taka -rrb- .
the monthly rent for a one room apartment in dhaka is around 25 euros a month .
" it is not even close to the living wage we have calculated , " said khorshed alam from the campaigning group alternative movement for resources and freedom society -lrb- amrf -rrb- .
with calculations based on someone working a 12- to 14-hour day , the amrf estimates around 5,000 taka a month -lrb- 52 euros -rrb- is necessary for a single worker .
a family needs to earn around 9-10,000 taka .
dirty water , mean bosses , unpaid overtime the two seamstresses are using their tour of germany to highlight how bad working conditions are in the factories .
" the drinking water is dirty and we are packed in with little space between the machines , " said begum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessmin begum has been working as a seamstress in dhaka for eight years " our supervisors insult us and put us under pressure to work harder .
almost every day i do overtime and i hardly ever come home much earlier than midnight , " she added .
the workers have no sick pay or other benefits , so most seamstresses continue to work even when ill .
highlighting the problem jessmin and arifa 's tour of germany was organized by the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- , which campaigns worldwide to promote better working conditions and fair wages .
the ccc wants international corporations to stick to their pledges to provide better labor conditions .
" for years companies have been saying they are willing to meet certain standards , but it 's only on paper , not in actions , " said the ccc 's gisela burckhardt .
" we want a proper legal framework so that companies can see the impact of their activities on the environment and people in other countries , " burckhardt argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this dhaka garment factory was visited by the ccc in 2009 khorshed alam from the amrf added that it is also the responsibility of the bangladeshi government to monitor the brands which manufacture clothes in the country , and to ensure they implement local labor laws .
making consumers aware in addition to putting pressure on manufacturers and local governments , the tour aims to give consumers more awareness of the origin of their cheap shirts and trousers .
" i came here because the people who buy our products have no idea where they came from , or how much we suffer , " said begum .
the amrf want consumers to question companies like lidl who sell cheap clothes , while claiming they pay their workers well .
in response to the claims , a spokesperson for lidl said they completely oppose any form of child labor and violations of workers ' rights .
they also added that lidl was the first german discount store to join the business social compliance initiative which works to improve working conditions in supply networks worldwide .

the case involves airlines that fly around the globe , from air france-klm , to british airways and quantas . the european union 's competition watchdog issued fines tuesday to 11 airlines totaling 799.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- for running a global cargo cartel .
the cargo carriers were found to have coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security over a six-year period , between 1999 and 2006 .
" with today 's decision , the european commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate cartel behavior , " eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner almunia said the case was " deplorable " the fine imposed is one of the biggest in eu history .
the bloc 's rules forbid most forms of price fixing among competitors .
" it is deplorable that so many major airlines coordinated their pricing to the detriment of european businesses and european consumers , " almunia added .
no fine for the whistleblower air france-klm was hit with the largest fine of 310 million euros .
british airways came in second , having to pay a 104-million-euro penalty .
luxembourg 's cargolux will have to pay 79.9 million euros , while scandinavian carrier sas was ordered to pay 70.2 million euros .
other airlines involved in the cartel and slapped with fines were singapore airlines , air canada , quantas , lan chile , martinair and japan airlines .
the commission said it dropped charges against eleven other airlines , including german carrier lufthansa and its subsidiary swiss air , because it was the first to provide information about the cartel .
according to the commission the cartel the airlines began fixing fuel-surcharges in 1999 .
later the cooperation expanded with the introduction of a security surcharge and refused to pay a commission on those surcharges to their clients .
" by refusing to pay a commission , the airlines ensured that surcharges did not become subject to competition through the granting of discounts to customers .
such practices are in breach of the eu competition rules , " the commission said in a statement .

his book is unlikely to help heal the rift that emerged between the us and europe while he was in office . the 43rd us president 's apparent mission to have his two terms in the white house reassessed and his reputation rehabilitated through his new book , " decision points , " has many europeans shaking their heads . and it 's not just the most inflammatory excerpts - such as bush 's assertion that water-boarding of terror suspects saved lives - that are causing an outcry . bush 's supporters in the us say that every president has the right to defend his record ; " decision points " shows the former president as a man who was ideologically consistent during his eight years in office . his detractors counter that the president 's mistakes and his determination to follow ill-thought-out policies - without a thought for a possible , rectifying change of direction - plunged the us into a decade of war and the worst financial crisis in over 80 years .
while george w. bush may have been a good guy with a difficult job , they say , he does n't deserve to be rehabilitated via his memoirs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush left office with two wars and an economic crisis raging if bush 's single-minded and heavy-handed approach to afghanistan and iraq in the wake of the terror attacks of 9/11 were damaging to his relations with his european allies at the time , his newly released memoirs appear to be giving european readers the chance get angry all over again . europeans , even allies , dismissed as irrelevant " in my opinion , there ’ s been no change in perception of bush in europe , " dr. henning meyer , a transatlantic relations expert at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle . " his legacy projects , such as iraq and afghanistan , are still the main issues associated with his presidency and of course europeans are still affected by these and in most cases are still in opposition to a certain degree .
if you remember , bush ’ s war on terror effectively split europe .
so these things have not been forgotten . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush says the uk 's perception of him does n't matter in " decision points , " bush is dismissive about those europeans who had taken a risk to follow him into war in iraq , and he talks frankly about his reputation in the one country whose leaders followed him most obediently of all : england .
" it does n't matter how people perceive me in england , " he writes .
" it just does n't matter any more .
and frankly , at times , it did n't matter then . " in a veiled dig at what he saw at the time as the rest of europe 's lack of stomach for the fight , bush writes : " people in europe said : ' ah , man , he 's a religious fanatic , cowboy , simpleton . '

if you believe that freedom is universal , then you should n't be surprised when people take courageous measures to live in a free society . " he reserves his most scathing treatment for those european leaders who disappointed him most , especially during the iraq war : former german chancellor gerhard schroeder comes in for even worse treatment than former french president jacques chirac , schroeder 's ally in the european anti-war opposition . german emotions still raw over bush 's rush to war in the book , bush accuses schroeder of abusing his trust after allegedly telling the president in 2002 , before the invasion of iraq the following year , that " what goes for afghanistan also goes for iraq .
nations which support terrorism must accept the consequences .
if you go forward fast and resolutely , i am on your side . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush did n't trust schroeder after the latter withdrew his support however , struggling in his re-election campaign in the fall of that year , schroeder hitched his wagon to the huge swell of anti-war feeling in germany and across europe .
he claims bush is lying when he says that he had offered his support for an invasion , and that he 'd made it clear all along that his support was conditional on whether iraq really had weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- . " schroeder 's support -lrb- for the invasion of iraq -rrb- was conditional on evidence being found of terrorists being harbored in iraq , so when there was no evidence delivered , he withdrew his support , " lse professor meyer told deutsche welle .
" bush is attempting to polish his own picture of this situation with the germans by saying that the breakdown in relations was not his fault and that it was schroeder who turned opinion against him . " the bush legacy is still powerfully felt in the united states : the armed forces are embroiled in the two wars he started ; the financial system is struggling to pull out of an overwhelming crisis , and politicians are scrambling to rebuild their credibility on the world stage . but the ripples from his eight-year presidency continue to be felt in europe as well .
under his leadership , decades of trust and cooperation between the us and european governments was damaged . according to thomas klau , a transatlantic relations expert at the european council for foreign relations , the memoir provides new fodder for europeans who are skeptical about the us political system . " europeans , and germans in particular , are still amazed that the us political system has the potential to elect such an incompetent leader who has no respect for western values , " klau said .
" while obama gave some hope , the germans are now saddened to see that a discredited party such as the republicans can be re-elected as the majority in the house of representatives . " germans see the republican mid-term victory as proof that " the us system and electorate has a very short memory and very little wisdom . " european anger reignited over torture statements so far , european reaction to the bush memoirs has been heavily affected by comments in the book that seem to advocate torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims water boarding extracted vital information for meyer , the water-boarding comments are " a very clear example of the philosophical differences between the bush administration and the europeans . " " there is a huge difference in what bush thought was acceptable in terms of the war on terror and what the europeans thought , " he added .
" bush saw approaches such as water-boarding as not a breaking of any laws but a legitimate bending of them . " moreover , bush " made bold statements " that the information gained from water-boarding stopped an attack on london - a claim the uk refutes . " most people in europe say that there were other ways of getting the information and that bush ’ s assertions are just not true , " meyer said . severe - and lasting - damage ? the response to his memoirs suggests that the damage bush did to his country 's reputation in europe remains severe . " bush 's was the worst us presidency that europe and the world has ever seen and his legacy , in political and economic terms , will be seen as one of disaster , " said klau .
" few people will expect to see any change in this perception arising from his memoirs .
in fact , it 's highly likely that his already terrible reputation in europe will take an even worse turn . " bush may have come out with his book to try and put the record straight in his own words .
but in doing so , at least in europe , it appears that he has taken a big stick to a hornet 's nest of his own making . author : nick amies editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the energy challenge is one of the greatest tests europe has to face , " oettinger said on wednesday at the presentation of the bloc 's energy strategy for the next 10 years . " putting our energy system onto a new , more sustainable and secure path may take time but ambitious decisions need to be taken now . " the energy chief said individual governments ' priorities in the 27-member bloc had limited european energy policy in the past , and that this must change . " to have an efficient , competitive and low-carbon economy we have to europeanize our energy policy and focus on a few , but pressing , priorities , " oettinger said . energy connections between member states tend to be scattered and inefficient , a hangover from pre-eu times when most national grids were the property of state-run monopolies . " failing to achieve a well-functioning european energy market will only increase the costs for consumers and put europe 's competitiveness at risk , " he added . ending energy isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : encouraging energy savings was another of the report 's priorities in the context of russia 's gas disputes with its neighbours in recent years – and their knock-on consequences for europe – oettinger indicated that security was another reason for integrating networks , so as to prevent states from becoming overly dependent upon a single energy provider . " by 2015 , no member state should be isolated , " a european commission statement said on wednesday . oettinger said the eu 's executive would propose legislation in five key areas in the coming 18 months , including energy efficiency measures for businesses and private housholds . it will also push eu member states to accept a deadline of 2015 to link up all 27 national energy markets . the eu as well as european countries will have to update the energy grid to allow for decentralized power generation and distribution , according to stefan gsaenger , secretary general of the world wind energy association . " up to 10 or 20 years ago in germany we had dozens of huge power stations , " he told deutsche welle .
" today there are hundreds of thousands of power generation units in solar systems and wind farms that are all over germany .
that completely changes the grid . " gsaenger said he expects generation of local , small-scale renewable energy generation to continue increasing as the eu member states strive reach their announced goal of collectively sourcing 20 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2020 , which implies about 35 percent of electricity . funding for electricity grid improvements will come from taxpayers and power companies . german chancellor angela merkel had said earlier that european members should ensure new energy projects are commercially viable .

the case involves airlines that fly around the globe , from air france-klm , to british airways and quantas . the european union 's competition watchdog issued fines tuesday to 11 airlines totaling 799.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- for running a global cargo cartel .
the cargo carriers were found to have coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security over a six-year period , between 1999 and 2006 .
" with today 's decision , the european commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate cartel behavior , " eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner almunia said the case was " deplorable " the fine imposed is one of the biggest in eu history .
the bloc 's rules forbid most forms of price fixing among competitors .
" it is deplorable that so many major airlines coordinated their pricing to the detriment of european businesses and european consumers , " almunia added .
no fine for the whistleblower air france-klm was hit with the largest fine of 310 million euros .
british airways came in second , having to pay a 104-million-euro penalty .
luxembourg 's cargolux will have to pay 79.9 million euros , while scandinavian carrier sas was ordered to pay 70.2 million euros .
other airlines involved in the cartel and slapped with fines were singapore airlines , air canada , quantas , lan chile , martinair and japan airlines .
the commission said it dropped charges against eleven other airlines , including german carrier lufthansa and its subsidiary swiss air , because it was the first to provide information about the cartel .
according to the commission the cartel the airlines began fixing fuel-surcharges in 1999 .
later the cooperation expanded with the introduction of a security surcharge and refused to pay a commission on those surcharges to their clients .
" by refusing to pay a commission , the airlines ensured that surcharges did not become subject to competition through the granting of discounts to customers .
such practices are in breach of the eu competition rules , " the commission said in a statement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 10.11.2010 german economic sages point to increased growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang franz and his team of ' wise men ' have n't delivered such good news for some time the german government 's team of five economic ' wise men ' have predicted consistent economic growth , lower unemployment , and reduced budget deficits for 2010 and 2011 .
however , they have warned against sudden tax cuts . the german council of economic experts predicted on wednesday that germany 's economy will grow by 3.7 percent in 2010 , and by 2.2 percent in 2011 - a prognosis that even exceeds the latest official estimates from chancellor angela merkel 's government .
" the pleasing upward trend in the german economy offers the chance for a stable , if relatively flat , path of growth , " the council 's chairman , wolfgang franz said .
" also , the government is in a position to considerably bolster these chances with solid economic policies . "
increased consumption , investments and demand for german exports are fuelling the recovery , and should lead to reduced levels of unemployment and state borrowing , the experts said .
however , they also cautioned that a repeat of germany 's so-called economic miracle in the post-war era was not on the cards .
the council , often referred to as the five wise men of the economy -lrb- in fact , one is a woman -rrb- , was set up in 1963 to advise the government on economic policy . " i think we are all delighted that the situation this year looks a lot more optimistic than last year , " chancellor angela merkel said on receiving the report , promising to continue with governent plans to save money .
" we are well aware that the structure of our current budget - designed as a response to the recent crisis with over 50 percent of spending going towards social security - is not a sustainable model for the future , especially considering our ageing population . "
taxation and borrowing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government says reducing borrowing still takes priority over tax cuts the chairman of the expert panel , wolfgang franz , told chancellor merkel that her government could support the fragile growth by issuing stricter regulations on the global financial sector and continuing to consolidate german overspending .
he also issued two warnings to governments , employers , and trade unions - advising against " rash cuts in taxes " and " excessive increases in wages . "
tax cuts were a major campaign platform of merkel 's pro-business coalition partners , the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , and the party - which is struggling in the polls - is keen that they are introduced sooner rather than later .
economic minister rainer bruederle , a member of the fdp , told german public television on wednesday that his party would be patient before cutting taxes , but the cuts would come .
" not today , but soon .
because if the economy really does grow as predicted , then - after implementing the measures to balance the budget that we have made priority number one - there might be a bit of lee-way for some slight cuts in the middle-bracket . "
bruederle said .
" but , as our coalition keeps saying , we must reduce the budget deficit as a short-term priority , and then think about taxation in the medium term . "
bruederle said that the government might be in a position to start the process by 2012 - especially in light of the panel 's prediction that germany might dip below the prescribed eu budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 .
but the economists see this matter very differently , arguing that there will be no room for tax cuts during the current legislative period -lrb- which ends in 2013 -rrb- , and saying it may not even be possible early in the next one .
instead , the group suggested that berlin might be forced to raise taxes slightly in order to meet its target of cutting 80 billion euros in spending between 2010 and 2014 .
job market to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to target germany 's unemployment problem the german economic experts also predicted reduced joblessness for 2011 , with germany set to dip below 3 million unemployed next year .
earlier in the week , buoyed by the prospect of good news from her experts , chancellor merkel told the focus news magazine that full employment was a major goal for her government .
" i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " she said .
" we must , and can , get these people back to work . "
however , the cologne-based institute for economic research predicts that a rate of around 5 percent unemployment , meaning roughly 2 million germans out of work , would be a more realistic goal in the foreseeable future .
" at that point the structural issues behind joblessness start to become a problem , " the institute 's president michael huether explained .
" things like a lack of qualifications , the unsuitability of candidates for the jobs on offer , and vice versa . "
economic envy in the english press germany is leading eu member states as the bloc struggles to emerge from recession - something which has caused the british media to take note in recent weeks .
as britain 's coalition government , elected earlier this year , looks to introduce tough spending cuts and jumpstart the faltering economy , more and more media outlets are reevaluating the merits of the relatively export-heavy , frugal economic policies which germans call " rhineland capitalism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's new leadership duo are making drastic cuts for little reward " a decade ago we considered the german economy a write-off .
now -lrb- prime minister -rrb- david cameron looks to angela merkel for inspiration , " a columnist at the left-leaning guardian newspaper , david gow , wrote in a recent commentary .
germany only partially followed the anglo-american movement towards dependence on the financial and services sectors in the latter half of the 20th century , preferring to maintain some industrial output and favoring a relatively cautious banking community .
the decision was often derided as backward , and even harmful to less cautious western neighbors , but now british commentators are asking whether the same caution has proved the key to a relatively swift recovery .
even the conservative newspaper , the times , has recently turned against the higher-risk capitalism favored in the english-speaking world , suggesting that germany 's export-heavy model is " leaving britain behind . "
yet there are other voices in the uk , like london-based financial analysts lombard street research , who point to decreasing demand in china and continued economic problems in the us and much of southern europe , suggesting that this could mean that germany 's export-driven recovery might falter in the near future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 10.11.2010 opinion : a guilty conscience is no basis for membership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how should the eu deal with turkey 's membership hopes ?
many eu politicians have a guilty conscience over keeping ankara waiting .
but that 's a poor basis for making decisions , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . many eu politicians have a guilty conscience .
they do n't know how to deal with ankara ’ s hopes for speedy progress in the country 's bid for eu membership .
turkey is after all an official membership candidate and is trying to implement the reforms that brussels is calling for .
and from ankara 's perspective , this should eventually lead to full membership once the eu 's demands have been met .
so far , all previous membership candidates have eventually become full members .
but it 's clear that a guilty conscience alone is a poor basis for granting membership .
many european governments today regret that they – or their predecessors – have in past years given the green light for membership talks with turkey .
the doubts within the eu about whether turkey is fit for membership have since then only increased , and the arguments against membership have not changed .
they are not about individual points of criticism – be it cyprus or freedom of expression – but they are , in fact of a more fundamental nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations will continue to improve , but there wo n't be full membership , says hasselbach for instance , the eu still struggles with the consequences of its two previous expansion rounds in 2004 and 2007 .
and even if past expansion was not a mistake – the new members have significantly changed the european union .
the bloc 's ability to speak with one voice seems to be faltering – simply because the member states are too diverse and different .
these changes have to sink in and this process is bound to take time .
accepting turkey with its different history and tradition would from today 's perspective lead to a final stop to european integration .
has anyone ever thought of the fact that turkey would soon surpass germany as the most populous eu member state ?
turkey as a member would therefore have the right to demand more official posts than any of the other countries .
this would change the eu to an extent likely to cause sharp opposition .
and no one can guarantee that turkey will remain a secular state for good .
none of this calls into question the fact that the eu needs turkey and that turkey needs the eu .
the good trade relations and security cooperation should be built upon .
both sides are certain to do this for their very own interests .
and turkey is likely to continue its reform path even without the prospect of eu membership .
that 's why it ’ s wrong to argue that without membership talks , ankara will abandon reforms and look for other partners .
both sides need to look at the current situation .
it 's not a question of all or nothing .
and the eu should be honest with ankara that at the end of the path will be a closer relationship than today – but no full membership .

" the energy challenge is one of the greatest tests europe has to face , " oettinger said on wednesday at the presentation of the bloc 's energy strategy for the next 10 years . " putting our energy system onto a new , more sustainable and secure path may take time but ambitious decisions need to be taken now . " the energy chief said individual governments ' priorities in the 27-member bloc had limited european energy policy in the past , and that this must change . " to have an efficient , competitive and low-carbon economy we have to europeanize our energy policy and focus on a few , but pressing , priorities , " oettinger said . energy connections between member states tend to be scattered and inefficient , a hangover from pre-eu times when most national grids were the property of state-run monopolies . " failing to achieve a well-functioning european energy market will only increase the costs for consumers and put europe 's competitiveness at risk , " he added . ending energy isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : encouraging energy savings was another of the report 's priorities in the context of russia 's gas disputes with its neighbours in recent years – and their knock-on consequences for europe – oettinger indicated that security was another reason for integrating networks , so as to prevent states from becoming overly dependent upon a single energy provider . " by 2015 , no member state should be isolated , " a european commission statement said on wednesday . oettinger said the eu 's executive would propose legislation in five key areas in the coming 18 months , including energy efficiency measures for businesses and private housholds . it will also push eu member states to accept a deadline of 2015 to link up all 27 national energy markets . the eu as well as european countries will have to update the energy grid to allow for decentralized power generation and distribution , according to stefan gsaenger , secretary general of the world wind energy association . " up to 10 or 20 years ago in germany we had dozens of huge power stations , " he told deutsche welle .
" today there are hundreds of thousands of power generation units in solar systems and wind farms that are all over germany .
that completely changes the grid . " gsaenger said he expects generation of local , small-scale renewable energy generation to continue increasing as the eu member states strive reach their announced goal of collectively sourcing 20 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2020 , which implies about 35 percent of electricity . funding for electricity grid improvements will come from taxpayers and power companies . german chancellor angela merkel had said earlier that european members should ensure new energy projects are commercially viable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 10.11.2010 opinion : a guilty conscience is no basis for membership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how should the eu deal with turkey 's membership hopes ?
many eu politicians have a guilty conscience over keeping ankara waiting .
but that 's a poor basis for making decisions , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . many eu politicians have a guilty conscience .
they do n't know how to deal with ankara ’ s hopes for speedy progress in the country 's bid for eu membership .
turkey is after all an official membership candidate and is trying to implement the reforms that brussels is calling for .
and from ankara 's perspective , this should eventually lead to full membership once the eu 's demands have been met .
so far , all previous membership candidates have eventually become full members .
but it 's clear that a guilty conscience alone is a poor basis for granting membership .
many european governments today regret that they – or their predecessors – have in past years given the green light for membership talks with turkey .
the doubts within the eu about whether turkey is fit for membership have since then only increased , and the arguments against membership have not changed .
they are not about individual points of criticism – be it cyprus or freedom of expression – but they are , in fact of a more fundamental nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations will continue to improve , but there wo n't be full membership , says hasselbach for instance , the eu still struggles with the consequences of its two previous expansion rounds in 2004 and 2007 .
and even if past expansion was not a mistake – the new members have significantly changed the european union .
the bloc 's ability to speak with one voice seems to be faltering – simply because the member states are too diverse and different .
these changes have to sink in and this process is bound to take time .
accepting turkey with its different history and tradition would from today 's perspective lead to a final stop to european integration .
has anyone ever thought of the fact that turkey would soon surpass germany as the most populous eu member state ?
turkey as a member would therefore have the right to demand more official posts than any of the other countries .
this would change the eu to an extent likely to cause sharp opposition .
and no one can guarantee that turkey will remain a secular state for good .
none of this calls into question the fact that the eu needs turkey and that turkey needs the eu .
the good trade relations and security cooperation should be built upon .
both sides are certain to do this for their very own interests .
and turkey is likely to continue its reform path even without the prospect of eu membership .
that 's why it ’ s wrong to argue that without membership talks , ankara will abandon reforms and look for other partners .
both sides need to look at the current situation .
it 's not a question of all or nothing .
and the eu should be honest with ankara that at the end of the path will be a closer relationship than today – but no full membership .

the case involves airlines that fly around the globe , from air france-klm , to british airways and quantas . the european union 's competition watchdog issued fines tuesday to 11 airlines totaling 799.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- for running a global cargo cartel .
the cargo carriers were found to have coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security over a six-year period , between 1999 and 2006 .

the commission said it dropped charges against eleven other airlines , including german carrier lufthansa and its subsidiary swiss air , because it was the first to provide information about the cartel .
according to the commission the cartel the airlines began fixing fuel-surcharges in 1999 .
later the cooperation expanded with the introduction of a security surcharge and refused to pay a commission on those surcharges to their clients .
" by refusing to pay a commission , the airlines ensured that surcharges did not become subject to competition through the granting of discounts to customers .
such practices are in breach of the eu competition rules , " the commission said in a statement .

in addition to keeping the " global currency war " from escalating , a common goal must be reaffirmed . the sheer scale of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit can be staggering .
representing 90 percent of the world 's economic power , and four-fifths of global trade , the summit is crisis-oriented .
it was called into life in 1999 as a reaction to financial crises in asia , brazil and russia , and was initially a meeting of financial ministers .
when lehman brothers investment bank collapsed in the fall of 2008 , it unleashed a global financial crisis , and the g20 became a vehicle to combat recession .
that 's when heads of state became involved .
it has been nearly two years since a package of financial measures was decided on in washington .
their aim is to ensure such an unprecedented global crisis never happens again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique strauss-kahn says global cooperation is needed for dominique strauss-kahn , a french politician and managing director of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the most important realization of the crisis is that egoism on the national level needs to yield to global cooperation .
" in my view one of the main features of this crisis has been the emergence of a willingness to work together , of a new kind of economic cooperation at the global level which never existed , never happened in the past , " strauss-kahn said in october at the annual meeting of the imf in washington .
according to strauss-kahn , that spirit of cooperation was present at past g20 summits in london , pittsburgh and toronto .
but the meeting starting thursday in seoul may show a decrease in countries ' willingness to cooperate at a global level .
" that is a real threat … there is no domestic solution to a global crisis , " he said .
summit as a litmus test the g20 summit participants surely know global cooperation is the way forward .
in the end , however , each country has to master its own national politics in order to institute financial reform .
that 's why german chancellor angela merkel says she is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far " in terms of the financial sector 's participation in carrying the costs of the crisis , the german government could have pictured more , " she told german parliamentarians in october as she outlined her goals for the seoul gathering .
while germany imposed a nationwide " financial crisis responsibility fee " on its banks , the g20 failed to agree on an international tax on financial markets .
nevertheless , europe will be bringing something to the table in seoul : its oversight of financial systems will be significantly improved .
risky financial products may be forbidden under certain circumstances and control over hedge funds and ratings agencies is being tightened .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has expressed concerns about the seoul g20 summit .
he says it comes at a critical point in time , as all parties will have to accept that global economic imbalances affect them all .
" it will be a real test of whether the g20 can deliver the coordination the world economy needs , " he wrote in an open letter .
no hint of unity despite numerous promises to disallow protectionism , the g20 nations are far from unified in their efforts to do so .
each is primarily acting with the strength its own domestic economy in mind , and the resulting imbalance is fertile ground for another crisis .
the trade balances of the individual countries – the ratio of their exports versus imports – is filled with dormant potential for conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imposed a fee on its banks , but an international tax was not agreed on in outlining her goals for the seoul g20 summit , merkel asked what countries can " do together for sustainable , strong and balanced growth . "
she wants to see this entirely accomplished by unadulterated market forces as such balances are an expression of economic competitiveness .
no answers on currency currency exchange rates are an inevitable source of controversy in the current scenario of global trade , and some analysts have already dubbed the situation a " global currency war . "
the problem is that some countries are trying to gain a competitive edge by devaluing their own currencies to make exports more attractive .
china and the united states are the primary practitioners of this tactic , with south korea , japan and brazil jointing in too .
a precarious race has begun .
the seoul g20 summit wo n't solve this problem , but merkel says that exchange rates should accurately reflect the fundamental data of a country 's domestic prosperity for the time being .
" a political scenario which targets currency distortion to strengthen economic competitiveness must be avoided , " merkel said .
france , which is due to take over south korea 's presidency of the g20 , wants to make currency policies a central issue .
still , one central issue may be the most important of all during the talks – whether the 20 nations can demonstrate they are all moving in the same direction , even if they were forced into negotiations by a crisis .

" the energy challenge is one of the greatest tests europe has to face , " oettinger said on wednesday at the presentation of the bloc 's energy strategy for the next 10 years . " putting our energy system onto a new , more sustainable and secure path may take time but ambitious decisions need to be taken now . " the energy chief said individual governments ' priorities in the 27-member bloc had limited european energy policy in the past , and that this must change . " to have an efficient , competitive and low-carbon economy we have to europeanize our energy policy and focus on a few , but pressing , priorities , " oettinger said . energy connections between member states tend to be scattered and inefficient , a hangover from pre-eu times when most national grids were the property of state-run monopolies . " failing to achieve a well-functioning european energy market will only increase the costs for consumers and put europe 's competitiveness at risk , " he added . ending energy isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : encouraging energy savings was another of the report 's priorities in the context of russia 's gas disputes with its neighbours in recent years – and their knock-on consequences for europe – oettinger indicated that security was another reason for integrating networks , so as to prevent states from becoming overly dependent upon a single energy provider . " by 2015 , no member state should be isolated , " a european commission statement said on wednesday . oettinger said the eu 's executive would propose legislation in five key areas in the coming 18 months , including energy efficiency measures for businesses and private housholds . it will also push eu member states to accept a deadline of 2015 to link up all 27 national energy markets . the eu as well as european countries will have to update the energy grid to allow for decentralized power generation and distribution , according to stefan gsaenger , secretary general of the world wind energy association . " up to 10 or 20 years ago in germany we had dozens of huge power stations , " he told deutsche welle .
" today there are hundreds of thousands of power generation units in solar systems and wind farms that are all over germany .
that completely changes the grid . " gsaenger said he expects generation of local , small-scale renewable energy generation to continue increasing as the eu member states strive reach their announced goal of collectively sourcing 20 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2020 , which implies about 35 percent of electricity . funding for electricity grid improvements will come from taxpayers and power companies . german chancellor angela merkel had said earlier that european members should ensure new energy projects are commercially viable .

however , they have warned against sudden tax cuts . the german council of economic experts predicted on wednesday that germany 's economy will grow by 3.7 percent in 2010 , and by 2.2 percent in 2011 - a prognosis that even exceeds the latest official estimates from chancellor angela merkel 's government .
" the pleasing upward trend in the german economy offers the chance for a stable , if relatively flat , path of growth , " the council 's chairman , wolfgang franz said .
" also , the government is in a position to considerably bolster these chances with solid economic policies . "
increased consumption , investments and demand for german exports are fuelling the recovery , and should lead to reduced levels of unemployment and state borrowing , the experts said .
however , they also cautioned that a repeat of germany 's so-called economic miracle in the post-war era was not on the cards .
the council , often referred to as the five wise men of the economy -lrb- in fact , one is a woman -rrb- , was set up in 1963 to advise the government on economic policy . " i think we are all delighted that the situation this year looks a lot more optimistic than last year , " chancellor angela merkel said on receiving the report , promising to continue with governent plans to save money .
" we are well aware that the structure of our current budget - designed as a response to the recent crisis with over 50 percent of spending going towards social security - is not a sustainable model for the future , especially considering our ageing population . "
taxation and borrowing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government says reducing borrowing still takes priority over tax cuts the chairman of the expert panel , wolfgang franz , told chancellor merkel that her government could support the fragile growth by issuing stricter regulations on the global financial sector and continuing to consolidate german overspending .
he also issued two warnings to governments , employers , and trade unions - advising against " rash cuts in taxes " and " excessive increases in wages . "
tax cuts were a major campaign platform of merkel 's pro-business coalition partners , the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , and the party - which is struggling in the polls - is keen that they are introduced sooner rather than later .
economic minister rainer bruederle , a member of the fdp , told german public television on wednesday that his party would be patient before cutting taxes , but the cuts would come .
" not today , but soon .
because if the economy really does grow as predicted , then - after implementing the measures to balance the budget that we have made priority number one - there might be a bit of lee-way for some slight cuts in the middle-bracket . "
bruederle said .
" but , as our coalition keeps saying , we must reduce the budget deficit as a short-term priority , and then think about taxation in the medium term . "
bruederle said that the government might be in a position to start the process by 2012 - especially in light of the panel 's prediction that germany might dip below the prescribed eu budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 .
but the economists see this matter very differently , arguing that there will be no room for tax cuts during the current legislative period -lrb- which ends in 2013 -rrb- , and saying it may not even be possible early in the next one .
instead , the group suggested that berlin might be forced to raise taxes slightly in order to meet its target of cutting 80 billion euros in spending between 2010 and 2014 .
job market to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to target germany 's unemployment problem the german economic experts also predicted reduced joblessness for 2011 , with germany set to dip below 3 million unemployed next year .
earlier in the week , buoyed by the prospect of good news from her experts , chancellor merkel told the focus news magazine that full employment was a major goal for her government .
" i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " she said .
" we must , and can , get these people back to work . "
however , the cologne-based institute for economic research predicts that a rate of around 5 percent unemployment , meaning roughly 2 million germans out of work , would be a more realistic goal in the foreseeable future .

in addition to keeping the " global currency war " from escalating , a common goal must be reaffirmed . the sheer scale of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit can be staggering .
representing 90 percent of the world 's economic power , and four-fifths of global trade , the summit is crisis-oriented .
it was called into life in 1999 as a reaction to financial crises in asia , brazil and russia , and was initially a meeting of financial ministers .
when lehman brothers investment bank collapsed in the fall of 2008 , it unleashed a global financial crisis , and the g20 became a vehicle to combat recession .
that 's when heads of state became involved .
it has been nearly two years since a package of financial measures was decided on in washington .
their aim is to ensure such an unprecedented global crisis never happens again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique strauss-kahn says global cooperation is needed for dominique strauss-kahn , a french politician and managing director of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the most important realization of the crisis is that egoism on the national level needs to yield to global cooperation .
" in my view one of the main features of this crisis has been the emergence of a willingness to work together , of a new kind of economic cooperation at the global level which never existed , never happened in the past , " strauss-kahn said in october at the annual meeting of the imf in washington .
according to strauss-kahn , that spirit of cooperation was present at past g20 summits in london , pittsburgh and toronto .
but the meeting starting thursday in seoul may show a decrease in countries ' willingness to cooperate at a global level .
" that is a real threat … there is no domestic solution to a global crisis , " he said .
summit as a litmus test the g20 summit participants surely know global cooperation is the way forward .
in the end , however , each country has to master its own national politics in order to institute financial reform .
that 's why german chancellor angela merkel says she is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far " in terms of the financial sector 's participation in carrying the costs of the crisis , the german government could have pictured more , " she told german parliamentarians in october as she outlined her goals for the seoul gathering .
while germany imposed a nationwide " financial crisis responsibility fee " on its banks , the g20 failed to agree on an international tax on financial markets .
nevertheless , europe will be bringing something to the table in seoul : its oversight of financial systems will be significantly improved .
risky financial products may be forbidden under certain circumstances and control over hedge funds and ratings agencies is being tightened .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has expressed concerns about the seoul g20 summit .
he says it comes at a critical point in time , as all parties will have to accept that global economic imbalances affect them all .
" it will be a real test of whether the g20 can deliver the coordination the world economy needs , " he wrote in an open letter .
no hint of unity despite numerous promises to disallow protectionism , the g20 nations are far from unified in their efforts to do so .
each is primarily acting with the strength its own domestic economy in mind , and the resulting imbalance is fertile ground for another crisis .
the trade balances of the individual countries – the ratio of their exports versus imports – is filled with dormant potential for conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imposed a fee on its banks , but an international tax was not agreed on in outlining her goals for the seoul g20 summit , merkel asked what countries can " do together for sustainable , strong and balanced growth . "
she wants to see this entirely accomplished by unadulterated market forces as such balances are an expression of economic competitiveness .
no answers on currency currency exchange rates are an inevitable source of controversy in the current scenario of global trade , and some analysts have already dubbed the situation a " global currency war . "
the problem is that some countries are trying to gain a competitive edge by devaluing their own currencies to make exports more attractive .
china and the united states are the primary practitioners of this tactic , with south korea , japan and brazil jointing in too .
a precarious race has begun .
the seoul g20 summit wo n't solve this problem , but merkel says that exchange rates should accurately reflect the fundamental data of a country 's domestic prosperity for the time being .
" a political scenario which targets currency distortion to strengthen economic competitiveness must be avoided , " merkel said .
france , which is due to take over south korea 's presidency of the g20 , wants to make currency policies a central issue .
still , one central issue may be the most important of all during the talks – whether the 20 nations can demonstrate they are all moving in the same direction , even if they were forced into negotiations by a crisis .

however , they have warned against sudden tax cuts . the german council of economic experts predicted on wednesday that germany 's economy will grow by 3.7 percent in 2010 , and by 2.2 percent in 2011 - a prognosis that even exceeds the latest official estimates from chancellor angela merkel 's government .
" the pleasing upward trend in the german economy offers the chance for a stable , if relatively flat , path of growth , " the council 's chairman , wolfgang franz said .
" also , the government is in a position to considerably bolster these chances with solid economic policies . "
increased consumption , investments and demand for german exports are fuelling the recovery , and should lead to reduced levels of unemployment and state borrowing , the experts said .
however , they also cautioned that a repeat of germany 's so-called economic miracle in the post-war era was not on the cards .
the council , often referred to as the five wise men of the economy -lrb- in fact , one is a woman -rrb- , was set up in 1963 to advise the government on economic policy . " i think we are all delighted that the situation this year looks a lot more optimistic than last year , " chancellor angela merkel said on receiving the report , promising to continue with governent plans to save money .
" we are well aware that the structure of our current budget - designed as a response to the recent crisis with over 50 percent of spending going towards social security - is not a sustainable model for the future , especially considering our ageing population . "
taxation and borrowing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government says reducing borrowing still takes priority over tax cuts the chairman of the expert panel , wolfgang franz , told chancellor merkel that her government could support the fragile growth by issuing stricter regulations on the global financial sector and continuing to consolidate german overspending .
he also issued two warnings to governments , employers , and trade unions - advising against " rash cuts in taxes " and " excessive increases in wages . "
tax cuts were a major campaign platform of merkel 's pro-business coalition partners , the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , and the party - which is struggling in the polls - is keen that they are introduced sooner rather than later .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 10.11.2010 security flaw discovered in german digital id card software großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new electronic id card was released on november 1 one day after its release , the software used to read new german id cards is shown to be vulnerable to attack .
the federal office for information security has removed links to the program from its website . jan schejbal , a german computer security researcher living in sweden , on tuesday described a way to hack the new electronic german id card software .
the federal office responsible for the program stopped allowing the software to be downloaded on wednesday . the new cards , which became available november 1 and will gradually replace current german cards , contain an rfid wireless chip - the same kind found in many contactless security or payment keycards .
the chip stores digital versions of the card holder 's photo , name , address , date of birth , height , eye and hair color and location of issuance . the interior ministry and the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- have claimed the cards will help the government provide easy-to-use digital signatures and other government services , as well as protection against online scams and phishing attacks .
germans can also use the ids in place of a passport when traveling within the european union . spoofing the server but to be useful to individuals , the digital information on the cards needs to be accessed with a card reader .
it 's the ausweisapp -lrb- " id app " -rrb- software that runs the card reader which is flawed , according to schejbal . after downloading the first version of ausweisapp from a german government website , he noticed a major flaw when the program checks for updates .
the software does not verify the origin of a digital security -lrb- ssl -rrb- certificate , which leaves the program open to a spoof attack that conceivably could lead to the download of malicious software . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia has had digital id cards for eight years " the electronic id itself may have quite a high security level , " said schejbal in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" however , this security becomes worthless if the framework which is used to access this secure core is insecure and allows compromising overall security . " had the new electronic id card already been widely used , the security flaw in updating would have been significant , according to karsten nohl , an independent security expert based in berlin . " fortunately , that is not the case and the bug can be fixed swiftly , " he told deutsche welle .
" this vulnerability is another reminder of the complexity of the id card security system , not all of which has been tested rigorously . " in a statement to the german tech news website heise.de , the bsi said it was looking into the update issue .
it also removed the software from its website to prevent more people from downloading the flawed program . " the media has been made aware of a perceived vulnerability in the software ausweisapp necessary for the eid feature of the new id card , " it wrote .
bsi did not reply to deutsche welle 's request for comment .
" if a vulnerability exists in the software , the bsi will provide a new version of the software without delay and will inform the public accordingly . " digital id cards expanding across europe digital ids have been spreading across the continent in recent years .
estonia has had one for nearly a decade , with a slew of electronic government services , and legally binding digital signatures to go along with it .
belgium , sweden , spain , portugal all currently have electronic id cards , and there are plans in place to release such cards in luxembourg and the czech republic . while schejbal added that he is not opposed to the concept of an electronic id , he advised germans to avoid the cards for as long as possible . " it is not secure , and it will put the user at risk , " he wrote .
" if the electronic identity is abused , the user will have a hard time proving that he did not authorize a transaction . " previous flaws have been discovered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital id cards have a corresponding reader when used with a computer schejbal 's discovery is n't the first time security flaws were found in the new electronic id cards .
in september , the german hacker collective the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- demonstrated how the card reader 's security measures could be circumvented . after obtaining an id card 's pin number by using a program that records individual keystrokes , the hackers were able to rewrite all the information on the id .
card readers come in a variety of models , and the ccc circumvented the most basic model . security researchers have doubts manuel bach , the electronic id project manager at the bsi , responded by saying that germans must take responsibility for their own computer security and ensure their computers remain free of the malicious software needed to steal pins and other personal data . " the germany id card ca n't protect you from trojan horses , it 's just a piece of plastic with a microchip inside , " he told deutsche welle in an interview last month .
" you as a citizen or computer user have a responsibility to secure your system .
if you do that you 're very safe , even with a basic card reader . " but constanze kurz , a ccc spokeswoman , said the government should n't expect all germans to be tech whizzes . " if you pretend that all your citizens are really good with computers , and that they can manage their own it security on their systems , then you are definitely wrong , " she said in an interview with deutsche welle .

his book is unlikely to help heal the rift that emerged between the us and europe while he was in office . the 43rd us president 's apparent mission to have his two terms in the white house reassessed and his reputation rehabilitated through his new book , " decision points , " has many europeans shaking their heads . and it 's not just the most inflammatory excerpts - such as bush 's assertion that water-boarding of terror suspects saved lives - that are causing an outcry . bush 's supporters in the us say that every president has the right to defend his record ; " decision points " shows the former president as a man who was ideologically consistent during his eight years in office . his detractors counter that the president 's mistakes and his determination to follow ill-thought-out policies - without a thought for a possible , rectifying change of direction - plunged the us into a decade of war and the worst financial crisis in over 80 years .
while george w. bush may have been a good guy with a difficult job , they say , he does n't deserve to be rehabilitated via his memoirs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush left office with two wars and an economic crisis raging if bush 's single-minded and heavy-handed approach to afghanistan and iraq in the wake of the terror attacks of 9/11 were damaging to his relations with his european allies at the time , his newly released memoirs appear to be giving european readers the chance get angry all over again . europeans , even allies , dismissed as irrelevant " in my opinion , there ’ s been no change in perception of bush in europe , " dr. henning meyer , a transatlantic relations expert at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle . " his legacy projects , such as iraq and afghanistan , are still the main issues associated with his presidency and of course europeans are still affected by these and in most cases are still in opposition to a certain degree .
if you remember , bush ’ s war on terror effectively split europe .
so these things have not been forgotten . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush says the uk 's perception of him does n't matter in " decision points , " bush is dismissive about those europeans who had taken a risk to follow him into war in iraq , and he talks frankly about his reputation in the one country whose leaders followed him most obediently of all : england .
" it does n't matter how people perceive me in england , " he writes .
" it just does n't matter any more .
and frankly , at times , it did n't matter then . " in a veiled dig at what he saw at the time as the rest of europe 's lack of stomach for the fight , bush writes : " people in europe said : ' ah , man , he 's a religious fanatic , cowboy , simpleton . '
all that stuff ...
if you believe that freedom is universal , then you should n't be surprised when people take courageous measures to live in a free society . " he reserves his most scathing treatment for those european leaders who disappointed him most , especially during the iraq war : former german chancellor gerhard schroeder comes in for even worse treatment than former french president jacques chirac , schroeder 's ally in the european anti-war opposition . german emotions still raw over bush 's rush to war in the book , bush accuses schroeder of abusing his trust after allegedly telling the president in 2002 , before the invasion of iraq the following year , that " what goes for afghanistan also goes for iraq .
nations which support terrorism must accept the consequences .
if you go forward fast and resolutely , i am on your side . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush did n't trust schroeder after the latter withdrew his support however , struggling in his re-election campaign in the fall of that year , schroeder hitched his wagon to the huge swell of anti-war feeling in germany and across europe .
he claims bush is lying when he says that he had offered his support for an invasion , and that he 'd made it clear all along that his support was conditional on whether iraq really had weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- . " schroeder 's support -lrb- for the invasion of iraq -rrb- was conditional on evidence being found of terrorists being harbored in iraq , so when there was no evidence delivered , he withdrew his support , " lse professor meyer told deutsche welle .
" bush is attempting to polish his own picture of this situation with the germans by saying that the breakdown in relations was not his fault and that it was schroeder who turned opinion against him . " the bush legacy is still powerfully felt in the united states : the armed forces are embroiled in the two wars he started ; the financial system is struggling to pull out of an overwhelming crisis , and politicians are scrambling to rebuild their credibility on the world stage . but the ripples from his eight-year presidency continue to be felt in europe as well .
under his leadership , decades of trust and cooperation between the us and european governments was damaged . according to thomas klau , a transatlantic relations expert at the european council for foreign relations , the memoir provides new fodder for europeans who are skeptical about the us political system . " europeans , and germans in particular , are still amazed that the us political system has the potential to elect such an incompetent leader who has no respect for western values , " klau said .
" while obama gave some hope , the germans are now saddened to see that a discredited party such as the republicans can be re-elected as the majority in the house of representatives . " germans see the republican mid-term victory as proof that " the us system and electorate has a very short memory and very little wisdom . " european anger reignited over torture statements so far , european reaction to the bush memoirs has been heavily affected by comments in the book that seem to advocate torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims water boarding extracted vital information for meyer , the water-boarding comments are " a very clear example of the philosophical differences between the bush administration and the europeans . " " there is a huge difference in what bush thought was acceptable in terms of the war on terror and what the europeans thought , " he added .
" bush saw approaches such as water-boarding as not a breaking of any laws but a legitimate bending of them . " moreover , bush " made bold statements " that the information gained from water-boarding stopped an attack on london - a claim the uk refutes . " most people in europe say that there were other ways of getting the information and that bush ’ s assertions are just not true , " meyer said . severe - and lasting - damage ? the response to his memoirs suggests that the damage bush did to his country 's reputation in europe remains severe . " bush 's was the worst us presidency that europe and the world has ever seen and his legacy , in political and economic terms , will be seen as one of disaster , " said klau .
" few people will expect to see any change in this perception arising from his memoirs .
in fact , it 's highly likely that his already terrible reputation in europe will take an even worse turn . " bush may have come out with his book to try and put the record straight in his own words .

" the energy challenge is one of the greatest tests europe has to face , " oettinger said on wednesday at the presentation of the bloc 's energy strategy for the next 10 years . " putting our energy system onto a new , more sustainable and secure path may take time but ambitious decisions need to be taken now . " the energy chief said individual governments ' priorities in the 27-member bloc had limited european energy policy in the past , and that this must change . " to have an efficient , competitive and low-carbon economy we have to europeanize our energy policy and focus on a few , but pressing , priorities , " oettinger said . energy connections between member states tend to be scattered and inefficient , a hangover from pre-eu times when most national grids were the property of state-run monopolies . " failing to achieve a well-functioning european energy market will only increase the costs for consumers and put europe 's competitiveness at risk , " he added . ending energy isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : encouraging energy savings was another of the report 's priorities in the context of russia 's gas disputes with its neighbours in recent years – and their knock-on consequences for europe – oettinger indicated that security was another reason for integrating networks , so as to prevent states from becoming overly dependent upon a single energy provider . " by 2015 , no member state should be isolated , " a european commission statement said on wednesday . oettinger said the eu 's executive would propose legislation in five key areas in the coming 18 months , including energy efficiency measures for businesses and private housholds . it will also push eu member states to accept a deadline of 2015 to link up all 27 national energy markets . the eu as well as european countries will have to update the energy grid to allow for decentralized power generation and distribution , according to stefan gsaenger , secretary general of the world wind energy association . " up to 10 or 20 years ago in germany we had dozens of huge power stations , " he told deutsche welle .
" today there are hundreds of thousands of power generation units in solar systems and wind farms that are all over germany .
that completely changes the grid . " gsaenger said he expects generation of local , small-scale renewable energy generation to continue increasing as the eu member states strive reach their announced goal of collectively sourcing 20 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2020 , which implies about 35 percent of electricity . funding for electricity grid improvements will come from taxpayers and power companies . german chancellor angela merkel had said earlier that european members should ensure new energy projects are commercially viable .

however , they have warned against sudden tax cuts . the german council of economic experts predicted on wednesday that germany 's economy will grow by 3.7 percent in 2010 , and by 2.2 percent in 2011 - a prognosis that even exceeds the latest official estimates from chancellor angela merkel 's government .
" the pleasing upward trend in the german economy offers the chance for a stable , if relatively flat , path of growth , " the council 's chairman , wolfgang franz said .
" also , the government is in a position to considerably bolster these chances with solid economic policies . "
increased consumption , investments and demand for german exports are fuelling the recovery , and should lead to reduced levels of unemployment and state borrowing , the experts said .
however , they also cautioned that a repeat of germany 's so-called economic miracle in the post-war era was not on the cards .
the council , often referred to as the five wise men of the economy -lrb- in fact , one is a woman -rrb- , was set up in 1963 to advise the government on economic policy . " i think we are all delighted that the situation this year looks a lot more optimistic than last year , " chancellor angela merkel said on receiving the report , promising to continue with governent plans to save money .
" we are well aware that the structure of our current budget - designed as a response to the recent crisis with over 50 percent of spending going towards social security - is not a sustainable model for the future , especially considering our ageing population . "
taxation and borrowing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government says reducing borrowing still takes priority over tax cuts the chairman of the expert panel , wolfgang franz , told chancellor merkel that her government could support the fragile growth by issuing stricter regulations on the global financial sector and continuing to consolidate german overspending .
he also issued two warnings to governments , employers , and trade unions - advising against " rash cuts in taxes " and " excessive increases in wages . "
tax cuts were a major campaign platform of merkel 's pro-business coalition partners , the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , and the party - which is struggling in the polls - is keen that they are introduced sooner rather than later .
economic minister rainer bruederle , a member of the fdp , told german public television on wednesday that his party would be patient before cutting taxes , but the cuts would come .
" not today , but soon .
because if the economy really does grow as predicted , then - after implementing the measures to balance the budget that we have made priority number one - there might be a bit of lee-way for some slight cuts in the middle-bracket . "
bruederle said .
" but , as our coalition keeps saying , we must reduce the budget deficit as a short-term priority , and then think about taxation in the medium term . "
bruederle said that the government might be in a position to start the process by 2012 - especially in light of the panel 's prediction that germany might dip below the prescribed eu budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 .
but the economists see this matter very differently , arguing that there will be no room for tax cuts during the current legislative period -lrb- which ends in 2013 -rrb- , and saying it may not even be possible early in the next one .
instead , the group suggested that berlin might be forced to raise taxes slightly in order to meet its target of cutting 80 billion euros in spending between 2010 and 2014 .
job market to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to target germany 's unemployment problem the german economic experts also predicted reduced joblessness for 2011 , with germany set to dip below 3 million unemployed next year .
earlier in the week , buoyed by the prospect of good news from her experts , chancellor merkel told the focus news magazine that full employment was a major goal for her government .
" i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " she said .
" we must , and can , get these people back to work . "
however , the cologne-based institute for economic research predicts that a rate of around 5 percent unemployment , meaning roughly 2 million germans out of work , would be a more realistic goal in the foreseeable future .
" at that point the structural issues behind joblessness start to become a problem , " the institute 's president michael huether explained .
" things like a lack of qualifications , the unsuitability of candidates for the jobs on offer , and vice versa . "
economic envy in the english press germany is leading eu member states as the bloc struggles to emerge from recession - something which has caused the british media to take note in recent weeks .
as britain 's coalition government , elected earlier this year , looks to introduce tough spending cuts and jumpstart the faltering economy , more and more media outlets are reevaluating the merits of the relatively export-heavy , frugal economic policies which germans call " rhineland capitalism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's new leadership duo are making drastic cuts for little reward " a decade ago we considered the german economy a write-off .
now -lrb- prime minister -rrb- david cameron looks to angela merkel for inspiration , " a columnist at the left-leaning guardian newspaper , david gow , wrote in a recent commentary .
germany only partially followed the anglo-american movement towards dependence on the financial and services sectors in the latter half of the 20th century , preferring to maintain some industrial output and favoring a relatively cautious banking community .
the decision was often derided as backward , and even harmful to less cautious western neighbors , but now british commentators are asking whether the same caution has proved the key to a relatively swift recovery .
even the conservative newspaper , the times , has recently turned against the higher-risk capitalism favored in the english-speaking world , suggesting that germany 's export-heavy model is " leaving britain behind . "
yet there are other voices in the uk , like london-based financial analysts lombard street research , who point to decreasing demand in china and continued economic problems in the us and much of southern europe , suggesting that this could mean that germany 's export-driven recovery might falter in the near future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de france -pipe- 10.11.2010 french pension reform becomes law after failed legal challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reform raises the minimum retirement age to 62 the controversial and unpopular pension reform plan has become official law in france , as president nicolas sarkozy claims victory and the opposition socialists vow to repeal it . french president nicolas sarkozy 's plan to raise the national minimum retirement age officially became law on wednesday after the country 's constitutional court rejected a challenge to it .
sarkozy wasted no time in signing the bill on wednesday , just hours after the court ruling .
he said in a statement that while he heard the concerns expressed by opponents during the debate , it was his " duty " to ensure the pension fund 's integrity .
" with this law , our redistributive pension system has been saved , " he said .
" french citizens can now be assured that they can count on their retirement and that pension payments will be maintained . "
sarkozy 's right-of-center government insisted the reform , which raises the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the full retirement age from 65 to 67 , was necessary to fill a major budget gap as france 's population ages and few workers are paying into the system .
the law will gradually come into effect in july 2011 and will be fully enacted by 2018 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive strikes and protests against the reform disrupted society socialists vow a repeal opposition socialists and other parties asked the country 's highest court to examine the constitutionality of the law on november 2 , saying it contradicted france 's principles of equality .
the court rejected the challenge , but the socialists have vowed to repeal the law if they win the next presidential election in 2012 .
" the president is confusing appearance with reality , he thinks that by putting his head down and charging forward without listening , he 's showing courage , " said socialist leader martine aubry .
" it would have been courage to put in place a reform that really solves the problem of retirement . "
as the reform was in debate in the legislature , massive protests and nationwide strikes crippled the country 's transportation system and all but shut down the oil industry , leaving many gas stations without fuel for cars .
unions have called for another day of strikes on november 23 , but it was unclear how many would take part , as the public opposition to the bill was running out of steam toward the end of the debate .

lidl has come under particular fire over pay and practices . supermarkets across germany are popular places to buy clothes .
prices are cheap : you can buy a men 's shirt for seven euros -lrb- nine us dollars -rrb- or a pair of women 's trousers for under 10 euros .
however two women from bangladesh are currently on a speaking tour of germany to highlight how these cheap prices come at a human cost .
26-year-old jessmin begum and 36-year-old arifa akter both work as seamstresses in clothes factories in dhaka that make clothes for european stores .
they say the working conditions are terrible and the pay is inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers complain about cramped conditions , dirty water and tough bosses " i 'm proud of my work , especially when i see people here wearing my clothes , " said begum , who works for a factory that supplies clothes to german-based supermarket chain lidl .
" but it makes me mad that what we get for our work in bangladesh is nothing . "
not a living wage as a seamstress , jessmin begum earns around 35 euros a month -lrb- just under 4,000 bangladesh taka -rrb- .
the monthly rent for a one room apartment in dhaka is around 25 euros a month .
" it is not even close to the living wage we have calculated , " said khorshed alam from the campaigning group alternative movement for resources and freedom society -lrb- amrf -rrb- .
with calculations based on someone working a 12- to 14-hour day , the amrf estimates around 5,000 taka a month -lrb- 52 euros -rrb- is necessary for a single worker .
a family needs to earn around 9-10,000 taka .
dirty water , mean bosses , unpaid overtime the two seamstresses are using their tour of germany to highlight how bad working conditions are in the factories .
" the drinking water is dirty and we are packed in with little space between the machines , " said begum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessmin begum has been working as a seamstress in dhaka for eight years " our supervisors insult us and put us under pressure to work harder .
almost every day i do overtime and i hardly ever come home much earlier than midnight , " she added .
the workers have no sick pay or other benefits , so most seamstresses continue to work even when ill .
highlighting the problem jessmin and arifa 's tour of germany was organized by the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- , which campaigns worldwide to promote better working conditions and fair wages .
the ccc wants international corporations to stick to their pledges to provide better labor conditions .
" for years companies have been saying they are willing to meet certain standards , but it 's only on paper , not in actions , " said the ccc 's gisela burckhardt .
" we want a proper legal framework so that companies can see the impact of their activities on the environment and people in other countries , " burckhardt argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this dhaka garment factory was visited by the ccc in 2009 khorshed alam from the amrf added that it is also the responsibility of the bangladeshi government to monitor the brands which manufacture clothes in the country , and to ensure they implement local labor laws .
making consumers aware in addition to putting pressure on manufacturers and local governments , the tour aims to give consumers more awareness of the origin of their cheap shirts and trousers .
" i came here because the people who buy our products have no idea where they came from , or how much we suffer , " said begum .
the amrf want consumers to question companies like lidl who sell cheap clothes , while claiming they pay their workers well .
in response to the claims , a spokesperson for lidl said they completely oppose any form of child labor and violations of workers ' rights .
they also added that lidl was the first german discount store to join the business social compliance initiative which works to improve working conditions in supply networks worldwide .

his book is unlikely to help heal the rift that emerged between the us and europe while he was in office . the 43rd us president 's apparent mission to have his two terms in the white house reassessed and his reputation rehabilitated through his new book , " decision points , " has many europeans shaking their heads . and it 's not just the most inflammatory excerpts - such as bush 's assertion that water-boarding of terror suspects saved lives - that are causing an outcry . bush 's supporters in the us say that every president has the right to defend his record ; " decision points " shows the former president as a man who was ideologically consistent during his eight years in office . his detractors counter that the president 's mistakes and his determination to follow ill-thought-out policies - without a thought for a possible , rectifying change of direction - plunged the us into a decade of war and the worst financial crisis in over 80 years .
while george w. bush may have been a good guy with a difficult job , they say , he does n't deserve to be rehabilitated via his memoirs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush left office with two wars and an economic crisis raging if bush 's single-minded and heavy-handed approach to afghanistan and iraq in the wake of the terror attacks of 9/11 were damaging to his relations with his european allies at the time , his newly released memoirs appear to be giving european readers the chance get angry all over again . europeans , even allies , dismissed as irrelevant " in my opinion , there ’ s been no change in perception of bush in europe , " dr. henning meyer , a transatlantic relations expert at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle . " his legacy projects , such as iraq and afghanistan , are still the main issues associated with his presidency and of course europeans are still affected by these and in most cases are still in opposition to a certain degree .
if you remember , bush ’ s war on terror effectively split europe .
so these things have not been forgotten . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush says the uk 's perception of him does n't matter in " decision points , " bush is dismissive about those europeans who had taken a risk to follow him into war in iraq , and he talks frankly about his reputation in the one country whose leaders followed him most obediently of all : england .
" it does n't matter how people perceive me in england , " he writes .
" it just does n't matter any more .
and frankly , at times , it did n't matter then . " in a veiled dig at what he saw at the time as the rest of europe 's lack of stomach for the fight , bush writes : " people in europe said : ' ah , man , he 's a religious fanatic , cowboy , simpleton . '
all that stuff ...
if you believe that freedom is universal , then you should n't be surprised when people take courageous measures to live in a free society . " he reserves his most scathing treatment for those european leaders who disappointed him most , especially during the iraq war : former german chancellor gerhard schroeder comes in for even worse treatment than former french president jacques chirac , schroeder 's ally in the european anti-war opposition . german emotions still raw over bush 's rush to war in the book , bush accuses schroeder of abusing his trust after allegedly telling the president in 2002 , before the invasion of iraq the following year , that " what goes for afghanistan also goes for iraq .
nations which support terrorism must accept the consequences .
if you go forward fast and resolutely , i am on your side . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush did n't trust schroeder after the latter withdrew his support however , struggling in his re-election campaign in the fall of that year , schroeder hitched his wagon to the huge swell of anti-war feeling in germany and across europe .
he claims bush is lying when he says that he had offered his support for an invasion , and that he 'd made it clear all along that his support was conditional on whether iraq really had weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- . " schroeder 's support -lrb- for the invasion of iraq -rrb- was conditional on evidence being found of terrorists being harbored in iraq , so when there was no evidence delivered , he withdrew his support , " lse professor meyer told deutsche welle .
" bush is attempting to polish his own picture of this situation with the germans by saying that the breakdown in relations was not his fault and that it was schroeder who turned opinion against him . " the bush legacy is still powerfully felt in the united states : the armed forces are embroiled in the two wars he started ; the financial system is struggling to pull out of an overwhelming crisis , and politicians are scrambling to rebuild their credibility on the world stage . but the ripples from his eight-year presidency continue to be felt in europe as well .
under his leadership , decades of trust and cooperation between the us and european governments was damaged . according to thomas klau , a transatlantic relations expert at the european council for foreign relations , the memoir provides new fodder for europeans who are skeptical about the us political system . " europeans , and germans in particular , are still amazed that the us political system has the potential to elect such an incompetent leader who has no respect for western values , " klau said .
" while obama gave some hope , the germans are now saddened to see that a discredited party such as the republicans can be re-elected as the majority in the house of representatives . " germans see the republican mid-term victory as proof that " the us system and electorate has a very short memory and very little wisdom . " european anger reignited over torture statements so far , european reaction to the bush memoirs has been heavily affected by comments in the book that seem to advocate torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims water boarding extracted vital information for meyer , the water-boarding comments are " a very clear example of the philosophical differences between the bush administration and the europeans . " " there is a huge difference in what bush thought was acceptable in terms of the war on terror and what the europeans thought , " he added .
" bush saw approaches such as water-boarding as not a breaking of any laws but a legitimate bending of them . " moreover , bush " made bold statements " that the information gained from water-boarding stopped an attack on london - a claim the uk refutes . " most people in europe say that there were other ways of getting the information and that bush ’ s assertions are just not true , " meyer said . severe - and lasting - damage ? the response to his memoirs suggests that the damage bush did to his country 's reputation in europe remains severe . " bush 's was the worst us presidency that europe and the world has ever seen and his legacy , in political and economic terms , will be seen as one of disaster , " said klau .
" few people will expect to see any change in this perception arising from his memoirs .
in fact , it 's highly likely that his already terrible reputation in europe will take an even worse turn . " bush may have come out with his book to try and put the record straight in his own words .

his book is unlikely to help heal the rift that emerged between the us and europe while he was in office . the 43rd us president 's apparent mission to have his two terms in the white house reassessed and his reputation rehabilitated through his new book , " decision points , " has many europeans shaking their heads . and it 's not just the most inflammatory excerpts - such as bush 's assertion that water-boarding of terror suspects saved lives - that are causing an outcry . bush 's supporters in the us say that every president has the right to defend his record ; " decision points " shows the former president as a man who was ideologically consistent during his eight years in office . his detractors counter that the president 's mistakes and his determination to follow ill-thought-out policies - without a thought for a possible , rectifying change of direction - plunged the us into a decade of war and the worst financial crisis in over 80 years .
while george w. bush may have been a good guy with a difficult job , they say , he does n't deserve to be rehabilitated via his memoirs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush left office with two wars and an economic crisis raging if bush 's single-minded and heavy-handed approach to afghanistan and iraq in the wake of the terror attacks of 9/11 were damaging to his relations with his european allies at the time , his newly released memoirs appear to be giving european readers the chance get angry all over again . europeans , even allies , dismissed as irrelevant " in my opinion , there ’ s been no change in perception of bush in europe , " dr. henning meyer , a transatlantic relations expert at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle . " his legacy projects , such as iraq and afghanistan , are still the main issues associated with his presidency and of course europeans are still affected by these and in most cases are still in opposition to a certain degree .
if you remember , bush ’ s war on terror effectively split europe .
so these things have not been forgotten . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush says the uk 's perception of him does n't matter in " decision points , " bush is dismissive about those europeans who had taken a risk to follow him into war in iraq , and he talks frankly about his reputation in the one country whose leaders followed him most obediently of all : england .
" it does n't matter how people perceive me in england , " he writes .
" it just does n't matter any more .
and frankly , at times , it did n't matter then . " in a veiled dig at what he saw at the time as the rest of europe 's lack of stomach for the fight , bush writes : " people in europe said : ' ah , man , he 's a religious fanatic , cowboy , simpleton . '
all that stuff ...
if you believe that freedom is universal , then you should n't be surprised when people take courageous measures to live in a free society . " he reserves his most scathing treatment for those european leaders who disappointed him most , especially during the iraq war : former german chancellor gerhard schroeder comes in for even worse treatment than former french president jacques chirac , schroeder 's ally in the european anti-war opposition . german emotions still raw over bush 's rush to war in the book , bush accuses schroeder of abusing his trust after allegedly telling the president in 2002 , before the invasion of iraq the following year , that " what goes for afghanistan also goes for iraq .
nations which support terrorism must accept the consequences .
if you go forward fast and resolutely , i am on your side . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush did n't trust schroeder after the latter withdrew his support however , struggling in his re-election campaign in the fall of that year , schroeder hitched his wagon to the huge swell of anti-war feeling in germany and across europe .
he claims bush is lying when he says that he had offered his support for an invasion , and that he 'd made it clear all along that his support was conditional on whether iraq really had weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- . " schroeder 's support -lrb- for the invasion of iraq -rrb- was conditional on evidence being found of terrorists being harbored in iraq , so when there was no evidence delivered , he withdrew his support , " lse professor meyer told deutsche welle .
" bush is attempting to polish his own picture of this situation with the germans by saying that the breakdown in relations was not his fault and that it was schroeder who turned opinion against him . " the bush legacy is still powerfully felt in the united states : the armed forces are embroiled in the two wars he started ; the financial system is struggling to pull out of an overwhelming crisis , and politicians are scrambling to rebuild their credibility on the world stage . but the ripples from his eight-year presidency continue to be felt in europe as well .
under his leadership , decades of trust and cooperation between the us and european governments was damaged . according to thomas klau , a transatlantic relations expert at the european council for foreign relations , the memoir provides new fodder for europeans who are skeptical about the us political system . " europeans , and germans in particular , are still amazed that the us political system has the potential to elect such an incompetent leader who has no respect for western values , " klau said .
" while obama gave some hope , the germans are now saddened to see that a discredited party such as the republicans can be re-elected as the majority in the house of representatives . " germans see the republican mid-term victory as proof that " the us system and electorate has a very short memory and very little wisdom . " european anger reignited over torture statements so far , european reaction to the bush memoirs has been heavily affected by comments in the book that seem to advocate torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims water boarding extracted vital information for meyer , the water-boarding comments are " a very clear example of the philosophical differences between the bush administration and the europeans . " " there is a huge difference in what bush thought was acceptable in terms of the war on terror and what the europeans thought , " he added .
" bush saw approaches such as water-boarding as not a breaking of any laws but a legitimate bending of them . " moreover , bush " made bold statements " that the information gained from water-boarding stopped an attack on london - a claim the uk refutes . " most people in europe say that there were other ways of getting the information and that bush ’ s assertions are just not true , " meyer said . severe - and lasting - damage ? the response to his memoirs suggests that the damage bush did to his country 's reputation in europe remains severe . " bush 's was the worst us presidency that europe and the world has ever seen and his legacy , in political and economic terms , will be seen as one of disaster , " said klau .
" few people will expect to see any change in this perception arising from his memoirs .
in fact , it 's highly likely that his already terrible reputation in europe will take an even worse turn . " bush may have come out with his book to try and put the record straight in his own words .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de brands -pipe- 10.11.2010 adidas vows to outperform rival nike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas aims to escape nike 's shadow in the united states adidas has trailed nike in the sportswear market for years .
now the german company says it 's in a position to outgrow its us rival and dominate the market by 2015 .
consumers in the united states are central to its plans . after weathering a difficult year in 2009 and pinning its hopes on the 2010 world cup in south africa , german sporting goods company adidas has surged ahead in profits and now says it wants to outperform leading rival nike .
adidas wants to grow faster than nike through 2015 and increase its turnover by 45-50 percent to 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.4 billion -rrb- .
" we 're hoping this faster rate of growth will let us lay a foundation to be the market leader at a later point in time , " an adidas spokeswoman told deutsche welle .
nike , however , is moving forward with goals of its own .
it hopes to generate 19.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- in revenue by 2015 .
in the first nine months of 2010 , adidas primarily grew in the united states , china and russia , according to the company 's spokeswoman .
most of the growth was generated in the sports style , fashion and lifestyle sectors , as well as the reebok brand , which it bought in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa world cup gave adidas a major sales boost adidas maintains a consistent marketing budget of 13 to 14 percent of its overall turnover.the bavarian-based company now plans to market new clothing designs for teenagers every two weeks .
it also plans to aggressively pursue the young customers on the internet using social networking .
us market vital according to matt powell , an analyst at sportsonesource - a research and data firm based in charlotte , north carolina - the key market for both adidas and nike is the united states .
" the us does about half of the athletic footwear and apparel business in the world , " he told deutsche welle .
" so you 've got the us versus the rest of the world , if you will .
now you 've got some markets – especially china – which are growing very quickly .
but that pales in comparison to the us . "
powell also said that both adidas and reebok had been losing market share in footwear " until very recently . "
" i really think that part of why adidas has struggled in the us is because they really do n't have a clear understanding of what the us consumer wants , " he said . " -lrb- but -rrb- i think they 're doing a much better job today than they were five years ago . "
what the us consumer really wants is fashion , powell said , adding that most athletic footwear " is n't used for sports . "
growth in north america and china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is also a rapidly growing market for adidas and nike some of the highlights of adidas ' quarterly exchange-rate-adjusted figures include a 10 percent increase in turnover for the adidas brand , and a 14 percent increase for the reebok brand .
the company 's overall third-quarter turnover increased in all regions , specifically 14 percent in north america and 9 percent in china .
powell said he believes there is a chance adidas could grow faster than nike in the next five years .
" historically the numbers would say it 's doable , but it 's a pretty steep hill to climb . "

lidl has come under particular fire over pay and practices . supermarkets across germany are popular places to buy clothes .
prices are cheap : you can buy a men 's shirt for seven euros -lrb- nine us dollars -rrb- or a pair of women 's trousers for under 10 euros .
however two women from bangladesh are currently on a speaking tour of germany to highlight how these cheap prices come at a human cost .
26-year-old jessmin begum and 36-year-old arifa akter both work as seamstresses in clothes factories in dhaka that make clothes for european stores .
they say the working conditions are terrible and the pay is inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers complain about cramped conditions , dirty water and tough bosses " i 'm proud of my work , especially when i see people here wearing my clothes , " said begum , who works for a factory that supplies clothes to german-based supermarket chain lidl .
" but it makes me mad that what we get for our work in bangladesh is nothing . "
not a living wage as a seamstress , jessmin begum earns around 35 euros a month -lrb- just under 4,000 bangladesh taka -rrb- .
the monthly rent for a one room apartment in dhaka is around 25 euros a month .
" it is not even close to the living wage we have calculated , " said khorshed alam from the campaigning group alternative movement for resources and freedom society -lrb- amrf -rrb- .
with calculations based on someone working a 12- to 14-hour day , the amrf estimates around 5,000 taka a month -lrb- 52 euros -rrb- is necessary for a single worker .
a family needs to earn around 9-10,000 taka .
dirty water , mean bosses , unpaid overtime the two seamstresses are using their tour of germany to highlight how bad working conditions are in the factories .
" the drinking water is dirty and we are packed in with little space between the machines , " said begum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessmin begum has been working as a seamstress in dhaka for eight years " our supervisors insult us and put us under pressure to work harder .
almost every day i do overtime and i hardly ever come home much earlier than midnight , " she added .
the workers have no sick pay or other benefits , so most seamstresses continue to work even when ill .
highlighting the problem jessmin and arifa 's tour of germany was organized by the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- , which campaigns worldwide to promote better working conditions and fair wages .
the ccc wants international corporations to stick to their pledges to provide better labor conditions .
" for years companies have been saying they are willing to meet certain standards , but it 's only on paper , not in actions , " said the ccc 's gisela burckhardt .
" we want a proper legal framework so that companies can see the impact of their activities on the environment and people in other countries , " burckhardt argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this dhaka garment factory was visited by the ccc in 2009 khorshed alam from the amrf added that it is also the responsibility of the bangladeshi government to monitor the brands which manufacture clothes in the country , and to ensure they implement local labor laws .
making consumers aware in addition to putting pressure on manufacturers and local governments , the tour aims to give consumers more awareness of the origin of their cheap shirts and trousers .
" i came here because the people who buy our products have no idea where they came from , or how much we suffer , " said begum .
the amrf want consumers to question companies like lidl who sell cheap clothes , while claiming they pay their workers well .
in response to the claims , a spokesperson for lidl said they completely oppose any form of child labor and violations of workers ' rights .
they also added that lidl was the first german discount store to join the business social compliance initiative which works to improve working conditions in supply networks worldwide .

schools in the czech republic - and in many other european countries – still maintain a system of de facto segregation for members of the roma minority , according to the errc .
" we did n't necessarily have the smoking gun of the teacher or a school administrator saying we 're putting you in these schools because you 're roma , but the numbers speak for themselves , " errc executive director robert kushen told reporters .
the european court of human rights ruled in november 2007 that 18 czech roma children had been discriminated against by being sent wrongly to special schools .
no changes so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de facto segregation also exists in greece , croatia and slovakia " the number of romani children in special education in the czech republic at that time and today was out of all proportion to the number of romani children in the population , " kushen added .
the czech government itself undertook studies after the court decision which confirm that something like 27 percent of romani children are in special education compared to 2.2 percent of non-romani children being in special education .
the only real change since the 2007 court ruling , says the center , is that such schools have been renamed ' practical ' schools by the authorities .
behind their doors , however , the overwhelmingly roma pupils still follow an academically inferior curriculum , condemning them to a life of limited further education , bleak employment prospects and deeper social exclusion .
similar situation across south-east europe but the czech republic is not alone – the center has since won a similar court case against croatia , and contributed towards another case in greece that was brought by the greek helsinki monitor .
both verdicts found that de facto segregation exists in those countries too .
in neighboring slovakia , for instance , a recent study showed 60 percent of special school pupils were roma .
stanislav daniel , a university-educated academic researcher working for the errc , said he himself had narrowly escaped being shunted off to a special school as a child in communist czechoslovakia .
" interestingly , i was also placed into a class at a mainstream school .
in the first year , i was placed in a class with all the romani children , and this class was for the children where there was a risk they would be placed into special school .
and this took place at the time when i was able to read and write .
my father , for some reason that i will never understand , taught me to read and write before i went to school . "
the european roma rights center says far from addressing the problem head on since the verdict , the new czech government actually seems to be backsliding on the little progress already made .
tuesday 's briefing was held ahead of a meeting of the commission of ministers later in november , who meet regularly to discuss whether european court of human rights recommendations are being implemented .
in this case , says the errc , it 's clear they 're not .

the case involves airlines that fly around the globe , from air france-klm , to british airways and quantas . the european union 's competition watchdog issued fines tuesday to 11 airlines totaling 799.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- for running a global cargo cartel .
the cargo carriers were found to have coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security over a six-year period , between 1999 and 2006 .
" with today 's decision , the european commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate cartel behavior , " eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner almunia said the case was " deplorable " the fine imposed is one of the biggest in eu history .
the bloc 's rules forbid most forms of price fixing among competitors .
" it is deplorable that so many major airlines coordinated their pricing to the detriment of european businesses and european consumers , " almunia added .
no fine for the whistleblower air france-klm was hit with the largest fine of 310 million euros .
british airways came in second , having to pay a 104-million-euro penalty .
luxembourg 's cargolux will have to pay 79.9 million euros , while scandinavian carrier sas was ordered to pay 70.2 million euros .
other airlines involved in the cartel and slapped with fines were singapore airlines , air canada , quantas , lan chile , martinair and japan airlines .
the commission said it dropped charges against eleven other airlines , including german carrier lufthansa and its subsidiary swiss air , because it was the first to provide information about the cartel .
according to the commission the cartel the airlines began fixing fuel-surcharges in 1999 .
later the cooperation expanded with the introduction of a security surcharge and refused to pay a commission on those surcharges to their clients .
" by refusing to pay a commission , the airlines ensured that surcharges did not become subject to competition through the granting of discounts to customers .
such practices are in breach of the eu competition rules , " the commission said in a statement .

many eu politicians have a guilty conscience over keeping ankara waiting .
but that 's a poor basis for making decisions , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . many eu politicians have a guilty conscience .
they do n't know how to deal with ankara ’ s hopes for speedy progress in the country 's bid for eu membership .
turkey is after all an official membership candidate and is trying to implement the reforms that brussels is calling for .
and from ankara 's perspective , this should eventually lead to full membership once the eu 's demands have been met .
so far , all previous membership candidates have eventually become full members .
but it 's clear that a guilty conscience alone is a poor basis for granting membership .
many european governments today regret that they – or their predecessors – have in past years given the green light for membership talks with turkey .
the doubts within the eu about whether turkey is fit for membership have since then only increased , and the arguments against membership have not changed .
they are not about individual points of criticism – be it cyprus or freedom of expression – but they are , in fact of a more fundamental nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations will continue to improve , but there wo n't be full membership , says hasselbach for instance , the eu still struggles with the consequences of its two previous expansion rounds in 2004 and 2007 .
and even if past expansion was not a mistake – the new members have significantly changed the european union .
the bloc 's ability to speak with one voice seems to be faltering – simply because the member states are too diverse and different .
these changes have to sink in and this process is bound to take time .
accepting turkey with its different history and tradition would from today 's perspective lead to a final stop to european integration .
has anyone ever thought of the fact that turkey would soon surpass germany as the most populous eu member state ?
turkey as a member would therefore have the right to demand more official posts than any of the other countries .
this would change the eu to an extent likely to cause sharp opposition .
and no one can guarantee that turkey will remain a secular state for good .
none of this calls into question the fact that the eu needs turkey and that turkey needs the eu .
the good trade relations and security cooperation should be built upon .
both sides are certain to do this for their very own interests .
and turkey is likely to continue its reform path even without the prospect of eu membership .
that 's why it ’ s wrong to argue that without membership talks , ankara will abandon reforms and look for other partners .
both sides need to look at the current situation .
it 's not a question of all or nothing .
and the eu should be honest with ankara that at the end of the path will be a closer relationship than today – but no full membership .

they do n't know how to deal with ankara ’ s hopes for speedy progress in the country 's bid for eu membership .
turkey is after all an official membership candidate and is trying to implement the reforms that brussels is calling for .
and from ankara 's perspective , this should eventually lead to full membership once the eu 's demands have been met .
so far , all previous membership candidates have eventually become full members .
but it 's clear that a guilty conscience alone is a poor basis for granting membership .
many european governments today regret that they – or their predecessors – have in past years given the green light for membership talks with turkey .
the doubts within the eu about whether turkey is fit for membership have since then only increased , and the arguments against membership have not changed .
they are not about individual points of criticism – be it cyprus or freedom of expression – but they are , in fact of a more fundamental nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations will continue to improve , but there wo n't be full membership , says hasselbach for instance , the eu still struggles with the consequences of its two previous expansion rounds in 2004 and 2007 .
and even if past expansion was not a mistake – the new members have significantly changed the european union .
the bloc 's ability to speak with one voice seems to be faltering – simply because the member states are too diverse and different .
these changes have to sink in and this process is bound to take time .
accepting turkey with its different history and tradition would from today 's perspective lead to a final stop to european integration .
has anyone ever thought of the fact that turkey would soon surpass germany as the most populous eu member state ?
turkey as a member would therefore have the right to demand more official posts than any of the other countries .
this would change the eu to an extent likely to cause sharp opposition .
and no one can guarantee that turkey will remain a secular state for good .
none of this calls into question the fact that the eu needs turkey and that turkey needs the eu .
the good trade relations and security cooperation should be built upon .
both sides are certain to do this for their very own interests .
and turkey is likely to continue its reform path even without the prospect of eu membership .
that 's why it ’ s wrong to argue that without membership talks , ankara will abandon reforms and look for other partners .
both sides need to look at the current situation .
it 's not a question of all or nothing .
and the eu should be honest with ankara that at the end of the path will be a closer relationship than today – but no full membership .

banners hung around seoul urge residents to say hello and be extra courteous to the visiting foreigners .
the south korean government is taking preparations for the g20 very seriously .
it ’ s the largest international gathering the country has held since the 2002 world cup .
this week ’ s summit also marks the first time a non-g8 and asian nation has hosted the economic forum .
south korea proud to host g20 and considering that several decades ago , south korea was one of the world ’ s poorest nations , its quick rise to the top makes it a model for other nations to emulate , says un secretary general ban ki moon .
the former south korean foreign minister says he ’ s proud of his nation ’ s accomplishments that have been made in the light of its division and war with north korea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea has undertaken the largest-ever security operation he spoke during a press briefing today in seoul : " i think we meet at a critical moment , the spotlight is on korea and is the first g20 summit in an emerging market economy .
korea is a bridge between the developed and developing world .
this role has never been more necessary and important and so there is something very special about this g20 moment . "
activists protest against " unequal economic policies " but some opposed to the g20 are using this moment to raise attention what they call its flawed economic policies .
an umbrella organization representing 80 south korean labor and civic groups says the top economies have done little to help the world ’ s poor and offset global unemployment , which they say is the highest in years .
chun hyoung baek of the civic group people ’ s solidarity for participatory democracy delivered the activists ’ official statement .
she spoke through an interpreter : " we call upon the g20 to regulate financial capital , which have brought suffering to so many people .
we call on the g20 to tax speculators and use the revenues to expand welfare .

and now as the g20 gets under way , korean and foreign activists are taking their message to the streets of seoul .
earlier this week , tens of thousands of protesters rallied against the g20 .
they were met by squads of korean riot police , who have been put on high alert ahead of the summit .
security tight in seoul some reports say the police used pepper spray to hold demonstrators back .
to keep protests like this under control and away from the g20 venues , seoul authorities have created a two kilometer buffer zone around the convention center .
it ’ s the largest security operation the nation has undertaken , according to the national police agency .
but south korea ’ s measures have only aggravated some protestors .
kim young hoon , president of the korean confederation of trade unions , says that president lee myung bak is denying their right to protest during the summit .
violence between trade unions and police has erupted in the past during anti free trade rallies .
police have been criticized for turning water cannons on protestors .

"
this season , the globe theatre pays homage to this special relationship . blasphemous as it might seem at first glance , the globe theatre 's current program serves to highlight a rather special bond between the world 's most famous writer and a whole country . " what i am discovering more and more is how deeply -lsb- shakespeare -rsb- entered into the german psyche from the 18th century on , " said patrick spottiswoode , education director for the globe theatre and curator of the season . and shakespeare 's german connection has strong credentials .
for starters , there are more performances of shakespeare in germany in any given year than in england .
german was the first language shakespeare was ever translated into ; and the first shakespeare society in the world was founded in germany . " the germans in the 18th and 19th century regarded him as ' ganz unser ' - entirely ours , " added spottiswoode . translating frenzy the notion of " ownership " over shakespeare was propagated by a wealth of translations that began to appear as early as 1766 - 150 years after his death - with christoph martin wieland 's prose translation of 22 of the bard 's plays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hamlet , said ferdinand freiligrath " to translate the whole works of shakespeare is quite a task ” , said spottiswoode , " and there were successive translations of the entire works in the 18th and 19th centuries . " between 1818 and 1839 alone , eight separate translations of the entire works of shakespeare were published .
some even say that this helped to " improve " the german language , as new words had to be invented to complete the task . it was the schlegel-tieck edition of 1833 that set the gold standard for shakespeare translation and laid the foundations for successive generations of german writers to attempt their very own versions . a constant contemporary " from wieland and then fontane down to heiner mueller in the post-war period , you have a spectrum of writers of different kinds that all contributed crucially to insuring that every other generation of german readers and viewers would have their very own shakespeare in a new translation , " said professor ruediger goerner , director of anglo-german relations at the university of queen mary in london . " shakespeare has always been a contemporary author for german audiences , " he continued .
this continual element of newness has seen a wealth of unusual and avant-garde interpretations of shakespeare come out of germany . " i think there 's that sense that as soon as you translate him , you are freeing him , " said spottiswoode . the goethe factor one of shakespeare 's greatest advocates was germany 's favorite literary child himself .
in 1771 , a 22-year old johann wolfgang von goethe gave an impassioned speech on the merits of his " friend " across the north sea . spottiswoode commissioned a translation of this lecture into english , sparking the entire " shakespeare is german " season at the globe theatre . " it 's a very beautiful , lyrical , passionate avocation of shakespeare and how he could be important and how german culture and theater could learn so much from shakespeare , " commented spottiswoode .
" he was going to free germany from the shackles of french-style drama . " shakespeare 's plays did not adhere to the classical unities of action , place and time as was common practice in french theater .
goethe once said of these unities that they were " as oppressive as prison . "
shakespeare represented a breath of fresh air and offered a whole new world of creative possibilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the globe is a reconstruction of the theater built by shakespeare 's company focus on nature " he was regarded as a new writer more than anything else , rather than a historical writer , a new type of writer and poet who would clearly bring poetry back to nature , " said goerner .
this idea married well with the principles of german classicism , and slowly shakespeare became an intrinsic part of a very german literary movement . by 1849 , the writer ferdinand freiligrath famously proclaimed " germany is hamlet , " revealing the extent to which shakespeare had infiltrated the german psyche by that time .
the legacy of this close bond with the bard from stratford-upon-avon can still be seen in german classrooms today . " there is indeed an affinity between the german language and the kind of poetic demands shakespeare makes , " said goerner .
" german , in that sense , is incredibly adaptable and you can mould german to capture the shakespearian vein , both in terms of his poetic approach and the sheer drama of the soul . " everyone 's favorite son if you think germany is alone in claiming shakespeare as its own , then think again .
" i had a moroccan film crew coming over they said ' our viewers at home think shakespeare really was an arab ! " ' said spottiswoode . he pointed out that the bard set his plays all over the world , taking his original london audiences on faraway travel .
it 's only fitting that his work has since gone around the world and been translated into some 90 languages .

"
this season , the globe theatre pays homage to this special relationship . blasphemous as it might seem at first glance , the globe theatre 's current program serves to highlight a rather special bond between the world 's most famous writer and a whole country . " what i am discovering more and more is how deeply -lsb- shakespeare -rsb- entered into the german psyche from the 18th century on , " said patrick spottiswoode , education director for the globe theatre and curator of the season . and shakespeare 's german connection has strong credentials .
for starters , there are more performances of shakespeare in germany in any given year than in england .
german was the first language shakespeare was ever translated into ; and the first shakespeare society in the world was founded in germany . " the germans in the 18th and 19th century regarded him as ' ganz unser ' - entirely ours , " added spottiswoode . translating frenzy the notion of " ownership " over shakespeare was propagated by a wealth of translations that began to appear as early as 1766 - 150 years after his death - with christoph martin wieland 's prose translation of 22 of the bard 's plays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hamlet , said ferdinand freiligrath " to translate the whole works of shakespeare is quite a task ” , said spottiswoode , " and there were successive translations of the entire works in the 18th and 19th centuries . " between 1818 and 1839 alone , eight separate translations of the entire works of shakespeare were published .
some even say that this helped to " improve " the german language , as new words had to be invented to complete the task . it was the schlegel-tieck edition of 1833 that set the gold standard for shakespeare translation and laid the foundations for successive generations of german writers to attempt their very own versions . a constant contemporary " from wieland and then fontane down to heiner mueller in the post-war period , you have a spectrum of writers of different kinds that all contributed crucially to insuring that every other generation of german readers and viewers would have their very own shakespeare in a new translation , " said professor ruediger goerner , director of anglo-german relations at the university of queen mary in london . " shakespeare has always been a contemporary author for german audiences , " he continued .
this continual element of newness has seen a wealth of unusual and avant-garde interpretations of shakespeare come out of germany . " i think there 's that sense that as soon as you translate him , you are freeing him , " said spottiswoode . the goethe factor one of shakespeare 's greatest advocates was germany 's favorite literary child himself .
in 1771 , a 22-year old johann wolfgang von goethe gave an impassioned speech on the merits of his " friend " across the north sea . spottiswoode commissioned a translation of this lecture into english , sparking the entire " shakespeare is german " season at the globe theatre . " it 's a very beautiful , lyrical , passionate avocation of shakespeare and how he could be important and how german culture and theater could learn so much from shakespeare , " commented spottiswoode .
" he was going to free germany from the shackles of french-style drama . " shakespeare 's plays did not adhere to the classical unities of action , place and time as was common practice in french theater .
goethe once said of these unities that they were " as oppressive as prison . "
shakespeare represented a breath of fresh air and offered a whole new world of creative possibilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the globe is a reconstruction of the theater built by shakespeare 's company focus on nature " he was regarded as a new writer more than anything else , rather than a historical writer , a new type of writer and poet who would clearly bring poetry back to nature , " said goerner .
this idea married well with the principles of german classicism , and slowly shakespeare became an intrinsic part of a very german literary movement . by 1849 , the writer ferdinand freiligrath famously proclaimed " germany is hamlet , " revealing the extent to which shakespeare had infiltrated the german psyche by that time .
the legacy of this close bond with the bard from stratford-upon-avon can still be seen in german classrooms today . " there is indeed an affinity between the german language and the kind of poetic demands shakespeare makes , " said goerner .
" german , in that sense , is incredibly adaptable and you can mould german to capture the shakespearian vein , both in terms of his poetic approach and the sheer drama of the soul . " everyone 's favorite son if you think germany is alone in claiming shakespeare as its own , then think again .
" i had a moroccan film crew coming over they said ' our viewers at home think shakespeare really was an arab ! " ' said spottiswoode . he pointed out that the bard set his plays all over the world , taking his original london audiences on faraway travel .
it 's only fitting that his work has since gone around the world and been translated into some 90 languages . " shakespeare seems to touch everybody , " added spottiswoode . author : sarah stolarz editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 10.11.2010 opinion : a guilty conscience is no basis for membership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how should the eu deal with turkey 's membership hopes ?
many eu politicians have a guilty conscience over keeping ankara waiting .
but that 's a poor basis for making decisions , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . many eu politicians have a guilty conscience .
they do n't know how to deal with ankara ’ s hopes for speedy progress in the country 's bid for eu membership .
turkey is after all an official membership candidate and is trying to implement the reforms that brussels is calling for .
and from ankara 's perspective , this should eventually lead to full membership once the eu 's demands have been met .
so far , all previous membership candidates have eventually become full members .
but it 's clear that a guilty conscience alone is a poor basis for granting membership .
many european governments today regret that they – or their predecessors – have in past years given the green light for membership talks with turkey .
the doubts within the eu about whether turkey is fit for membership have since then only increased , and the arguments against membership have not changed .
they are not about individual points of criticism – be it cyprus or freedom of expression – but they are , in fact of a more fundamental nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations will continue to improve , but there wo n't be full membership , says hasselbach for instance , the eu still struggles with the consequences of its two previous expansion rounds in 2004 and 2007 .
and even if past expansion was not a mistake – the new members have significantly changed the european union .
the bloc 's ability to speak with one voice seems to be faltering – simply because the member states are too diverse and different .
these changes have to sink in and this process is bound to take time .
accepting turkey with its different history and tradition would from today 's perspective lead to a final stop to european integration .
has anyone ever thought of the fact that turkey would soon surpass germany as the most populous eu member state ?
turkey as a member would therefore have the right to demand more official posts than any of the other countries .
this would change the eu to an extent likely to cause sharp opposition .
and no one can guarantee that turkey will remain a secular state for good .
none of this calls into question the fact that the eu needs turkey and that turkey needs the eu .
the good trade relations and security cooperation should be built upon .
both sides are certain to do this for their very own interests .
and turkey is likely to continue its reform path even without the prospect of eu membership .
that 's why it ’ s wrong to argue that without membership talks , ankara will abandon reforms and look for other partners .
both sides need to look at the current situation .
it 's not a question of all or nothing .
and the eu should be honest with ankara that at the end of the path will be a closer relationship than today – but no full membership .

now the german company says it 's in a position to outgrow its us rival and dominate the market by 2015 .
consumers in the united states are central to its plans . after weathering a difficult year in 2009 and pinning its hopes on the 2010 world cup in south africa , german sporting goods company adidas has surged ahead in profits and now says it wants to outperform leading rival nike .
adidas wants to grow faster than nike through 2015 and increase its turnover by 45-50 percent to 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.4 billion -rrb- .
" we 're hoping this faster rate of growth will let us lay a foundation to be the market leader at a later point in time , " an adidas spokeswoman told deutsche welle .
nike , however , is moving forward with goals of its own .
it hopes to generate 19.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- in revenue by 2015 .
in the first nine months of 2010 , adidas primarily grew in the united states , china and russia , according to the company 's spokeswoman .
most of the growth was generated in the sports style , fashion and lifestyle sectors , as well as the reebok brand , which it bought in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa world cup gave adidas a major sales boost adidas maintains a consistent marketing budget of 13 to 14 percent of its overall turnover.the bavarian-based company now plans to market new clothing designs for teenagers every two weeks .
it also plans to aggressively pursue the young customers on the internet using social networking .
us market vital according to matt powell , an analyst at sportsonesource - a research and data firm based in charlotte , north carolina - the key market for both adidas and nike is the united states .
" the us does about half of the athletic footwear and apparel business in the world , " he told deutsche welle .
" so you 've got the us versus the rest of the world , if you will .
now you 've got some markets – especially china – which are growing very quickly .
but that pales in comparison to the us . "
powell also said that both adidas and reebok had been losing market share in footwear " until very recently . "
" i really think that part of why adidas has struggled in the us is because they really do n't have a clear understanding of what the us consumer wants , " he said . " -lrb- but -rrb- i think they 're doing a much better job today than they were five years ago . "
what the us consumer really wants is fashion , powell said , adding that most athletic footwear " is n't used for sports . "
growth in north america and china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is also a rapidly growing market for adidas and nike some of the highlights of adidas ' quarterly exchange-rate-adjusted figures include a 10 percent increase in turnover for the adidas brand , and a 14 percent increase for the reebok brand .
the company 's overall third-quarter turnover increased in all regions , specifically 14 percent in north america and 9 percent in china .
powell said he believes there is a chance adidas could grow faster than nike in the next five years .
" historically the numbers would say it 's doable , but it 's a pretty steep hill to climb . "

with the spotlight on south korea , the government there has taken a number of steps to ensure the forum goes off without a hitch . south korea is in the grips of g20 fever.television ads play around the clock proclaiming korea ’ s readiness to host the summit .
banners hung around seoul urge residents to say hello and be extra courteous to the visiting foreigners .
the south korean government is taking preparations for the g20 very seriously .
it ’ s the largest international gathering the country has held since the 2002 world cup .
this week ’ s summit also marks the first time a non-g8 and asian nation has hosted the economic forum .
south korea proud to host g20 and considering that several decades ago , south korea was one of the world ’ s poorest nations , its quick rise to the top makes it a model for other nations to emulate , says un secretary general ban ki moon .
the former south korean foreign minister says he ’ s proud of his nation ’ s accomplishments that have been made in the light of its division and war with north korea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea has undertaken the largest-ever security operation he spoke during a press briefing today in seoul : " i think we meet at a critical moment , the spotlight is on korea and is the first g20 summit in an emerging market economy .
korea is a bridge between the developed and developing world .
this role has never been more necessary and important and so there is something very special about this g20 moment . "
activists protest against " unequal economic policies " but some opposed to the g20 are using this moment to raise attention what they call its flawed economic policies .
an umbrella organization representing 80 south korean labor and civic groups says the top economies have done little to help the world ’ s poor and offset global unemployment , which they say is the highest in years .
chun hyoung baek of the civic group people ’ s solidarity for participatory democracy delivered the activists ’ official statement .
she spoke through an interpreter : " we call upon the g20 to regulate financial capital , which have brought suffering to so many people .
we call on the g20 to tax speculators and use the revenues to expand welfare .
the g20 has revamped the international monetary fund whose structural adjustment programs have devastated the lives of people all around the world . "
and now as the g20 gets under way , korean and foreign activists are taking their message to the streets of seoul .
earlier this week , tens of thousands of protesters rallied against the g20 .
they were met by squads of korean riot police , who have been put on high alert ahead of the summit .
security tight in seoul some reports say the police used pepper spray to hold demonstrators back .
to keep protests like this under control and away from the g20 venues , seoul authorities have created a two kilometer buffer zone around the convention center .
it ’ s the largest security operation the nation has undertaken , according to the national police agency .
but south korea ’ s measures have only aggravated some protestors .
kim young hoon , president of the korean confederation of trade unions , says that president lee myung bak is denying their right to protest during the summit .
violence between trade unions and police has erupted in the past during anti free trade rallies .
police have been criticized for turning water cannons on protestors .
bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate in seoul to draw attention to global poverty issues and kim says that he can not ensure that his members won ’ t resort to violence again , if police prevent them from demonstrating : " excessive use of force to crack down on demonstrations and rallies , to crack down and oppress our rights , will induce or provoke the demonstrations to become violent , that nobody wants . "
south korean riot police are prepared to confront activist groups on thursday , the first day of the g20 summit , as protestors plan to march through the capital .

south korea proud to host g20 and considering that several decades ago , south korea was one of the world ’ s poorest nations , its quick rise to the top makes it a model for other nations to emulate , says un secretary general ban ki moon .
the former south korean foreign minister says he ’ s proud of his nation ’ s accomplishments that have been made in the light of its division and war with north korea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea has undertaken the largest-ever security operation he spoke during a press briefing today in seoul : " i think we meet at a critical moment , the spotlight is on korea and is the first g20 summit in an emerging market economy .
korea is a bridge between the developed and developing world .
this role has never been more necessary and important and so there is something very special about this g20 moment . "
activists protest against " unequal economic policies " but some opposed to the g20 are using this moment to raise attention what they call its flawed economic policies .
an umbrella organization representing 80 south korean labor and civic groups says the top economies have done little to help the world ’ s poor and offset global unemployment , which they say is the highest in years .
chun hyoung baek of the civic group people ’ s solidarity for participatory democracy delivered the activists ’ official statement .
she spoke through an interpreter : " we call upon the g20 to regulate financial capital , which have brought suffering to so many people .
we call on the g20 to tax speculators and use the revenues to expand welfare .
the g20 has revamped the international monetary fund whose structural adjustment programs have devastated the lives of people all around the world . "
and now as the g20 gets under way , korean and foreign activists are taking their message to the streets of seoul .
earlier this week , tens of thousands of protesters rallied against the g20 .
they were met by squads of korean riot police , who have been put on high alert ahead of the summit .
security tight in seoul some reports say the police used pepper spray to hold demonstrators back .
to keep protests like this under control and away from the g20 venues , seoul authorities have created a two kilometer buffer zone around the convention center .
it ’ s the largest security operation the nation has undertaken , according to the national police agency .
but south korea ’ s measures have only aggravated some protestors .
kim young hoon , president of the korean confederation of trade unions , says that president lee myung bak is denying their right to protest during the summit .
violence between trade unions and police has erupted in the past during anti free trade rallies .
police have been criticized for turning water cannons on protestors .
bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate in seoul to draw attention to global poverty issues and kim says that he can not ensure that his members won ’ t resort to violence again , if police prevent them from demonstrating : " excessive use of force to crack down on demonstrations and rallies , to crack down and oppress our rights , will induce or provoke the demonstrations to become violent , that nobody wants . "
south korean riot police are prepared to confront activist groups on thursday , the first day of the g20 summit , as protestors plan to march through the capital .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.11.2010 as bush plugs his memoir , european anger still simmers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-president bush has reignited dormant anger in europe as george w. bush returns to the public eye to promote his recently published memoirs , he is polarizing opinion .
his book is unlikely to help heal the rift that emerged between the us and europe while he was in office . the 43rd us president 's apparent mission to have his two terms in the white house reassessed and his reputation rehabilitated through his new book , " decision points , " has many europeans shaking their heads . and it 's not just the most inflammatory excerpts - such as bush 's assertion that water-boarding of terror suspects saved lives - that are causing an outcry . bush 's supporters in the us say that every president has the right to defend his record ; " decision points " shows the former president as a man who was ideologically consistent during his eight years in office . his detractors counter that the president 's mistakes and his determination to follow ill-thought-out policies - without a thought for a possible , rectifying change of direction - plunged the us into a decade of war and the worst financial crisis in over 80 years .
while george w. bush may have been a good guy with a difficult job , they say , he does n't deserve to be rehabilitated via his memoirs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush left office with two wars and an economic crisis raging if bush 's single-minded and heavy-handed approach to afghanistan and iraq in the wake of the terror attacks of 9/11 were damaging to his relations with his european allies at the time , his newly released memoirs appear to be giving european readers the chance get angry all over again . europeans , even allies , dismissed as irrelevant " in my opinion , there ’ s been no change in perception of bush in europe , " dr. henning meyer , a transatlantic relations expert at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle . " his legacy projects , such as iraq and afghanistan , are still the main issues associated with his presidency and of course europeans are still affected by these and in most cases are still in opposition to a certain degree .
if you remember , bush ’ s war on terror effectively split europe .
so these things have not been forgotten . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush says the uk 's perception of him does n't matter in " decision points , " bush is dismissive about those europeans who had taken a risk to follow him into war in iraq , and he talks frankly about his reputation in the one country whose leaders followed him most obediently of all : england .
" it does n't matter how people perceive me in england , " he writes .
" it just does n't matter any more .
and frankly , at times , it did n't matter then . " in a veiled dig at what he saw at the time as the rest of europe 's lack of stomach for the fight , bush writes : " people in europe said : ' ah , man , he 's a religious fanatic , cowboy , simpleton . '
all that stuff ...
if you believe that freedom is universal , then you should n't be surprised when people take courageous measures to live in a free society . " he reserves his most scathing treatment for those european leaders who disappointed him most , especially during the iraq war : former german chancellor gerhard schroeder comes in for even worse treatment than former french president jacques chirac , schroeder 's ally in the european anti-war opposition . german emotions still raw over bush 's rush to war in the book , bush accuses schroeder of abusing his trust after allegedly telling the president in 2002 , before the invasion of iraq the following year , that " what goes for afghanistan also goes for iraq .
nations which support terrorism must accept the consequences .
if you go forward fast and resolutely , i am on your side . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush did n't trust schroeder after the latter withdrew his support however , struggling in his re-election campaign in the fall of that year , schroeder hitched his wagon to the huge swell of anti-war feeling in germany and across europe .
he claims bush is lying when he says that he had offered his support for an invasion , and that he 'd made it clear all along that his support was conditional on whether iraq really had weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- . " schroeder 's support -lrb- for the invasion of iraq -rrb- was conditional on evidence being found of terrorists being harbored in iraq , so when there was no evidence delivered , he withdrew his support , " lse professor meyer told deutsche welle .
" bush is attempting to polish his own picture of this situation with the germans by saying that the breakdown in relations was not his fault and that it was schroeder who turned opinion against him . " the bush legacy is still powerfully felt in the united states : the armed forces are embroiled in the two wars he started ; the financial system is struggling to pull out of an overwhelming crisis , and politicians are scrambling to rebuild their credibility on the world stage . but the ripples from his eight-year presidency continue to be felt in europe as well .
under his leadership , decades of trust and cooperation between the us and european governments was damaged . according to thomas klau , a transatlantic relations expert at the european council for foreign relations , the memoir provides new fodder for europeans who are skeptical about the us political system . " europeans , and germans in particular , are still amazed that the us political system has the potential to elect such an incompetent leader who has no respect for western values , " klau said .
" while obama gave some hope , the germans are now saddened to see that a discredited party such as the republicans can be re-elected as the majority in the house of representatives . " germans see the republican mid-term victory as proof that " the us system and electorate has a very short memory and very little wisdom . " european anger reignited over torture statements so far , european reaction to the bush memoirs has been heavily affected by comments in the book that seem to advocate torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims water boarding extracted vital information for meyer , the water-boarding comments are " a very clear example of the philosophical differences between the bush administration and the europeans . " " there is a huge difference in what bush thought was acceptable in terms of the war on terror and what the europeans thought , " he added .
" bush saw approaches such as water-boarding as not a breaking of any laws but a legitimate bending of them . " moreover , bush " made bold statements " that the information gained from water-boarding stopped an attack on london - a claim the uk refutes . " most people in europe say that there were other ways of getting the information and that bush ’ s assertions are just not true , " meyer said . severe - and lasting - damage ? the response to his memoirs suggests that the damage bush did to his country 's reputation in europe remains severe . " bush 's was the worst us presidency that europe and the world has ever seen and his legacy , in political and economic terms , will be seen as one of disaster , " said klau .
" few people will expect to see any change in this perception arising from his memoirs .
in fact , it 's highly likely that his already terrible reputation in europe will take an even worse turn . " bush may have come out with his book to try and put the record straight in his own words .
but in doing so , at least in europe , it appears that he has taken a big stick to a hornet 's nest of his own making . author : nick amies editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

clubs promised to help depressed players .
however in football , does success come first ? professional football can put enormous pressure on its players .
in the bundesliga , the race for goals , points , championship and money can all pile on the pressure .
however , one year on from the tragic death of former national goalkeeper robert enke , what has really changed to help troubled players ?
as goalkeeper for eintracht frankfurt , bochum , stuttgart and kaiserslautern , thomas ernst has experienced the highs and lows of the football league .
he is currently technical director at second league club bochum .
from his years of playing experience , he knows about the mental condition of the players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas ernst -lrb- right -rrb- with bochum player chong tese " there are situations during a game when people whistle and shout personal insults at you , where every player meets challenges they can not cope with , " ernst told deutsche welle .
" the pressure is there in training , and again when playing in the stadium , " said ernst .
" it can really build up , and that stresses you out . "
footballers ' union provides help even before robert enke 's death , the union that looks after contract footballers , the vdv , was witnessing an increase of players seeking help .
the vdv has been offering psychological and pastoral advice to footballers for several years , said its chief executive ulf baranowsky .
" immediately after the tragic death of robert enke , the number of people inquiring about these services shot up , " said baranowsky .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outpouring of grief after enke 's death highlighted the issue of depression in sports since enke 's death more than two dozen players have sought advice or counseling through the vdv .
players can contact the union in strict confidentiality , or anonymously by email if they wish .
the facade is all part of the game for the psychologist thomas graw , who has worked with several bundesliga professionals , robert enke 's case was not an isolated one . " players learn to have certain internal processes to shield their feelings from the outside , " said graw .
" they see it as part of their job and their career , " he added .
even if a player looks fine from the outside , he could be suffering inside .
the psychologists who work with the vdv look out for whether a player might be suffering from a short-term mood fluctuation , or more long-term depression .
problems include fear of failure , performance anxiety , issues with coaches , bullying and " anything that affects the psyche " said baronowsky .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clubs and teammates need to be more understanding about mental illness added to these problems is a lack of understanding from teammates and coaches .
" i can well imagine that there are many coaches and teammates who reject the idea completely and just say , ' all right , well , he has no place playing here then , " ' said graw .
change unlikely in many of the speeches which were made after robert enke 's death , voices from across the world of soccer said more must be done to help those suffering from mental illness .
a major rethink was ordered across the multi-million dollar business of football .
however , according to thomas ernst at bochum , these words have failed to turn into real actions .
there has been little progress in clubs ' understanding and tackling of those with mental illness .
" basically , in the businesses and in the processes , nothing has changed . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 10.11.2010 security flaw discovered in german digital id card software großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new electronic id card was released on november 1 one day after its release , the software used to read new german id cards is shown to be vulnerable to attack .
the federal office for information security has removed links to the program from its website . jan schejbal , a german computer security researcher living in sweden , on tuesday described a way to hack the new electronic german id card software .
the federal office responsible for the program stopped allowing the software to be downloaded on wednesday . the new cards , which became available november 1 and will gradually replace current german cards , contain an rfid wireless chip - the same kind found in many contactless security or payment keycards .
the chip stores digital versions of the card holder 's photo , name , address , date of birth , height , eye and hair color and location of issuance . the interior ministry and the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- have claimed the cards will help the government provide easy-to-use digital signatures and other government services , as well as protection against online scams and phishing attacks .
germans can also use the ids in place of a passport when traveling within the european union . spoofing the server but to be useful to individuals , the digital information on the cards needs to be accessed with a card reader .
it 's the ausweisapp -lrb- " id app " -rrb- software that runs the card reader which is flawed , according to schejbal . after downloading the first version of ausweisapp from a german government website , he noticed a major flaw when the program checks for updates .
the software does not verify the origin of a digital security -lrb- ssl -rrb- certificate , which leaves the program open to a spoof attack that conceivably could lead to the download of malicious software . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia has had digital id cards for eight years " the electronic id itself may have quite a high security level , " said schejbal in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" however , this security becomes worthless if the framework which is used to access this secure core is insecure and allows compromising overall security . " had the new electronic id card already been widely used , the security flaw in updating would have been significant , according to karsten nohl , an independent security expert based in berlin . " fortunately , that is not the case and the bug can be fixed swiftly , " he told deutsche welle .
" this vulnerability is another reminder of the complexity of the id card security system , not all of which has been tested rigorously . " in a statement to the german tech news website heise.de , the bsi said it was looking into the update issue .
it also removed the software from its website to prevent more people from downloading the flawed program . " the media has been made aware of a perceived vulnerability in the software ausweisapp necessary for the eid feature of the new id card , " it wrote .
bsi did not reply to deutsche welle 's request for comment .
" if a vulnerability exists in the software , the bsi will provide a new version of the software without delay and will inform the public accordingly . " digital id cards expanding across europe digital ids have been spreading across the continent in recent years .
estonia has had one for nearly a decade , with a slew of electronic government services , and legally binding digital signatures to go along with it .
belgium , sweden , spain , portugal all currently have electronic id cards , and there are plans in place to release such cards in luxembourg and the czech republic . while schejbal added that he is not opposed to the concept of an electronic id , he advised germans to avoid the cards for as long as possible . " it is not secure , and it will put the user at risk , " he wrote .
" if the electronic identity is abused , the user will have a hard time proving that he did not authorize a transaction . " previous flaws have been discovered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital id cards have a corresponding reader when used with a computer schejbal 's discovery is n't the first time security flaws were found in the new electronic id cards .
in september , the german hacker collective the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- demonstrated how the card reader 's security measures could be circumvented . after obtaining an id card 's pin number by using a program that records individual keystrokes , the hackers were able to rewrite all the information on the id .
card readers come in a variety of models , and the ccc circumvented the most basic model . security researchers have doubts manuel bach , the electronic id project manager at the bsi , responded by saying that germans must take responsibility for their own computer security and ensure their computers remain free of the malicious software needed to steal pins and other personal data . " the germany id card ca n't protect you from trojan horses , it 's just a piece of plastic with a microchip inside , " he told deutsche welle in an interview last month .
" you as a citizen or computer user have a responsibility to secure your system .
if you do that you 're very safe , even with a basic card reader . " but constanze kurz , a ccc spokeswoman , said the government should n't expect all germans to be tech whizzes . " if you pretend that all your citizens are really good with computers , and that they can manage their own it security on their systems , then you are definitely wrong , " she said in an interview with deutsche welle .

with the spotlight on south korea , the government there has taken a number of steps to ensure the forum goes off without a hitch . south korea is in the grips of g20 fever.television ads play around the clock proclaiming korea ’ s readiness to host the summit .
banners hung around seoul urge residents to say hello and be extra courteous to the visiting foreigners .
the south korean government is taking preparations for the g20 very seriously .
it ’ s the largest international gathering the country has held since the 2002 world cup .
this week ’ s summit also marks the first time a non-g8 and asian nation has hosted the economic forum .
south korea proud to host g20 and considering that several decades ago , south korea was one of the world ’ s poorest nations , its quick rise to the top makes it a model for other nations to emulate , says un secretary general ban ki moon .
the former south korean foreign minister says he ’ s proud of his nation ’ s accomplishments that have been made in the light of its division and war with north korea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea has undertaken the largest-ever security operation he spoke during a press briefing today in seoul : " i think we meet at a critical moment , the spotlight is on korea and is the first g20 summit in an emerging market economy .
korea is a bridge between the developed and developing world .
this role has never been more necessary and important and so there is something very special about this g20 moment . "
activists protest against " unequal economic policies " but some opposed to the g20 are using this moment to raise attention what they call its flawed economic policies .
an umbrella organization representing 80 south korean labor and civic groups says the top economies have done little to help the world ’ s poor and offset global unemployment , which they say is the highest in years .
chun hyoung baek of the civic group people ’ s solidarity for participatory democracy delivered the activists ’ official statement .
she spoke through an interpreter : " we call upon the g20 to regulate financial capital , which have brought suffering to so many people .
we call on the g20 to tax speculators and use the revenues to expand welfare .
the g20 has revamped the international monetary fund whose structural adjustment programs have devastated the lives of people all around the world . "
and now as the g20 gets under way , korean and foreign activists are taking their message to the streets of seoul .
earlier this week , tens of thousands of protesters rallied against the g20 .
they were met by squads of korean riot police , who have been put on high alert ahead of the summit .
security tight in seoul some reports say the police used pepper spray to hold demonstrators back .
to keep protests like this under control and away from the g20 venues , seoul authorities have created a two kilometer buffer zone around the convention center .
it ’ s the largest security operation the nation has undertaken , according to the national police agency .
but south korea ’ s measures have only aggravated some protestors .
kim young hoon , president of the korean confederation of trade unions , says that president lee myung bak is denying their right to protest during the summit .
violence between trade unions and police has erupted in the past during anti free trade rallies .
police have been criticized for turning water cannons on protestors .
bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate in seoul to draw attention to global poverty issues and kim says that he can not ensure that his members won ’ t resort to violence again , if police prevent them from demonstrating : " excessive use of force to crack down on demonstrations and rallies , to crack down and oppress our rights , will induce or provoke the demonstrations to become violent , that nobody wants . "
south korean riot police are prepared to confront activist groups on thursday , the first day of the g20 summit , as protestors plan to march through the capital .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 10.11.2010 security flaw discovered in german digital id card software großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new electronic id card was released on november 1 one day after its release , the software used to read new german id cards is shown to be vulnerable to attack .
the federal office for information security has removed links to the program from its website . jan schejbal , a german computer security researcher living in sweden , on tuesday described a way to hack the new electronic german id card software .
the federal office responsible for the program stopped allowing the software to be downloaded on wednesday . the new cards , which became available november 1 and will gradually replace current german cards , contain an rfid wireless chip - the same kind found in many contactless security or payment keycards .
the chip stores digital versions of the card holder 's photo , name , address , date of birth , height , eye and hair color and location of issuance . the interior ministry and the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- have claimed the cards will help the government provide easy-to-use digital signatures and other government services , as well as protection against online scams and phishing attacks .
germans can also use the ids in place of a passport when traveling within the european union . spoofing the server but to be useful to individuals , the digital information on the cards needs to be accessed with a card reader .
it 's the ausweisapp -lrb- " id app " -rrb- software that runs the card reader which is flawed , according to schejbal . after downloading the first version of ausweisapp from a german government website , he noticed a major flaw when the program checks for updates .
the software does not verify the origin of a digital security -lrb- ssl -rrb- certificate , which leaves the program open to a spoof attack that conceivably could lead to the download of malicious software . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia has had digital id cards for eight years " the electronic id itself may have quite a high security level , " said schejbal in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" however , this security becomes worthless if the framework which is used to access this secure core is insecure and allows compromising overall security . " had the new electronic id card already been widely used , the security flaw in updating would have been significant , according to karsten nohl , an independent security expert based in berlin . " fortunately , that is not the case and the bug can be fixed swiftly , " he told deutsche welle .
" this vulnerability is another reminder of the complexity of the id card security system , not all of which has been tested rigorously . " in a statement to the german tech news website heise.de , the bsi said it was looking into the update issue .
it also removed the software from its website to prevent more people from downloading the flawed program . " the media has been made aware of a perceived vulnerability in the software ausweisapp necessary for the eid feature of the new id card , " it wrote .
bsi did not reply to deutsche welle 's request for comment .
" if a vulnerability exists in the software , the bsi will provide a new version of the software without delay and will inform the public accordingly . " digital id cards expanding across europe digital ids have been spreading across the continent in recent years .
estonia has had one for nearly a decade , with a slew of electronic government services , and legally binding digital signatures to go along with it .
belgium , sweden , spain , portugal all currently have electronic id cards , and there are plans in place to release such cards in luxembourg and the czech republic . while schejbal added that he is not opposed to the concept of an electronic id , he advised germans to avoid the cards for as long as possible . " it is not secure , and it will put the user at risk , " he wrote .
" if the electronic identity is abused , the user will have a hard time proving that he did not authorize a transaction . " previous flaws have been discovered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital id cards have a corresponding reader when used with a computer schejbal 's discovery is n't the first time security flaws were found in the new electronic id cards .
in september , the german hacker collective the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- demonstrated how the card reader 's security measures could be circumvented . after obtaining an id card 's pin number by using a program that records individual keystrokes , the hackers were able to rewrite all the information on the id .
card readers come in a variety of models , and the ccc circumvented the most basic model . security researchers have doubts manuel bach , the electronic id project manager at the bsi , responded by saying that germans must take responsibility for their own computer security and ensure their computers remain free of the malicious software needed to steal pins and other personal data . " the germany id card ca n't protect you from trojan horses , it 's just a piece of plastic with a microchip inside , " he told deutsche welle in an interview last month .
" you as a citizen or computer user have a responsibility to secure your system .
if you do that you 're very safe , even with a basic card reader . " but constanze kurz , a ccc spokeswoman , said the government should n't expect all germans to be tech whizzes . " if you pretend that all your citizens are really good with computers , and that they can manage their own it security on their systems , then you are definitely wrong , " she said in an interview with deutsche welle .

" putting our energy system onto a new , more sustainable and secure path may take time but ambitious decisions need to be taken now . " the energy chief said individual governments ' priorities in the 27-member bloc had limited european energy policy in the past , and that this must change . " to have an efficient , competitive and low-carbon economy we have to europeanize our energy policy and focus on a few , but pressing , priorities , " oettinger said . energy connections between member states tend to be scattered and inefficient , a hangover from pre-eu times when most national grids were the property of state-run monopolies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 10.11.2010 german economic sages point to increased growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang franz and his team of ' wise men ' have n't delivered such good news for some time the german government 's team of five economic ' wise men ' have predicted consistent economic growth , lower unemployment , and reduced budget deficits for 2010 and 2011 .
however , they have warned against sudden tax cuts . the german council of economic experts predicted on wednesday that germany 's economy will grow by 3.7 percent in 2010 , and by 2.2 percent in 2011 - a prognosis that even exceeds the latest official estimates from chancellor angela merkel 's government .
" the pleasing upward trend in the german economy offers the chance for a stable , if relatively flat , path of growth , " the council 's chairman , wolfgang franz said .
" also , the government is in a position to considerably bolster these chances with solid economic policies . "
increased consumption , investments and demand for german exports are fuelling the recovery , and should lead to reduced levels of unemployment and state borrowing , the experts said .
however , they also cautioned that a repeat of germany 's so-called economic miracle in the post-war era was not on the cards .
the council , often referred to as the five wise men of the economy -lrb- in fact , one is a woman -rrb- , was set up in 1963 to advise the government on economic policy . " i think we are all delighted that the situation this year looks a lot more optimistic than last year , " chancellor angela merkel said on receiving the report , promising to continue with governent plans to save money .
" we are well aware that the structure of our current budget - designed as a response to the recent crisis with over 50 percent of spending going towards social security - is not a sustainable model for the future , especially considering our ageing population . "
taxation and borrowing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government says reducing borrowing still takes priority over tax cuts the chairman of the expert panel , wolfgang franz , told chancellor merkel that her government could support the fragile growth by issuing stricter regulations on the global financial sector and continuing to consolidate german overspending .
he also issued two warnings to governments , employers , and trade unions - advising against " rash cuts in taxes " and " excessive increases in wages . "
tax cuts were a major campaign platform of merkel 's pro-business coalition partners , the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , and the party - which is struggling in the polls - is keen that they are introduced sooner rather than later .
economic minister rainer bruederle , a member of the fdp , told german public television on wednesday that his party would be patient before cutting taxes , but the cuts would come .
" not today , but soon .
because if the economy really does grow as predicted , then - after implementing the measures to balance the budget that we have made priority number one - there might be a bit of lee-way for some slight cuts in the middle-bracket . "
bruederle said .
" but , as our coalition keeps saying , we must reduce the budget deficit as a short-term priority , and then think about taxation in the medium term . "
bruederle said that the government might be in a position to start the process by 2012 - especially in light of the panel 's prediction that germany might dip below the prescribed eu budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 .
but the economists see this matter very differently , arguing that there will be no room for tax cuts during the current legislative period -lrb- which ends in 2013 -rrb- , and saying it may not even be possible early in the next one .
instead , the group suggested that berlin might be forced to raise taxes slightly in order to meet its target of cutting 80 billion euros in spending between 2010 and 2014 .
job market to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to target germany 's unemployment problem the german economic experts also predicted reduced joblessness for 2011 , with germany set to dip below 3 million unemployed next year .
earlier in the week , buoyed by the prospect of good news from her experts , chancellor merkel told the focus news magazine that full employment was a major goal for her government .
" i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " she said .
" we must , and can , get these people back to work . "
however , the cologne-based institute for economic research predicts that a rate of around 5 percent unemployment , meaning roughly 2 million germans out of work , would be a more realistic goal in the foreseeable future .
" at that point the structural issues behind joblessness start to become a problem , " the institute 's president michael huether explained .
" things like a lack of qualifications , the unsuitability of candidates for the jobs on offer , and vice versa . "
economic envy in the english press germany is leading eu member states as the bloc struggles to emerge from recession - something which has caused the british media to take note in recent weeks .
as britain 's coalition government , elected earlier this year , looks to introduce tough spending cuts and jumpstart the faltering economy , more and more media outlets are reevaluating the merits of the relatively export-heavy , frugal economic policies which germans call " rhineland capitalism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's new leadership duo are making drastic cuts for little reward " a decade ago we considered the german economy a write-off .
now -lrb- prime minister -rrb- david cameron looks to angela merkel for inspiration , " a columnist at the left-leaning guardian newspaper , david gow , wrote in a recent commentary .
germany only partially followed the anglo-american movement towards dependence on the financial and services sectors in the latter half of the 20th century , preferring to maintain some industrial output and favoring a relatively cautious banking community .
the decision was often derided as backward , and even harmful to less cautious western neighbors , but now british commentators are asking whether the same caution has proved the key to a relatively swift recovery .
even the conservative newspaper , the times , has recently turned against the higher-risk capitalism favored in the english-speaking world , suggesting that germany 's export-heavy model is " leaving britain behind . "
yet there are other voices in the uk , like london-based financial analysts lombard street research , who point to decreasing demand in china and continued economic problems in the us and much of southern europe , suggesting that this could mean that germany 's export-driven recovery might falter in the near future .

however , they have warned against sudden tax cuts . the german council of economic experts predicted on wednesday that germany 's economy will grow by 3.7 percent in 2010 , and by 2.2 percent in 2011 - a prognosis that even exceeds the latest official estimates from chancellor angela merkel 's government .
" the pleasing upward trend in the german economy offers the chance for a stable , if relatively flat , path of growth , " the council 's chairman , wolfgang franz said .
" also , the government is in a position to considerably bolster these chances with solid economic policies . "
increased consumption , investments and demand for german exports are fuelling the recovery , and should lead to reduced levels of unemployment and state borrowing , the experts said .
however , they also cautioned that a repeat of germany 's so-called economic miracle in the post-war era was not on the cards .
the council , often referred to as the five wise men of the economy -lrb- in fact , one is a woman -rrb- , was set up in 1963 to advise the government on economic policy . " i think we are all delighted that the situation this year looks a lot more optimistic than last year , " chancellor angela merkel said on receiving the report , promising to continue with governent plans to save money .
" we are well aware that the structure of our current budget - designed as a response to the recent crisis with over 50 percent of spending going towards social security - is not a sustainable model for the future , especially considering our ageing population . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 10.11.2010 german economic sages point to increased growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang franz and his team of ' wise men ' have n't delivered such good news for some time the german government 's team of five economic ' wise men ' have predicted consistent economic growth , lower unemployment , and reduced budget deficits for 2010 and 2011 .
however , they have warned against sudden tax cuts . the german council of economic experts predicted on wednesday that germany 's economy will grow by 3.7 percent in 2010 , and by 2.2 percent in 2011 - a prognosis that even exceeds the latest official estimates from chancellor angela merkel 's government .
" the pleasing upward trend in the german economy offers the chance for a stable , if relatively flat , path of growth , " the council 's chairman , wolfgang franz said .
" also , the government is in a position to considerably bolster these chances with solid economic policies . "
increased consumption , investments and demand for german exports are fuelling the recovery , and should lead to reduced levels of unemployment and state borrowing , the experts said .
however , they also cautioned that a repeat of germany 's so-called economic miracle in the post-war era was not on the cards .
the council , often referred to as the five wise men of the economy -lrb- in fact , one is a woman -rrb- , was set up in 1963 to advise the government on economic policy . " i think we are all delighted that the situation this year looks a lot more optimistic than last year , " chancellor angela merkel said on receiving the report , promising to continue with governent plans to save money .
" we are well aware that the structure of our current budget - designed as a response to the recent crisis with over 50 percent of spending going towards social security - is not a sustainable model for the future , especially considering our ageing population . "
taxation and borrowing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government says reducing borrowing still takes priority over tax cuts the chairman of the expert panel , wolfgang franz , told chancellor merkel that her government could support the fragile growth by issuing stricter regulations on the global financial sector and continuing to consolidate german overspending .
he also issued two warnings to governments , employers , and trade unions - advising against " rash cuts in taxes " and " excessive increases in wages . "
tax cuts were a major campaign platform of merkel 's pro-business coalition partners , the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , and the party - which is struggling in the polls - is keen that they are introduced sooner rather than later .
economic minister rainer bruederle , a member of the fdp , told german public television on wednesday that his party would be patient before cutting taxes , but the cuts would come .
" not today , but soon .
because if the economy really does grow as predicted , then - after implementing the measures to balance the budget that we have made priority number one - there might be a bit of lee-way for some slight cuts in the middle-bracket . "
bruederle said .
" but , as our coalition keeps saying , we must reduce the budget deficit as a short-term priority , and then think about taxation in the medium term . "
bruederle said that the government might be in a position to start the process by 2012 - especially in light of the panel 's prediction that germany might dip below the prescribed eu budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 .
but the economists see this matter very differently , arguing that there will be no room for tax cuts during the current legislative period -lrb- which ends in 2013 -rrb- , and saying it may not even be possible early in the next one .
instead , the group suggested that berlin might be forced to raise taxes slightly in order to meet its target of cutting 80 billion euros in spending between 2010 and 2014 .
job market to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to target germany 's unemployment problem the german economic experts also predicted reduced joblessness for 2011 , with germany set to dip below 3 million unemployed next year .
earlier in the week , buoyed by the prospect of good news from her experts , chancellor merkel told the focus news magazine that full employment was a major goal for her government .
" i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " she said .
" we must , and can , get these people back to work . "
however , the cologne-based institute for economic research predicts that a rate of around 5 percent unemployment , meaning roughly 2 million germans out of work , would be a more realistic goal in the foreseeable future .
" at that point the structural issues behind joblessness start to become a problem , " the institute 's president michael huether explained .
" things like a lack of qualifications , the unsuitability of candidates for the jobs on offer , and vice versa . "
economic envy in the english press germany is leading eu member states as the bloc struggles to emerge from recession - something which has caused the british media to take note in recent weeks .
as britain 's coalition government , elected earlier this year , looks to introduce tough spending cuts and jumpstart the faltering economy , more and more media outlets are reevaluating the merits of the relatively export-heavy , frugal economic policies which germans call " rhineland capitalism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's new leadership duo are making drastic cuts for little reward " a decade ago we considered the german economy a write-off .
now -lrb- prime minister -rrb- david cameron looks to angela merkel for inspiration , " a columnist at the left-leaning guardian newspaper , david gow , wrote in a recent commentary .
germany only partially followed the anglo-american movement towards dependence on the financial and services sectors in the latter half of the 20th century , preferring to maintain some industrial output and favoring a relatively cautious banking community .
the decision was often derided as backward , and even harmful to less cautious western neighbors , but now british commentators are asking whether the same caution has proved the key to a relatively swift recovery .
even the conservative newspaper , the times , has recently turned against the higher-risk capitalism favored in the english-speaking world , suggesting that germany 's export-heavy model is " leaving britain behind . "

sarkozy wasted no time in signing the bill on wednesday , just hours after the court ruling .
he said in a statement that while he heard the concerns expressed by opponents during the debate , it was his " duty " to ensure the pension fund 's integrity .
" with this law , our redistributive pension system has been saved , " he said .
" french citizens can now be assured that they can count on their retirement and that pension payments will be maintained . "
sarkozy 's right-of-center government insisted the reform , which raises the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the full retirement age from 65 to 67 , was necessary to fill a major budget gap as france 's population ages and few workers are paying into the system .
the law will gradually come into effect in july 2011 and will be fully enacted by 2018 .

sarkozy 's right-of-center government insisted the reform , which raises the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the full retirement age from 65 to 67 , was necessary to fill a major budget gap as france 's population ages and few workers are paying into the system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 10.11.2010 world leaders told not to waver on financial reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial regulation is high on the agenda in seoul an international financial think-tank has warned world leaders attending the g20 summit of top economies to concentrate on improving global banking regulations . following a two-day meeting attended by financial executives , regulators and policy-makers , the international centre for financial regulation -lrb- icfr -rrb- has called on leaders attending the g20 summit in seoul to focus on the most workable reforms .
in a press release , the icfr said there was widespread fear in the sector that the g20 could " fail to make progress on its goals , as domestic considerations move back center-stage . "
it urged leaders to agree on financial reforms most likely improve economic stability and achieve international implementation . " we are calling on the g20 to prioritize more effective cross-border coordination by supervisors , and for agreement on the way forward on crisis resolution to allow for the orderly wind-down of complex banks , " barbara ridpath , ceo of the watchdog said in a statement .
" time for unity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki moon has urged leaders to find common ground the icfr calls were echoed by united nations secretary general ban ki-moon , who is in the south korean capital for the international summit .
on the eve of the meeting , he expressed concern over national differences of opinion on global rebalancing and currency policies .
" the global economic recovery remains fragile .
64 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty this year , " ban said , adding that this was a time for unity .
he said the world could not afford to think narrowly about development and economic growth , and that " all countries and all peoples have a stake in the management of the global economy . "
on the agenda leaders at the seoul g20 summit , the first to be held in an emerging market economy , are expected to sign off on the basel iii agreement , which is designed to tighten global capital and liquidity requirements for banks from 2013 onwards . bildunterschrift : the summit is being watched closely by managers in frankfurt 's banking towers drafted by the basel committee of central bankers and regulators back in september , the package is considered a significant step down the path towards financial stability .
it also tipped by observers to be one of the few items on the regulation agenda that is likely to receive broad support in seoul .
the only other real progress the talks are expected to yield is the endorsement of a series of agreements aimed at tightening supervision of the derivatives market and ensuring the standardization of contracts to facilitate central clearing processes and trading on exchanges .
safety nets on the issue of " too big to fail " banks , analysts are expecting little movement .
the financial stability board -lrb- fsb -rrb- , which is responsible for the implementation of g20 regulatory pledges , is expected to lay out a set of recommendations on " systemically important financial institutions , " otherwise known as sifis , involving the largest 20 or so global banks .
under the terms of the proposals , regulators would be required to make sure that sifis , the list of which is yet to be finalized , prepare living wills outlining how , if necessary , they could be wound up without causing major upset on the markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsbc is likely to feature on the list of global banks deemed too big to fail g20 members have not , as yet , been able to agree on many of the details of sifis , but there is speculation that the list will not include big asian banks .
their business is conducted primarily in domestic markets .
they therefore pose little threat to the wider world if they go under .
ratings , commodities and accounting summit delegates are , however , tipped to rubber-stamp fsb proposals for reducing market reliance on rating agencies .
if they do green-light the suggestion , they will have to find alternative ways of assessing creditworthiness .
regulators say the move would reduce what is known as the cliff effect , which contributes to market destabilization .
in the name of yet greater stability , the group of 20 wealthy and emerging nations is also calling for more transparency in commodity markets .
this week , regulators ruled a major overhaul , but they did concede more pricing information was needed from physical commodity markets .
there is little hope of movement on the establishment of a single set of global accounting standards .
the june 2011 deadline is likely to be overshot due to differences between the g20 member states , but analysts say the summit could be an opportunity to push for resolution .

in addition to keeping the " global currency war " from escalating , a common goal must be reaffirmed . the sheer scale of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit can be staggering .
representing 90 percent of the world 's economic power , and four-fifths of global trade , the summit is crisis-oriented .
it was called into life in 1999 as a reaction to financial crises in asia , brazil and russia , and was initially a meeting of financial ministers .
when lehman brothers investment bank collapsed in the fall of 2008 , it unleashed a global financial crisis , and the g20 became a vehicle to combat recession .
that 's when heads of state became involved .
it has been nearly two years since a package of financial measures was decided on in washington .
their aim is to ensure such an unprecedented global crisis never happens again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique strauss-kahn says global cooperation is needed for dominique strauss-kahn , a french politician and managing director of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the most important realization of the crisis is that egoism on the national level needs to yield to global cooperation .
" in my view one of the main features of this crisis has been the emergence of a willingness to work together , of a new kind of economic cooperation at the global level which never existed , never happened in the past , " strauss-kahn said in october at the annual meeting of the imf in washington .
according to strauss-kahn , that spirit of cooperation was present at past g20 summits in london , pittsburgh and toronto .
but the meeting starting thursday in seoul may show a decrease in countries ' willingness to cooperate at a global level .
" that is a real threat … there is no domestic solution to a global crisis , " he said .
summit as a litmus test the g20 summit participants surely know global cooperation is the way forward .
in the end , however , each country has to master its own national politics in order to institute financial reform .
that 's why german chancellor angela merkel says she is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far " in terms of the financial sector 's participation in carrying the costs of the crisis , the german government could have pictured more , " she told german parliamentarians in october as she outlined her goals for the seoul gathering .
while germany imposed a nationwide " financial crisis responsibility fee " on its banks , the g20 failed to agree on an international tax on financial markets .
nevertheless , europe will be bringing something to the table in seoul : its oversight of financial systems will be significantly improved .
risky financial products may be forbidden under certain circumstances and control over hedge funds and ratings agencies is being tightened .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has expressed concerns about the seoul g20 summit .
he says it comes at a critical point in time , as all parties will have to accept that global economic imbalances affect them all .
" it will be a real test of whether the g20 can deliver the coordination the world economy needs , " he wrote in an open letter .
no hint of unity despite numerous promises to disallow protectionism , the g20 nations are far from unified in their efforts to do so .
each is primarily acting with the strength its own domestic economy in mind , and the resulting imbalance is fertile ground for another crisis .
the trade balances of the individual countries – the ratio of their exports versus imports – is filled with dormant potential for conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imposed a fee on its banks , but an international tax was not agreed on in outlining her goals for the seoul g20 summit , merkel asked what countries can " do together for sustainable , strong and balanced growth . "
she wants to see this entirely accomplished by unadulterated market forces as such balances are an expression of economic competitiveness .
no answers on currency currency exchange rates are an inevitable source of controversy in the current scenario of global trade , and some analysts have already dubbed the situation a " global currency war . "
the problem is that some countries are trying to gain a competitive edge by devaluing their own currencies to make exports more attractive .
china and the united states are the primary practitioners of this tactic , with south korea , japan and brazil jointing in too .
a precarious race has begun .
the seoul g20 summit wo n't solve this problem , but merkel says that exchange rates should accurately reflect the fundamental data of a country 's domestic prosperity for the time being .
" a political scenario which targets currency distortion to strengthen economic competitiveness must be avoided , " merkel said .
france , which is due to take over south korea 's presidency of the g20 , wants to make currency policies a central issue .
still , one central issue may be the most important of all during the talks – whether the 20 nations can demonstrate they are all moving in the same direction , even if they were forced into negotiations by a crisis .

and he has been in charge ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolaus breuel is expected to lose his job but that now looks set to change .
members of db 's body of governors told the dpa news agency on tuesday that a non-scheduled board meeting had been called for friday to discuss personnel issues .
there has been significant speculation over the past weeks that ulrich homburg , managing director of db mobility and logistics , which oversees the long-distance division , is unhappy with breuel 's handling of a string of glitches to hit high-speed ice trains over the past couple of years .
the first major problem arose in 2008 when a broken axel highlighted a necessity for more frequent maintenance checks .
this led to a reduction in the number of reserve trains available on the network and saw service reliability drop as a result .
winter travelers have had to put up with regular delays and cancellations .
bildunterschrift : the heat was too much for too many passengers poor management public outrage reached a peak this summer when air conditioning in several high-speed trains failed and thousands of passengers had to be paid compensation .
in one incident , db customers were stranded for three hours in a tunnel when their train broke down in sweltering temperatures .
several passengers had to be taken to hospital . the combination of events has done nothing to enhance deutsche bahn 's image , and breuel , once pipped as a possible successor to the former ceo of the deutsche bahn group hartmut mehdorn , now looks set to take the rap .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.11.2010 currency likely to take center stage at seoul g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 summit starts in seoul on thursday the annual g20 summit starts in seoul on thursday , and artificial currency manipulation is likely to be a central issue .
in addition to keeping the " global currency war " from escalating , a common goal must be reaffirmed . the sheer scale of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit can be staggering .
representing 90 percent of the world 's economic power , and four-fifths of global trade , the summit is crisis-oriented .
it was called into life in 1999 as a reaction to financial crises in asia , brazil and russia , and was initially a meeting of financial ministers .
when lehman brothers investment bank collapsed in the fall of 2008 , it unleashed a global financial crisis , and the g20 became a vehicle to combat recession .
that 's when heads of state became involved .
it has been nearly two years since a package of financial measures was decided on in washington .
their aim is to ensure such an unprecedented global crisis never happens again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique strauss-kahn says global cooperation is needed for dominique strauss-kahn , a french politician and managing director of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the most important realization of the crisis is that egoism on the national level needs to yield to global cooperation .
" in my view one of the main features of this crisis has been the emergence of a willingness to work together , of a new kind of economic cooperation at the global level which never existed , never happened in the past , " strauss-kahn said in october at the annual meeting of the imf in washington .
according to strauss-kahn , that spirit of cooperation was present at past g20 summits in london , pittsburgh and toronto .
but the meeting starting thursday in seoul may show a decrease in countries ' willingness to cooperate at a global level .
" that is a real threat … there is no domestic solution to a global crisis , " he said .
summit as a litmus test the g20 summit participants surely know global cooperation is the way forward .
in the end , however , each country has to master its own national politics in order to institute financial reform .
that 's why german chancellor angela merkel says she is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far " in terms of the financial sector 's participation in carrying the costs of the crisis , the german government could have pictured more , " she told german parliamentarians in october as she outlined her goals for the seoul gathering .
while germany imposed a nationwide " financial crisis responsibility fee " on its banks , the g20 failed to agree on an international tax on financial markets .
nevertheless , europe will be bringing something to the table in seoul : its oversight of financial systems will be significantly improved .
risky financial products may be forbidden under certain circumstances and control over hedge funds and ratings agencies is being tightened .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has expressed concerns about the seoul g20 summit .
he says it comes at a critical point in time , as all parties will have to accept that global economic imbalances affect them all .
" it will be a real test of whether the g20 can deliver the coordination the world economy needs , " he wrote in an open letter .
no hint of unity despite numerous promises to disallow protectionism , the g20 nations are far from unified in their efforts to do so .
each is primarily acting with the strength its own domestic economy in mind , and the resulting imbalance is fertile ground for another crisis .
the trade balances of the individual countries – the ratio of their exports versus imports – is filled with dormant potential for conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imposed a fee on its banks , but an international tax was not agreed on in outlining her goals for the seoul g20 summit , merkel asked what countries can " do together for sustainable , strong and balanced growth . "
she wants to see this entirely accomplished by unadulterated market forces as such balances are an expression of economic competitiveness .
no answers on currency currency exchange rates are an inevitable source of controversy in the current scenario of global trade , and some analysts have already dubbed the situation a " global currency war . "
the problem is that some countries are trying to gain a competitive edge by devaluing their own currencies to make exports more attractive .
china and the united states are the primary practitioners of this tactic , with south korea , japan and brazil jointing in too .
a precarious race has begun .
the seoul g20 summit wo n't solve this problem , but merkel says that exchange rates should accurately reflect the fundamental data of a country 's domestic prosperity for the time being .
" a political scenario which targets currency distortion to strengthen economic competitiveness must be avoided , " merkel said .
france , which is due to take over south korea 's presidency of the g20 , wants to make currency policies a central issue .
still , one central issue may be the most important of all during the talks – whether the 20 nations can demonstrate they are all moving in the same direction , even if they were forced into negotiations by a crisis .

major powers are likely to disagree on currency policy and plans to end exceptional economic stimulus measures . chancellor angela merkel called on world powers to coordinate plans for weaning their national economies off economic stimulus measures , and warned against creating new asset bubbles .
" there will of course be a discussion about exit strategies , " merkel told reporters before flying to seoul for the meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- top rich and emerging nations .
" it is naturally desirable that the leading economic powers do not come up with answers which are too varied to the question as to when the exit strategy should begin , " she said .
" this could be a thoroughly lively debate . "

" nobody has an interest in creating new bubbles .
rather , we must see to it that growth in the global economy this year is more sustainable and enduring than we had a few years ago , " she said .
critics argue that the fed 's quantitative easing amounts to an effective dollar devaluation , and has the potential to trigger a 1930s-style trade war if other countries respond in kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is accused of weakening its currency to promote economic growth with this in mind , merkel also pressed her fellow leaders to avoid any form of protectionism , amid criticism that certain countries , notably china and japan , are keeping their currencies artificially low to encourage exports .
but she declined to criticize beijing for its foreign exchange policy , saying : " i assume that china has a very strong interest in sending a positive signal from this summit . "
" china also needs sustainable growth for its overall economic situation , " the chancellor added .
germany is the world 's second-biggest exporter after china .
its strong export sector has helped it stage an impressive economic comeback this year , but its trade surpluses have also drawn criticism abroad .
no fixed numbers merkel said germany would not accept fixed targets for addressing countries ' trade gaps .
" we reject quantified bandwidths for acceptable imbalances for good reason because ... competitiveness must be able to express itself , also in export ratios . "
merkel said germany wants to see leaders commit themselves to the final stretch of the doha round of global trade talks .
she added that trade barriers posed the biggest danger to sustained world growth .
" the biggest danger for sustainable growth is currently coming from protectionism in its different forms , " she said .

major powers are likely to disagree on currency policy and plans to end exceptional economic stimulus measures . chancellor angela merkel called on world powers to coordinate plans for weaning their national economies off economic stimulus measures , and warned against creating new asset bubbles .
" there will of course be a discussion about exit strategies , " merkel told reporters before flying to seoul for the meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- top rich and emerging nations .
" it is naturally desirable that the leading economic powers do not come up with answers which are too varied to the question as to when the exit strategy should begin , " she said .

" nobody has an interest in creating new bubbles .
rather , we must see to it that growth in the global economy this year is more sustainable and enduring than we had a few years ago , " she said .

" china also needs sustainable growth for its overall economic situation , " the chancellor added .
germany is the world 's second-biggest exporter after china .
its strong export sector has helped it stage an impressive economic comeback this year , but its trade surpluses have also drawn criticism abroad .
no fixed numbers merkel said germany would not accept fixed targets for addressing countries ' trade gaps .
" we reject quantified bandwidths for acceptable imbalances for good reason because ... competitiveness must be able to express itself , also in export ratios . "
merkel said germany wants to see leaders commit themselves to the final stretch of the doha round of global trade talks .
she added that trade barriers posed the biggest danger to sustained world growth .
" the biggest danger for sustainable growth is currently coming from protectionism in its different forms , " she said .

in addition to keeping the " global currency war " from escalating , a common goal must be reaffirmed . the sheer scale of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit can be staggering .
representing 90 percent of the world 's economic power , and four-fifths of global trade , the summit is crisis-oriented .
it was called into life in 1999 as a reaction to financial crises in asia , brazil and russia , and was initially a meeting of financial ministers .
when lehman brothers investment bank collapsed in the fall of 2008 , it unleashed a global financial crisis , and the g20 became a vehicle to combat recession .
that 's when heads of state became involved .
it has been nearly two years since a package of financial measures was decided on in washington .
their aim is to ensure such an unprecedented global crisis never happens again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique strauss-kahn says global cooperation is needed for dominique strauss-kahn , a french politician and managing director of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the most important realization of the crisis is that egoism on the national level needs to yield to global cooperation .
" in my view one of the main features of this crisis has been the emergence of a willingness to work together , of a new kind of economic cooperation at the global level which never existed , never happened in the past , " strauss-kahn said in october at the annual meeting of the imf in washington .
according to strauss-kahn , that spirit of cooperation was present at past g20 summits in london , pittsburgh and toronto .
but the meeting starting thursday in seoul may show a decrease in countries ' willingness to cooperate at a global level .
" that is a real threat … there is no domestic solution to a global crisis , " he said .
summit as a litmus test the g20 summit participants surely know global cooperation is the way forward .
in the end , however , each country has to master its own national politics in order to institute financial reform .
that 's why german chancellor angela merkel says she is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far " in terms of the financial sector 's participation in carrying the costs of the crisis , the german government could have pictured more , " she told german parliamentarians in october as she outlined her goals for the seoul gathering .
while germany imposed a nationwide " financial crisis responsibility fee " on its banks , the g20 failed to agree on an international tax on financial markets .
nevertheless , europe will be bringing something to the table in seoul : its oversight of financial systems will be significantly improved .
risky financial products may be forbidden under certain circumstances and control over hedge funds and ratings agencies is being tightened .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has expressed concerns about the seoul g20 summit .
he says it comes at a critical point in time , as all parties will have to accept that global economic imbalances affect them all .
" it will be a real test of whether the g20 can deliver the coordination the world economy needs , " he wrote in an open letter .
no hint of unity despite numerous promises to disallow protectionism , the g20 nations are far from unified in their efforts to do so .
each is primarily acting with the strength its own domestic economy in mind , and the resulting imbalance is fertile ground for another crisis .
the trade balances of the individual countries – the ratio of their exports versus imports – is filled with dormant potential for conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imposed a fee on its banks , but an international tax was not agreed on in outlining her goals for the seoul g20 summit , merkel asked what countries can " do together for sustainable , strong and balanced growth . "
she wants to see this entirely accomplished by unadulterated market forces as such balances are an expression of economic competitiveness .
no answers on currency currency exchange rates are an inevitable source of controversy in the current scenario of global trade , and some analysts have already dubbed the situation a " global currency war . "
the problem is that some countries are trying to gain a competitive edge by devaluing their own currencies to make exports more attractive .
china and the united states are the primary practitioners of this tactic , with south korea , japan and brazil jointing in too .
a precarious race has begun .
the seoul g20 summit wo n't solve this problem , but merkel says that exchange rates should accurately reflect the fundamental data of a country 's domestic prosperity for the time being .
" a political scenario which targets currency distortion to strengthen economic competitiveness must be avoided , " merkel said .
france , which is due to take over south korea 's presidency of the g20 , wants to make currency policies a central issue .
still , one central issue may be the most important of all during the talks – whether the 20 nations can demonstrate they are all moving in the same direction , even if they were forced into negotiations by a crisis .

according to strauss-kahn , that spirit of cooperation was present at past g20 summits in london , pittsburgh and toronto .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.11.2010 as bush plugs his memoir , european anger still simmers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-president bush has reignited dormant anger in europe as george w. bush returns to the public eye to promote his recently published memoirs , he is polarizing opinion .
his book is unlikely to help heal the rift that emerged between the us and europe while he was in office . the 43rd us president 's apparent mission to have his two terms in the white house reassessed and his reputation rehabilitated through his new book , " decision points , " has many europeans shaking their heads . and it 's not just the most inflammatory excerpts - such as bush 's assertion that water-boarding of terror suspects saved lives - that are causing an outcry . bush 's supporters in the us say that every president has the right to defend his record ; " decision points " shows the former president as a man who was ideologically consistent during his eight years in office . his detractors counter that the president 's mistakes and his determination to follow ill-thought-out policies - without a thought for a possible , rectifying change of direction - plunged the us into a decade of war and the worst financial crisis in over 80 years .
while george w. bush may have been a good guy with a difficult job , they say , he does n't deserve to be rehabilitated via his memoirs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush left office with two wars and an economic crisis raging if bush 's single-minded and heavy-handed approach to afghanistan and iraq in the wake of the terror attacks of 9/11 were damaging to his relations with his european allies at the time , his newly released memoirs appear to be giving european readers the chance get angry all over again . europeans , even allies , dismissed as irrelevant " in my opinion , there ’ s been no change in perception of bush in europe , " dr. henning meyer , a transatlantic relations expert at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle . " his legacy projects , such as iraq and afghanistan , are still the main issues associated with his presidency and of course europeans are still affected by these and in most cases are still in opposition to a certain degree .
if you remember , bush ’ s war on terror effectively split europe .
so these things have not been forgotten . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush says the uk 's perception of him does n't matter in " decision points , " bush is dismissive about those europeans who had taken a risk to follow him into war in iraq , and he talks frankly about his reputation in the one country whose leaders followed him most obediently of all : england .
" it does n't matter how people perceive me in england , " he writes .
" it just does n't matter any more .
and frankly , at times , it did n't matter then . " in a veiled dig at what he saw at the time as the rest of europe 's lack of stomach for the fight , bush writes : " people in europe said : ' ah , man , he 's a religious fanatic , cowboy , simpleton . '
all that stuff ...
if you believe that freedom is universal , then you should n't be surprised when people take courageous measures to live in a free society . " he reserves his most scathing treatment for those european leaders who disappointed him most , especially during the iraq war : former german chancellor gerhard schroeder comes in for even worse treatment than former french president jacques chirac , schroeder 's ally in the european anti-war opposition . german emotions still raw over bush 's rush to war in the book , bush accuses schroeder of abusing his trust after allegedly telling the president in 2002 , before the invasion of iraq the following year , that " what goes for afghanistan also goes for iraq .
nations which support terrorism must accept the consequences .
if you go forward fast and resolutely , i am on your side . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush did n't trust schroeder after the latter withdrew his support however , struggling in his re-election campaign in the fall of that year , schroeder hitched his wagon to the huge swell of anti-war feeling in germany and across europe .
he claims bush is lying when he says that he had offered his support for an invasion , and that he 'd made it clear all along that his support was conditional on whether iraq really had weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- . " schroeder 's support -lrb- for the invasion of iraq -rrb- was conditional on evidence being found of terrorists being harbored in iraq , so when there was no evidence delivered , he withdrew his support , " lse professor meyer told deutsche welle .
" bush is attempting to polish his own picture of this situation with the germans by saying that the breakdown in relations was not his fault and that it was schroeder who turned opinion against him . " the bush legacy is still powerfully felt in the united states : the armed forces are embroiled in the two wars he started ; the financial system is struggling to pull out of an overwhelming crisis , and politicians are scrambling to rebuild their credibility on the world stage . but the ripples from his eight-year presidency continue to be felt in europe as well .
under his leadership , decades of trust and cooperation between the us and european governments was damaged . according to thomas klau , a transatlantic relations expert at the european council for foreign relations , the memoir provides new fodder for europeans who are skeptical about the us political system . " europeans , and germans in particular , are still amazed that the us political system has the potential to elect such an incompetent leader who has no respect for western values , " klau said .
" while obama gave some hope , the germans are now saddened to see that a discredited party such as the republicans can be re-elected as the majority in the house of representatives . " germans see the republican mid-term victory as proof that " the us system and electorate has a very short memory and very little wisdom . " european anger reignited over torture statements so far , european reaction to the bush memoirs has been heavily affected by comments in the book that seem to advocate torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims water boarding extracted vital information for meyer , the water-boarding comments are " a very clear example of the philosophical differences between the bush administration and the europeans . " " there is a huge difference in what bush thought was acceptable in terms of the war on terror and what the europeans thought , " he added .
" bush saw approaches such as water-boarding as not a breaking of any laws but a legitimate bending of them . " moreover , bush " made bold statements " that the information gained from water-boarding stopped an attack on london - a claim the uk refutes . " most people in europe say that there were other ways of getting the information and that bush ’ s assertions are just not true , " meyer said . severe - and lasting - damage ? the response to his memoirs suggests that the damage bush did to his country 's reputation in europe remains severe . " bush 's was the worst us presidency that europe and the world has ever seen and his legacy , in political and economic terms , will be seen as one of disaster , " said klau .
" few people will expect to see any change in this perception arising from his memoirs .
in fact , it 's highly likely that his already terrible reputation in europe will take an even worse turn . " bush may have come out with his book to try and put the record straight in his own words .
but in doing so , at least in europe , it appears that he has taken a big stick to a hornet 's nest of his own making . author : nick amies editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the biggest such mission , german marines will continue their involvement in the european union 's anti-piracy operation .
the so-called " atalanta mission " targets somali pirates threatening ships in the gulf of aden and the indian ocean , one of the most important trade routes between asia and europe .

bosnian peacekeepers meanwhile there are currently 115 german peacekeeping soldiers stationed in bosnia .
the cabinet agreed to maintain the maximum number of german troops taking part in the eu mission in the country at 900 .

the decision reached by chancellor angela merkel and her cabinet on wednesday still requires parliamentary approval .

now the german company says it 's in a position to outgrow its us rival and dominate the market by 2015 .
consumers in the united states are central to its plans . after weathering a difficult year in 2009 and pinning its hopes on the 2010 world cup in south africa , german sporting goods company adidas has surged ahead in profits and now says it wants to outperform leading rival nike .
adidas wants to grow faster than nike through 2015 and increase its turnover by 45-50 percent to 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.4 billion -rrb- .
" we 're hoping this faster rate of growth will let us lay a foundation to be the market leader at a later point in time , " an adidas spokeswoman told deutsche welle .
nike , however , is moving forward with goals of its own .
it hopes to generate 19.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- in revenue by 2015 .
in the first nine months of 2010 , adidas primarily grew in the united states , china and russia , according to the company 's spokeswoman .
most of the growth was generated in the sports style , fashion and lifestyle sectors , as well as the reebok brand , which it bought in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa world cup gave adidas a major sales boost adidas maintains a consistent marketing budget of 13 to 14 percent of its overall turnover.the bavarian-based company now plans to market new clothing designs for teenagers every two weeks .
it also plans to aggressively pursue the young customers on the internet using social networking .
us market vital according to matt powell , an analyst at sportsonesource - a research and data firm based in charlotte , north carolina - the key market for both adidas and nike is the united states .
" the us does about half of the athletic footwear and apparel business in the world , " he told deutsche welle .
" so you 've got the us versus the rest of the world , if you will .
now you 've got some markets – especially china – which are growing very quickly .
but that pales in comparison to the us . "
powell also said that both adidas and reebok had been losing market share in footwear " until very recently . "
" i really think that part of why adidas has struggled in the us is because they really do n't have a clear understanding of what the us consumer wants , " he said . " -lrb- but -rrb- i think they 're doing a much better job today than they were five years ago . "
what the us consumer really wants is fashion , powell said , adding that most athletic footwear " is n't used for sports . "
growth in north america and china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is also a rapidly growing market for adidas and nike some of the highlights of adidas ' quarterly exchange-rate-adjusted figures include a 10 percent increase in turnover for the adidas brand , and a 14 percent increase for the reebok brand .
the company 's overall third-quarter turnover increased in all regions , specifically 14 percent in north america and 9 percent in china .
powell said he believes there is a chance adidas could grow faster than nike in the next five years .
" historically the numbers would say it 's doable , but it 's a pretty steep hill to climb . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 10.11.2010 roma rights advocates accuse czech government of de facto segregation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many romani children end up in schools for mentally disabled the leading roma rights advocacy group , the european roma rights center , has accused the czech government of failing to stop romani children being sent to special schools for the mentally disabled . the budapest-based european roma rights center -lrb- errc -rrb- has accused the czech government of failing to address the problem of disproportionately huge numbers of roma children ending up in what are defined as special schools for children with mild mental retardation .
schools in the czech republic - and in many other european countries – still maintain a system of de facto segregation for members of the roma minority , according to the errc .
" we did n't necessarily have the smoking gun of the teacher or a school administrator saying we 're putting you in these schools because you 're roma , but the numbers speak for themselves , " errc executive director robert kushen told reporters .
the european court of human rights ruled in november 2007 that 18 czech roma children had been discriminated against by being sent wrongly to special schools .
no changes so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de facto segregation also exists in greece , croatia and slovakia " the number of romani children in special education in the czech republic at that time and today was out of all proportion to the number of romani children in the population , " kushen added .
the czech government itself undertook studies after the court decision which confirm that something like 27 percent of romani children are in special education compared to 2.2 percent of non-romani children being in special education .
the only real change since the 2007 court ruling , says the center , is that such schools have been renamed ' practical ' schools by the authorities .
behind their doors , however , the overwhelmingly roma pupils still follow an academically inferior curriculum , condemning them to a life of limited further education , bleak employment prospects and deeper social exclusion .
similar situation across south-east europe but the czech republic is not alone – the center has since won a similar court case against croatia , and contributed towards another case in greece that was brought by the greek helsinki monitor .
both verdicts found that de facto segregation exists in those countries too .
in neighboring slovakia , for instance , a recent study showed 60 percent of special school pupils were roma .
stanislav daniel , a university-educated academic researcher working for the errc , said he himself had narrowly escaped being shunted off to a special school as a child in communist czechoslovakia .
" interestingly , i was also placed into a class at a mainstream school .
in the first year , i was placed in a class with all the romani children , and this class was for the children where there was a risk they would be placed into special school .
and this took place at the time when i was able to read and write .
my father , for some reason that i will never understand , taught me to read and write before i went to school . "
the european roma rights center says far from addressing the problem head on since the verdict , the new czech government actually seems to be backsliding on the little progress already made .
tuesday 's briefing was held ahead of a meeting of the commission of ministers later in november , who meet regularly to discuss whether european court of human rights recommendations are being implemented .
in this case , says the errc , it 's clear they 're not .

the federal office for information security has removed links to the program from its website . jan schejbal , a german computer security researcher living in sweden , on tuesday described a way to hack the new electronic german id card software .
the federal office responsible for the program stopped allowing the software to be downloaded on wednesday . the new cards , which became available november 1 and will gradually replace current german cards , contain an rfid wireless chip - the same kind found in many contactless security or payment keycards .
the chip stores digital versions of the card holder 's photo , name , address , date of birth , height , eye and hair color and location of issuance . the interior ministry and the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- have claimed the cards will help the government provide easy-to-use digital signatures and other government services , as well as protection against online scams and phishing attacks .
germans can also use the ids in place of a passport when traveling within the european union . spoofing the server but to be useful to individuals , the digital information on the cards needs to be accessed with a card reader .
it 's the ausweisapp -lrb- " id app " -rrb- software that runs the card reader which is flawed , according to schejbal . after downloading the first version of ausweisapp from a german government website , he noticed a major flaw when the program checks for updates .
the software does not verify the origin of a digital security -lrb- ssl -rrb- certificate , which leaves the program open to a spoof attack that conceivably could lead to the download of malicious software . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia has had digital id cards for eight years " the electronic id itself may have quite a high security level , " said schejbal in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" however , this security becomes worthless if the framework which is used to access this secure core is insecure and allows compromising overall security . " had the new electronic id card already been widely used , the security flaw in updating would have been significant , according to karsten nohl , an independent security expert based in berlin . " fortunately , that is not the case and the bug can be fixed swiftly , " he told deutsche welle .
" this vulnerability is another reminder of the complexity of the id card security system , not all of which has been tested rigorously . " in a statement to the german tech news website heise.de , the bsi said it was looking into the update issue .
it also removed the software from its website to prevent more people from downloading the flawed program . " the media has been made aware of a perceived vulnerability in the software ausweisapp necessary for the eid feature of the new id card , " it wrote .
bsi did not reply to deutsche welle 's request for comment .
" if a vulnerability exists in the software , the bsi will provide a new version of the software without delay and will inform the public accordingly . " digital id cards expanding across europe digital ids have been spreading across the continent in recent years .
estonia has had one for nearly a decade , with a slew of electronic government services , and legally binding digital signatures to go along with it .
belgium , sweden , spain , portugal all currently have electronic id cards , and there are plans in place to release such cards in luxembourg and the czech republic . while schejbal added that he is not opposed to the concept of an electronic id , he advised germans to avoid the cards for as long as possible . " it is not secure , and it will put the user at risk , " he wrote .
" if the electronic identity is abused , the user will have a hard time proving that he did not authorize a transaction . " previous flaws have been discovered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital id cards have a corresponding reader when used with a computer schejbal 's discovery is n't the first time security flaws were found in the new electronic id cards .
in september , the german hacker collective the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- demonstrated how the card reader 's security measures could be circumvented . after obtaining an id card 's pin number by using a program that records individual keystrokes , the hackers were able to rewrite all the information on the id .
card readers come in a variety of models , and the ccc circumvented the most basic model . security researchers have doubts manuel bach , the electronic id project manager at the bsi , responded by saying that germans must take responsibility for their own computer security and ensure their computers remain free of the malicious software needed to steal pins and other personal data . " the germany id card ca n't protect you from trojan horses , it 's just a piece of plastic with a microchip inside , " he told deutsche welle in an interview last month .
" you as a citizen or computer user have a responsibility to secure your system .
if you do that you 're very safe , even with a basic card reader . " but constanze kurz , a ccc spokeswoman , said the government should n't expect all germans to be tech whizzes . " if you pretend that all your citizens are really good with computers , and that they can manage their own it security on their systems , then you are definitely wrong , " she said in an interview with deutsche welle .

belgium , sweden , spain , portugal all currently have electronic id cards , and there are plans in place to release such cards in luxembourg and the czech republic . while schejbal added that he is not opposed to the concept of an electronic id , he advised germans to avoid the cards for as long as possible .

" previous flaws have been discovered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital id cards have a corresponding reader when used with a computer schejbal 's discovery is n't the first time security flaws were found in the new electronic id cards .
in september , the german hacker collective the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- demonstrated how the card reader 's security measures could be circumvented . after obtaining an id card 's pin number by using a program that records individual keystrokes , the hackers were able to rewrite all the information on the id .
card readers come in a variety of models , and the ccc circumvented the most basic model . security researchers have doubts manuel bach , the electronic id project manager at the bsi , responded by saying that germans must take responsibility for their own computer security and ensure their computers remain free of the malicious software needed to steal pins and other personal data . " the germany id card ca n't protect you from trojan horses , it 's just a piece of plastic with a microchip inside , " he told deutsche welle in an interview last month .
" you as a citizen or computer user have a responsibility to secure your system .
if you do that you 're very safe , even with a basic card reader . " but constanze kurz , a ccc spokeswoman , said the government should n't expect all germans to be tech whizzes . " if you pretend that all your citizens are really good with computers , and that they can manage their own it security on their systems , then you are definitely wrong , " she said in an interview with deutsche welle .

consumers in the united states are central to its plans . after weathering a difficult year in 2009 and pinning its hopes on the 2010 world cup in south africa , german sporting goods company adidas has surged ahead in profits and now says it wants to outperform leading rival nike .
adidas wants to grow faster than nike through 2015 and increase its turnover by 45-50 percent to 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.4 billion -rrb- .
" we 're hoping this faster rate of growth will let us lay a foundation to be the market leader at a later point in time , " an adidas spokeswoman told deutsche welle .

lidl has come under particular fire over pay and practices . supermarkets across germany are popular places to buy clothes .
prices are cheap : you can buy a men 's shirt for seven euros -lrb- nine us dollars -rrb- or a pair of women 's trousers for under 10 euros .
however two women from bangladesh are currently on a speaking tour of germany to highlight how these cheap prices come at a human cost .
26-year-old jessmin begum and 36-year-old arifa akter both work as seamstresses in clothes factories in dhaka that make clothes for european stores .
they say the working conditions are terrible and the pay is inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers complain about cramped conditions , dirty water and tough bosses " i 'm proud of my work , especially when i see people here wearing my clothes , " said begum , who works for a factory that supplies clothes to german-based supermarket chain lidl .
" but it makes me mad that what we get for our work in bangladesh is nothing . "
not a living wage as a seamstress , jessmin begum earns around 35 euros a month -lrb- just under 4,000 bangladesh taka -rrb- .
the monthly rent for a one room apartment in dhaka is around 25 euros a month .
" it is not even close to the living wage we have calculated , " said khorshed alam from the campaigning group alternative movement for resources and freedom society -lrb- amrf -rrb- .
with calculations based on someone working a 12- to 14-hour day , the amrf estimates around 5,000 taka a month -lrb- 52 euros -rrb- is necessary for a single worker .
a family needs to earn around 9-10,000 taka .
dirty water , mean bosses , unpaid overtime the two seamstresses are using their tour of germany to highlight how bad working conditions are in the factories .
" the drinking water is dirty and we are packed in with little space between the machines , " said begum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessmin begum has been working as a seamstress in dhaka for eight years " our supervisors insult us and put us under pressure to work harder .
almost every day i do overtime and i hardly ever come home much earlier than midnight , " she added .
the workers have no sick pay or other benefits , so most seamstresses continue to work even when ill .
highlighting the problem jessmin and arifa 's tour of germany was organized by the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- , which campaigns worldwide to promote better working conditions and fair wages .
the ccc wants international corporations to stick to their pledges to provide better labor conditions .
" for years companies have been saying they are willing to meet certain standards , but it 's only on paper , not in actions , " said the ccc 's gisela burckhardt .
" we want a proper legal framework so that companies can see the impact of their activities on the environment and people in other countries , " burckhardt argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this dhaka garment factory was visited by the ccc in 2009 khorshed alam from the amrf added that it is also the responsibility of the bangladeshi government to monitor the brands which manufacture clothes in the country , and to ensure they implement local labor laws .
making consumers aware in addition to putting pressure on manufacturers and local governments , the tour aims to give consumers more awareness of the origin of their cheap shirts and trousers .
" i came here because the people who buy our products have no idea where they came from , or how much we suffer , " said begum .
the amrf want consumers to question companies like lidl who sell cheap clothes , while claiming they pay their workers well .
in response to the claims , a spokesperson for lidl said they completely oppose any form of child labor and violations of workers ' rights .
they also added that lidl was the first german discount store to join the business social compliance initiative which works to improve working conditions in supply networks worldwide .

lidl has come under particular fire over pay and practices . supermarkets across germany are popular places to buy clothes .
prices are cheap : you can buy a men 's shirt for seven euros -lrb- nine us dollars -rrb- or a pair of women 's trousers for under 10 euros .
however two women from bangladesh are currently on a speaking tour of germany to highlight how these cheap prices come at a human cost .
26-year-old jessmin begum and 36-year-old arifa akter both work as seamstresses in clothes factories in dhaka that make clothes for european stores .
they say the working conditions are terrible and the pay is inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers complain about cramped conditions , dirty water and tough bosses " i 'm proud of my work , especially when i see people here wearing my clothes , " said begum , who works for a factory that supplies clothes to german-based supermarket chain lidl .
" but it makes me mad that what we get for our work in bangladesh is nothing . "
not a living wage as a seamstress , jessmin begum earns around 35 euros a month -lrb- just under 4,000 bangladesh taka -rrb- .
the monthly rent for a one room apartment in dhaka is around 25 euros a month .
" it is not even close to the living wage we have calculated , " said khorshed alam from the campaigning group alternative movement for resources and freedom society -lrb- amrf -rrb- .
with calculations based on someone working a 12- to 14-hour day , the amrf estimates around 5,000 taka a month -lrb- 52 euros -rrb- is necessary for a single worker .
a family needs to earn around 9-10,000 taka .

almost every day i do overtime and i hardly ever come home much earlier than midnight , " she added .

highlighting the problem jessmin and arifa 's tour of germany was organized by the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- , which campaigns worldwide to promote better working conditions and fair wages .
the ccc wants international corporations to stick to their pledges to provide better labor conditions .
" for years companies have been saying they are willing to meet certain standards , but it 's only on paper , not in actions , " said the ccc 's gisela burckhardt .
" we want a proper legal framework so that companies can see the impact of their activities on the environment and people in other countries , " burckhardt argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this dhaka garment factory was visited by the ccc in 2009 khorshed alam from the amrf added that it is also the responsibility of the bangladeshi government to monitor the brands which manufacture clothes in the country , and to ensure they implement local labor laws .
making consumers aware in addition to putting pressure on manufacturers and local governments , the tour aims to give consumers more awareness of the origin of their cheap shirts and trousers .
" i came here because the people who buy our products have no idea where they came from , or how much we suffer , " said begum .
the amrf want consumers to question companies like lidl who sell cheap clothes , while claiming they pay their workers well .
in response to the claims , a spokesperson for lidl said they completely oppose any form of child labor and violations of workers ' rights .
they also added that lidl was the first german discount store to join the business social compliance initiative which works to improve working conditions in supply networks worldwide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.11.2010 currency likely to take center stage at seoul g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 summit starts in seoul on thursday the annual g20 summit starts in seoul on thursday , and artificial currency manipulation is likely to be a central issue .
in addition to keeping the " global currency war " from escalating , a common goal must be reaffirmed . the sheer scale of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit can be staggering .
representing 90 percent of the world 's economic power , and four-fifths of global trade , the summit is crisis-oriented .
it was called into life in 1999 as a reaction to financial crises in asia , brazil and russia , and was initially a meeting of financial ministers .
when lehman brothers investment bank collapsed in the fall of 2008 , it unleashed a global financial crisis , and the g20 became a vehicle to combat recession .
that 's when heads of state became involved .
it has been nearly two years since a package of financial measures was decided on in washington .
their aim is to ensure such an unprecedented global crisis never happens again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique strauss-kahn says global cooperation is needed for dominique strauss-kahn , a french politician and managing director of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the most important realization of the crisis is that egoism on the national level needs to yield to global cooperation .
" in my view one of the main features of this crisis has been the emergence of a willingness to work together , of a new kind of economic cooperation at the global level which never existed , never happened in the past , " strauss-kahn said in october at the annual meeting of the imf in washington .
according to strauss-kahn , that spirit of cooperation was present at past g20 summits in london , pittsburgh and toronto .
but the meeting starting thursday in seoul may show a decrease in countries ' willingness to cooperate at a global level .
" that is a real threat … there is no domestic solution to a global crisis , " he said .
summit as a litmus test the g20 summit participants surely know global cooperation is the way forward .
in the end , however , each country has to master its own national politics in order to institute financial reform .
that 's why german chancellor angela merkel says she is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far " in terms of the financial sector 's participation in carrying the costs of the crisis , the german government could have pictured more , " she told german parliamentarians in october as she outlined her goals for the seoul gathering .
while germany imposed a nationwide " financial crisis responsibility fee " on its banks , the g20 failed to agree on an international tax on financial markets .
nevertheless , europe will be bringing something to the table in seoul : its oversight of financial systems will be significantly improved .
risky financial products may be forbidden under certain circumstances and control over hedge funds and ratings agencies is being tightened .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has expressed concerns about the seoul g20 summit .
he says it comes at a critical point in time , as all parties will have to accept that global economic imbalances affect them all .
" it will be a real test of whether the g20 can deliver the coordination the world economy needs , " he wrote in an open letter .
no hint of unity despite numerous promises to disallow protectionism , the g20 nations are far from unified in their efforts to do so .
each is primarily acting with the strength its own domestic economy in mind , and the resulting imbalance is fertile ground for another crisis .
the trade balances of the individual countries – the ratio of their exports versus imports – is filled with dormant potential for conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imposed a fee on its banks , but an international tax was not agreed on in outlining her goals for the seoul g20 summit , merkel asked what countries can " do together for sustainable , strong and balanced growth . "
she wants to see this entirely accomplished by unadulterated market forces as such balances are an expression of economic competitiveness .
no answers on currency currency exchange rates are an inevitable source of controversy in the current scenario of global trade , and some analysts have already dubbed the situation a " global currency war . "
the problem is that some countries are trying to gain a competitive edge by devaluing their own currencies to make exports more attractive .
china and the united states are the primary practitioners of this tactic , with south korea , japan and brazil jointing in too .
a precarious race has begun .
the seoul g20 summit wo n't solve this problem , but merkel says that exchange rates should accurately reflect the fundamental data of a country 's domestic prosperity for the time being .
" a political scenario which targets currency distortion to strengthen economic competitiveness must be avoided , " merkel said .
france , which is due to take over south korea 's presidency of the g20 , wants to make currency policies a central issue .
still , one central issue may be the most important of all during the talks – whether the 20 nations can demonstrate they are all moving in the same direction , even if they were forced into negotiations by a crisis .

in a press release , the icfr said there was widespread fear in the sector that the g20 could " fail to make progress on its goals , as domestic considerations move back center-stage . "
it urged leaders to agree on financial reforms most likely improve economic stability and achieve international implementation . " we are calling on the g20 to prioritize more effective cross-border coordination by supervisors , and for agreement on the way forward on crisis resolution to allow for the orderly wind-down of complex banks , " barbara ridpath , ceo of the watchdog said in a statement .
" time for unity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki moon has urged leaders to find common ground the icfr calls were echoed by united nations secretary general ban ki-moon , who is in the south korean capital for the international summit .
on the eve of the meeting , he expressed concern over national differences of opinion on global rebalancing and currency policies .
" the global economic recovery remains fragile .
64 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty this year , " ban said , adding that this was a time for unity .
he said the world could not afford to think narrowly about development and economic growth , and that " all countries and all peoples have a stake in the management of the global economy . "
on the agenda leaders at the seoul g20 summit , the first to be held in an emerging market economy , are expected to sign off on the basel iii agreement , which is designed to tighten global capital and liquidity requirements for banks from 2013 onwards . bildunterschrift : the summit is being watched closely by managers in frankfurt 's banking towers drafted by the basel committee of central bankers and regulators back in september , the package is considered a significant step down the path towards financial stability .
it also tipped by observers to be one of the few items on the regulation agenda that is likely to receive broad support in seoul .
the only other real progress the talks are expected to yield is the endorsement of a series of agreements aimed at tightening supervision of the derivatives market and ensuring the standardization of contracts to facilitate central clearing processes and trading on exchanges .
safety nets on the issue of " too big to fail " banks , analysts are expecting little movement .
the financial stability board -lrb- fsb -rrb- , which is responsible for the implementation of g20 regulatory pledges , is expected to lay out a set of recommendations on " systemically important financial institutions , " otherwise known as sifis , involving the largest 20 or so global banks .
under the terms of the proposals , regulators would be required to make sure that sifis , the list of which is yet to be finalized , prepare living wills outlining how , if necessary , they could be wound up without causing major upset on the markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsbc is likely to feature on the list of global banks deemed too big to fail g20 members have not , as yet , been able to agree on many of the details of sifis , but there is speculation that the list will not include big asian banks .
their business is conducted primarily in domestic markets .
they therefore pose little threat to the wider world if they go under .
ratings , commodities and accounting summit delegates are , however , tipped to rubber-stamp fsb proposals for reducing market reliance on rating agencies .
if they do green-light the suggestion , they will have to find alternative ways of assessing creditworthiness .
regulators say the move would reduce what is known as the cliff effect , which contributes to market destabilization .
in the name of yet greater stability , the group of 20 wealthy and emerging nations is also calling for more transparency in commodity markets .
this week , regulators ruled a major overhaul , but they did concede more pricing information was needed from physical commodity markets .
there is little hope of movement on the establishment of a single set of global accounting standards .
the june 2011 deadline is likely to be overshot due to differences between the g20 member states , but analysts say the summit could be an opportunity to push for resolution .

the case involves airlines that fly around the globe , from air france-klm , to british airways and quantas . the european union 's competition watchdog issued fines tuesday to 11 airlines totaling 799.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- for running a global cargo cartel .
the cargo carriers were found to have coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security over a six-year period , between 1999 and 2006 .
" with today 's decision , the european commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate cartel behavior , " eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner almunia said the case was " deplorable " the fine imposed is one of the biggest in eu history .
the bloc 's rules forbid most forms of price fixing among competitors .
" it is deplorable that so many major airlines coordinated their pricing to the detriment of european businesses and european consumers , " almunia added .
no fine for the whistleblower air france-klm was hit with the largest fine of 310 million euros .
british airways came in second , having to pay a 104-million-euro penalty .
luxembourg 's cargolux will have to pay 79.9 million euros , while scandinavian carrier sas was ordered to pay 70.2 million euros .
other airlines involved in the cartel and slapped with fines were singapore airlines , air canada , quantas , lan chile , martinair and japan airlines .
the commission said it dropped charges against eleven other airlines , including german carrier lufthansa and its subsidiary swiss air , because it was the first to provide information about the cartel .
according to the commission the cartel the airlines began fixing fuel-surcharges in 1999 .
later the cooperation expanded with the introduction of a security surcharge and refused to pay a commission on those surcharges to their clients .
" by refusing to pay a commission , the airlines ensured that surcharges did not become subject to competition through the granting of discounts to customers .
such practices are in breach of the eu competition rules , " the commission said in a statement .

schools in the czech republic - and in many other european countries – still maintain a system of de facto segregation for members of the roma minority , according to the errc .
" we did n't necessarily have the smoking gun of the teacher or a school administrator saying we 're putting you in these schools because you 're roma , but the numbers speak for themselves , " errc executive director robert kushen told reporters .
the european court of human rights ruled in november 2007 that 18 czech roma children had been discriminated against by being sent wrongly to special schools .
no changes so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de facto segregation also exists in greece , croatia and slovakia " the number of romani children in special education in the czech republic at that time and today was out of all proportion to the number of romani children in the population , " kushen added .
the czech government itself undertook studies after the court decision which confirm that something like 27 percent of romani children are in special education compared to 2.2 percent of non-romani children being in special education .
the only real change since the 2007 court ruling , says the center , is that such schools have been renamed ' practical ' schools by the authorities .
behind their doors , however , the overwhelmingly roma pupils still follow an academically inferior curriculum , condemning them to a life of limited further education , bleak employment prospects and deeper social exclusion .
similar situation across south-east europe but the czech republic is not alone – the center has since won a similar court case against croatia , and contributed towards another case in greece that was brought by the greek helsinki monitor .
both verdicts found that de facto segregation exists in those countries too .
in neighboring slovakia , for instance , a recent study showed 60 percent of special school pupils were roma .
stanislav daniel , a university-educated academic researcher working for the errc , said he himself had narrowly escaped being shunted off to a special school as a child in communist czechoslovakia .
" interestingly , i was also placed into a class at a mainstream school .
in the first year , i was placed in a class with all the romani children , and this class was for the children where there was a risk they would be placed into special school .
and this took place at the time when i was able to read and write .
my father , for some reason that i will never understand , taught me to read and write before i went to school . "
the european roma rights center says far from addressing the problem head on since the verdict , the new czech government actually seems to be backsliding on the little progress already made .
tuesday 's briefing was held ahead of a meeting of the commission of ministers later in november , who meet regularly to discuss whether european court of human rights recommendations are being implemented .
in this case , says the errc , it 's clear they 're not .

among those to go is the long-standing ceo of db 's long-distance travel unit . nikolaus breuel was responsible for deutsche bahn 's main-line routes long before 1999 , when the ' db fernverkehr ' subsidiary was founded as part of the db privatization process .
and he has been in charge ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolaus breuel is expected to lose his job but that now looks set to change .
members of db 's body of governors told the dpa news agency on tuesday that a non-scheduled board meeting had been called for friday to discuss personnel issues .
there has been significant speculation over the past weeks that ulrich homburg , managing director of db mobility and logistics , which oversees the long-distance division , is unhappy with breuel 's handling of a string of glitches to hit high-speed ice trains over the past couple of years .
the first major problem arose in 2008 when a broken axel highlighted a necessity for more frequent maintenance checks .
this led to a reduction in the number of reserve trains available on the network and saw service reliability drop as a result .
winter travelers have had to put up with regular delays and cancellations .
bildunterschrift : the heat was too much for too many passengers poor management public outrage reached a peak this summer when air conditioning in several high-speed trains failed and thousands of passengers had to be paid compensation .
in one incident , db customers were stranded for three hours in a tunnel when their train broke down in sweltering temperatures .
several passengers had to be taken to hospital . the combination of events has done nothing to enhance deutsche bahn 's image , and breuel , once pipped as a possible successor to the former ceo of the deutsche bahn group hartmut mehdorn , now looks set to take the rap .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.11.2010 currency likely to take center stage at seoul g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 summit starts in seoul on thursday the annual g20 summit starts in seoul on thursday , and artificial currency manipulation is likely to be a central issue .
in addition to keeping the " global currency war " from escalating , a common goal must be reaffirmed . the sheer scale of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit can be staggering .
representing 90 percent of the world 's economic power , and four-fifths of global trade , the summit is crisis-oriented .
it was called into life in 1999 as a reaction to financial crises in asia , brazil and russia , and was initially a meeting of financial ministers .
when lehman brothers investment bank collapsed in the fall of 2008 , it unleashed a global financial crisis , and the g20 became a vehicle to combat recession .
that 's when heads of state became involved .
it has been nearly two years since a package of financial measures was decided on in washington .
their aim is to ensure such an unprecedented global crisis never happens again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique strauss-kahn says global cooperation is needed for dominique strauss-kahn , a french politician and managing director of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the most important realization of the crisis is that egoism on the national level needs to yield to global cooperation .
" in my view one of the main features of this crisis has been the emergence of a willingness to work together , of a new kind of economic cooperation at the global level which never existed , never happened in the past , " strauss-kahn said in october at the annual meeting of the imf in washington .
according to strauss-kahn , that spirit of cooperation was present at past g20 summits in london , pittsburgh and toronto .
but the meeting starting thursday in seoul may show a decrease in countries ' willingness to cooperate at a global level .
" that is a real threat … there is no domestic solution to a global crisis , " he said .
summit as a litmus test the g20 summit participants surely know global cooperation is the way forward .
in the end , however , each country has to master its own national politics in order to institute financial reform .
that 's why german chancellor angela merkel says she is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far " in terms of the financial sector 's participation in carrying the costs of the crisis , the german government could have pictured more , " she told german parliamentarians in october as she outlined her goals for the seoul gathering .
while germany imposed a nationwide " financial crisis responsibility fee " on its banks , the g20 failed to agree on an international tax on financial markets .
nevertheless , europe will be bringing something to the table in seoul : its oversight of financial systems will be significantly improved .
risky financial products may be forbidden under certain circumstances and control over hedge funds and ratings agencies is being tightened .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has expressed concerns about the seoul g20 summit .
he says it comes at a critical point in time , as all parties will have to accept that global economic imbalances affect them all .
" it will be a real test of whether the g20 can deliver the coordination the world economy needs , " he wrote in an open letter .
no hint of unity despite numerous promises to disallow protectionism , the g20 nations are far from unified in their efforts to do so .
each is primarily acting with the strength its own domestic economy in mind , and the resulting imbalance is fertile ground for another crisis .
the trade balances of the individual countries – the ratio of their exports versus imports – is filled with dormant potential for conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imposed a fee on its banks , but an international tax was not agreed on in outlining her goals for the seoul g20 summit , merkel asked what countries can " do together for sustainable , strong and balanced growth . "
she wants to see this entirely accomplished by unadulterated market forces as such balances are an expression of economic competitiveness .
no answers on currency currency exchange rates are an inevitable source of controversy in the current scenario of global trade , and some analysts have already dubbed the situation a " global currency war . "
the problem is that some countries are trying to gain a competitive edge by devaluing their own currencies to make exports more attractive .
china and the united states are the primary practitioners of this tactic , with south korea , japan and brazil jointing in too .
a precarious race has begun .
the seoul g20 summit wo n't solve this problem , but merkel says that exchange rates should accurately reflect the fundamental data of a country 's domestic prosperity for the time being .
" a political scenario which targets currency distortion to strengthen economic competitiveness must be avoided , " merkel said .
france , which is due to take over south korea 's presidency of the g20 , wants to make currency policies a central issue .
still , one central issue may be the most important of all during the talks – whether the 20 nations can demonstrate they are all moving in the same direction , even if they were forced into negotiations by a crisis .

the federal office for information security has removed links to the program from its website . jan schejbal , a german computer security researcher living in sweden , on tuesday described a way to hack the new electronic german id card software .
the federal office responsible for the program stopped allowing the software to be downloaded on wednesday . the new cards , which became available november 1 and will gradually replace current german cards , contain an rfid wireless chip - the same kind found in many contactless security or payment keycards .
the chip stores digital versions of the card holder 's photo , name , address , date of birth , height , eye and hair color and location of issuance . the interior ministry and the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- have claimed the cards will help the government provide easy-to-use digital signatures and other government services , as well as protection against online scams and phishing attacks .
germans can also use the ids in place of a passport when traveling within the european union . spoofing the server but to be useful to individuals , the digital information on the cards needs to be accessed with a card reader .
it 's the ausweisapp -lrb- " id app " -rrb- software that runs the card reader which is flawed , according to schejbal . after downloading the first version of ausweisapp from a german government website , he noticed a major flaw when the program checks for updates .
the software does not verify the origin of a digital security -lrb- ssl -rrb- certificate , which leaves the program open to a spoof attack that conceivably could lead to the download of malicious software . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia has had digital id cards for eight years " the electronic id itself may have quite a high security level , " said schejbal in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" however , this security becomes worthless if the framework which is used to access this secure core is insecure and allows compromising overall security . " had the new electronic id card already been widely used , the security flaw in updating would have been significant , according to karsten nohl , an independent security expert based in berlin . " fortunately , that is not the case and the bug can be fixed swiftly , " he told deutsche welle .
" this vulnerability is another reminder of the complexity of the id card security system , not all of which has been tested rigorously . " in a statement to the german tech news website heise.de , the bsi said it was looking into the update issue .
it also removed the software from its website to prevent more people from downloading the flawed program . " the media has been made aware of a perceived vulnerability in the software ausweisapp necessary for the eid feature of the new id card , " it wrote .
bsi did not reply to deutsche welle 's request for comment .
" if a vulnerability exists in the software , the bsi will provide a new version of the software without delay and will inform the public accordingly . " digital id cards expanding across europe digital ids have been spreading across the continent in recent years .
estonia has had one for nearly a decade , with a slew of electronic government services , and legally binding digital signatures to go along with it .
belgium , sweden , spain , portugal all currently have electronic id cards , and there are plans in place to release such cards in luxembourg and the czech republic . while schejbal added that he is not opposed to the concept of an electronic id , he advised germans to avoid the cards for as long as possible . " it is not secure , and it will put the user at risk , " he wrote .
" if the electronic identity is abused , the user will have a hard time proving that he did not authorize a transaction . " previous flaws have been discovered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital id cards have a corresponding reader when used with a computer schejbal 's discovery is n't the first time security flaws were found in the new electronic id cards .
in september , the german hacker collective the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- demonstrated how the card reader 's security measures could be circumvented . after obtaining an id card 's pin number by using a program that records individual keystrokes , the hackers were able to rewrite all the information on the id .
card readers come in a variety of models , and the ccc circumvented the most basic model . security researchers have doubts manuel bach , the electronic id project manager at the bsi , responded by saying that germans must take responsibility for their own computer security and ensure their computers remain free of the malicious software needed to steal pins and other personal data . " the germany id card ca n't protect you from trojan horses , it 's just a piece of plastic with a microchip inside , " he told deutsche welle in an interview last month .
" you as a citizen or computer user have a responsibility to secure your system .
if you do that you 're very safe , even with a basic card reader . " but constanze kurz , a ccc spokeswoman , said the government should n't expect all germans to be tech whizzes . " if you pretend that all your citizens are really good with computers , and that they can manage their own it security on their systems , then you are definitely wrong , " she said in an interview with deutsche welle .

in addition to keeping the " global currency war " from escalating , a common goal must be reaffirmed . the sheer scale of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit can be staggering .
representing 90 percent of the world 's economic power , and four-fifths of global trade , the summit is crisis-oriented .
it was called into life in 1999 as a reaction to financial crises in asia , brazil and russia , and was initially a meeting of financial ministers .
when lehman brothers investment bank collapsed in the fall of 2008 , it unleashed a global financial crisis , and the g20 became a vehicle to combat recession .
that 's when heads of state became involved .
it has been nearly two years since a package of financial measures was decided on in washington .
their aim is to ensure such an unprecedented global crisis never happens again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique strauss-kahn says global cooperation is needed for dominique strauss-kahn , a french politician and managing director of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the most important realization of the crisis is that egoism on the national level needs to yield to global cooperation .
" in my view one of the main features of this crisis has been the emergence of a willingness to work together , of a new kind of economic cooperation at the global level which never existed , never happened in the past , " strauss-kahn said in october at the annual meeting of the imf in washington .
according to strauss-kahn , that spirit of cooperation was present at past g20 summits in london , pittsburgh and toronto .
but the meeting starting thursday in seoul may show a decrease in countries ' willingness to cooperate at a global level .
" that is a real threat … there is no domestic solution to a global crisis , " he said .
summit as a litmus test the g20 summit participants surely know global cooperation is the way forward .
in the end , however , each country has to master its own national politics in order to institute financial reform .
that 's why german chancellor angela merkel says she is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far " in terms of the financial sector 's participation in carrying the costs of the crisis , the german government could have pictured more , " she told german parliamentarians in october as she outlined her goals for the seoul gathering .
while germany imposed a nationwide " financial crisis responsibility fee " on its banks , the g20 failed to agree on an international tax on financial markets .
nevertheless , europe will be bringing something to the table in seoul : its oversight of financial systems will be significantly improved .
risky financial products may be forbidden under certain circumstances and control over hedge funds and ratings agencies is being tightened .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has expressed concerns about the seoul g20 summit .
he says it comes at a critical point in time , as all parties will have to accept that global economic imbalances affect them all .
" it will be a real test of whether the g20 can deliver the coordination the world economy needs , " he wrote in an open letter .
no hint of unity despite numerous promises to disallow protectionism , the g20 nations are far from unified in their efforts to do so .
each is primarily acting with the strength its own domestic economy in mind , and the resulting imbalance is fertile ground for another crisis .
the trade balances of the individual countries – the ratio of their exports versus imports – is filled with dormant potential for conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imposed a fee on its banks , but an international tax was not agreed on in outlining her goals for the seoul g20 summit , merkel asked what countries can " do together for sustainable , strong and balanced growth . "
she wants to see this entirely accomplished by unadulterated market forces as such balances are an expression of economic competitiveness .
no answers on currency currency exchange rates are an inevitable source of controversy in the current scenario of global trade , and some analysts have already dubbed the situation a " global currency war . "
the problem is that some countries are trying to gain a competitive edge by devaluing their own currencies to make exports more attractive .
china and the united states are the primary practitioners of this tactic , with south korea , japan and brazil jointing in too .
a precarious race has begun .
the seoul g20 summit wo n't solve this problem , but merkel says that exchange rates should accurately reflect the fundamental data of a country 's domestic prosperity for the time being .
" a political scenario which targets currency distortion to strengthen economic competitiveness must be avoided , " merkel said .
france , which is due to take over south korea 's presidency of the g20 , wants to make currency policies a central issue .
still , one central issue may be the most important of all during the talks – whether the 20 nations can demonstrate they are all moving in the same direction , even if they were forced into negotiations by a crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 10.11.2010 security flaw discovered in german digital id card software großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new electronic id card was released on november 1 one day after its release , the software used to read new german id cards is shown to be vulnerable to attack .
the federal office for information security has removed links to the program from its website . jan schejbal , a german computer security researcher living in sweden , on tuesday described a way to hack the new electronic german id card software .
the federal office responsible for the program stopped allowing the software to be downloaded on wednesday . the new cards , which became available november 1 and will gradually replace current german cards , contain an rfid wireless chip - the same kind found in many contactless security or payment keycards .
the chip stores digital versions of the card holder 's photo , name , address , date of birth , height , eye and hair color and location of issuance . the interior ministry and the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- have claimed the cards will help the government provide easy-to-use digital signatures and other government services , as well as protection against online scams and phishing attacks .
germans can also use the ids in place of a passport when traveling within the european union . spoofing the server but to be useful to individuals , the digital information on the cards needs to be accessed with a card reader .
it 's the ausweisapp -lrb- " id app " -rrb- software that runs the card reader which is flawed , according to schejbal . after downloading the first version of ausweisapp from a german government website , he noticed a major flaw when the program checks for updates .
the software does not verify the origin of a digital security -lrb- ssl -rrb- certificate , which leaves the program open to a spoof attack that conceivably could lead to the download of malicious software . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia has had digital id cards for eight years " the electronic id itself may have quite a high security level , " said schejbal in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" however , this security becomes worthless if the framework which is used to access this secure core is insecure and allows compromising overall security . " had the new electronic id card already been widely used , the security flaw in updating would have been significant , according to karsten nohl , an independent security expert based in berlin . " fortunately , that is not the case and the bug can be fixed swiftly , " he told deutsche welle .
" this vulnerability is another reminder of the complexity of the id card security system , not all of which has been tested rigorously . " in a statement to the german tech news website heise.de , the bsi said it was looking into the update issue .
it also removed the software from its website to prevent more people from downloading the flawed program . " the media has been made aware of a perceived vulnerability in the software ausweisapp necessary for the eid feature of the new id card , " it wrote .
bsi did not reply to deutsche welle 's request for comment .
" if a vulnerability exists in the software , the bsi will provide a new version of the software without delay and will inform the public accordingly . " digital id cards expanding across europe digital ids have been spreading across the continent in recent years .
estonia has had one for nearly a decade , with a slew of electronic government services , and legally binding digital signatures to go along with it .
belgium , sweden , spain , portugal all currently have electronic id cards , and there are plans in place to release such cards in luxembourg and the czech republic . while schejbal added that he is not opposed to the concept of an electronic id , he advised germans to avoid the cards for as long as possible . " it is not secure , and it will put the user at risk , " he wrote .
" if the electronic identity is abused , the user will have a hard time proving that he did not authorize a transaction . " previous flaws have been discovered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital id cards have a corresponding reader when used with a computer schejbal 's discovery is n't the first time security flaws were found in the new electronic id cards .

" the energy challenge is one of the greatest tests europe has to face , " oettinger said on wednesday at the presentation of the bloc 's energy strategy for the next 10 years . " putting our energy system onto a new , more sustainable and secure path may take time but ambitious decisions need to be taken now . " the energy chief said individual governments ' priorities in the 27-member bloc had limited european energy policy in the past , and that this must change . " to have an efficient , competitive and low-carbon economy we have to europeanize our energy policy and focus on a few , but pressing , priorities , " oettinger said . energy connections between member states tend to be scattered and inefficient , a hangover from pre-eu times when most national grids were the property of state-run monopolies . " failing to achieve a well-functioning european energy market will only increase the costs for consumers and put europe 's competitiveness at risk , " he added . ending energy isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : encouraging energy savings was another of the report 's priorities in the context of russia 's gas disputes with its neighbours in recent years – and their knock-on consequences for europe – oettinger indicated that security was another reason for integrating networks , so as to prevent states from becoming overly dependent upon a single energy provider . " by 2015 , no member state should be isolated , " a european commission statement said on wednesday . oettinger said the eu 's executive would propose legislation in five key areas in the coming 18 months , including energy efficiency measures for businesses and private housholds . it will also push eu member states to accept a deadline of 2015 to link up all 27 national energy markets . the eu as well as european countries will have to update the energy grid to allow for decentralized power generation and distribution , according to stefan gsaenger , secretary general of the world wind energy association . " up to 10 or 20 years ago in germany we had dozens of huge power stations , " he told deutsche welle .
" today there are hundreds of thousands of power generation units in solar systems and wind farms that are all over germany .
that completely changes the grid . " gsaenger said he expects generation of local , small-scale renewable energy generation to continue increasing as the eu member states strive reach their announced goal of collectively sourcing 20 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2020 , which implies about 35 percent of electricity . funding for electricity grid improvements will come from taxpayers and power companies . german chancellor angela merkel had said earlier that european members should ensure new energy projects are commercially viable .

" the energy challenge is one of the greatest tests europe has to face , " oettinger said on wednesday at the presentation of the bloc 's energy strategy for the next 10 years . " putting our energy system onto a new , more sustainable and secure path may take time but ambitious decisions need to be taken now . " the energy chief said individual governments ' priorities in the 27-member bloc had limited european energy policy in the past , and that this must change . " to have an efficient , competitive and low-carbon economy we have to europeanize our energy policy and focus on a few , but pressing , priorities , " oettinger said . energy connections between member states tend to be scattered and inefficient , a hangover from pre-eu times when most national grids were the property of state-run monopolies .

" by 2015 , no member state should be isolated , " a european commission statement said on wednesday . oettinger said the eu 's executive would propose legislation in five key areas in the coming 18 months , including energy efficiency measures for businesses and private housholds . it will also push eu member states to accept a deadline of 2015 to link up all 27 national energy markets . the eu as well as european countries will have to update the energy grid to allow for decentralized power generation and distribution , according to stefan gsaenger , secretary general of the world wind energy association .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 10.11.2010 german economic sages point to increased growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang franz and his team of ' wise men ' have n't delivered such good news for some time the german government 's team of five economic ' wise men ' have predicted consistent economic growth , lower unemployment , and reduced budget deficits for 2010 and 2011 .
however , they have warned against sudden tax cuts . the german council of economic experts predicted on wednesday that germany 's economy will grow by 3.7 percent in 2010 , and by 2.2 percent in 2011 - a prognosis that even exceeds the latest official estimates from chancellor angela merkel 's government .
" the pleasing upward trend in the german economy offers the chance for a stable , if relatively flat , path of growth , " the council 's chairman , wolfgang franz said .
" also , the government is in a position to considerably bolster these chances with solid economic policies . "
increased consumption , investments and demand for german exports are fuelling the recovery , and should lead to reduced levels of unemployment and state borrowing , the experts said .
however , they also cautioned that a repeat of germany 's so-called economic miracle in the post-war era was not on the cards .
the council , often referred to as the five wise men of the economy -lrb- in fact , one is a woman -rrb- , was set up in 1963 to advise the government on economic policy . " i think we are all delighted that the situation this year looks a lot more optimistic than last year , " chancellor angela merkel said on receiving the report , promising to continue with governent plans to save money .
" we are well aware that the structure of our current budget - designed as a response to the recent crisis with over 50 percent of spending going towards social security - is not a sustainable model for the future , especially considering our ageing population . "
taxation and borrowing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government says reducing borrowing still takes priority over tax cuts the chairman of the expert panel , wolfgang franz , told chancellor merkel that her government could support the fragile growth by issuing stricter regulations on the global financial sector and continuing to consolidate german overspending .
he also issued two warnings to governments , employers , and trade unions - advising against " rash cuts in taxes " and " excessive increases in wages . "
tax cuts were a major campaign platform of merkel 's pro-business coalition partners , the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , and the party - which is struggling in the polls - is keen that they are introduced sooner rather than later .
economic minister rainer bruederle , a member of the fdp , told german public television on wednesday that his party would be patient before cutting taxes , but the cuts would come .
" not today , but soon .
because if the economy really does grow as predicted , then - after implementing the measures to balance the budget that we have made priority number one - there might be a bit of lee-way for some slight cuts in the middle-bracket . "
bruederle said .
" but , as our coalition keeps saying , we must reduce the budget deficit as a short-term priority , and then think about taxation in the medium term . "
bruederle said that the government might be in a position to start the process by 2012 - especially in light of the panel 's prediction that germany might dip below the prescribed eu budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 .
but the economists see this matter very differently , arguing that there will be no room for tax cuts during the current legislative period -lrb- which ends in 2013 -rrb- , and saying it may not even be possible early in the next one .
instead , the group suggested that berlin might be forced to raise taxes slightly in order to meet its target of cutting 80 billion euros in spending between 2010 and 2014 .
job market to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to target germany 's unemployment problem the german economic experts also predicted reduced joblessness for 2011 , with germany set to dip below 3 million unemployed next year .
earlier in the week , buoyed by the prospect of good news from her experts , chancellor merkel told the focus news magazine that full employment was a major goal for her government .
" i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " she said .
" we must , and can , get these people back to work . "
however , the cologne-based institute for economic research predicts that a rate of around 5 percent unemployment , meaning roughly 2 million germans out of work , would be a more realistic goal in the foreseeable future .
" at that point the structural issues behind joblessness start to become a problem , " the institute 's president michael huether explained .
" things like a lack of qualifications , the unsuitability of candidates for the jobs on offer , and vice versa . "
economic envy in the english press germany is leading eu member states as the bloc struggles to emerge from recession - something which has caused the british media to take note in recent weeks .
as britain 's coalition government , elected earlier this year , looks to introduce tough spending cuts and jumpstart the faltering economy , more and more media outlets are reevaluating the merits of the relatively export-heavy , frugal economic policies which germans call " rhineland capitalism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's new leadership duo are making drastic cuts for little reward " a decade ago we considered the german economy a write-off .
now -lrb- prime minister -rrb- david cameron looks to angela merkel for inspiration , " a columnist at the left-leaning guardian newspaper , david gow , wrote in a recent commentary .
germany only partially followed the anglo-american movement towards dependence on the financial and services sectors in the latter half of the 20th century , preferring to maintain some industrial output and favoring a relatively cautious banking community .
the decision was often derided as backward , and even harmful to less cautious western neighbors , but now british commentators are asking whether the same caution has proved the key to a relatively swift recovery .
even the conservative newspaper , the times , has recently turned against the higher-risk capitalism favored in the english-speaking world , suggesting that germany 's export-heavy model is " leaving britain behind . "
yet there are other voices in the uk , like london-based financial analysts lombard street research , who point to decreasing demand in china and continued economic problems in the us and much of southern europe , suggesting that this could mean that germany 's export-driven recovery might falter in the near future .

however , they have warned against sudden tax cuts . the german council of economic experts predicted on wednesday that germany 's economy will grow by 3.7 percent in 2010 , and by 2.2 percent in 2011 - a prognosis that even exceeds the latest official estimates from chancellor angela merkel 's government .
" the pleasing upward trend in the german economy offers the chance for a stable , if relatively flat , path of growth , " the council 's chairman , wolfgang franz said .
" also , the government is in a position to considerably bolster these chances with solid economic policies . "
increased consumption , investments and demand for german exports are fuelling the recovery , and should lead to reduced levels of unemployment and state borrowing , the experts said .
however , they also cautioned that a repeat of germany 's so-called economic miracle in the post-war era was not on the cards .
the council , often referred to as the five wise men of the economy -lrb- in fact , one is a woman -rrb- , was set up in 1963 to advise the government on economic policy . " i think we are all delighted that the situation this year looks a lot more optimistic than last year , " chancellor angela merkel said on receiving the report , promising to continue with governent plans to save money .
" we are well aware that the structure of our current budget - designed as a response to the recent crisis with over 50 percent of spending going towards social security - is not a sustainable model for the future , especially considering our ageing population . "
taxation and borrowing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government says reducing borrowing still takes priority over tax cuts the chairman of the expert panel , wolfgang franz , told chancellor merkel that her government could support the fragile growth by issuing stricter regulations on the global financial sector and continuing to consolidate german overspending .
he also issued two warnings to governments , employers , and trade unions - advising against " rash cuts in taxes " and " excessive increases in wages . "
tax cuts were a major campaign platform of merkel 's pro-business coalition partners , the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , and the party - which is struggling in the polls - is keen that they are introduced sooner rather than later .
economic minister rainer bruederle , a member of the fdp , told german public television on wednesday that his party would be patient before cutting taxes , but the cuts would come .
" not today , but soon .
because if the economy really does grow as predicted , then - after implementing the measures to balance the budget that we have made priority number one - there might be a bit of lee-way for some slight cuts in the middle-bracket . "
bruederle said .
" but , as our coalition keeps saying , we must reduce the budget deficit as a short-term priority , and then think about taxation in the medium term . "
bruederle said that the government might be in a position to start the process by 2012 - especially in light of the panel 's prediction that germany might dip below the prescribed eu budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 .
but the economists see this matter very differently , arguing that there will be no room for tax cuts during the current legislative period -lrb- which ends in 2013 -rrb- , and saying it may not even be possible early in the next one .
instead , the group suggested that berlin might be forced to raise taxes slightly in order to meet its target of cutting 80 billion euros in spending between 2010 and 2014 .
job market to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to target germany 's unemployment problem the german economic experts also predicted reduced joblessness for 2011 , with germany set to dip below 3 million unemployed next year .
earlier in the week , buoyed by the prospect of good news from her experts , chancellor merkel told the focus news magazine that full employment was a major goal for her government .
" i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " she said .
" we must , and can , get these people back to work . "
however , the cologne-based institute for economic research predicts that a rate of around 5 percent unemployment , meaning roughly 2 million germans out of work , would be a more realistic goal in the foreseeable future .
" at that point the structural issues behind joblessness start to become a problem , " the institute 's president michael huether explained .
" things like a lack of qualifications , the unsuitability of candidates for the jobs on offer , and vice versa . "
economic envy in the english press germany is leading eu member states as the bloc struggles to emerge from recession - something which has caused the british media to take note in recent weeks .
as britain 's coalition government , elected earlier this year , looks to introduce tough spending cuts and jumpstart the faltering economy , more and more media outlets are reevaluating the merits of the relatively export-heavy , frugal economic policies which germans call " rhineland capitalism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's new leadership duo are making drastic cuts for little reward " a decade ago we considered the german economy a write-off .
now -lrb- prime minister -rrb- david cameron looks to angela merkel for inspiration , " a columnist at the left-leaning guardian newspaper , david gow , wrote in a recent commentary .
germany only partially followed the anglo-american movement towards dependence on the financial and services sectors in the latter half of the 20th century , preferring to maintain some industrial output and favoring a relatively cautious banking community .
the decision was often derided as backward , and even harmful to less cautious western neighbors , but now british commentators are asking whether the same caution has proved the key to a relatively swift recovery .
even the conservative newspaper , the times , has recently turned against the higher-risk capitalism favored in the english-speaking world , suggesting that germany 's export-heavy model is " leaving britain behind . "
yet there are other voices in the uk , like london-based financial analysts lombard street research , who point to decreasing demand in china and continued economic problems in the us and much of southern europe , suggesting that this could mean that germany 's export-driven recovery might falter in the near future .

sarkozy wasted no time in signing the bill on wednesday , just hours after the court ruling .
he said in a statement that while he heard the concerns expressed by opponents during the debate , it was his " duty " to ensure the pension fund 's integrity .
" with this law , our redistributive pension system has been saved , " he said .
" french citizens can now be assured that they can count on their retirement and that pension payments will be maintained . "
sarkozy 's right-of-center government insisted the reform , which raises the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the full retirement age from 65 to 67 , was necessary to fill a major budget gap as france 's population ages and few workers are paying into the system .
the law will gradually come into effect in july 2011 and will be fully enacted by 2018 .

the court rejected the challenge , but the socialists have vowed to repeal the law if they win the next presidential election in 2012 .
" the president is confusing appearance with reality , he thinks that by putting his head down and charging forward without listening , he 's showing courage , " said socialist leader martine aubry .
" it would have been courage to put in place a reform that really solves the problem of retirement . "
as the reform was in debate in the legislature , massive protests and nationwide strikes crippled the country 's transportation system and all but shut down the oil industry , leaving many gas stations without fuel for cars .
unions have called for another day of strikes on november 23 , but it was unclear how many would take part , as the public opposition to the bill was running out of steam toward the end of the debate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.11.2010 as bush plugs his memoir , european anger still simmers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-president bush has reignited dormant anger in europe as george w. bush returns to the public eye to promote his recently published memoirs , he is polarizing opinion .
his book is unlikely to help heal the rift that emerged between the us and europe while he was in office . the 43rd us president 's apparent mission to have his two terms in the white house reassessed and his reputation rehabilitated through his new book , " decision points , " has many europeans shaking their heads . and it 's not just the most inflammatory excerpts - such as bush 's assertion that water-boarding of terror suspects saved lives - that are causing an outcry . bush 's supporters in the us say that every president has the right to defend his record ; " decision points " shows the former president as a man who was ideologically consistent during his eight years in office . his detractors counter that the president 's mistakes and his determination to follow ill-thought-out policies - without a thought for a possible , rectifying change of direction - plunged the us into a decade of war and the worst financial crisis in over 80 years .
while george w. bush may have been a good guy with a difficult job , they say , he does n't deserve to be rehabilitated via his memoirs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush left office with two wars and an economic crisis raging if bush 's single-minded and heavy-handed approach to afghanistan and iraq in the wake of the terror attacks of 9/11 were damaging to his relations with his european allies at the time , his newly released memoirs appear to be giving european readers the chance get angry all over again . europeans , even allies , dismissed as irrelevant " in my opinion , there ’ s been no change in perception of bush in europe , " dr. henning meyer , a transatlantic relations expert at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle . " his legacy projects , such as iraq and afghanistan , are still the main issues associated with his presidency and of course europeans are still affected by these and in most cases are still in opposition to a certain degree .
if you remember , bush ’ s war on terror effectively split europe .
so these things have not been forgotten . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush says the uk 's perception of him does n't matter in " decision points , " bush is dismissive about those europeans who had taken a risk to follow him into war in iraq , and he talks frankly about his reputation in the one country whose leaders followed him most obediently of all : england .
" it does n't matter how people perceive me in england , " he writes .
" it just does n't matter any more .
and frankly , at times , it did n't matter then . " in a veiled dig at what he saw at the time as the rest of europe 's lack of stomach for the fight , bush writes : " people in europe said : ' ah , man , he 's a religious fanatic , cowboy , simpleton . '
all that stuff ...
if you believe that freedom is universal , then you should n't be surprised when people take courageous measures to live in a free society . " he reserves his most scathing treatment for those european leaders who disappointed him most , especially during the iraq war : former german chancellor gerhard schroeder comes in for even worse treatment than former french president jacques chirac , schroeder 's ally in the european anti-war opposition . german emotions still raw over bush 's rush to war in the book , bush accuses schroeder of abusing his trust after allegedly telling the president in 2002 , before the invasion of iraq the following year , that " what goes for afghanistan also goes for iraq .
nations which support terrorism must accept the consequences .
if you go forward fast and resolutely , i am on your side . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush did n't trust schroeder after the latter withdrew his support however , struggling in his re-election campaign in the fall of that year , schroeder hitched his wagon to the huge swell of anti-war feeling in germany and across europe .
he claims bush is lying when he says that he had offered his support for an invasion , and that he 'd made it clear all along that his support was conditional on whether iraq really had weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- . " schroeder 's support -lrb- for the invasion of iraq -rrb- was conditional on evidence being found of terrorists being harbored in iraq , so when there was no evidence delivered , he withdrew his support , " lse professor meyer told deutsche welle .
" bush is attempting to polish his own picture of this situation with the germans by saying that the breakdown in relations was not his fault and that it was schroeder who turned opinion against him . " the bush legacy is still powerfully felt in the united states : the armed forces are embroiled in the two wars he started ; the financial system is struggling to pull out of an overwhelming crisis , and politicians are scrambling to rebuild their credibility on the world stage . but the ripples from his eight-year presidency continue to be felt in europe as well .
under his leadership , decades of trust and cooperation between the us and european governments was damaged . according to thomas klau , a transatlantic relations expert at the european council for foreign relations , the memoir provides new fodder for europeans who are skeptical about the us political system . " europeans , and germans in particular , are still amazed that the us political system has the potential to elect such an incompetent leader who has no respect for western values , " klau said .
" while obama gave some hope , the germans are now saddened to see that a discredited party such as the republicans can be re-elected as the majority in the house of representatives . " germans see the republican mid-term victory as proof that " the us system and electorate has a very short memory and very little wisdom . " european anger reignited over torture statements so far , european reaction to the bush memoirs has been heavily affected by comments in the book that seem to advocate torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims water boarding extracted vital information for meyer , the water-boarding comments are " a very clear example of the philosophical differences between the bush administration and the europeans . " " there is a huge difference in what bush thought was acceptable in terms of the war on terror and what the europeans thought , " he added .
" bush saw approaches such as water-boarding as not a breaking of any laws but a legitimate bending of them . " moreover , bush " made bold statements " that the information gained from water-boarding stopped an attack on london - a claim the uk refutes . " most people in europe say that there were other ways of getting the information and that bush ’ s assertions are just not true , " meyer said . severe - and lasting - damage ? the response to his memoirs suggests that the damage bush did to his country 's reputation in europe remains severe . " bush 's was the worst us presidency that europe and the world has ever seen and his legacy , in political and economic terms , will be seen as one of disaster , " said klau .
" few people will expect to see any change in this perception arising from his memoirs .
in fact , it 's highly likely that his already terrible reputation in europe will take an even worse turn . " bush may have come out with his book to try and put the record straight in his own words .
but in doing so , at least in europe , it appears that he has taken a big stick to a hornet 's nest of his own making . author : nick amies editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his book is unlikely to help heal the rift that emerged between the us and europe while he was in office . the 43rd us president 's apparent mission to have his two terms in the white house reassessed and his reputation rehabilitated through his new book , " decision points , " has many europeans shaking their heads . and it 's not just the most inflammatory excerpts - such as bush 's assertion that water-boarding of terror suspects saved lives - that are causing an outcry . bush 's supporters in the us say that every president has the right to defend his record ; " decision points " shows the former president as a man who was ideologically consistent during his eight years in office . his detractors counter that the president 's mistakes and his determination to follow ill-thought-out policies - without a thought for a possible , rectifying change of direction - plunged the us into a decade of war and the worst financial crisis in over 80 years .
while george w. bush may have been a good guy with a difficult job , they say , he does n't deserve to be rehabilitated via his memoirs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush left office with two wars and an economic crisis raging if bush 's single-minded and heavy-handed approach to afghanistan and iraq in the wake of the terror attacks of 9/11 were damaging to his relations with his european allies at the time , his newly released memoirs appear to be giving european readers the chance get angry all over again . europeans , even allies , dismissed as irrelevant " in my opinion , there ’ s been no change in perception of bush in europe , " dr. henning meyer , a transatlantic relations expert at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle . " his legacy projects , such as iraq and afghanistan , are still the main issues associated with his presidency and of course europeans are still affected by these and in most cases are still in opposition to a certain degree .
if you remember , bush ’ s war on terror effectively split europe .
so these things have not been forgotten . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush says the uk 's perception of him does n't matter in " decision points , " bush is dismissive about those europeans who had taken a risk to follow him into war in iraq , and he talks frankly about his reputation in the one country whose leaders followed him most obediently of all : england .
" it does n't matter how people perceive me in england , " he writes .
" it just does n't matter any more .
and frankly , at times , it did n't matter then . " in a veiled dig at what he saw at the time as the rest of europe 's lack of stomach for the fight , bush writes : " people in europe said : ' ah , man , he 's a religious fanatic , cowboy , simpleton . '
all that stuff ...
if you believe that freedom is universal , then you should n't be surprised when people take courageous measures to live in a free society . " he reserves his most scathing treatment for those european leaders who disappointed him most , especially during the iraq war : former german chancellor gerhard schroeder comes in for even worse treatment than former french president jacques chirac , schroeder 's ally in the european anti-war opposition . german emotions still raw over bush 's rush to war in the book , bush accuses schroeder of abusing his trust after allegedly telling the president in 2002 , before the invasion of iraq the following year , that " what goes for afghanistan also goes for iraq .
nations which support terrorism must accept the consequences .
if you go forward fast and resolutely , i am on your side . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush did n't trust schroeder after the latter withdrew his support however , struggling in his re-election campaign in the fall of that year , schroeder hitched his wagon to the huge swell of anti-war feeling in germany and across europe .
he claims bush is lying when he says that he had offered his support for an invasion , and that he 'd made it clear all along that his support was conditional on whether iraq really had weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- . " schroeder 's support -lrb- for the invasion of iraq -rrb- was conditional on evidence being found of terrorists being harbored in iraq , so when there was no evidence delivered , he withdrew his support , " lse professor meyer told deutsche welle .
" bush is attempting to polish his own picture of this situation with the germans by saying that the breakdown in relations was not his fault and that it was schroeder who turned opinion against him . " the bush legacy is still powerfully felt in the united states : the armed forces are embroiled in the two wars he started ; the financial system is struggling to pull out of an overwhelming crisis , and politicians are scrambling to rebuild their credibility on the world stage . but the ripples from his eight-year presidency continue to be felt in europe as well .
under his leadership , decades of trust and cooperation between the us and european governments was damaged . according to thomas klau , a transatlantic relations expert at the european council for foreign relations , the memoir provides new fodder for europeans who are skeptical about the us political system . " europeans , and germans in particular , are still amazed that the us political system has the potential to elect such an incompetent leader who has no respect for western values , " klau said .
" while obama gave some hope , the germans are now saddened to see that a discredited party such as the republicans can be re-elected as the majority in the house of representatives . " germans see the republican mid-term victory as proof that " the us system and electorate has a very short memory and very little wisdom . " european anger reignited over torture statements so far , european reaction to the bush memoirs has been heavily affected by comments in the book that seem to advocate torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims water boarding extracted vital information for meyer , the water-boarding comments are " a very clear example of the philosophical differences between the bush administration and the europeans . " " there is a huge difference in what bush thought was acceptable in terms of the war on terror and what the europeans thought , " he added .
" bush saw approaches such as water-boarding as not a breaking of any laws but a legitimate bending of them . " moreover , bush " made bold statements " that the information gained from water-boarding stopped an attack on london - a claim the uk refutes . " most people in europe say that there were other ways of getting the information and that bush ’ s assertions are just not true , " meyer said . severe - and lasting - damage ? the response to his memoirs suggests that the damage bush did to his country 's reputation in europe remains severe .

" few people will expect to see any change in this perception arising from his memoirs .

banners hung around seoul urge residents to say hello and be extra courteous to the visiting foreigners .
the south korean government is taking preparations for the g20 very seriously .
it ’ s the largest international gathering the country has held since the 2002 world cup .
this week ’ s summit also marks the first time a non-g8 and asian nation has hosted the economic forum .
south korea proud to host g20 and considering that several decades ago , south korea was one of the world ’ s poorest nations , its quick rise to the top makes it a model for other nations to emulate , says un secretary general ban ki moon .
the former south korean foreign minister says he ’ s proud of his nation ’ s accomplishments that have been made in the light of its division and war with north korea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea has undertaken the largest-ever security operation he spoke during a press briefing today in seoul : " i think we meet at a critical moment , the spotlight is on korea and is the first g20 summit in an emerging market economy .
korea is a bridge between the developed and developing world .
this role has never been more necessary and important and so there is something very special about this g20 moment . "
activists protest against " unequal economic policies " but some opposed to the g20 are using this moment to raise attention what they call its flawed economic policies .
an umbrella organization representing 80 south korean labor and civic groups says the top economies have done little to help the world ’ s poor and offset global unemployment , which they say is the highest in years .
chun hyoung baek of the civic group people ’ s solidarity for participatory democracy delivered the activists ’ official statement .
she spoke through an interpreter : " we call upon the g20 to regulate financial capital , which have brought suffering to so many people .
we call on the g20 to tax speculators and use the revenues to expand welfare .
the g20 has revamped the international monetary fund whose structural adjustment programs have devastated the lives of people all around the world . "
and now as the g20 gets under way , korean and foreign activists are taking their message to the streets of seoul .
earlier this week , tens of thousands of protesters rallied against the g20 .
they were met by squads of korean riot police , who have been put on high alert ahead of the summit .
security tight in seoul some reports say the police used pepper spray to hold demonstrators back .
to keep protests like this under control and away from the g20 venues , seoul authorities have created a two kilometer buffer zone around the convention center .
it ’ s the largest security operation the nation has undertaken , according to the national police agency .
but south korea ’ s measures have only aggravated some protestors .
kim young hoon , president of the korean confederation of trade unions , says that president lee myung bak is denying their right to protest during the summit .
violence between trade unions and police has erupted in the past during anti free trade rallies .
police have been criticized for turning water cannons on protestors .
bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate in seoul to draw attention to global poverty issues and kim says that he can not ensure that his members won ’ t resort to violence again , if police prevent them from demonstrating : " excessive use of force to crack down on demonstrations and rallies , to crack down and oppress our rights , will induce or provoke the demonstrations to become violent , that nobody wants . "
south korean riot police are prepared to confront activist groups on thursday , the first day of the g20 summit , as protestors plan to march through the capital .

with the spotlight on south korea , the government there has taken a number of steps to ensure the forum goes off without a hitch . south korea is in the grips of g20 fever.television ads play around the clock proclaiming korea ’ s readiness to host the summit .
banners hung around seoul urge residents to say hello and be extra courteous to the visiting foreigners .
the south korean government is taking preparations for the g20 very seriously .
it ’ s the largest international gathering the country has held since the 2002 world cup .
this week ’ s summit also marks the first time a non-g8 and asian nation has hosted the economic forum .
south korea proud to host g20 and considering that several decades ago , south korea was one of the world ’ s poorest nations , its quick rise to the top makes it a model for other nations to emulate , says un secretary general ban ki moon .
the former south korean foreign minister says he ’ s proud of his nation ’ s accomplishments that have been made in the light of its division and war with north korea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea has undertaken the largest-ever security operation he spoke during a press briefing today in seoul : " i think we meet at a critical moment , the spotlight is on korea and is the first g20 summit in an emerging market economy .
korea is a bridge between the developed and developing world .
this role has never been more necessary and important and so there is something very special about this g20 moment . "
activists protest against " unequal economic policies " but some opposed to the g20 are using this moment to raise attention what they call its flawed economic policies .
an umbrella organization representing 80 south korean labor and civic groups says the top economies have done little to help the world ’ s poor and offset global unemployment , which they say is the highest in years .
chun hyoung baek of the civic group people ’ s solidarity for participatory democracy delivered the activists ’ official statement .
she spoke through an interpreter : " we call upon the g20 to regulate financial capital , which have brought suffering to so many people .
we call on the g20 to tax speculators and use the revenues to expand welfare .
the g20 has revamped the international monetary fund whose structural adjustment programs have devastated the lives of people all around the world . "
and now as the g20 gets under way , korean and foreign activists are taking their message to the streets of seoul .
earlier this week , tens of thousands of protesters rallied against the g20 .
they were met by squads of korean riot police , who have been put on high alert ahead of the summit .
security tight in seoul some reports say the police used pepper spray to hold demonstrators back .
to keep protests like this under control and away from the g20 venues , seoul authorities have created a two kilometer buffer zone around the convention center .
it ’ s the largest security operation the nation has undertaken , according to the national police agency .
but south korea ’ s measures have only aggravated some protestors .
kim young hoon , president of the korean confederation of trade unions , says that president lee myung bak is denying their right to protest during the summit .
violence between trade unions and police has erupted in the past during anti free trade rallies .
police have been criticized for turning water cannons on protestors .
bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate in seoul to draw attention to global poverty issues and kim says that he can not ensure that his members won ’ t resort to violence again , if police prevent them from demonstrating : " excessive use of force to crack down on demonstrations and rallies , to crack down and oppress our rights , will induce or provoke the demonstrations to become violent , that nobody wants . "
south korean riot police are prepared to confront activist groups on thursday , the first day of the g20 summit , as protestors plan to march through the capital .

lidl has come under particular fire over pay and practices . supermarkets across germany are popular places to buy clothes .
prices are cheap : you can buy a men 's shirt for seven euros -lrb- nine us dollars -rrb- or a pair of women 's trousers for under 10 euros .
however two women from bangladesh are currently on a speaking tour of germany to highlight how these cheap prices come at a human cost .
26-year-old jessmin begum and 36-year-old arifa akter both work as seamstresses in clothes factories in dhaka that make clothes for european stores .
they say the working conditions are terrible and the pay is inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers complain about cramped conditions , dirty water and tough bosses " i 'm proud of my work , especially when i see people here wearing my clothes , " said begum , who works for a factory that supplies clothes to german-based supermarket chain lidl .
" but it makes me mad that what we get for our work in bangladesh is nothing . "
not a living wage as a seamstress , jessmin begum earns around 35 euros a month -lrb- just under 4,000 bangladesh taka -rrb- .
the monthly rent for a one room apartment in dhaka is around 25 euros a month .
" it is not even close to the living wage we have calculated , " said khorshed alam from the campaigning group alternative movement for resources and freedom society -lrb- amrf -rrb- .
with calculations based on someone working a 12- to 14-hour day , the amrf estimates around 5,000 taka a month -lrb- 52 euros -rrb- is necessary for a single worker .
a family needs to earn around 9-10,000 taka .
dirty water , mean bosses , unpaid overtime the two seamstresses are using their tour of germany to highlight how bad working conditions are in the factories .
" the drinking water is dirty and we are packed in with little space between the machines , " said begum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessmin begum has been working as a seamstress in dhaka for eight years " our supervisors insult us and put us under pressure to work harder .
almost every day i do overtime and i hardly ever come home much earlier than midnight , " she added .
the workers have no sick pay or other benefits , so most seamstresses continue to work even when ill .
highlighting the problem jessmin and arifa 's tour of germany was organized by the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- , which campaigns worldwide to promote better working conditions and fair wages .
the ccc wants international corporations to stick to their pledges to provide better labor conditions .
" for years companies have been saying they are willing to meet certain standards , but it 's only on paper , not in actions , " said the ccc 's gisela burckhardt .
" we want a proper legal framework so that companies can see the impact of their activities on the environment and people in other countries , " burckhardt argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this dhaka garment factory was visited by the ccc in 2009 khorshed alam from the amrf added that it is also the responsibility of the bangladeshi government to monitor the brands which manufacture clothes in the country , and to ensure they implement local labor laws .
making consumers aware in addition to putting pressure on manufacturers and local governments , the tour aims to give consumers more awareness of the origin of their cheap shirts and trousers .
" i came here because the people who buy our products have no idea where they came from , or how much we suffer , " said begum .
the amrf want consumers to question companies like lidl who sell cheap clothes , while claiming they pay their workers well .
in response to the claims , a spokesperson for lidl said they completely oppose any form of child labor and violations of workers ' rights .
they also added that lidl was the first german discount store to join the business social compliance initiative which works to improve working conditions in supply networks worldwide .

this season , the globe theatre pays homage to this special relationship . blasphemous as it might seem at first glance , the globe theatre 's current program serves to highlight a rather special bond between the world 's most famous writer and a whole country .

for starters , there are more performances of shakespeare in germany in any given year than in england .

major powers are likely to disagree on currency policy and plans to end exceptional economic stimulus measures . chancellor angela merkel called on world powers to coordinate plans for weaning their national economies off economic stimulus measures , and warned against creating new asset bubbles .
" there will of course be a discussion about exit strategies , " merkel told reporters before flying to seoul for the meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- top rich and emerging nations .
" it is naturally desirable that the leading economic powers do not come up with answers which are too varied to the question as to when the exit strategy should begin , " she said .
" this could be a thoroughly lively debate . "
defusing the dollar asked about the united states ' policy of " quantitative easing , " which has seen the federal reserve pump 600 billion dollars into its fragile economy , merkel said : " we are going to discuss this issue with the americans in a spirit of partnership . "
" nobody has an interest in creating new bubbles .
rather , we must see to it that growth in the global economy this year is more sustainable and enduring than we had a few years ago , " she said .
critics argue that the fed 's quantitative easing amounts to an effective dollar devaluation , and has the potential to trigger a 1930s-style trade war if other countries respond in kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is accused of weakening its currency to promote economic growth with this in mind , merkel also pressed her fellow leaders to avoid any form of protectionism , amid criticism that certain countries , notably china and japan , are keeping their currencies artificially low to encourage exports .
but she declined to criticize beijing for its foreign exchange policy , saying : " i assume that china has a very strong interest in sending a positive signal from this summit . "
" china also needs sustainable growth for its overall economic situation , " the chancellor added .
germany is the world 's second-biggest exporter after china .
its strong export sector has helped it stage an impressive economic comeback this year , but its trade surpluses have also drawn criticism abroad .
no fixed numbers merkel said germany would not accept fixed targets for addressing countries ' trade gaps .
" we reject quantified bandwidths for acceptable imbalances for good reason because ... competitiveness must be able to express itself , also in export ratios . "
merkel said germany wants to see leaders commit themselves to the final stretch of the doha round of global trade talks .
she added that trade barriers posed the biggest danger to sustained world growth .
" the biggest danger for sustainable growth is currently coming from protectionism in its different forms , " she said .

major powers are likely to disagree on currency policy and plans to end exceptional economic stimulus measures . chancellor angela merkel called on world powers to coordinate plans for weaning their national economies off economic stimulus measures , and warned against creating new asset bubbles .
" there will of course be a discussion about exit strategies , " merkel told reporters before flying to seoul for the meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- top rich and emerging nations .
" it is naturally desirable that the leading economic powers do not come up with answers which are too varied to the question as to when the exit strategy should begin , " she said .
" this could be a thoroughly lively debate . "
defusing the dollar asked about the united states ' policy of " quantitative easing , " which has seen the federal reserve pump 600 billion dollars into its fragile economy , merkel said : " we are going to discuss this issue with the americans in a spirit of partnership . "
" nobody has an interest in creating new bubbles .
rather , we must see to it that growth in the global economy this year is more sustainable and enduring than we had a few years ago , " she said .
critics argue that the fed 's quantitative easing amounts to an effective dollar devaluation , and has the potential to trigger a 1930s-style trade war if other countries respond in kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is accused of weakening its currency to promote economic growth with this in mind , merkel also pressed her fellow leaders to avoid any form of protectionism , amid criticism that certain countries , notably china and japan , are keeping their currencies artificially low to encourage exports .
but she declined to criticize beijing for its foreign exchange policy , saying : " i assume that china has a very strong interest in sending a positive signal from this summit . "
" china also needs sustainable growth for its overall economic situation , " the chancellor added .
germany is the world 's second-biggest exporter after china .
its strong export sector has helped it stage an impressive economic comeback this year , but its trade surpluses have also drawn criticism abroad .
no fixed numbers merkel said germany would not accept fixed targets for addressing countries ' trade gaps .
" we reject quantified bandwidths for acceptable imbalances for good reason because ... competitiveness must be able to express itself , also in export ratios . "
merkel said germany wants to see leaders commit themselves to the final stretch of the doha round of global trade talks .
she added that trade barriers posed the biggest danger to sustained world growth .
" the biggest danger for sustainable growth is currently coming from protectionism in its different forms , " she said .

t-shirts or trousers might cost as little as two euros .
this is great for low-income families .
but there is a downside . most of the textiles and clothes found in the stores of industrialised countries are sewn in developing countries .
bangladesh , india and indonesia top the list .
30 euros for a month 's work cheap clothes can be found at all of germany ’ s popular discount stores – for example lidl , aldi and kik .
they attract society ’ s low-earning groups , tempted by well-made shirts and trousers with a price tag of under five euros .
but the harsh truth is that the rest of the price is paid by asia 's garment workers , who receive very low wages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at germany 's discount store kik a t-shirt can be bought for one euro jasmine begum is a bangladeshi garment worker .
" in the year 2000 , i started working as an assistant operator in a garment factory , " she said . " then i was off work for some years .
i came back as an operator .
i earn 3,500 taka per month .
this is not enough for me to run my family .
i want everything to change .
i want a pay rise so that i can survive with my family .
i want to send my son to school . " 3,500 taka is about 30 euros .
jasmine , who receives no support from her husband , also lives with her mother and her elder brother .
she can not find another job because she is illiterate .
she says she is stuck in the garments sector .
foreign companies pay too little to manufacturing factories arifa akhter also once worked in garments .
she is now a member of the national garments workers federation and wants to help the girls and women who make up 80 percent of the employees in the garment sector .
she not only wants to improve working conditions but also wages .
" our garments factory owners do n't get enough money to get the job done .
that 's why they ca n't pay the workers .
if the owners were better paid by the foreign companies then the employees would also get a fraction of it if not the whole .
we demand that the foreign companies understand the problems and take the necessary measures , " said arifa akhter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration of bangladeshi garment workers for better wages “ clean clothing campaign ” in the past , such demands have often fallen on deaf ears .
one organization in germany is very concerned .
gisela bruckhardt ’ s “ clean clothing campaign ” promotes clothes that are untainted by human rights violations , exploitation , harassment and low wages .
bruckhardt says companies in germany should be fully accountable : " we want these organizations to pay garment workers accordingly .
wages must be high enough for any employee to be able to survive with her / his family .
these organizations must visit these factories every now and then to see how things are run .
but we ca n't really force them to visit .
this is a serious problem . "
gisela bruckhardt says the german government should come forward in such cases , enact laws to defend and protect these employees : " after all they are producing for us .
these employees should be able to sue german companies in a federal court and claim their rights . "
there are almost two million garments workers in bangladesh and thousands of garments factories .

in a press release , the icfr said there was widespread fear in the sector that the g20 could " fail to make progress on its goals , as domestic considerations move back center-stage . "
it urged leaders to agree on financial reforms most likely improve economic stability and achieve international implementation . " we are calling on the g20 to prioritize more effective cross-border coordination by supervisors , and for agreement on the way forward on crisis resolution to allow for the orderly wind-down of complex banks , " barbara ridpath , ceo of the watchdog said in a statement .
" time for unity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki moon has urged leaders to find common ground the icfr calls were echoed by united nations secretary general ban ki-moon , who is in the south korean capital for the international summit .
on the eve of the meeting , he expressed concern over national differences of opinion on global rebalancing and currency policies .
" the global economic recovery remains fragile .
64 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty this year , " ban said , adding that this was a time for unity .
he said the world could not afford to think narrowly about development and economic growth , and that " all countries and all peoples have a stake in the management of the global economy . "
on the agenda leaders at the seoul g20 summit , the first to be held in an emerging market economy , are expected to sign off on the basel iii agreement , which is designed to tighten global capital and liquidity requirements for banks from 2013 onwards . bildunterschrift : the summit is being watched closely by managers in frankfurt 's banking towers drafted by the basel committee of central bankers and regulators back in september , the package is considered a significant step down the path towards financial stability .
it also tipped by observers to be one of the few items on the regulation agenda that is likely to receive broad support in seoul .
the only other real progress the talks are expected to yield is the endorsement of a series of agreements aimed at tightening supervision of the derivatives market and ensuring the standardization of contracts to facilitate central clearing processes and trading on exchanges .
safety nets on the issue of " too big to fail " banks , analysts are expecting little movement .
the financial stability board -lrb- fsb -rrb- , which is responsible for the implementation of g20 regulatory pledges , is expected to lay out a set of recommendations on " systemically important financial institutions , " otherwise known as sifis , involving the largest 20 or so global banks .
under the terms of the proposals , regulators would be required to make sure that sifis , the list of which is yet to be finalized , prepare living wills outlining how , if necessary , they could be wound up without causing major upset on the markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsbc is likely to feature on the list of global banks deemed too big to fail g20 members have not , as yet , been able to agree on many of the details of sifis , but there is speculation that the list will not include big asian banks .
their business is conducted primarily in domestic markets .
they therefore pose little threat to the wider world if they go under .
ratings , commodities and accounting summit delegates are , however , tipped to rubber-stamp fsb proposals for reducing market reliance on rating agencies .
if they do green-light the suggestion , they will have to find alternative ways of assessing creditworthiness .
regulators say the move would reduce what is known as the cliff effect , which contributes to market destabilization .
in the name of yet greater stability , the group of 20 wealthy and emerging nations is also calling for more transparency in commodity markets .
this week , regulators ruled a major overhaul , but they did concede more pricing information was needed from physical commodity markets .
there is little hope of movement on the establishment of a single set of global accounting standards .
the june 2011 deadline is likely to be overshot due to differences between the g20 member states , but analysts say the summit could be an opportunity to push for resolution .

sarkozy wasted no time in signing the bill on wednesday , just hours after the court ruling .
he said in a statement that while he heard the concerns expressed by opponents during the debate , it was his " duty " to ensure the pension fund 's integrity .
" with this law , our redistributive pension system has been saved , " he said .
" french citizens can now be assured that they can count on their retirement and that pension payments will be maintained . "
sarkozy 's right-of-center government insisted the reform , which raises the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the full retirement age from 65 to 67 , was necessary to fill a major budget gap as france 's population ages and few workers are paying into the system .
the law will gradually come into effect in july 2011 and will be fully enacted by 2018 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive strikes and protests against the reform disrupted society socialists vow a repeal opposition socialists and other parties asked the country 's highest court to examine the constitutionality of the law on november 2 , saying it contradicted france 's principles of equality .
the court rejected the challenge , but the socialists have vowed to repeal the law if they win the next presidential election in 2012 .
" the president is confusing appearance with reality , he thinks that by putting his head down and charging forward without listening , he 's showing courage , " said socialist leader martine aubry .
" it would have been courage to put in place a reform that really solves the problem of retirement . "
as the reform was in debate in the legislature , massive protests and nationwide strikes crippled the country 's transportation system and all but shut down the oil industry , leaving many gas stations without fuel for cars .
unions have called for another day of strikes on november 23 , but it was unclear how many would take part , as the public opposition to the bill was running out of steam toward the end of the debate .

clubs promised to help depressed players .
however in football , does success come first ? professional football can put enormous pressure on its players .
in the bundesliga , the race for goals , points , championship and money can all pile on the pressure .
however , one year on from the tragic death of former national goalkeeper robert enke , what has really changed to help troubled players ?
as goalkeeper for eintracht frankfurt , bochum , stuttgart and kaiserslautern , thomas ernst has experienced the highs and lows of the football league .
he is currently technical director at second league club bochum .
from his years of playing experience , he knows about the mental condition of the players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas ernst -lrb- right -rrb- with bochum player chong tese " there are situations during a game when people whistle and shout personal insults at you , where every player meets challenges they can not cope with , " ernst told deutsche welle .
" the pressure is there in training , and again when playing in the stadium , " said ernst .
" it can really build up , and that stresses you out . "
footballers ' union provides help even before robert enke 's death , the union that looks after contract footballers , the vdv , was witnessing an increase of players seeking help .
the vdv has been offering psychological and pastoral advice to footballers for several years , said its chief executive ulf baranowsky .
" immediately after the tragic death of robert enke , the number of people inquiring about these services shot up , " said baranowsky .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outpouring of grief after enke 's death highlighted the issue of depression in sports since enke 's death more than two dozen players have sought advice or counseling through the vdv .
players can contact the union in strict confidentiality , or anonymously by email if they wish .
the facade is all part of the game for the psychologist thomas graw , who has worked with several bundesliga professionals , robert enke 's case was not an isolated one . " players learn to have certain internal processes to shield their feelings from the outside , " said graw .
" they see it as part of their job and their career , " he added .
even if a player looks fine from the outside , he could be suffering inside .
the psychologists who work with the vdv look out for whether a player might be suffering from a short-term mood fluctuation , or more long-term depression .
problems include fear of failure , performance anxiety , issues with coaches , bullying and " anything that affects the psyche " said baronowsky .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clubs and teammates need to be more understanding about mental illness added to these problems is a lack of understanding from teammates and coaches .
" i can well imagine that there are many coaches and teammates who reject the idea completely and just say , ' all right , well , he has no place playing here then , " ' said graw .
change unlikely in many of the speeches which were made after robert enke 's death , voices from across the world of soccer said more must be done to help those suffering from mental illness .
a major rethink was ordered across the multi-million dollar business of football .
however , according to thomas ernst at bochum , these words have failed to turn into real actions .
there has been little progress in clubs ' understanding and tackling of those with mental illness .
" basically , in the businesses and in the processes , nothing has changed . "

now the german company says it 's in a position to outgrow its us rival and dominate the market by 2015 .
consumers in the united states are central to its plans . after weathering a difficult year in 2009 and pinning its hopes on the 2010 world cup in south africa , german sporting goods company adidas has surged ahead in profits and now says it wants to outperform leading rival nike .
adidas wants to grow faster than nike through 2015 and increase its turnover by 45-50 percent to 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.4 billion -rrb- .
" we 're hoping this faster rate of growth will let us lay a foundation to be the market leader at a later point in time , " an adidas spokeswoman told deutsche welle .
nike , however , is moving forward with goals of its own .
it hopes to generate 19.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- in revenue by 2015 .
in the first nine months of 2010 , adidas primarily grew in the united states , china and russia , according to the company 's spokeswoman .
most of the growth was generated in the sports style , fashion and lifestyle sectors , as well as the reebok brand , which it bought in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa world cup gave adidas a major sales boost adidas maintains a consistent marketing budget of 13 to 14 percent of its overall turnover.the bavarian-based company now plans to market new clothing designs for teenagers every two weeks .
it also plans to aggressively pursue the young customers on the internet using social networking .
us market vital according to matt powell , an analyst at sportsonesource - a research and data firm based in charlotte , north carolina - the key market for both adidas and nike is the united states .
" the us does about half of the athletic footwear and apparel business in the world , " he told deutsche welle .
" so you 've got the us versus the rest of the world , if you will .
now you 've got some markets – especially china – which are growing very quickly .
but that pales in comparison to the us . "
powell also said that both adidas and reebok had been losing market share in footwear " until very recently . "
" i really think that part of why adidas has struggled in the us is because they really do n't have a clear understanding of what the us consumer wants , " he said . " -lrb- but -rrb- i think they 're doing a much better job today than they were five years ago . "
what the us consumer really wants is fashion , powell said , adding that most athletic footwear " is n't used for sports . "
growth in north america and china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is also a rapidly growing market for adidas and nike some of the highlights of adidas ' quarterly exchange-rate-adjusted figures include a 10 percent increase in turnover for the adidas brand , and a 14 percent increase for the reebok brand .
the company 's overall third-quarter turnover increased in all regions , specifically 14 percent in north america and 9 percent in china .
powell said he believes there is a chance adidas could grow faster than nike in the next five years .
" historically the numbers would say it 's doable , but it 's a pretty steep hill to climb . "

now the german company says it 's in a position to outgrow its us rival and dominate the market by 2015 .
consumers in the united states are central to its plans . after weathering a difficult year in 2009 and pinning its hopes on the 2010 world cup in south africa , german sporting goods company adidas has surged ahead in profits and now says it wants to outperform leading rival nike .
adidas wants to grow faster than nike through 2015 and increase its turnover by 45-50 percent to 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.4 billion -rrb- .
" we 're hoping this faster rate of growth will let us lay a foundation to be the market leader at a later point in time , " an adidas spokeswoman told deutsche welle .
nike , however , is moving forward with goals of its own .
it hopes to generate 19.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- in revenue by 2015 .
in the first nine months of 2010 , adidas primarily grew in the united states , china and russia , according to the company 's spokeswoman .
most of the growth was generated in the sports style , fashion and lifestyle sectors , as well as the reebok brand , which it bought in 2006 .

" the us does about half of the athletic footwear and apparel business in the world , " he told deutsche welle .
" so you 've got the us versus the rest of the world , if you will .
now you 've got some markets – especially china – which are growing very quickly .
but that pales in comparison to the us . "
powell also said that both adidas and reebok had been losing market share in footwear " until very recently . "
" i really think that part of why adidas has struggled in the us is because they really do n't have a clear understanding of what the us consumer wants , " he said . " -lrb- but -rrb- i think they 're doing a much better job today than they were five years ago . "
what the us consumer really wants is fashion , powell said , adding that most athletic footwear " is n't used for sports . "

the company 's overall third-quarter turnover increased in all regions , specifically 14 percent in north america and 9 percent in china .
powell said he believes there is a chance adidas could grow faster than nike in the next five years .
" historically the numbers would say it 's doable , but it 's a pretty steep hill to climb . "

many eu politicians have a guilty conscience over keeping ankara waiting .
but that 's a poor basis for making decisions , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . many eu politicians have a guilty conscience .
they do n't know how to deal with ankara ’ s hopes for speedy progress in the country 's bid for eu membership .
turkey is after all an official membership candidate and is trying to implement the reforms that brussels is calling for .
and from ankara 's perspective , this should eventually lead to full membership once the eu 's demands have been met .
so far , all previous membership candidates have eventually become full members .
but it 's clear that a guilty conscience alone is a poor basis for granting membership .
many european governments today regret that they – or their predecessors – have in past years given the green light for membership talks with turkey .
the doubts within the eu about whether turkey is fit for membership have since then only increased , and the arguments against membership have not changed .
they are not about individual points of criticism – be it cyprus or freedom of expression – but they are , in fact of a more fundamental nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations will continue to improve , but there wo n't be full membership , says hasselbach for instance , the eu still struggles with the consequences of its two previous expansion rounds in 2004 and 2007 .
and even if past expansion was not a mistake – the new members have significantly changed the european union .
the bloc 's ability to speak with one voice seems to be faltering – simply because the member states are too diverse and different .
these changes have to sink in and this process is bound to take time .
accepting turkey with its different history and tradition would from today 's perspective lead to a final stop to european integration .
has anyone ever thought of the fact that turkey would soon surpass germany as the most populous eu member state ?
turkey as a member would therefore have the right to demand more official posts than any of the other countries .
this would change the eu to an extent likely to cause sharp opposition .
and no one can guarantee that turkey will remain a secular state for good .
none of this calls into question the fact that the eu needs turkey and that turkey needs the eu .
the good trade relations and security cooperation should be built upon .
both sides are certain to do this for their very own interests .
and turkey is likely to continue its reform path even without the prospect of eu membership .
that 's why it ’ s wrong to argue that without membership talks , ankara will abandon reforms and look for other partners .
both sides need to look at the current situation .
it 's not a question of all or nothing .
and the eu should be honest with ankara that at the end of the path will be a closer relationship than today – but no full membership .

the case involves airlines that fly around the globe , from air france-klm , to british airways and quantas . the european union 's competition watchdog issued fines tuesday to 11 airlines totaling 799.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- for running a global cargo cartel .
the cargo carriers were found to have coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security over a six-year period , between 1999 and 2006 .
" with today 's decision , the european commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate cartel behavior , " eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner almunia said the case was " deplorable " the fine imposed is one of the biggest in eu history .

the commission said it dropped charges against eleven other airlines , including german carrier lufthansa and its subsidiary swiss air , because it was the first to provide information about the cartel .
according to the commission the cartel the airlines began fixing fuel-surcharges in 1999 .
later the cooperation expanded with the introduction of a security surcharge and refused to pay a commission on those surcharges to their clients .
" by refusing to pay a commission , the airlines ensured that surcharges did not become subject to competition through the granting of discounts to customers .
such practices are in breach of the eu competition rules , " the commission said in a statement .

the young journalist is an editor with a local television station and now lives in islamabad , pakistan ’ s capital .
“ people in the kpk province suffer from the problems there , ” he says , pointing to increased militarization , the taliban influence , and the radicalization of islam .
particularly those regions bordering afghanistan are becoming more dangerous , he says , “ especially for journalists .
and for children . ”
“ because safety is a problem in pashto areas , many children there can ’ t go to school .
and in afghanistan , schools are constantly being destroyed , ” says florian weigand , a dw-akademie project manager .
in october , he spent two weeks in islamabad training pakistani journalists .
“ learning is fun ! – children ’ s television for the pashto areas ” is the name of the dw-akademie project supporting media in pakistan and afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainer veronica picmanova and workshop participants “ television is very popular on both sides of the border .
and for children , it can open the door to the world , ” says weigand .
but the reality is different : the few children ’ s programs that do exist there feature mainly cartoons .
however , this may soon change .
in the afghan capital , kabul , as well as in islamabad , weigand and colleagues familiar with the region have begun producing children ’ s magazine programs together with local journalists .
“ we base them to some extent on successful german programs for children , ” weigand says .
they ’ ve found that in pashto areas the children also enjoy educational programs presented in an entertaining way .
this summer weigand and his colleagues held workshops in kabul and also baragali , in northern pakistan .
here participants filmed short reports on the different lives of children in the pashto areas .
“ during the workshop they produced entire magazine programs based on these clips , ” weigand says .
and they chose a child moderator , learned presentation methods and more about camera techniques , video editing , and writing for television .
bakht zaman also took part in the recent two-week workshop in islamabad .
he works as a journalist and as a lecturer for the university of peshawar ’ s journalism and mass communication seminar .
“ this is all about young people , ” he reflects .
“ and this means our feature .
it ’ s only when we ’ re well-trained as journalists and teachers that we can offer something worthwhile to children and young people . ”
the project offers even more than this : it brings together journalists from both sides of the border and contributes to understanding .
children ’ s television , adds weigand , lies below the ‘ political threshold ’ .
“ it ’ s an area where colleagues from pakistan and afghanistan can meet regardless of the political climate between their countries . ”
further workshops are planned for next year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 02 german version dw-akademie auf deutsch dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit wirtschaft we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

when the government temporarily took over all broadcasting frequencies , critics accused it of harming freedom of the press . the assault on the ecuadorian president , rafael correa , brought the latin american country to the brink of a coup .
protesting police units had taken correa by force on the afternoon of september 30th and had held him for ten hours in a police hospital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government swiftly reacted : for almost seven hours it took over all television networks , and only broadcast live reports from the state channel ectv .
“ this has drastically affected the way the broadcaster is now perceived from outside , ” says matthias kopp , dw-akademie project manager .
using twitter , people aired their grievances about the state control .
that day of the near-coup , kopp had been on his way to quito to consult with the state broadcaster on public service broadcasting .
the experienced trainer promptly rearranged his plans : because of the current events he coached the staff on reporting live during and after the revolt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we looked at ectv ’ s background reports on the role of the police , the military and the government and critically analyzed them , ” kopp says .
the result : “ considering the circumstances , the limits and the extremely polarized media culture in ecuador , the ectv colleagues reported relatively professionally . ”
but , he says , much work is still needed to increase the journalistic quality of ectv ’ s news programs .
“ and , ” he adds , “ the discussion around the role of public television in ecuador , which has been at the foreground since september 30th , also needs dw-akademie ’ s support . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 02 german version dw-akademie auf deutsch dw-tv europe live quadriga - der internationale talk we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

in addition to keeping the " global currency war " from escalating , a common goal must be reaffirmed . the sheer scale of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit can be staggering .
representing 90 percent of the world 's economic power , and four-fifths of global trade , the summit is crisis-oriented .
it was called into life in 1999 as a reaction to financial crises in asia , brazil and russia , and was initially a meeting of financial ministers .
when lehman brothers investment bank collapsed in the fall of 2008 , it unleashed a global financial crisis , and the g20 became a vehicle to combat recession .
that 's when heads of state became involved .
it has been nearly two years since a package of financial measures was decided on in washington .
their aim is to ensure such an unprecedented global crisis never happens again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique strauss-kahn says global cooperation is needed for dominique strauss-kahn , a french politician and managing director of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the most important realization of the crisis is that egoism on the national level needs to yield to global cooperation .
" in my view one of the main features of this crisis has been the emergence of a willingness to work together , of a new kind of economic cooperation at the global level which never existed , never happened in the past , " strauss-kahn said in october at the annual meeting of the imf in washington .
according to strauss-kahn , that spirit of cooperation was present at past g20 summits in london , pittsburgh and toronto .
but the meeting starting thursday in seoul may show a decrease in countries ' willingness to cooperate at a global level .
" that is a real threat … there is no domestic solution to a global crisis , " he said .
summit as a litmus test the g20 summit participants surely know global cooperation is the way forward .
in the end , however , each country has to master its own national politics in order to institute financial reform .
that 's why german chancellor angela merkel says she is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far " in terms of the financial sector 's participation in carrying the costs of the crisis , the german government could have pictured more , " she told german parliamentarians in october as she outlined her goals for the seoul gathering .
while germany imposed a nationwide " financial crisis responsibility fee " on its banks , the g20 failed to agree on an international tax on financial markets .
nevertheless , europe will be bringing something to the table in seoul : its oversight of financial systems will be significantly improved .
risky financial products may be forbidden under certain circumstances and control over hedge funds and ratings agencies is being tightened .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has expressed concerns about the seoul g20 summit .
he says it comes at a critical point in time , as all parties will have to accept that global economic imbalances affect them all .
" it will be a real test of whether the g20 can deliver the coordination the world economy needs , " he wrote in an open letter .
no hint of unity despite numerous promises to disallow protectionism , the g20 nations are far from unified in their efforts to do so .
each is primarily acting with the strength its own domestic economy in mind , and the resulting imbalance is fertile ground for another crisis .
the trade balances of the individual countries – the ratio of their exports versus imports – is filled with dormant potential for conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imposed a fee on its banks , but an international tax was not agreed on in outlining her goals for the seoul g20 summit , merkel asked what countries can " do together for sustainable , strong and balanced growth . "
she wants to see this entirely accomplished by unadulterated market forces as such balances are an expression of economic competitiveness .
no answers on currency currency exchange rates are an inevitable source of controversy in the current scenario of global trade , and some analysts have already dubbed the situation a " global currency war . "
the problem is that some countries are trying to gain a competitive edge by devaluing their own currencies to make exports more attractive .
china and the united states are the primary practitioners of this tactic , with south korea , japan and brazil jointing in too .
a precarious race has begun .
the seoul g20 summit wo n't solve this problem , but merkel says that exchange rates should accurately reflect the fundamental data of a country 's domestic prosperity for the time being .
" a political scenario which targets currency distortion to strengthen economic competitiveness must be avoided , " merkel said .
france , which is due to take over south korea 's presidency of the g20 , wants to make currency policies a central issue .
still , one central issue may be the most important of all during the talks – whether the 20 nations can demonstrate they are all moving in the same direction , even if they were forced into negotiations by a crisis .

no hint of unity despite numerous promises to disallow protectionism , the g20 nations are far from unified in their efforts to do so .
each is primarily acting with the strength its own domestic economy in mind , and the resulting imbalance is fertile ground for another crisis .
the trade balances of the individual countries – the ratio of their exports versus imports – is filled with dormant potential for conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imposed a fee on its banks , but an international tax was not agreed on in outlining her goals for the seoul g20 summit , merkel asked what countries can " do together for sustainable , strong and balanced growth . "
she wants to see this entirely accomplished by unadulterated market forces as such balances are an expression of economic competitiveness .
no answers on currency currency exchange rates are an inevitable source of controversy in the current scenario of global trade , and some analysts have already dubbed the situation a " global currency war . "
the problem is that some countries are trying to gain a competitive edge by devaluing their own currencies to make exports more attractive .
china and the united states are the primary practitioners of this tactic , with south korea , japan and brazil jointing in too .
a precarious race has begun .
the seoul g20 summit wo n't solve this problem , but merkel says that exchange rates should accurately reflect the fundamental data of a country 's domestic prosperity for the time being .
" a political scenario which targets currency distortion to strengthen economic competitiveness must be avoided , " merkel said .
france , which is due to take over south korea 's presidency of the g20 , wants to make currency policies a central issue .
still , one central issue may be the most important of all during the talks – whether the 20 nations can demonstrate they are all moving in the same direction , even if they were forced into negotiations by a crisis .

clubs promised to help depressed players .
however in football , does success come first ? professional football can put enormous pressure on its players .
in the bundesliga , the race for goals , points , championship and money can all pile on the pressure .
however , one year on from the tragic death of former national goalkeeper robert enke , what has really changed to help troubled players ?
as goalkeeper for eintracht frankfurt , bochum , stuttgart and kaiserslautern , thomas ernst has experienced the highs and lows of the football league .
he is currently technical director at second league club bochum .
from his years of playing experience , he knows about the mental condition of the players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas ernst -lrb- right -rrb- with bochum player chong tese " there are situations during a game when people whistle and shout personal insults at you , where every player meets challenges they can not cope with , " ernst told deutsche welle .
" the pressure is there in training , and again when playing in the stadium , " said ernst .
" it can really build up , and that stresses you out . "
footballers ' union provides help even before robert enke 's death , the union that looks after contract footballers , the vdv , was witnessing an increase of players seeking help .
the vdv has been offering psychological and pastoral advice to footballers for several years , said its chief executive ulf baranowsky .
" immediately after the tragic death of robert enke , the number of people inquiring about these services shot up , " said baranowsky .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outpouring of grief after enke 's death highlighted the issue of depression in sports since enke 's death more than two dozen players have sought advice or counseling through the vdv .
players can contact the union in strict confidentiality , or anonymously by email if they wish .
the facade is all part of the game for the psychologist thomas graw , who has worked with several bundesliga professionals , robert enke 's case was not an isolated one . " players learn to have certain internal processes to shield their feelings from the outside , " said graw .
" they see it as part of their job and their career , " he added .
even if a player looks fine from the outside , he could be suffering inside .
the psychologists who work with the vdv look out for whether a player might be suffering from a short-term mood fluctuation , or more long-term depression .
problems include fear of failure , performance anxiety , issues with coaches , bullying and " anything that affects the psyche " said baronowsky .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clubs and teammates need to be more understanding about mental illness added to these problems is a lack of understanding from teammates and coaches .
" i can well imagine that there are many coaches and teammates who reject the idea completely and just say , ' all right , well , he has no place playing here then , " ' said graw .
change unlikely in many of the speeches which were made after robert enke 's death , voices from across the world of soccer said more must be done to help those suffering from mental illness .
a major rethink was ordered across the multi-million dollar business of football .
however , according to thomas ernst at bochum , these words have failed to turn into real actions .
there has been little progress in clubs ' understanding and tackling of those with mental illness .
" basically , in the businesses and in the processes , nothing has changed . "

with the spotlight on south korea , the government there has taken a number of steps to ensure the forum goes off without a hitch . south korea is in the grips of g20 fever.television ads play around the clock proclaiming korea ’ s readiness to host the summit .
banners hung around seoul urge residents to say hello and be extra courteous to the visiting foreigners .
the south korean government is taking preparations for the g20 very seriously .
it ’ s the largest international gathering the country has held since the 2002 world cup .
this week ’ s summit also marks the first time a non-g8 and asian nation has hosted the economic forum .
south korea proud to host g20 and considering that several decades ago , south korea was one of the world ’ s poorest nations , its quick rise to the top makes it a model for other nations to emulate , says un secretary general ban ki moon .
the former south korean foreign minister says he ’ s proud of his nation ’ s accomplishments that have been made in the light of its division and war with north korea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea has undertaken the largest-ever security operation he spoke during a press briefing today in seoul : " i think we meet at a critical moment , the spotlight is on korea and is the first g20 summit in an emerging market economy .
korea is a bridge between the developed and developing world .
this role has never been more necessary and important and so there is something very special about this g20 moment . "
activists protest against " unequal economic policies " but some opposed to the g20 are using this moment to raise attention what they call its flawed economic policies .
an umbrella organization representing 80 south korean labor and civic groups says the top economies have done little to help the world ’ s poor and offset global unemployment , which they say is the highest in years .
chun hyoung baek of the civic group people ’ s solidarity for participatory democracy delivered the activists ’ official statement .
she spoke through an interpreter : " we call upon the g20 to regulate financial capital , which have brought suffering to so many people .
we call on the g20 to tax speculators and use the revenues to expand welfare .
the g20 has revamped the international monetary fund whose structural adjustment programs have devastated the lives of people all around the world . "
and now as the g20 gets under way , korean and foreign activists are taking their message to the streets of seoul .
earlier this week , tens of thousands of protesters rallied against the g20 .
they were met by squads of korean riot police , who have been put on high alert ahead of the summit .
security tight in seoul some reports say the police used pepper spray to hold demonstrators back .
to keep protests like this under control and away from the g20 venues , seoul authorities have created a two kilometer buffer zone around the convention center .
it ’ s the largest security operation the nation has undertaken , according to the national police agency .
but south korea ’ s measures have only aggravated some protestors .
kim young hoon , president of the korean confederation of trade unions , says that president lee myung bak is denying their right to protest during the summit .
violence between trade unions and police has erupted in the past during anti free trade rallies .
police have been criticized for turning water cannons on protestors .
bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate in seoul to draw attention to global poverty issues and kim says that he can not ensure that his members won ’ t resort to violence again , if police prevent them from demonstrating : " excessive use of force to crack down on demonstrations and rallies , to crack down and oppress our rights , will induce or provoke the demonstrations to become violent , that nobody wants . "
south korean riot police are prepared to confront activist groups on thursday , the first day of the g20 summit , as protestors plan to march through the capital .

" the energy challenge is one of the greatest tests europe has to face , " oettinger said on wednesday at the presentation of the bloc 's energy strategy for the next 10 years . " putting our energy system onto a new , more sustainable and secure path may take time but ambitious decisions need to be taken now . " the energy chief said individual governments ' priorities in the 27-member bloc had limited european energy policy in the past , and that this must change . " to have an efficient , competitive and low-carbon economy we have to europeanize our energy policy and focus on a few , but pressing , priorities , " oettinger said . energy connections between member states tend to be scattered and inefficient , a hangover from pre-eu times when most national grids were the property of state-run monopolies . " failing to achieve a well-functioning european energy market will only increase the costs for consumers and put europe 's competitiveness at risk , " he added . ending energy isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : encouraging energy savings was another of the report 's priorities in the context of russia 's gas disputes with its neighbours in recent years – and their knock-on consequences for europe – oettinger indicated that security was another reason for integrating networks , so as to prevent states from becoming overly dependent upon a single energy provider . " by 2015 , no member state should be isolated , " a european commission statement said on wednesday . oettinger said the eu 's executive would propose legislation in five key areas in the coming 18 months , including energy efficiency measures for businesses and private housholds . it will also push eu member states to accept a deadline of 2015 to link up all 27 national energy markets . the eu as well as european countries will have to update the energy grid to allow for decentralized power generation and distribution , according to stefan gsaenger , secretary general of the world wind energy association . " up to 10 or 20 years ago in germany we had dozens of huge power stations , " he told deutsche welle .
" today there are hundreds of thousands of power generation units in solar systems and wind farms that are all over germany .
that completely changes the grid . " gsaenger said he expects generation of local , small-scale renewable energy generation to continue increasing as the eu member states strive reach their announced goal of collectively sourcing 20 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2020 , which implies about 35 percent of electricity . funding for electricity grid improvements will come from taxpayers and power companies . german chancellor angela merkel had said earlier that european members should ensure new energy projects are commercially viable .

" the energy challenge is one of the greatest tests europe has to face , " oettinger said on wednesday at the presentation of the bloc 's energy strategy for the next 10 years . " putting our energy system onto a new , more sustainable and secure path may take time but ambitious decisions need to be taken now . " the energy chief said individual governments ' priorities in the 27-member bloc had limited european energy policy in the past , and that this must change . " to have an efficient , competitive and low-carbon economy we have to europeanize our energy policy and focus on a few , but pressing , priorities , " oettinger said . energy connections between member states tend to be scattered and inefficient , a hangover from pre-eu times when most national grids were the property of state-run monopolies . " failing to achieve a well-functioning european energy market will only increase the costs for consumers and put europe 's competitiveness at risk , " he added . ending energy isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : encouraging energy savings was another of the report 's priorities in the context of russia 's gas disputes with its neighbours in recent years – and their knock-on consequences for europe – oettinger indicated that security was another reason for integrating networks , so as to prevent states from becoming overly dependent upon a single energy provider . " by 2015 , no member state should be isolated , " a european commission statement said on wednesday . oettinger said the eu 's executive would propose legislation in five key areas in the coming 18 months , including energy efficiency measures for businesses and private housholds . it will also push eu member states to accept a deadline of 2015 to link up all 27 national energy markets . the eu as well as european countries will have to update the energy grid to allow for decentralized power generation and distribution , according to stefan gsaenger , secretary general of the world wind energy association . " up to 10 or 20 years ago in germany we had dozens of huge power stations , " he told deutsche welle .
" today there are hundreds of thousands of power generation units in solar systems and wind farms that are all over germany .
that completely changes the grid . " gsaenger said he expects generation of local , small-scale renewable energy generation to continue increasing as the eu member states strive reach their announced goal of collectively sourcing 20 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2020 , which implies about 35 percent of electricity . funding for electricity grid improvements will come from taxpayers and power companies . german chancellor angela merkel had said earlier that european members should ensure new energy projects are commercially viable . " i see the main responsibility for the realization and financing of energy infrastructure as resting with business , " she was quoted by the euobserver as saying . author : sean sinico -lrb- dpa , afp , reuters -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his book is unlikely to help heal the rift that emerged between the us and europe while he was in office . the 43rd us president 's apparent mission to have his two terms in the white house reassessed and his reputation rehabilitated through his new book , " decision points , " has many europeans shaking their heads . and it 's not just the most inflammatory excerpts - such as bush 's assertion that water-boarding of terror suspects saved lives - that are causing an outcry . bush 's supporters in the us say that every president has the right to defend his record ; " decision points " shows the former president as a man who was ideologically consistent during his eight years in office . his detractors counter that the president 's mistakes and his determination to follow ill-thought-out policies - without a thought for a possible , rectifying change of direction - plunged the us into a decade of war and the worst financial crisis in over 80 years .
while george w. bush may have been a good guy with a difficult job , they say , he does n't deserve to be rehabilitated via his memoirs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush left office with two wars and an economic crisis raging if bush 's single-minded and heavy-handed approach to afghanistan and iraq in the wake of the terror attacks of 9/11 were damaging to his relations with his european allies at the time , his newly released memoirs appear to be giving european readers the chance get angry all over again . europeans , even allies , dismissed as irrelevant " in my opinion , there ’ s been no change in perception of bush in europe , " dr. henning meyer , a transatlantic relations expert at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle . " his legacy projects , such as iraq and afghanistan , are still the main issues associated with his presidency and of course europeans are still affected by these and in most cases are still in opposition to a certain degree .
if you remember , bush ’ s war on terror effectively split europe .
so these things have not been forgotten . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush says the uk 's perception of him does n't matter in " decision points , " bush is dismissive about those europeans who had taken a risk to follow him into war in iraq , and he talks frankly about his reputation in the one country whose leaders followed him most obediently of all : england .
" it does n't matter how people perceive me in england , " he writes .
" it just does n't matter any more .
and frankly , at times , it did n't matter then . " in a veiled dig at what he saw at the time as the rest of europe 's lack of stomach for the fight , bush writes : " people in europe said : ' ah , man , he 's a religious fanatic , cowboy , simpleton . '
all that stuff ...
if you believe that freedom is universal , then you should n't be surprised when people take courageous measures to live in a free society . " he reserves his most scathing treatment for those european leaders who disappointed him most , especially during the iraq war : former german chancellor gerhard schroeder comes in for even worse treatment than former french president jacques chirac , schroeder 's ally in the european anti-war opposition . german emotions still raw over bush 's rush to war in the book , bush accuses schroeder of abusing his trust after allegedly telling the president in 2002 , before the invasion of iraq the following year , that " what goes for afghanistan also goes for iraq .
nations which support terrorism must accept the consequences .
if you go forward fast and resolutely , i am on your side . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush did n't trust schroeder after the latter withdrew his support however , struggling in his re-election campaign in the fall of that year , schroeder hitched his wagon to the huge swell of anti-war feeling in germany and across europe .
he claims bush is lying when he says that he had offered his support for an invasion , and that he 'd made it clear all along that his support was conditional on whether iraq really had weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- . " schroeder 's support -lrb- for the invasion of iraq -rrb- was conditional on evidence being found of terrorists being harbored in iraq , so when there was no evidence delivered , he withdrew his support , " lse professor meyer told deutsche welle .
" bush is attempting to polish his own picture of this situation with the germans by saying that the breakdown in relations was not his fault and that it was schroeder who turned opinion against him . " the bush legacy is still powerfully felt in the united states : the armed forces are embroiled in the two wars he started ; the financial system is struggling to pull out of an overwhelming crisis , and politicians are scrambling to rebuild their credibility on the world stage . but the ripples from his eight-year presidency continue to be felt in europe as well .
under his leadership , decades of trust and cooperation between the us and european governments was damaged . according to thomas klau , a transatlantic relations expert at the european council for foreign relations , the memoir provides new fodder for europeans who are skeptical about the us political system . " europeans , and germans in particular , are still amazed that the us political system has the potential to elect such an incompetent leader who has no respect for western values , " klau said .
" while obama gave some hope , the germans are now saddened to see that a discredited party such as the republicans can be re-elected as the majority in the house of representatives . " germans see the republican mid-term victory as proof that " the us system and electorate has a very short memory and very little wisdom . " european anger reignited over torture statements so far , european reaction to the bush memoirs has been heavily affected by comments in the book that seem to advocate torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims water boarding extracted vital information for meyer , the water-boarding comments are " a very clear example of the philosophical differences between the bush administration and the europeans . " " there is a huge difference in what bush thought was acceptable in terms of the war on terror and what the europeans thought , " he added .
" bush saw approaches such as water-boarding as not a breaking of any laws but a legitimate bending of them . " moreover , bush " made bold statements " that the information gained from water-boarding stopped an attack on london - a claim the uk refutes . " most people in europe say that there were other ways of getting the information and that bush ’ s assertions are just not true , " meyer said . severe - and lasting - damage ? the response to his memoirs suggests that the damage bush did to his country 's reputation in europe remains severe . " bush 's was the worst us presidency that europe and the world has ever seen and his legacy , in political and economic terms , will be seen as one of disaster , " said klau .
" few people will expect to see any change in this perception arising from his memoirs .
in fact , it 's highly likely that his already terrible reputation in europe will take an even worse turn . " bush may have come out with his book to try and put the record straight in his own words .

major powers are likely to disagree on currency policy and plans to end exceptional economic stimulus measures . chancellor angela merkel called on world powers to coordinate plans for weaning their national economies off economic stimulus measures , and warned against creating new asset bubbles .
" there will of course be a discussion about exit strategies , " merkel told reporters before flying to seoul for the meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- top rich and emerging nations .
" it is naturally desirable that the leading economic powers do not come up with answers which are too varied to the question as to when the exit strategy should begin , " she said .
" this could be a thoroughly lively debate . "
defusing the dollar asked about the united states ' policy of " quantitative easing , " which has seen the federal reserve pump 600 billion dollars into its fragile economy , merkel said : " we are going to discuss this issue with the americans in a spirit of partnership . "
" nobody has an interest in creating new bubbles .
rather , we must see to it that growth in the global economy this year is more sustainable and enduring than we had a few years ago , " she said .
critics argue that the fed 's quantitative easing amounts to an effective dollar devaluation , and has the potential to trigger a 1930s-style trade war if other countries respond in kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is accused of weakening its currency to promote economic growth with this in mind , merkel also pressed her fellow leaders to avoid any form of protectionism , amid criticism that certain countries , notably china and japan , are keeping their currencies artificially low to encourage exports .
but she declined to criticize beijing for its foreign exchange policy , saying : " i assume that china has a very strong interest in sending a positive signal from this summit . "
" china also needs sustainable growth for its overall economic situation , " the chancellor added .
germany is the world 's second-biggest exporter after china .
its strong export sector has helped it stage an impressive economic comeback this year , but its trade surpluses have also drawn criticism abroad .
no fixed numbers merkel said germany would not accept fixed targets for addressing countries ' trade gaps .
" we reject quantified bandwidths for acceptable imbalances for good reason because ... competitiveness must be able to express itself , also in export ratios . "
merkel said germany wants to see leaders commit themselves to the final stretch of the doha round of global trade talks .
she added that trade barriers posed the biggest danger to sustained world growth .
" the biggest danger for sustainable growth is currently coming from protectionism in its different forms , " she said .

major powers are likely to disagree on currency policy and plans to end exceptional economic stimulus measures . chancellor angela merkel called on world powers to coordinate plans for weaning their national economies off economic stimulus measures , and warned against creating new asset bubbles .
" there will of course be a discussion about exit strategies , " merkel told reporters before flying to seoul for the meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- top rich and emerging nations .
" it is naturally desirable that the leading economic powers do not come up with answers which are too varied to the question as to when the exit strategy should begin , " she said .
" this could be a thoroughly lively debate . "
defusing the dollar asked about the united states ' policy of " quantitative easing , " which has seen the federal reserve pump 600 billion dollars into its fragile economy , merkel said : " we are going to discuss this issue with the americans in a spirit of partnership . "
" nobody has an interest in creating new bubbles .
rather , we must see to it that growth in the global economy this year is more sustainable and enduring than we had a few years ago , " she said .
critics argue that the fed 's quantitative easing amounts to an effective dollar devaluation , and has the potential to trigger a 1930s-style trade war if other countries respond in kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is accused of weakening its currency to promote economic growth with this in mind , merkel also pressed her fellow leaders to avoid any form of protectionism , amid criticism that certain countries , notably china and japan , are keeping their currencies artificially low to encourage exports .
but she declined to criticize beijing for its foreign exchange policy , saying : " i assume that china has a very strong interest in sending a positive signal from this summit . "
" china also needs sustainable growth for its overall economic situation , " the chancellor added .
germany is the world 's second-biggest exporter after china .
its strong export sector has helped it stage an impressive economic comeback this year , but its trade surpluses have also drawn criticism abroad .
no fixed numbers merkel said germany would not accept fixed targets for addressing countries ' trade gaps .
" we reject quantified bandwidths for acceptable imbalances for good reason because ... competitiveness must be able to express itself , also in export ratios . "
merkel said germany wants to see leaders commit themselves to the final stretch of the doha round of global trade talks .
she added that trade barriers posed the biggest danger to sustained world growth .
" the biggest danger for sustainable growth is currently coming from protectionism in its different forms , " she said .

lidl has come under particular fire over pay and practices . supermarkets across germany are popular places to buy clothes .
prices are cheap : you can buy a men 's shirt for seven euros -lrb- nine us dollars -rrb- or a pair of women 's trousers for under 10 euros .
however two women from bangladesh are currently on a speaking tour of germany to highlight how these cheap prices come at a human cost .
26-year-old jessmin begum and 36-year-old arifa akter both work as seamstresses in clothes factories in dhaka that make clothes for european stores .
they say the working conditions are terrible and the pay is inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers complain about cramped conditions , dirty water and tough bosses " i 'm proud of my work , especially when i see people here wearing my clothes , " said begum , who works for a factory that supplies clothes to german-based supermarket chain lidl .
" but it makes me mad that what we get for our work in bangladesh is nothing . "
not a living wage as a seamstress , jessmin begum earns around 35 euros a month -lrb- just under 4,000 bangladesh taka -rrb- .
the monthly rent for a one room apartment in dhaka is around 25 euros a month .
" it is not even close to the living wage we have calculated , " said khorshed alam from the campaigning group alternative movement for resources and freedom society -lrb- amrf -rrb- .
with calculations based on someone working a 12- to 14-hour day , the amrf estimates around 5,000 taka a month -lrb- 52 euros -rrb- is necessary for a single worker .
a family needs to earn around 9-10,000 taka .
dirty water , mean bosses , unpaid overtime the two seamstresses are using their tour of germany to highlight how bad working conditions are in the factories .
" the drinking water is dirty and we are packed in with little space between the machines , " said begum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessmin begum has been working as a seamstress in dhaka for eight years " our supervisors insult us and put us under pressure to work harder .
almost every day i do overtime and i hardly ever come home much earlier than midnight , " she added .
the workers have no sick pay or other benefits , so most seamstresses continue to work even when ill .
highlighting the problem jessmin and arifa 's tour of germany was organized by the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- , which campaigns worldwide to promote better working conditions and fair wages .
the ccc wants international corporations to stick to their pledges to provide better labor conditions .
" for years companies have been saying they are willing to meet certain standards , but it 's only on paper , not in actions , " said the ccc 's gisela burckhardt .
" we want a proper legal framework so that companies can see the impact of their activities on the environment and people in other countries , " burckhardt argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this dhaka garment factory was visited by the ccc in 2009 khorshed alam from the amrf added that it is also the responsibility of the bangladeshi government to monitor the brands which manufacture clothes in the country , and to ensure they implement local labor laws .
making consumers aware in addition to putting pressure on manufacturers and local governments , the tour aims to give consumers more awareness of the origin of their cheap shirts and trousers .
" i came here because the people who buy our products have no idea where they came from , or how much we suffer , " said begum .
the amrf want consumers to question companies like lidl who sell cheap clothes , while claiming they pay their workers well .
in response to the claims , a spokesperson for lidl said they completely oppose any form of child labor and violations of workers ' rights .
they also added that lidl was the first german discount store to join the business social compliance initiative which works to improve working conditions in supply networks worldwide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 10.11.2010 security flaw discovered in german digital id card software großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new electronic id card was released on november 1 one day after its release , the software used to read new german id cards is shown to be vulnerable to attack .
the federal office for information security has removed links to the program from its website . jan schejbal , a german computer security researcher living in sweden , on tuesday described a way to hack the new electronic german id card software .
the federal office responsible for the program stopped allowing the software to be downloaded on wednesday . the new cards , which became available november 1 and will gradually replace current german cards , contain an rfid wireless chip - the same kind found in many contactless security or payment keycards .
the chip stores digital versions of the card holder 's photo , name , address , date of birth , height , eye and hair color and location of issuance . the interior ministry and the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- have claimed the cards will help the government provide easy-to-use digital signatures and other government services , as well as protection against online scams and phishing attacks .
germans can also use the ids in place of a passport when traveling within the european union . spoofing the server but to be useful to individuals , the digital information on the cards needs to be accessed with a card reader .
it 's the ausweisapp -lrb- " id app " -rrb- software that runs the card reader which is flawed , according to schejbal . after downloading the first version of ausweisapp from a german government website , he noticed a major flaw when the program checks for updates .
the software does not verify the origin of a digital security -lrb- ssl -rrb- certificate , which leaves the program open to a spoof attack that conceivably could lead to the download of malicious software . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia has had digital id cards for eight years " the electronic id itself may have quite a high security level , " said schejbal in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" however , this security becomes worthless if the framework which is used to access this secure core is insecure and allows compromising overall security . " had the new electronic id card already been widely used , the security flaw in updating would have been significant , according to karsten nohl , an independent security expert based in berlin . " fortunately , that is not the case and the bug can be fixed swiftly , " he told deutsche welle .
" this vulnerability is another reminder of the complexity of the id card security system , not all of which has been tested rigorously . " in a statement to the german tech news website heise.de , the bsi said it was looking into the update issue .
it also removed the software from its website to prevent more people from downloading the flawed program . " the media has been made aware of a perceived vulnerability in the software ausweisapp necessary for the eid feature of the new id card , " it wrote .
bsi did not reply to deutsche welle 's request for comment .
" if a vulnerability exists in the software , the bsi will provide a new version of the software without delay and will inform the public accordingly . " digital id cards expanding across europe digital ids have been spreading across the continent in recent years .
estonia has had one for nearly a decade , with a slew of electronic government services , and legally binding digital signatures to go along with it .
belgium , sweden , spain , portugal all currently have electronic id cards , and there are plans in place to release such cards in luxembourg and the czech republic . while schejbal added that he is not opposed to the concept of an electronic id , he advised germans to avoid the cards for as long as possible . " it is not secure , and it will put the user at risk , " he wrote .
" if the electronic identity is abused , the user will have a hard time proving that he did not authorize a transaction . " previous flaws have been discovered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital id cards have a corresponding reader when used with a computer schejbal 's discovery is n't the first time security flaws were found in the new electronic id cards .
in september , the german hacker collective the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- demonstrated how the card reader 's security measures could be circumvented . after obtaining an id card 's pin number by using a program that records individual keystrokes , the hackers were able to rewrite all the information on the id .
card readers come in a variety of models , and the ccc circumvented the most basic model . security researchers have doubts manuel bach , the electronic id project manager at the bsi , responded by saying that germans must take responsibility for their own computer security and ensure their computers remain free of the malicious software needed to steal pins and other personal data . " the germany id card ca n't protect you from trojan horses , it 's just a piece of plastic with a microchip inside , " he told deutsche welle in an interview last month .
" you as a citizen or computer user have a responsibility to secure your system .
if you do that you 're very safe , even with a basic card reader . " but constanze kurz , a ccc spokeswoman , said the government should n't expect all germans to be tech whizzes . " if you pretend that all your citizens are really good with computers , and that they can manage their own it security on their systems , then you are definitely wrong , " she said in an interview with deutsche welle .

the software does not verify the origin of a digital security -lrb- ssl -rrb- certificate , which leaves the program open to a spoof attack that conceivably could lead to the download of malicious software . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia has had digital id cards for eight years " the electronic id itself may have quite a high security level , " said schejbal in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" however , this security becomes worthless if the framework which is used to access this secure core is insecure and allows compromising overall security . " had the new electronic id card already been widely used , the security flaw in updating would have been significant , according to karsten nohl , an independent security expert based in berlin . " fortunately , that is not the case and the bug can be fixed swiftly , " he told deutsche welle .
" this vulnerability is another reminder of the complexity of the id card security system , not all of which has been tested rigorously . " in a statement to the german tech news website heise.de , the bsi said it was looking into the update issue .
it also removed the software from its website to prevent more people from downloading the flawed program . " the media has been made aware of a perceived vulnerability in the software ausweisapp necessary for the eid feature of the new id card , " it wrote .
bsi did not reply to deutsche welle 's request for comment .
" if a vulnerability exists in the software , the bsi will provide a new version of the software without delay and will inform the public accordingly . " digital id cards expanding across europe digital ids have been spreading across the continent in recent years .
estonia has had one for nearly a decade , with a slew of electronic government services , and legally binding digital signatures to go along with it .
belgium , sweden , spain , portugal all currently have electronic id cards , and there are plans in place to release such cards in luxembourg and the czech republic . while schejbal added that he is not opposed to the concept of an electronic id , he advised germans to avoid the cards for as long as possible . " it is not secure , and it will put the user at risk , " he wrote .
" if the electronic identity is abused , the user will have a hard time proving that he did not authorize a transaction . " previous flaws have been discovered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital id cards have a corresponding reader when used with a computer schejbal 's discovery is n't the first time security flaws were found in the new electronic id cards .
in september , the german hacker collective the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- demonstrated how the card reader 's security measures could be circumvented . after obtaining an id card 's pin number by using a program that records individual keystrokes , the hackers were able to rewrite all the information on the id .
card readers come in a variety of models , and the ccc circumvented the most basic model . security researchers have doubts manuel bach , the electronic id project manager at the bsi , responded by saying that germans must take responsibility for their own computer security and ensure their computers remain free of the malicious software needed to steal pins and other personal data . " the germany id card ca n't protect you from trojan horses , it 's just a piece of plastic with a microchip inside , " he told deutsche welle in an interview last month .
" you as a citizen or computer user have a responsibility to secure your system .
if you do that you 're very safe , even with a basic card reader . " but constanze kurz , a ccc spokeswoman , said the government should n't expect all germans to be tech whizzes . " if you pretend that all your citizens are really good with computers , and that they can manage their own it security on their systems , then you are definitely wrong , " she said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the hackers will always attack the weakest point and the weakest point is the user . " author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many eu politicians have a guilty conscience over keeping ankara waiting .
but that 's a poor basis for making decisions , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . many eu politicians have a guilty conscience .
they do n't know how to deal with ankara ’ s hopes for speedy progress in the country 's bid for eu membership .
turkey is after all an official membership candidate and is trying to implement the reforms that brussels is calling for .
and from ankara 's perspective , this should eventually lead to full membership once the eu 's demands have been met .
so far , all previous membership candidates have eventually become full members .
but it 's clear that a guilty conscience alone is a poor basis for granting membership .
many european governments today regret that they – or their predecessors – have in past years given the green light for membership talks with turkey .
the doubts within the eu about whether turkey is fit for membership have since then only increased , and the arguments against membership have not changed .
they are not about individual points of criticism – be it cyprus or freedom of expression – but they are , in fact of a more fundamental nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations will continue to improve , but there wo n't be full membership , says hasselbach for instance , the eu still struggles with the consequences of its two previous expansion rounds in 2004 and 2007 .
and even if past expansion was not a mistake – the new members have significantly changed the european union .
the bloc 's ability to speak with one voice seems to be faltering – simply because the member states are too diverse and different .
these changes have to sink in and this process is bound to take time .
accepting turkey with its different history and tradition would from today 's perspective lead to a final stop to european integration .
has anyone ever thought of the fact that turkey would soon surpass germany as the most populous eu member state ?
turkey as a member would therefore have the right to demand more official posts than any of the other countries .
this would change the eu to an extent likely to cause sharp opposition .
and no one can guarantee that turkey will remain a secular state for good .
none of this calls into question the fact that the eu needs turkey and that turkey needs the eu .
the good trade relations and security cooperation should be built upon .
both sides are certain to do this for their very own interests .
and turkey is likely to continue its reform path even without the prospect of eu membership .
that 's why it ’ s wrong to argue that without membership talks , ankara will abandon reforms and look for other partners .
both sides need to look at the current situation .
it 's not a question of all or nothing .
and the eu should be honest with ankara that at the end of the path will be a closer relationship than today – but no full membership .

in a press release , the icfr said there was widespread fear in the sector that the g20 could " fail to make progress on its goals , as domestic considerations move back center-stage . "
it urged leaders to agree on financial reforms most likely improve economic stability and achieve international implementation . " we are calling on the g20 to prioritize more effective cross-border coordination by supervisors , and for agreement on the way forward on crisis resolution to allow for the orderly wind-down of complex banks , " barbara ridpath , ceo of the watchdog said in a statement .
" time for unity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki moon has urged leaders to find common ground the icfr calls were echoed by united nations secretary general ban ki-moon , who is in the south korean capital for the international summit .
on the eve of the meeting , he expressed concern over national differences of opinion on global rebalancing and currency policies .
" the global economic recovery remains fragile .
64 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty this year , " ban said , adding that this was a time for unity .
he said the world could not afford to think narrowly about development and economic growth , and that " all countries and all peoples have a stake in the management of the global economy . "
on the agenda leaders at the seoul g20 summit , the first to be held in an emerging market economy , are expected to sign off on the basel iii agreement , which is designed to tighten global capital and liquidity requirements for banks from 2013 onwards . bildunterschrift : the summit is being watched closely by managers in frankfurt 's banking towers drafted by the basel committee of central bankers and regulators back in september , the package is considered a significant step down the path towards financial stability .
it also tipped by observers to be one of the few items on the regulation agenda that is likely to receive broad support in seoul .
the only other real progress the talks are expected to yield is the endorsement of a series of agreements aimed at tightening supervision of the derivatives market and ensuring the standardization of contracts to facilitate central clearing processes and trading on exchanges .
safety nets on the issue of " too big to fail " banks , analysts are expecting little movement .
the financial stability board -lrb- fsb -rrb- , which is responsible for the implementation of g20 regulatory pledges , is expected to lay out a set of recommendations on " systemically important financial institutions , " otherwise known as sifis , involving the largest 20 or so global banks .
under the terms of the proposals , regulators would be required to make sure that sifis , the list of which is yet to be finalized , prepare living wills outlining how , if necessary , they could be wound up without causing major upset on the markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsbc is likely to feature on the list of global banks deemed too big to fail g20 members have not , as yet , been able to agree on many of the details of sifis , but there is speculation that the list will not include big asian banks .
their business is conducted primarily in domestic markets .
they therefore pose little threat to the wider world if they go under .
ratings , commodities and accounting summit delegates are , however , tipped to rubber-stamp fsb proposals for reducing market reliance on rating agencies .
if they do green-light the suggestion , they will have to find alternative ways of assessing creditworthiness .
regulators say the move would reduce what is known as the cliff effect , which contributes to market destabilization .
in the name of yet greater stability , the group of 20 wealthy and emerging nations is also calling for more transparency in commodity markets .
this week , regulators ruled a major overhaul , but they did concede more pricing information was needed from physical commodity markets .
there is little hope of movement on the establishment of a single set of global accounting standards .
the june 2011 deadline is likely to be overshot due to differences between the g20 member states , but analysts say the summit could be an opportunity to push for resolution .

among those to go is the long-standing ceo of db 's long-distance travel unit . nikolaus breuel was responsible for deutsche bahn 's main-line routes long before 1999 , when the ' db fernverkehr ' subsidiary was founded as part of the db privatization process .
and he has been in charge ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolaus breuel is expected to lose his job but that now looks set to change .
members of db 's body of governors told the dpa news agency on tuesday that a non-scheduled board meeting had been called for friday to discuss personnel issues .
there has been significant speculation over the past weeks that ulrich homburg , managing director of db mobility and logistics , which oversees the long-distance division , is unhappy with breuel 's handling of a string of glitches to hit high-speed ice trains over the past couple of years .
the first major problem arose in 2008 when a broken axel highlighted a necessity for more frequent maintenance checks .
this led to a reduction in the number of reserve trains available on the network and saw service reliability drop as a result .
winter travelers have had to put up with regular delays and cancellations .
bildunterschrift : the heat was too much for too many passengers poor management public outrage reached a peak this summer when air conditioning in several high-speed trains failed and thousands of passengers had to be paid compensation .
in one incident , db customers were stranded for three hours in a tunnel when their train broke down in sweltering temperatures .
several passengers had to be taken to hospital . the combination of events has done nothing to enhance deutsche bahn 's image , and breuel , once pipped as a possible successor to the former ceo of the deutsche bahn group hartmut mehdorn , now looks set to take the rap .

among those to go is the long-standing ceo of db 's long-distance travel unit . nikolaus breuel was responsible for deutsche bahn 's main-line routes long before 1999 , when the ' db fernverkehr ' subsidiary was founded as part of the db privatization process .
and he has been in charge ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolaus breuel is expected to lose his job but that now looks set to change .
members of db 's body of governors told the dpa news agency on tuesday that a non-scheduled board meeting had been called for friday to discuss personnel issues .
there has been significant speculation over the past weeks that ulrich homburg , managing director of db mobility and logistics , which oversees the long-distance division , is unhappy with breuel 's handling of a string of glitches to hit high-speed ice trains over the past couple of years .
the first major problem arose in 2008 when a broken axel highlighted a necessity for more frequent maintenance checks .
this led to a reduction in the number of reserve trains available on the network and saw service reliability drop as a result .
winter travelers have had to put up with regular delays and cancellations .
bildunterschrift : the heat was too much for too many passengers poor management public outrage reached a peak this summer when air conditioning in several high-speed trains failed and thousands of passengers had to be paid compensation .
in one incident , db customers were stranded for three hours in a tunnel when their train broke down in sweltering temperatures .
several passengers had to be taken to hospital . the combination of events has done nothing to enhance deutsche bahn 's image , and breuel , once pipped as a possible successor to the former ceo of the deutsche bahn group hartmut mehdorn , now looks set to take the rap .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 10.11.2010 german economic sages point to increased growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang franz and his team of ' wise men ' have n't delivered such good news for some time the german government 's team of five economic ' wise men ' have predicted consistent economic growth , lower unemployment , and reduced budget deficits for 2010 and 2011 .
however , they have warned against sudden tax cuts . the german council of economic experts predicted on wednesday that germany 's economy will grow by 3.7 percent in 2010 , and by 2.2 percent in 2011 - a prognosis that even exceeds the latest official estimates from chancellor angela merkel 's government .
" the pleasing upward trend in the german economy offers the chance for a stable , if relatively flat , path of growth , " the council 's chairman , wolfgang franz said .
" also , the government is in a position to considerably bolster these chances with solid economic policies . "
increased consumption , investments and demand for german exports are fuelling the recovery , and should lead to reduced levels of unemployment and state borrowing , the experts said .
however , they also cautioned that a repeat of germany 's so-called economic miracle in the post-war era was not on the cards .
the council , often referred to as the five wise men of the economy -lrb- in fact , one is a woman -rrb- , was set up in 1963 to advise the government on economic policy . " i think we are all delighted that the situation this year looks a lot more optimistic than last year , " chancellor angela merkel said on receiving the report , promising to continue with governent plans to save money .
" we are well aware that the structure of our current budget - designed as a response to the recent crisis with over 50 percent of spending going towards social security - is not a sustainable model for the future , especially considering our ageing population . "
taxation and borrowing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government says reducing borrowing still takes priority over tax cuts the chairman of the expert panel , wolfgang franz , told chancellor merkel that her government could support the fragile growth by issuing stricter regulations on the global financial sector and continuing to consolidate german overspending .
he also issued two warnings to governments , employers , and trade unions - advising against " rash cuts in taxes " and " excessive increases in wages . "
tax cuts were a major campaign platform of merkel 's pro-business coalition partners , the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , and the party - which is struggling in the polls - is keen that they are introduced sooner rather than later .
economic minister rainer bruederle , a member of the fdp , told german public television on wednesday that his party would be patient before cutting taxes , but the cuts would come .
" not today , but soon .
because if the economy really does grow as predicted , then - after implementing the measures to balance the budget that we have made priority number one - there might be a bit of lee-way for some slight cuts in the middle-bracket . "
bruederle said .
" but , as our coalition keeps saying , we must reduce the budget deficit as a short-term priority , and then think about taxation in the medium term . "
bruederle said that the government might be in a position to start the process by 2012 - especially in light of the panel 's prediction that germany might dip below the prescribed eu budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 .
but the economists see this matter very differently , arguing that there will be no room for tax cuts during the current legislative period -lrb- which ends in 2013 -rrb- , and saying it may not even be possible early in the next one .
instead , the group suggested that berlin might be forced to raise taxes slightly in order to meet its target of cutting 80 billion euros in spending between 2010 and 2014 .
job market to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to target germany 's unemployment problem the german economic experts also predicted reduced joblessness for 2011 , with germany set to dip below 3 million unemployed next year .
earlier in the week , buoyed by the prospect of good news from her experts , chancellor merkel told the focus news magazine that full employment was a major goal for her government .
" i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " she said .
" we must , and can , get these people back to work . "
however , the cologne-based institute for economic research predicts that a rate of around 5 percent unemployment , meaning roughly 2 million germans out of work , would be a more realistic goal in the foreseeable future .
" at that point the structural issues behind joblessness start to become a problem , " the institute 's president michael huether explained .
" things like a lack of qualifications , the unsuitability of candidates for the jobs on offer , and vice versa . "
economic envy in the english press germany is leading eu member states as the bloc struggles to emerge from recession - something which has caused the british media to take note in recent weeks .
as britain 's coalition government , elected earlier this year , looks to introduce tough spending cuts and jumpstart the faltering economy , more and more media outlets are reevaluating the merits of the relatively export-heavy , frugal economic policies which germans call " rhineland capitalism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's new leadership duo are making drastic cuts for little reward " a decade ago we considered the german economy a write-off .
now -lrb- prime minister -rrb- david cameron looks to angela merkel for inspiration , " a columnist at the left-leaning guardian newspaper , david gow , wrote in a recent commentary .
germany only partially followed the anglo-american movement towards dependence on the financial and services sectors in the latter half of the 20th century , preferring to maintain some industrial output and favoring a relatively cautious banking community .
the decision was often derided as backward , and even harmful to less cautious western neighbors , but now british commentators are asking whether the same caution has proved the key to a relatively swift recovery .
even the conservative newspaper , the times , has recently turned against the higher-risk capitalism favored in the english-speaking world , suggesting that germany 's export-heavy model is " leaving britain behind . "
yet there are other voices in the uk , like london-based financial analysts lombard street research , who point to decreasing demand in china and continued economic problems in the us and much of southern europe , suggesting that this could mean that germany 's export-driven recovery might falter in the near future .

"
this season , the globe theatre pays homage to this special relationship . blasphemous as it might seem at first glance , the globe theatre 's current program serves to highlight a rather special bond between the world 's most famous writer and a whole country . " what i am discovering more and more is how deeply -lsb- shakespeare -rsb- entered into the german psyche from the 18th century on , " said patrick spottiswoode , education director for the globe theatre and curator of the season . and shakespeare 's german connection has strong credentials .
for starters , there are more performances of shakespeare in germany in any given year than in england .
german was the first language shakespeare was ever translated into ; and the first shakespeare society in the world was founded in germany . " the germans in the 18th and 19th century regarded him as ' ganz unser ' - entirely ours , " added spottiswoode . translating frenzy the notion of " ownership " over shakespeare was propagated by a wealth of translations that began to appear as early as 1766 - 150 years after his death - with christoph martin wieland 's prose translation of 22 of the bard 's plays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hamlet , said ferdinand freiligrath " to translate the whole works of shakespeare is quite a task ” , said spottiswoode , " and there were successive translations of the entire works in the 18th and 19th centuries .

the case involves airlines that fly around the globe , from air france-klm , to british airways and quantas . the european union 's competition watchdog issued fines tuesday to 11 airlines totaling 799.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- for running a global cargo cartel .
the cargo carriers were found to have coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security over a six-year period , between 1999 and 2006 .
" with today 's decision , the european commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate cartel behavior , " eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia told reporters in brussels .

other airlines involved in the cartel and slapped with fines were singapore airlines , air canada , quantas , lan chile , martinair and japan airlines .
the commission said it dropped charges against eleven other airlines , including german carrier lufthansa and its subsidiary swiss air , because it was the first to provide information about the cartel .
according to the commission the cartel the airlines began fixing fuel-surcharges in 1999 .
later the cooperation expanded with the introduction of a security surcharge and refused to pay a commission on those surcharges to their clients .
" by refusing to pay a commission , the airlines ensured that surcharges did not become subject to competition through the granting of discounts to customers .

schools in the czech republic - and in many other european countries – still maintain a system of de facto segregation for members of the roma minority , according to the errc .
" we did n't necessarily have the smoking gun of the teacher or a school administrator saying we 're putting you in these schools because you 're roma , but the numbers speak for themselves , " errc executive director robert kushen told reporters .
the european court of human rights ruled in november 2007 that 18 czech roma children had been discriminated against by being sent wrongly to special schools .
no changes so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de facto segregation also exists in greece , croatia and slovakia " the number of romani children in special education in the czech republic at that time and today was out of all proportion to the number of romani children in the population , " kushen added .
the czech government itself undertook studies after the court decision which confirm that something like 27 percent of romani children are in special education compared to 2.2 percent of non-romani children being in special education .
the only real change since the 2007 court ruling , says the center , is that such schools have been renamed ' practical ' schools by the authorities .
behind their doors , however , the overwhelmingly roma pupils still follow an academically inferior curriculum , condemning them to a life of limited further education , bleak employment prospects and deeper social exclusion .
similar situation across south-east europe but the czech republic is not alone – the center has since won a similar court case against croatia , and contributed towards another case in greece that was brought by the greek helsinki monitor .
both verdicts found that de facto segregation exists in those countries too .
in neighboring slovakia , for instance , a recent study showed 60 percent of special school pupils were roma .
stanislav daniel , a university-educated academic researcher working for the errc , said he himself had narrowly escaped being shunted off to a special school as a child in communist czechoslovakia .
" interestingly , i was also placed into a class at a mainstream school .
in the first year , i was placed in a class with all the romani children , and this class was for the children where there was a risk they would be placed into special school .
and this took place at the time when i was able to read and write .
my father , for some reason that i will never understand , taught me to read and write before i went to school . "
the european roma rights center says far from addressing the problem head on since the verdict , the new czech government actually seems to be backsliding on the little progress already made .
tuesday 's briefing was held ahead of a meeting of the commission of ministers later in november , who meet regularly to discuss whether european court of human rights recommendations are being implemented .
in this case , says the errc , it 's clear they 're not .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de brands -pipe- 10.11.2010 adidas vows to outperform rival nike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas aims to escape nike 's shadow in the united states adidas has trailed nike in the sportswear market for years .
now the german company says it 's in a position to outgrow its us rival and dominate the market by 2015 .
consumers in the united states are central to its plans . after weathering a difficult year in 2009 and pinning its hopes on the 2010 world cup in south africa , german sporting goods company adidas has surged ahead in profits and now says it wants to outperform leading rival nike .
adidas wants to grow faster than nike through 2015 and increase its turnover by 45-50 percent to 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.4 billion -rrb- .
" we 're hoping this faster rate of growth will let us lay a foundation to be the market leader at a later point in time , " an adidas spokeswoman told deutsche welle .
nike , however , is moving forward with goals of its own .
it hopes to generate 19.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- in revenue by 2015 .
in the first nine months of 2010 , adidas primarily grew in the united states , china and russia , according to the company 's spokeswoman .
most of the growth was generated in the sports style , fashion and lifestyle sectors , as well as the reebok brand , which it bought in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa world cup gave adidas a major sales boost adidas maintains a consistent marketing budget of 13 to 14 percent of its overall turnover.the bavarian-based company now plans to market new clothing designs for teenagers every two weeks .
it also plans to aggressively pursue the young customers on the internet using social networking .
us market vital according to matt powell , an analyst at sportsonesource - a research and data firm based in charlotte , north carolina - the key market for both adidas and nike is the united states .
" the us does about half of the athletic footwear and apparel business in the world , " he told deutsche welle .
" so you 've got the us versus the rest of the world , if you will .
now you 've got some markets – especially china – which are growing very quickly .
but that pales in comparison to the us . "
powell also said that both adidas and reebok had been losing market share in footwear " until very recently . "
" i really think that part of why adidas has struggled in the us is because they really do n't have a clear understanding of what the us consumer wants , " he said . " -lrb- but -rrb- i think they 're doing a much better job today than they were five years ago . "
what the us consumer really wants is fashion , powell said , adding that most athletic footwear " is n't used for sports . "
growth in north america and china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is also a rapidly growing market for adidas and nike some of the highlights of adidas ' quarterly exchange-rate-adjusted figures include a 10 percent increase in turnover for the adidas brand , and a 14 percent increase for the reebok brand .
the company 's overall third-quarter turnover increased in all regions , specifically 14 percent in north america and 9 percent in china .
powell said he believes there is a chance adidas could grow faster than nike in the next five years .
" historically the numbers would say it 's doable , but it 's a pretty steep hill to climb . "

now the german company says it 's in a position to outgrow its us rival and dominate the market by 2015 .
consumers in the united states are central to its plans . after weathering a difficult year in 2009 and pinning its hopes on the 2010 world cup in south africa , german sporting goods company adidas has surged ahead in profits and now says it wants to outperform leading rival nike .
adidas wants to grow faster than nike through 2015 and increase its turnover by 45-50 percent to 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.4 billion -rrb- .
" we 're hoping this faster rate of growth will let us lay a foundation to be the market leader at a later point in time , " an adidas spokeswoman told deutsche welle .
nike , however , is moving forward with goals of its own .
it hopes to generate 19.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- in revenue by 2015 .
in the first nine months of 2010 , adidas primarily grew in the united states , china and russia , according to the company 's spokeswoman .
most of the growth was generated in the sports style , fashion and lifestyle sectors , as well as the reebok brand , which it bought in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa world cup gave adidas a major sales boost adidas maintains a consistent marketing budget of 13 to 14 percent of its overall turnover.the bavarian-based company now plans to market new clothing designs for teenagers every two weeks .
it also plans to aggressively pursue the young customers on the internet using social networking .
us market vital according to matt powell , an analyst at sportsonesource - a research and data firm based in charlotte , north carolina - the key market for both adidas and nike is the united states .
" the us does about half of the athletic footwear and apparel business in the world , " he told deutsche welle .
" so you 've got the us versus the rest of the world , if you will .
now you 've got some markets – especially china – which are growing very quickly .
but that pales in comparison to the us . "
powell also said that both adidas and reebok had been losing market share in footwear " until very recently . "
" i really think that part of why adidas has struggled in the us is because they really do n't have a clear understanding of what the us consumer wants , " he said . " -lrb- but -rrb- i think they 're doing a much better job today than they were five years ago . "
what the us consumer really wants is fashion , powell said , adding that most athletic footwear " is n't used for sports . "
growth in north america and china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is also a rapidly growing market for adidas and nike some of the highlights of adidas ' quarterly exchange-rate-adjusted figures include a 10 percent increase in turnover for the adidas brand , and a 14 percent increase for the reebok brand .
the company 's overall third-quarter turnover increased in all regions , specifically 14 percent in north america and 9 percent in china .
powell said he believes there is a chance adidas could grow faster than nike in the next five years .
" historically the numbers would say it 's doable , but it 's a pretty steep hill to climb . "

sarkozy wasted no time in signing the bill on wednesday , just hours after the court ruling .
he said in a statement that while he heard the concerns expressed by opponents during the debate , it was his " duty " to ensure the pension fund 's integrity .
" with this law , our redistributive pension system has been saved , " he said .
" french citizens can now be assured that they can count on their retirement and that pension payments will be maintained . "
sarkozy 's right-of-center government insisted the reform , which raises the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the full retirement age from 65 to 67 , was necessary to fill a major budget gap as france 's population ages and few workers are paying into the system .
the law will gradually come into effect in july 2011 and will be fully enacted by 2018 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive strikes and protests against the reform disrupted society socialists vow a repeal opposition socialists and other parties asked the country 's highest court to examine the constitutionality of the law on november 2 , saying it contradicted france 's principles of equality .
the court rejected the challenge , but the socialists have vowed to repeal the law if they win the next presidential election in 2012 .
" the president is confusing appearance with reality , he thinks that by putting his head down and charging forward without listening , he 's showing courage , " said socialist leader martine aubry .
" it would have been courage to put in place a reform that really solves the problem of retirement . "
as the reform was in debate in the legislature , massive protests and nationwide strikes crippled the country 's transportation system and all but shut down the oil industry , leaving many gas stations without fuel for cars .
unions have called for another day of strikes on november 23 , but it was unclear how many would take part , as the public opposition to the bill was running out of steam toward the end of the debate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 10.11.2010 german economic sages point to increased growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang franz and his team of ' wise men ' have n't delivered such good news for some time the german government 's team of five economic ' wise men ' have predicted consistent economic growth , lower unemployment , and reduced budget deficits for 2010 and 2011 .
however , they have warned against sudden tax cuts . the german council of economic experts predicted on wednesday that germany 's economy will grow by 3.7 percent in 2010 , and by 2.2 percent in 2011 - a prognosis that even exceeds the latest official estimates from chancellor angela merkel 's government .
" the pleasing upward trend in the german economy offers the chance for a stable , if relatively flat , path of growth , " the council 's chairman , wolfgang franz said .
" also , the government is in a position to considerably bolster these chances with solid economic policies . "
increased consumption , investments and demand for german exports are fuelling the recovery , and should lead to reduced levels of unemployment and state borrowing , the experts said .
however , they also cautioned that a repeat of germany 's so-called economic miracle in the post-war era was not on the cards .
the council , often referred to as the five wise men of the economy -lrb- in fact , one is a woman -rrb- , was set up in 1963 to advise the government on economic policy . " i think we are all delighted that the situation this year looks a lot more optimistic than last year , " chancellor angela merkel said on receiving the report , promising to continue with governent plans to save money .
" we are well aware that the structure of our current budget - designed as a response to the recent crisis with over 50 percent of spending going towards social security - is not a sustainable model for the future , especially considering our ageing population . "
taxation and borrowing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government says reducing borrowing still takes priority over tax cuts the chairman of the expert panel , wolfgang franz , told chancellor merkel that her government could support the fragile growth by issuing stricter regulations on the global financial sector and continuing to consolidate german overspending .
he also issued two warnings to governments , employers , and trade unions - advising against " rash cuts in taxes " and " excessive increases in wages . "
tax cuts were a major campaign platform of merkel 's pro-business coalition partners , the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , and the party - which is struggling in the polls - is keen that they are introduced sooner rather than later .
economic minister rainer bruederle , a member of the fdp , told german public television on wednesday that his party would be patient before cutting taxes , but the cuts would come .
" not today , but soon .
because if the economy really does grow as predicted , then - after implementing the measures to balance the budget that we have made priority number one - there might be a bit of lee-way for some slight cuts in the middle-bracket . "
bruederle said .
" but , as our coalition keeps saying , we must reduce the budget deficit as a short-term priority , and then think about taxation in the medium term . "
bruederle said that the government might be in a position to start the process by 2012 - especially in light of the panel 's prediction that germany might dip below the prescribed eu budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 .
but the economists see this matter very differently , arguing that there will be no room for tax cuts during the current legislative period -lrb- which ends in 2013 -rrb- , and saying it may not even be possible early in the next one .
instead , the group suggested that berlin might be forced to raise taxes slightly in order to meet its target of cutting 80 billion euros in spending between 2010 and 2014 .
job market to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to target germany 's unemployment problem the german economic experts also predicted reduced joblessness for 2011 , with germany set to dip below 3 million unemployed next year .
earlier in the week , buoyed by the prospect of good news from her experts , chancellor merkel told the focus news magazine that full employment was a major goal for her government .
" i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " she said .
" we must , and can , get these people back to work . "
however , the cologne-based institute for economic research predicts that a rate of around 5 percent unemployment , meaning roughly 2 million germans out of work , would be a more realistic goal in the foreseeable future .
" at that point the structural issues behind joblessness start to become a problem , " the institute 's president michael huether explained .
" things like a lack of qualifications , the unsuitability of candidates for the jobs on offer , and vice versa . "
economic envy in the english press germany is leading eu member states as the bloc struggles to emerge from recession - something which has caused the british media to take note in recent weeks .
as britain 's coalition government , elected earlier this year , looks to introduce tough spending cuts and jumpstart the faltering economy , more and more media outlets are reevaluating the merits of the relatively export-heavy , frugal economic policies which germans call " rhineland capitalism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's new leadership duo are making drastic cuts for little reward " a decade ago we considered the german economy a write-off .
now -lrb- prime minister -rrb- david cameron looks to angela merkel for inspiration , " a columnist at the left-leaning guardian newspaper , david gow , wrote in a recent commentary .
germany only partially followed the anglo-american movement towards dependence on the financial and services sectors in the latter half of the 20th century , preferring to maintain some industrial output and favoring a relatively cautious banking community .
the decision was often derided as backward , and even harmful to less cautious western neighbors , but now british commentators are asking whether the same caution has proved the key to a relatively swift recovery .
even the conservative newspaper , the times , has recently turned against the higher-risk capitalism favored in the english-speaking world , suggesting that germany 's export-heavy model is " leaving britain behind . "
yet there are other voices in the uk , like london-based financial analysts lombard street research , who point to decreasing demand in china and continued economic problems in the us and much of southern europe , suggesting that this could mean that germany 's export-driven recovery might falter in the near future .

in a press release , the icfr said there was widespread fear in the sector that the g20 could " fail to make progress on its goals , as domestic considerations move back center-stage . "
it urged leaders to agree on financial reforms most likely improve economic stability and achieve international implementation . " we are calling on the g20 to prioritize more effective cross-border coordination by supervisors , and for agreement on the way forward on crisis resolution to allow for the orderly wind-down of complex banks , " barbara ridpath , ceo of the watchdog said in a statement .

" the global economic recovery remains fragile .
64 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty this year , " ban said , adding that this was a time for unity .
he said the world could not afford to think narrowly about development and economic growth , and that " all countries and all peoples have a stake in the management of the global economy . "
on the agenda leaders at the seoul g20 summit , the first to be held in an emerging market economy , are expected to sign off on the basel iii agreement , which is designed to tighten global capital and liquidity requirements for banks from 2013 onwards . bildunterschrift : the summit is being watched closely by managers in frankfurt 's banking towers drafted by the basel committee of central bankers and regulators back in september , the package is considered a significant step down the path towards financial stability .
it also tipped by observers to be one of the few items on the regulation agenda that is likely to receive broad support in seoul .
the only other real progress the talks are expected to yield is the endorsement of a series of agreements aimed at tightening supervision of the derivatives market and ensuring the standardization of contracts to facilitate central clearing processes and trading on exchanges .
safety nets on the issue of " too big to fail " banks , analysts are expecting little movement .
the financial stability board -lrb- fsb -rrb- , which is responsible for the implementation of g20 regulatory pledges , is expected to lay out a set of recommendations on " systemically important financial institutions , " otherwise known as sifis , involving the largest 20 or so global banks .
under the terms of the proposals , regulators would be required to make sure that sifis , the list of which is yet to be finalized , prepare living wills outlining how , if necessary , they could be wound up without causing major upset on the markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsbc is likely to feature on the list of global banks deemed too big to fail g20 members have not , as yet , been able to agree on many of the details of sifis , but there is speculation that the list will not include big asian banks .
their business is conducted primarily in domestic markets .
they therefore pose little threat to the wider world if they go under .
ratings , commodities and accounting summit delegates are , however , tipped to rubber-stamp fsb proposals for reducing market reliance on rating agencies .
if they do green-light the suggestion , they will have to find alternative ways of assessing creditworthiness .
regulators say the move would reduce what is known as the cliff effect , which contributes to market destabilization .
in the name of yet greater stability , the group of 20 wealthy and emerging nations is also calling for more transparency in commodity markets .
this week , regulators ruled a major overhaul , but they did concede more pricing information was needed from physical commodity markets .
there is little hope of movement on the establishment of a single set of global accounting standards .
the june 2011 deadline is likely to be overshot due to differences between the g20 member states , but analysts say the summit could be an opportunity to push for resolution .

now the german company says it 's in a position to outgrow its us rival and dominate the market by 2015 .
consumers in the united states are central to its plans . after weathering a difficult year in 2009 and pinning its hopes on the 2010 world cup in south africa , german sporting goods company adidas has surged ahead in profits and now says it wants to outperform leading rival nike .
adidas wants to grow faster than nike through 2015 and increase its turnover by 45-50 percent to 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.4 billion -rrb- .
" we 're hoping this faster rate of growth will let us lay a foundation to be the market leader at a later point in time , " an adidas spokeswoman told deutsche welle .
nike , however , is moving forward with goals of its own .
it hopes to generate 19.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- in revenue by 2015 .
in the first nine months of 2010 , adidas primarily grew in the united states , china and russia , according to the company 's spokeswoman .
most of the growth was generated in the sports style , fashion and lifestyle sectors , as well as the reebok brand , which it bought in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa world cup gave adidas a major sales boost adidas maintains a consistent marketing budget of 13 to 14 percent of its overall turnover.the bavarian-based company now plans to market new clothing designs for teenagers every two weeks .

" so you 've got the us versus the rest of the world , if you will .
now you 've got some markets – especially china – which are growing very quickly .
but that pales in comparison to the us . "
powell also said that both adidas and reebok had been losing market share in footwear " until very recently . "
" i really think that part of why adidas has struggled in the us is because they really do n't have a clear understanding of what the us consumer wants , " he said . " -lrb- but -rrb- i think they 're doing a much better job today than they were five years ago . "
what the us consumer really wants is fashion , powell said , adding that most athletic footwear " is n't used for sports . "

the company 's overall third-quarter turnover increased in all regions , specifically 14 percent in north america and 9 percent in china .
powell said he believes there is a chance adidas could grow faster than nike in the next five years .
" historically the numbers would say it 's doable , but it 's a pretty steep hill to climb . "

representing 90 percent of the world 's economic power , and four-fifths of global trade , the summit is crisis-oriented .
it was called into life in 1999 as a reaction to financial crises in asia , brazil and russia , and was initially a meeting of financial ministers .
when lehman brothers investment bank collapsed in the fall of 2008 , it unleashed a global financial crisis , and the g20 became a vehicle to combat recession .
that 's when heads of state became involved .
it has been nearly two years since a package of financial measures was decided on in washington .
their aim is to ensure such an unprecedented global crisis never happens again .

" in my view one of the main features of this crisis has been the emergence of a willingness to work together , of a new kind of economic cooperation at the global level which never existed , never happened in the past , " strauss-kahn said in october at the annual meeting of the imf in washington .
according to strauss-kahn , that spirit of cooperation was present at past g20 summits in london , pittsburgh and toronto .
but the meeting starting thursday in seoul may show a decrease in countries ' willingness to cooperate at a global level .
" that is a real threat … there is no domestic solution to a global crisis , " he said .
summit as a litmus test the g20 summit participants surely know global cooperation is the way forward .
in the end , however , each country has to master its own national politics in order to institute financial reform .
that 's why german chancellor angela merkel says she is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far " in terms of the financial sector 's participation in carrying the costs of the crisis , the german government could have pictured more , " she told german parliamentarians in october as she outlined her goals for the seoul gathering .
while germany imposed a nationwide " financial crisis responsibility fee " on its banks , the g20 failed to agree on an international tax on financial markets .
nevertheless , europe will be bringing something to the table in seoul : its oversight of financial systems will be significantly improved .
risky financial products may be forbidden under certain circumstances and control over hedge funds and ratings agencies is being tightened .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has expressed concerns about the seoul g20 summit .
he says it comes at a critical point in time , as all parties will have to accept that global economic imbalances affect them all .
" it will be a real test of whether the g20 can deliver the coordination the world economy needs , " he wrote in an open letter .
no hint of unity despite numerous promises to disallow protectionism , the g20 nations are far from unified in their efforts to do so .
each is primarily acting with the strength its own domestic economy in mind , and the resulting imbalance is fertile ground for another crisis .
the trade balances of the individual countries – the ratio of their exports versus imports – is filled with dormant potential for conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imposed a fee on its banks , but an international tax was not agreed on in outlining her goals for the seoul g20 summit , merkel asked what countries can " do together for sustainable , strong and balanced growth . "
she wants to see this entirely accomplished by unadulterated market forces as such balances are an expression of economic competitiveness .
no answers on currency currency exchange rates are an inevitable source of controversy in the current scenario of global trade , and some analysts have already dubbed the situation a " global currency war . "
the problem is that some countries are trying to gain a competitive edge by devaluing their own currencies to make exports more attractive .
china and the united states are the primary practitioners of this tactic , with south korea , japan and brazil jointing in too .
a precarious race has begun .
the seoul g20 summit wo n't solve this problem , but merkel says that exchange rates should accurately reflect the fundamental data of a country 's domestic prosperity for the time being .
" a political scenario which targets currency distortion to strengthen economic competitiveness must be avoided , " merkel said .
france , which is due to take over south korea 's presidency of the g20 , wants to make currency policies a central issue .
still , one central issue may be the most important of all during the talks – whether the 20 nations can demonstrate they are all moving in the same direction , even if they were forced into negotiations by a crisis .

now the german company says it 's in a position to outgrow its us rival and dominate the market by 2015 .
consumers in the united states are central to its plans . after weathering a difficult year in 2009 and pinning its hopes on the 2010 world cup in south africa , german sporting goods company adidas has surged ahead in profits and now says it wants to outperform leading rival nike .
adidas wants to grow faster than nike through 2015 and increase its turnover by 45-50 percent to 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.4 billion -rrb- .
" we 're hoping this faster rate of growth will let us lay a foundation to be the market leader at a later point in time , " an adidas spokeswoman told deutsche welle .
nike , however , is moving forward with goals of its own .
it hopes to generate 19.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- in revenue by 2015 .
in the first nine months of 2010 , adidas primarily grew in the united states , china and russia , according to the company 's spokeswoman .
most of the growth was generated in the sports style , fashion and lifestyle sectors , as well as the reebok brand , which it bought in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa world cup gave adidas a major sales boost adidas maintains a consistent marketing budget of 13 to 14 percent of its overall turnover.the bavarian-based company now plans to market new clothing designs for teenagers every two weeks .
it also plans to aggressively pursue the young customers on the internet using social networking .
us market vital according to matt powell , an analyst at sportsonesource - a research and data firm based in charlotte , north carolina - the key market for both adidas and nike is the united states .
" the us does about half of the athletic footwear and apparel business in the world , " he told deutsche welle .
" so you 've got the us versus the rest of the world , if you will .
now you 've got some markets – especially china – which are growing very quickly .
but that pales in comparison to the us . "
powell also said that both adidas and reebok had been losing market share in footwear " until very recently . "
" i really think that part of why adidas has struggled in the us is because they really do n't have a clear understanding of what the us consumer wants , " he said . " -lrb- but -rrb- i think they 're doing a much better job today than they were five years ago . "
what the us consumer really wants is fashion , powell said , adding that most athletic footwear " is n't used for sports . "
growth in north america and china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is also a rapidly growing market for adidas and nike some of the highlights of adidas ' quarterly exchange-rate-adjusted figures include a 10 percent increase in turnover for the adidas brand , and a 14 percent increase for the reebok brand .
the company 's overall third-quarter turnover increased in all regions , specifically 14 percent in north america and 9 percent in china .
powell said he believes there is a chance adidas could grow faster than nike in the next five years .
" historically the numbers would say it 's doable , but it 's a pretty steep hill to climb . "

the case involves airlines that fly around the globe , from air france-klm , to british airways and quantas . the european union 's competition watchdog issued fines tuesday to 11 airlines totaling 799.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- for running a global cargo cartel .
the cargo carriers were found to have coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security over a six-year period , between 1999 and 2006 .
" with today 's decision , the european commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate cartel behavior , " eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner almunia said the case was " deplorable " the fine imposed is one of the biggest in eu history .
the bloc 's rules forbid most forms of price fixing among competitors .
" it is deplorable that so many major airlines coordinated their pricing to the detriment of european businesses and european consumers , " almunia added .
no fine for the whistleblower air france-klm was hit with the largest fine of 310 million euros .
british airways came in second , having to pay a 104-million-euro penalty .
luxembourg 's cargolux will have to pay 79.9 million euros , while scandinavian carrier sas was ordered to pay 70.2 million euros .
other airlines involved in the cartel and slapped with fines were singapore airlines , air canada , quantas , lan chile , martinair and japan airlines .
the commission said it dropped charges against eleven other airlines , including german carrier lufthansa and its subsidiary swiss air , because it was the first to provide information about the cartel .
according to the commission the cartel the airlines began fixing fuel-surcharges in 1999 .
later the cooperation expanded with the introduction of a security surcharge and refused to pay a commission on those surcharges to their clients .
" by refusing to pay a commission , the airlines ensured that surcharges did not become subject to competition through the granting of discounts to customers .
such practices are in breach of the eu competition rules , " the commission said in a statement .

" the pleasing upward trend in the german economy offers the chance for a stable , if relatively flat , path of growth , " the council 's chairman , wolfgang franz said .
" also , the government is in a position to considerably bolster these chances with solid economic policies . "
increased consumption , investments and demand for german exports are fuelling the recovery , and should lead to reduced levels of unemployment and state borrowing , the experts said .
however , they also cautioned that a repeat of germany 's so-called economic miracle in the post-war era was not on the cards .
the council , often referred to as the five wise men of the economy -lrb- in fact , one is a woman -rrb- , was set up in 1963 to advise the government on economic policy . " i think we are all delighted that the situation this year looks a lot more optimistic than last year , " chancellor angela merkel said on receiving the report , promising to continue with governent plans to save money .
" we are well aware that the structure of our current budget - designed as a response to the recent crisis with over 50 percent of spending going towards social security - is not a sustainable model for the future , especially considering our ageing population . "
taxation and borrowing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government says reducing borrowing still takes priority over tax cuts the chairman of the expert panel , wolfgang franz , told chancellor merkel that her government could support the fragile growth by issuing stricter regulations on the global financial sector and continuing to consolidate german overspending .
he also issued two warnings to governments , employers , and trade unions - advising against " rash cuts in taxes " and " excessive increases in wages . "
tax cuts were a major campaign platform of merkel 's pro-business coalition partners , the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , and the party - which is struggling in the polls - is keen that they are introduced sooner rather than later .
economic minister rainer bruederle , a member of the fdp , told german public television on wednesday that his party would be patient before cutting taxes , but the cuts would come .
" not today , but soon .
because if the economy really does grow as predicted , then - after implementing the measures to balance the budget that we have made priority number one - there might be a bit of lee-way for some slight cuts in the middle-bracket . "
bruederle said .
" but , as our coalition keeps saying , we must reduce the budget deficit as a short-term priority , and then think about taxation in the medium term . "
bruederle said that the government might be in a position to start the process by 2012 - especially in light of the panel 's prediction that germany might dip below the prescribed eu budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 .
but the economists see this matter very differently , arguing that there will be no room for tax cuts during the current legislative period -lrb- which ends in 2013 -rrb- , and saying it may not even be possible early in the next one .
instead , the group suggested that berlin might be forced to raise taxes slightly in order to meet its target of cutting 80 billion euros in spending between 2010 and 2014 .
job market to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to target germany 's unemployment problem the german economic experts also predicted reduced joblessness for 2011 , with germany set to dip below 3 million unemployed next year .
earlier in the week , buoyed by the prospect of good news from her experts , chancellor merkel told the focus news magazine that full employment was a major goal for her government .
" i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " she said .
" we must , and can , get these people back to work . "
however , the cologne-based institute for economic research predicts that a rate of around 5 percent unemployment , meaning roughly 2 million germans out of work , would be a more realistic goal in the foreseeable future .
" at that point the structural issues behind joblessness start to become a problem , " the institute 's president michael huether explained .
" things like a lack of qualifications , the unsuitability of candidates for the jobs on offer , and vice versa . "
economic envy in the english press germany is leading eu member states as the bloc struggles to emerge from recession - something which has caused the british media to take note in recent weeks .
as britain 's coalition government , elected earlier this year , looks to introduce tough spending cuts and jumpstart the faltering economy , more and more media outlets are reevaluating the merits of the relatively export-heavy , frugal economic policies which germans call " rhineland capitalism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's new leadership duo are making drastic cuts for little reward " a decade ago we considered the german economy a write-off .
now -lrb- prime minister -rrb- david cameron looks to angela merkel for inspiration , " a columnist at the left-leaning guardian newspaper , david gow , wrote in a recent commentary .
germany only partially followed the anglo-american movement towards dependence on the financial and services sectors in the latter half of the 20th century , preferring to maintain some industrial output and favoring a relatively cautious banking community .
the decision was often derided as backward , and even harmful to less cautious western neighbors , but now british commentators are asking whether the same caution has proved the key to a relatively swift recovery .
even the conservative newspaper , the times , has recently turned against the higher-risk capitalism favored in the english-speaking world , suggesting that germany 's export-heavy model is " leaving britain behind . "
yet there are other voices in the uk , like london-based financial analysts lombard street research , who point to decreasing demand in china and continued economic problems in the us and much of southern europe , suggesting that this could mean that germany 's export-driven recovery might falter in the near future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.11.2010 currency likely to take center stage at seoul g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 summit starts in seoul on thursday the annual g20 summit starts in seoul on thursday , and artificial currency manipulation is likely to be a central issue .
in addition to keeping the " global currency war " from escalating , a common goal must be reaffirmed . the sheer scale of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit can be staggering .
representing 90 percent of the world 's economic power , and four-fifths of global trade , the summit is crisis-oriented .
it was called into life in 1999 as a reaction to financial crises in asia , brazil and russia , and was initially a meeting of financial ministers .
when lehman brothers investment bank collapsed in the fall of 2008 , it unleashed a global financial crisis , and the g20 became a vehicle to combat recession .
that 's when heads of state became involved .
it has been nearly two years since a package of financial measures was decided on in washington .
their aim is to ensure such an unprecedented global crisis never happens again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique strauss-kahn says global cooperation is needed for dominique strauss-kahn , a french politician and managing director of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the most important realization of the crisis is that egoism on the national level needs to yield to global cooperation .
" in my view one of the main features of this crisis has been the emergence of a willingness to work together , of a new kind of economic cooperation at the global level which never existed , never happened in the past , " strauss-kahn said in october at the annual meeting of the imf in washington .
according to strauss-kahn , that spirit of cooperation was present at past g20 summits in london , pittsburgh and toronto .
but the meeting starting thursday in seoul may show a decrease in countries ' willingness to cooperate at a global level .
" that is a real threat … there is no domestic solution to a global crisis , " he said .
summit as a litmus test the g20 summit participants surely know global cooperation is the way forward .
in the end , however , each country has to master its own national politics in order to institute financial reform .
that 's why german chancellor angela merkel says she is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far " in terms of the financial sector 's participation in carrying the costs of the crisis , the german government could have pictured more , " she told german parliamentarians in october as she outlined her goals for the seoul gathering .
while germany imposed a nationwide " financial crisis responsibility fee " on its banks , the g20 failed to agree on an international tax on financial markets .
nevertheless , europe will be bringing something to the table in seoul : its oversight of financial systems will be significantly improved .
risky financial products may be forbidden under certain circumstances and control over hedge funds and ratings agencies is being tightened .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has expressed concerns about the seoul g20 summit .
he says it comes at a critical point in time , as all parties will have to accept that global economic imbalances affect them all .
" it will be a real test of whether the g20 can deliver the coordination the world economy needs , " he wrote in an open letter .
no hint of unity despite numerous promises to disallow protectionism , the g20 nations are far from unified in their efforts to do so .
each is primarily acting with the strength its own domestic economy in mind , and the resulting imbalance is fertile ground for another crisis .
the trade balances of the individual countries – the ratio of their exports versus imports – is filled with dormant potential for conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imposed a fee on its banks , but an international tax was not agreed on in outlining her goals for the seoul g20 summit , merkel asked what countries can " do together for sustainable , strong and balanced growth . "
she wants to see this entirely accomplished by unadulterated market forces as such balances are an expression of economic competitiveness .
no answers on currency currency exchange rates are an inevitable source of controversy in the current scenario of global trade , and some analysts have already dubbed the situation a " global currency war . "
the problem is that some countries are trying to gain a competitive edge by devaluing their own currencies to make exports more attractive .
china and the united states are the primary practitioners of this tactic , with south korea , japan and brazil jointing in too .
a precarious race has begun .
the seoul g20 summit wo n't solve this problem , but merkel says that exchange rates should accurately reflect the fundamental data of a country 's domestic prosperity for the time being .
" a political scenario which targets currency distortion to strengthen economic competitiveness must be avoided , " merkel said .
france , which is due to take over south korea 's presidency of the g20 , wants to make currency policies a central issue .
still , one central issue may be the most important of all during the talks – whether the 20 nations can demonstrate they are all moving in the same direction , even if they were forced into negotiations by a crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 10.11.2010 opinion : a guilty conscience is no basis for membership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how should the eu deal with turkey 's membership hopes ?
many eu politicians have a guilty conscience over keeping ankara waiting .
but that 's a poor basis for making decisions , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . many eu politicians have a guilty conscience .
they do n't know how to deal with ankara ’ s hopes for speedy progress in the country 's bid for eu membership .
turkey is after all an official membership candidate and is trying to implement the reforms that brussels is calling for .
and from ankara 's perspective , this should eventually lead to full membership once the eu 's demands have been met .
so far , all previous membership candidates have eventually become full members .
but it 's clear that a guilty conscience alone is a poor basis for granting membership .
many european governments today regret that they – or their predecessors – have in past years given the green light for membership talks with turkey .
the doubts within the eu about whether turkey is fit for membership have since then only increased , and the arguments against membership have not changed .
they are not about individual points of criticism – be it cyprus or freedom of expression – but they are , in fact of a more fundamental nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations will continue to improve , but there wo n't be full membership , says hasselbach for instance , the eu still struggles with the consequences of its two previous expansion rounds in 2004 and 2007 .
and even if past expansion was not a mistake – the new members have significantly changed the european union .
the bloc 's ability to speak with one voice seems to be faltering – simply because the member states are too diverse and different .
these changes have to sink in and this process is bound to take time .
accepting turkey with its different history and tradition would from today 's perspective lead to a final stop to european integration .
has anyone ever thought of the fact that turkey would soon surpass germany as the most populous eu member state ?
turkey as a member would therefore have the right to demand more official posts than any of the other countries .
this would change the eu to an extent likely to cause sharp opposition .
and no one can guarantee that turkey will remain a secular state for good .
none of this calls into question the fact that the eu needs turkey and that turkey needs the eu .
the good trade relations and security cooperation should be built upon .
both sides are certain to do this for their very own interests .
and turkey is likely to continue its reform path even without the prospect of eu membership .
that 's why it ’ s wrong to argue that without membership talks , ankara will abandon reforms and look for other partners .
both sides need to look at the current situation .
it 's not a question of all or nothing .
and the eu should be honest with ankara that at the end of the path will be a closer relationship than today – but no full membership .

now the german company says it 's in a position to outgrow its us rival and dominate the market by 2015 .
consumers in the united states are central to its plans . after weathering a difficult year in 2009 and pinning its hopes on the 2010 world cup in south africa , german sporting goods company adidas has surged ahead in profits and now says it wants to outperform leading rival nike .
adidas wants to grow faster than nike through 2015 and increase its turnover by 45-50 percent to 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.4 billion -rrb- .
" we 're hoping this faster rate of growth will let us lay a foundation to be the market leader at a later point in time , " an adidas spokeswoman told deutsche welle .
nike , however , is moving forward with goals of its own .
it hopes to generate 19.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- in revenue by 2015 .
in the first nine months of 2010 , adidas primarily grew in the united states , china and russia , according to the company 's spokeswoman .
most of the growth was generated in the sports style , fashion and lifestyle sectors , as well as the reebok brand , which it bought in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa world cup gave adidas a major sales boost adidas maintains a consistent marketing budget of 13 to 14 percent of its overall turnover.the bavarian-based company now plans to market new clothing designs for teenagers every two weeks .
it also plans to aggressively pursue the young customers on the internet using social networking .
us market vital according to matt powell , an analyst at sportsonesource - a research and data firm based in charlotte , north carolina - the key market for both adidas and nike is the united states .
" the us does about half of the athletic footwear and apparel business in the world , " he told deutsche welle .
" so you 've got the us versus the rest of the world , if you will .
now you 've got some markets – especially china – which are growing very quickly .
but that pales in comparison to the us . "
powell also said that both adidas and reebok had been losing market share in footwear " until very recently . "
" i really think that part of why adidas has struggled in the us is because they really do n't have a clear understanding of what the us consumer wants , " he said . " -lrb- but -rrb- i think they 're doing a much better job today than they were five years ago . "
what the us consumer really wants is fashion , powell said , adding that most athletic footwear " is n't used for sports . "
growth in north america and china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is also a rapidly growing market for adidas and nike some of the highlights of adidas ' quarterly exchange-rate-adjusted figures include a 10 percent increase in turnover for the adidas brand , and a 14 percent increase for the reebok brand .
the company 's overall third-quarter turnover increased in all regions , specifically 14 percent in north america and 9 percent in china .
powell said he believes there is a chance adidas could grow faster than nike in the next five years .
" historically the numbers would say it 's doable , but it 's a pretty steep hill to climb . "

his book is unlikely to help heal the rift that emerged between the us and europe while he was in office . the 43rd us president 's apparent mission to have his two terms in the white house reassessed and his reputation rehabilitated through his new book , " decision points , " has many europeans shaking their heads . and it 's not just the most inflammatory excerpts - such as bush 's assertion that water-boarding of terror suspects saved lives - that are causing an outcry . bush 's supporters in the us say that every president has the right to defend his record ; " decision points " shows the former president as a man who was ideologically consistent during his eight years in office . his detractors counter that the president 's mistakes and his determination to follow ill-thought-out policies - without a thought for a possible , rectifying change of direction - plunged the us into a decade of war and the worst financial crisis in over 80 years .
while george w. bush may have been a good guy with a difficult job , they say , he does n't deserve to be rehabilitated via his memoirs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush left office with two wars and an economic crisis raging if bush 's single-minded and heavy-handed approach to afghanistan and iraq in the wake of the terror attacks of 9/11 were damaging to his relations with his european allies at the time , his newly released memoirs appear to be giving european readers the chance get angry all over again . europeans , even allies , dismissed as irrelevant " in my opinion , there ’ s been no change in perception of bush in europe , " dr. henning meyer , a transatlantic relations expert at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle . " his legacy projects , such as iraq and afghanistan , are still the main issues associated with his presidency and of course europeans are still affected by these and in most cases are still in opposition to a certain degree .
if you remember , bush ’ s war on terror effectively split europe .
so these things have not been forgotten . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush says the uk 's perception of him does n't matter in " decision points , " bush is dismissive about those europeans who had taken a risk to follow him into war in iraq , and he talks frankly about his reputation in the one country whose leaders followed him most obediently of all : england .
" it does n't matter how people perceive me in england , " he writes .
" it just does n't matter any more .
and frankly , at times , it did n't matter then . " in a veiled dig at what he saw at the time as the rest of europe 's lack of stomach for the fight , bush writes : " people in europe said : ' ah , man , he 's a religious fanatic , cowboy , simpleton . '
all that stuff ...
if you believe that freedom is universal , then you should n't be surprised when people take courageous measures to live in a free society . " he reserves his most scathing treatment for those european leaders who disappointed him most , especially during the iraq war : former german chancellor gerhard schroeder comes in for even worse treatment than former french president jacques chirac , schroeder 's ally in the european anti-war opposition . german emotions still raw over bush 's rush to war in the book , bush accuses schroeder of abusing his trust after allegedly telling the president in 2002 , before the invasion of iraq the following year , that " what goes for afghanistan also goes for iraq .
nations which support terrorism must accept the consequences .
if you go forward fast and resolutely , i am on your side . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush did n't trust schroeder after the latter withdrew his support however , struggling in his re-election campaign in the fall of that year , schroeder hitched his wagon to the huge swell of anti-war feeling in germany and across europe .
he claims bush is lying when he says that he had offered his support for an invasion , and that he 'd made it clear all along that his support was conditional on whether iraq really had weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- . " schroeder 's support -lrb- for the invasion of iraq -rrb- was conditional on evidence being found of terrorists being harbored in iraq , so when there was no evidence delivered , he withdrew his support , " lse professor meyer told deutsche welle .
" bush is attempting to polish his own picture of this situation with the germans by saying that the breakdown in relations was not his fault and that it was schroeder who turned opinion against him . " the bush legacy is still powerfully felt in the united states : the armed forces are embroiled in the two wars he started ; the financial system is struggling to pull out of an overwhelming crisis , and politicians are scrambling to rebuild their credibility on the world stage . but the ripples from his eight-year presidency continue to be felt in europe as well .
under his leadership , decades of trust and cooperation between the us and european governments was damaged . according to thomas klau , a transatlantic relations expert at the european council for foreign relations , the memoir provides new fodder for europeans who are skeptical about the us political system . " europeans , and germans in particular , are still amazed that the us political system has the potential to elect such an incompetent leader who has no respect for western values , " klau said .
" while obama gave some hope , the germans are now saddened to see that a discredited party such as the republicans can be re-elected as the majority in the house of representatives . " germans see the republican mid-term victory as proof that " the us system and electorate has a very short memory and very little wisdom . " european anger reignited over torture statements so far , european reaction to the bush memoirs has been heavily affected by comments in the book that seem to advocate torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims water boarding extracted vital information for meyer , the water-boarding comments are " a very clear example of the philosophical differences between the bush administration and the europeans . " " there is a huge difference in what bush thought was acceptable in terms of the war on terror and what the europeans thought , " he added .
" bush saw approaches such as water-boarding as not a breaking of any laws but a legitimate bending of them . " moreover , bush " made bold statements " that the information gained from water-boarding stopped an attack on london - a claim the uk refutes . " most people in europe say that there were other ways of getting the information and that bush ’ s assertions are just not true , " meyer said . severe - and lasting - damage ? the response to his memoirs suggests that the damage bush did to his country 's reputation in europe remains severe . " bush 's was the worst us presidency that europe and the world has ever seen and his legacy , in political and economic terms , will be seen as one of disaster , " said klau .
" few people will expect to see any change in this perception arising from his memoirs .
in fact , it 's highly likely that his already terrible reputation in europe will take an even worse turn . " bush may have come out with his book to try and put the record straight in his own words .
but in doing so , at least in europe , it appears that he has taken a big stick to a hornet 's nest of his own making . author : nick amies editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , they have warned against sudden tax cuts . the german council of economic experts predicted on wednesday that germany 's economy will grow by 3.7 percent in 2010 , and by 2.2 percent in 2011 - a prognosis that even exceeds the latest official estimates from chancellor angela merkel 's government .
" the pleasing upward trend in the german economy offers the chance for a stable , if relatively flat , path of growth , " the council 's chairman , wolfgang franz said .
" also , the government is in a position to considerably bolster these chances with solid economic policies . "
increased consumption , investments and demand for german exports are fuelling the recovery , and should lead to reduced levels of unemployment and state borrowing , the experts said .
however , they also cautioned that a repeat of germany 's so-called economic miracle in the post-war era was not on the cards .
the council , often referred to as the five wise men of the economy -lrb- in fact , one is a woman -rrb- , was set up in 1963 to advise the government on economic policy . " i think we are all delighted that the situation this year looks a lot more optimistic than last year , " chancellor angela merkel said on receiving the report , promising to continue with governent plans to save money .
" we are well aware that the structure of our current budget - designed as a response to the recent crisis with over 50 percent of spending going towards social security - is not a sustainable model for the future , especially considering our ageing population . "
taxation and borrowing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government says reducing borrowing still takes priority over tax cuts the chairman of the expert panel , wolfgang franz , told chancellor merkel that her government could support the fragile growth by issuing stricter regulations on the global financial sector and continuing to consolidate german overspending .
he also issued two warnings to governments , employers , and trade unions - advising against " rash cuts in taxes " and " excessive increases in wages . "
tax cuts were a major campaign platform of merkel 's pro-business coalition partners , the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , and the party - which is struggling in the polls - is keen that they are introduced sooner rather than later .
economic minister rainer bruederle , a member of the fdp , told german public television on wednesday that his party would be patient before cutting taxes , but the cuts would come .
" not today , but soon .
because if the economy really does grow as predicted , then - after implementing the measures to balance the budget that we have made priority number one - there might be a bit of lee-way for some slight cuts in the middle-bracket . "
bruederle said .
" but , as our coalition keeps saying , we must reduce the budget deficit as a short-term priority , and then think about taxation in the medium term . "
bruederle said that the government might be in a position to start the process by 2012 - especially in light of the panel 's prediction that germany might dip below the prescribed eu budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 .
but the economists see this matter very differently , arguing that there will be no room for tax cuts during the current legislative period -lrb- which ends in 2013 -rrb- , and saying it may not even be possible early in the next one .
instead , the group suggested that berlin might be forced to raise taxes slightly in order to meet its target of cutting 80 billion euros in spending between 2010 and 2014 .
job market to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to target germany 's unemployment problem the german economic experts also predicted reduced joblessness for 2011 , with germany set to dip below 3 million unemployed next year .
earlier in the week , buoyed by the prospect of good news from her experts , chancellor merkel told the focus news magazine that full employment was a major goal for her government .
" i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " she said .
" we must , and can , get these people back to work . "
however , the cologne-based institute for economic research predicts that a rate of around 5 percent unemployment , meaning roughly 2 million germans out of work , would be a more realistic goal in the foreseeable future .
" at that point the structural issues behind joblessness start to become a problem , " the institute 's president michael huether explained .
" things like a lack of qualifications , the unsuitability of candidates for the jobs on offer , and vice versa . "
economic envy in the english press germany is leading eu member states as the bloc struggles to emerge from recession - something which has caused the british media to take note in recent weeks .
as britain 's coalition government , elected earlier this year , looks to introduce tough spending cuts and jumpstart the faltering economy , more and more media outlets are reevaluating the merits of the relatively export-heavy , frugal economic policies which germans call " rhineland capitalism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's new leadership duo are making drastic cuts for little reward " a decade ago we considered the german economy a write-off .
now -lrb- prime minister -rrb- david cameron looks to angela merkel for inspiration , " a columnist at the left-leaning guardian newspaper , david gow , wrote in a recent commentary .
germany only partially followed the anglo-american movement towards dependence on the financial and services sectors in the latter half of the 20th century , preferring to maintain some industrial output and favoring a relatively cautious banking community .
the decision was often derided as backward , and even harmful to less cautious western neighbors , but now british commentators are asking whether the same caution has proved the key to a relatively swift recovery .
even the conservative newspaper , the times , has recently turned against the higher-risk capitalism favored in the english-speaking world , suggesting that germany 's export-heavy model is " leaving britain behind . "
yet there are other voices in the uk , like london-based financial analysts lombard street research , who point to decreasing demand in china and continued economic problems in the us and much of southern europe , suggesting that this could mean that germany 's export-driven recovery might falter in the near future .

in a press release , the icfr said there was widespread fear in the sector that the g20 could " fail to make progress on its goals , as domestic considerations move back center-stage . "
it urged leaders to agree on financial reforms most likely improve economic stability and achieve international implementation . " we are calling on the g20 to prioritize more effective cross-border coordination by supervisors , and for agreement on the way forward on crisis resolution to allow for the orderly wind-down of complex banks , " barbara ridpath , ceo of the watchdog said in a statement .
" time for unity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki moon has urged leaders to find common ground the icfr calls were echoed by united nations secretary general ban ki-moon , who is in the south korean capital for the international summit .
on the eve of the meeting , he expressed concern over national differences of opinion on global rebalancing and currency policies .
" the global economic recovery remains fragile .
64 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty this year , " ban said , adding that this was a time for unity .
he said the world could not afford to think narrowly about development and economic growth , and that " all countries and all peoples have a stake in the management of the global economy . "
on the agenda leaders at the seoul g20 summit , the first to be held in an emerging market economy , are expected to sign off on the basel iii agreement , which is designed to tighten global capital and liquidity requirements for banks from 2013 onwards . bildunterschrift : the summit is being watched closely by managers in frankfurt 's banking towers drafted by the basel committee of central bankers and regulators back in september , the package is considered a significant step down the path towards financial stability .
it also tipped by observers to be one of the few items on the regulation agenda that is likely to receive broad support in seoul .
the only other real progress the talks are expected to yield is the endorsement of a series of agreements aimed at tightening supervision of the derivatives market and ensuring the standardization of contracts to facilitate central clearing processes and trading on exchanges .
safety nets on the issue of " too big to fail " banks , analysts are expecting little movement .
the financial stability board -lrb- fsb -rrb- , which is responsible for the implementation of g20 regulatory pledges , is expected to lay out a set of recommendations on " systemically important financial institutions , " otherwise known as sifis , involving the largest 20 or so global banks .
under the terms of the proposals , regulators would be required to make sure that sifis , the list of which is yet to be finalized , prepare living wills outlining how , if necessary , they could be wound up without causing major upset on the markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsbc is likely to feature on the list of global banks deemed too big to fail g20 members have not , as yet , been able to agree on many of the details of sifis , but there is speculation that the list will not include big asian banks .
their business is conducted primarily in domestic markets .
they therefore pose little threat to the wider world if they go under .
ratings , commodities and accounting summit delegates are , however , tipped to rubber-stamp fsb proposals for reducing market reliance on rating agencies .
if they do green-light the suggestion , they will have to find alternative ways of assessing creditworthiness .
regulators say the move would reduce what is known as the cliff effect , which contributes to market destabilization .
in the name of yet greater stability , the group of 20 wealthy and emerging nations is also calling for more transparency in commodity markets .
this week , regulators ruled a major overhaul , but they did concede more pricing information was needed from physical commodity markets .
there is little hope of movement on the establishment of a single set of global accounting standards .
the june 2011 deadline is likely to be overshot due to differences between the g20 member states , but analysts say the summit could be an opportunity to push for resolution .

now the german company says it 's in a position to outgrow its us rival and dominate the market by 2015 .
consumers in the united states are central to its plans . after weathering a difficult year in 2009 and pinning its hopes on the 2010 world cup in south africa , german sporting goods company adidas has surged ahead in profits and now says it wants to outperform leading rival nike .
adidas wants to grow faster than nike through 2015 and increase its turnover by 45-50 percent to 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.4 billion -rrb- .
" we 're hoping this faster rate of growth will let us lay a foundation to be the market leader at a later point in time , " an adidas spokeswoman told deutsche welle .
nike , however , is moving forward with goals of its own .
it hopes to generate 19.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- in revenue by 2015 .
in the first nine months of 2010 , adidas primarily grew in the united states , china and russia , according to the company 's spokeswoman .
most of the growth was generated in the sports style , fashion and lifestyle sectors , as well as the reebok brand , which it bought in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa world cup gave adidas a major sales boost adidas maintains a consistent marketing budget of 13 to 14 percent of its overall turnover.the bavarian-based company now plans to market new clothing designs for teenagers every two weeks .
it also plans to aggressively pursue the young customers on the internet using social networking .
us market vital according to matt powell , an analyst at sportsonesource - a research and data firm based in charlotte , north carolina - the key market for both adidas and nike is the united states .
" the us does about half of the athletic footwear and apparel business in the world , " he told deutsche welle .
" so you 've got the us versus the rest of the world , if you will .
now you 've got some markets – especially china – which are growing very quickly .
but that pales in comparison to the us . "
powell also said that both adidas and reebok had been losing market share in footwear " until very recently . "
" i really think that part of why adidas has struggled in the us is because they really do n't have a clear understanding of what the us consumer wants , " he said . " -lrb- but -rrb- i think they 're doing a much better job today than they were five years ago . "
what the us consumer really wants is fashion , powell said , adding that most athletic footwear " is n't used for sports . "
growth in north america and china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is also a rapidly growing market for adidas and nike some of the highlights of adidas ' quarterly exchange-rate-adjusted figures include a 10 percent increase in turnover for the adidas brand , and a 14 percent increase for the reebok brand .
the company 's overall third-quarter turnover increased in all regions , specifically 14 percent in north america and 9 percent in china .
powell said he believes there is a chance adidas could grow faster than nike in the next five years .
" historically the numbers would say it 's doable , but it 's a pretty steep hill to climb . "

the south korean government is taking preparations for the g20 very seriously .
it ’ s the largest international gathering the country has held since the 2002 world cup .
this week ’ s summit also marks the first time a non-g8 and asian nation has hosted the economic forum .
south korea proud to host g20 and considering that several decades ago , south korea was one of the world ’ s poorest nations , its quick rise to the top makes it a model for other nations to emulate , says un secretary general ban ki moon .
the former south korean foreign minister says he ’ s proud of his nation ’ s accomplishments that have been made in the light of its division and war with north korea .

this role has never been more necessary and important and so there is something very special about this g20 moment . "
activists protest against " unequal economic policies " but some opposed to the g20 are using this moment to raise attention what they call its flawed economic policies .
an umbrella organization representing 80 south korean labor and civic groups says the top economies have done little to help the world ’ s poor and offset global unemployment , which they say is the highest in years .

and now as the g20 gets under way , korean and foreign activists are taking their message to the streets of seoul .
earlier this week , tens of thousands of protesters rallied against the g20 .
they were met by squads of korean riot police , who have been put on high alert ahead of the summit .
security tight in seoul some reports say the police used pepper spray to hold demonstrators back .
to keep protests like this under control and away from the g20 venues , seoul authorities have created a two kilometer buffer zone around the convention center .
it ’ s the largest security operation the nation has undertaken , according to the national police agency .
but south korea ’ s measures have only aggravated some protestors .
kim young hoon , president of the korean confederation of trade unions , says that president lee myung bak is denying their right to protest during the summit .

with the spotlight on south korea , the government there has taken a number of steps to ensure the forum goes off without a hitch . south korea is in the grips of g20 fever.television ads play around the clock proclaiming korea ’ s readiness to host the summit .
banners hung around seoul urge residents to say hello and be extra courteous to the visiting foreigners .
the south korean government is taking preparations for the g20 very seriously .
it ’ s the largest international gathering the country has held since the 2002 world cup .
this week ’ s summit also marks the first time a non-g8 and asian nation has hosted the economic forum .
south korea proud to host g20 and considering that several decades ago , south korea was one of the world ’ s poorest nations , its quick rise to the top makes it a model for other nations to emulate , says un secretary general ban ki moon .
the former south korean foreign minister says he ’ s proud of his nation ’ s accomplishments that have been made in the light of its division and war with north korea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea has undertaken the largest-ever security operation he spoke during a press briefing today in seoul : " i think we meet at a critical moment , the spotlight is on korea and is the first g20 summit in an emerging market economy .
korea is a bridge between the developed and developing world .
this role has never been more necessary and important and so there is something very special about this g20 moment . "
activists protest against " unequal economic policies " but some opposed to the g20 are using this moment to raise attention what they call its flawed economic policies .
an umbrella organization representing 80 south korean labor and civic groups says the top economies have done little to help the world ’ s poor and offset global unemployment , which they say is the highest in years .
chun hyoung baek of the civic group people ’ s solidarity for participatory democracy delivered the activists ’ official statement .
she spoke through an interpreter : " we call upon the g20 to regulate financial capital , which have brought suffering to so many people .
we call on the g20 to tax speculators and use the revenues to expand welfare .
the g20 has revamped the international monetary fund whose structural adjustment programs have devastated the lives of people all around the world . "
and now as the g20 gets under way , korean and foreign activists are taking their message to the streets of seoul .
earlier this week , tens of thousands of protesters rallied against the g20 .
they were met by squads of korean riot police , who have been put on high alert ahead of the summit .
security tight in seoul some reports say the police used pepper spray to hold demonstrators back .
to keep protests like this under control and away from the g20 venues , seoul authorities have created a two kilometer buffer zone around the convention center .
it ’ s the largest security operation the nation has undertaken , according to the national police agency .
but south korea ’ s measures have only aggravated some protestors .
kim young hoon , president of the korean confederation of trade unions , says that president lee myung bak is denying their right to protest during the summit .
violence between trade unions and police has erupted in the past during anti free trade rallies .
police have been criticized for turning water cannons on protestors .
bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate in seoul to draw attention to global poverty issues and kim says that he can not ensure that his members won ’ t resort to violence again , if police prevent them from demonstrating : " excessive use of force to crack down on demonstrations and rallies , to crack down and oppress our rights , will induce or provoke the demonstrations to become violent , that nobody wants . "
south korean riot police are prepared to confront activist groups on thursday , the first day of the g20 summit , as protestors plan to march through the capital .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 10.11.2010 german economic sages point to increased growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang franz and his team of ' wise men ' have n't delivered such good news for some time the german government 's team of five economic ' wise men ' have predicted consistent economic growth , lower unemployment , and reduced budget deficits for 2010 and 2011 .
however , they have warned against sudden tax cuts . the german council of economic experts predicted on wednesday that germany 's economy will grow by 3.7 percent in 2010 , and by 2.2 percent in 2011 - a prognosis that even exceeds the latest official estimates from chancellor angela merkel 's government .
" the pleasing upward trend in the german economy offers the chance for a stable , if relatively flat , path of growth , " the council 's chairman , wolfgang franz said .
" also , the government is in a position to considerably bolster these chances with solid economic policies . "
increased consumption , investments and demand for german exports are fuelling the recovery , and should lead to reduced levels of unemployment and state borrowing , the experts said .
however , they also cautioned that a repeat of germany 's so-called economic miracle in the post-war era was not on the cards .
the council , often referred to as the five wise men of the economy -lrb- in fact , one is a woman -rrb- , was set up in 1963 to advise the government on economic policy . " i think we are all delighted that the situation this year looks a lot more optimistic than last year , " chancellor angela merkel said on receiving the report , promising to continue with governent plans to save money .
" we are well aware that the structure of our current budget - designed as a response to the recent crisis with over 50 percent of spending going towards social security - is not a sustainable model for the future , especially considering our ageing population . "
taxation and borrowing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government says reducing borrowing still takes priority over tax cuts the chairman of the expert panel , wolfgang franz , told chancellor merkel that her government could support the fragile growth by issuing stricter regulations on the global financial sector and continuing to consolidate german overspending .
he also issued two warnings to governments , employers , and trade unions - advising against " rash cuts in taxes " and " excessive increases in wages . "
tax cuts were a major campaign platform of merkel 's pro-business coalition partners , the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , and the party - which is struggling in the polls - is keen that they are introduced sooner rather than later .
economic minister rainer bruederle , a member of the fdp , told german public television on wednesday that his party would be patient before cutting taxes , but the cuts would come .
" not today , but soon .
because if the economy really does grow as predicted , then - after implementing the measures to balance the budget that we have made priority number one - there might be a bit of lee-way for some slight cuts in the middle-bracket . "
bruederle said .
" but , as our coalition keeps saying , we must reduce the budget deficit as a short-term priority , and then think about taxation in the medium term . "
bruederle said that the government might be in a position to start the process by 2012 - especially in light of the panel 's prediction that germany might dip below the prescribed eu budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 .
but the economists see this matter very differently , arguing that there will be no room for tax cuts during the current legislative period -lrb- which ends in 2013 -rrb- , and saying it may not even be possible early in the next one .
instead , the group suggested that berlin might be forced to raise taxes slightly in order to meet its target of cutting 80 billion euros in spending between 2010 and 2014 .
job market to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to target germany 's unemployment problem the german economic experts also predicted reduced joblessness for 2011 , with germany set to dip below 3 million unemployed next year .
earlier in the week , buoyed by the prospect of good news from her experts , chancellor merkel told the focus news magazine that full employment was a major goal for her government .
" i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " she said .
" we must , and can , get these people back to work . "
however , the cologne-based institute for economic research predicts that a rate of around 5 percent unemployment , meaning roughly 2 million germans out of work , would be a more realistic goal in the foreseeable future .
" at that point the structural issues behind joblessness start to become a problem , " the institute 's president michael huether explained .
" things like a lack of qualifications , the unsuitability of candidates for the jobs on offer , and vice versa . "
economic envy in the english press germany is leading eu member states as the bloc struggles to emerge from recession - something which has caused the british media to take note in recent weeks .
as britain 's coalition government , elected earlier this year , looks to introduce tough spending cuts and jumpstart the faltering economy , more and more media outlets are reevaluating the merits of the relatively export-heavy , frugal economic policies which germans call " rhineland capitalism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's new leadership duo are making drastic cuts for little reward " a decade ago we considered the german economy a write-off .
now -lrb- prime minister -rrb- david cameron looks to angela merkel for inspiration , " a columnist at the left-leaning guardian newspaper , david gow , wrote in a recent commentary .
germany only partially followed the anglo-american movement towards dependence on the financial and services sectors in the latter half of the 20th century , preferring to maintain some industrial output and favoring a relatively cautious banking community .
the decision was often derided as backward , and even harmful to less cautious western neighbors , but now british commentators are asking whether the same caution has proved the key to a relatively swift recovery .
even the conservative newspaper , the times , has recently turned against the higher-risk capitalism favored in the english-speaking world , suggesting that germany 's export-heavy model is " leaving britain behind . "
yet there are other voices in the uk , like london-based financial analysts lombard street research , who point to decreasing demand in china and continued economic problems in the us and much of southern europe , suggesting that this could mean that germany 's export-driven recovery might falter in the near future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 10.11.2010 london 's globe theatre honors shakespeare 's german connection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been in love with shakespeare for centuries for many , shakespeare is synonymous with all things english , yet germany has a history of claiming the bard as " ganz unser " - their " very own . "
this season , the globe theatre pays homage to this special relationship . blasphemous as it might seem at first glance , the globe theatre 's current program serves to highlight a rather special bond between the world 's most famous writer and a whole country . " what i am discovering more and more is how deeply -lsb- shakespeare -rsb- entered into the german psyche from the 18th century on , " said patrick spottiswoode , education director for the globe theatre and curator of the season . and shakespeare 's german connection has strong credentials .
for starters , there are more performances of shakespeare in germany in any given year than in england .
german was the first language shakespeare was ever translated into ; and the first shakespeare society in the world was founded in germany . " the germans in the 18th and 19th century regarded him as ' ganz unser ' - entirely ours , " added spottiswoode . translating frenzy the notion of " ownership " over shakespeare was propagated by a wealth of translations that began to appear as early as 1766 - 150 years after his death - with christoph martin wieland 's prose translation of 22 of the bard 's plays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hamlet , said ferdinand freiligrath " to translate the whole works of shakespeare is quite a task ” , said spottiswoode , " and there were successive translations of the entire works in the 18th and 19th centuries . " between 1818 and 1839 alone , eight separate translations of the entire works of shakespeare were published .
some even say that this helped to " improve " the german language , as new words had to be invented to complete the task . it was the schlegel-tieck edition of 1833 that set the gold standard for shakespeare translation and laid the foundations for successive generations of german writers to attempt their very own versions . a constant contemporary " from wieland and then fontane down to heiner mueller in the post-war period , you have a spectrum of writers of different kinds that all contributed crucially to insuring that every other generation of german readers and viewers would have their very own shakespeare in a new translation , " said professor ruediger goerner , director of anglo-german relations at the university of queen mary in london . " shakespeare has always been a contemporary author for german audiences , " he continued .
this continual element of newness has seen a wealth of unusual and avant-garde interpretations of shakespeare come out of germany . " i think there 's that sense that as soon as you translate him , you are freeing him , " said spottiswoode . the goethe factor one of shakespeare 's greatest advocates was germany 's favorite literary child himself .
in 1771 , a 22-year old johann wolfgang von goethe gave an impassioned speech on the merits of his " friend " across the north sea . spottiswoode commissioned a translation of this lecture into english , sparking the entire " shakespeare is german " season at the globe theatre . " it 's a very beautiful , lyrical , passionate avocation of shakespeare and how he could be important and how german culture and theater could learn so much from shakespeare , " commented spottiswoode .
" he was going to free germany from the shackles of french-style drama . " shakespeare 's plays did not adhere to the classical unities of action , place and time as was common practice in french theater .
goethe once said of these unities that they were " as oppressive as prison . "
shakespeare represented a breath of fresh air and offered a whole new world of creative possibilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the globe is a reconstruction of the theater built by shakespeare 's company focus on nature " he was regarded as a new writer more than anything else , rather than a historical writer , a new type of writer and poet who would clearly bring poetry back to nature , " said goerner .
this idea married well with the principles of german classicism , and slowly shakespeare became an intrinsic part of a very german literary movement . by 1849 , the writer ferdinand freiligrath famously proclaimed " germany is hamlet , " revealing the extent to which shakespeare had infiltrated the german psyche by that time .
the legacy of this close bond with the bard from stratford-upon-avon can still be seen in german classrooms today . " there is indeed an affinity between the german language and the kind of poetic demands shakespeare makes , " said goerner .
" german , in that sense , is incredibly adaptable and you can mould german to capture the shakespearian vein , both in terms of his poetic approach and the sheer drama of the soul . " everyone 's favorite son if you think germany is alone in claiming shakespeare as its own , then think again .
" i had a moroccan film crew coming over they said ' our viewers at home think shakespeare really was an arab ! " ' said spottiswoode . he pointed out that the bard set his plays all over the world , taking his original london audiences on faraway travel .

"
this season , the globe theatre pays homage to this special relationship . blasphemous as it might seem at first glance , the globe theatre 's current program serves to highlight a rather special bond between the world 's most famous writer and a whole country . " what i am discovering more and more is how deeply -lsb- shakespeare -rsb- entered into the german psyche from the 18th century on , " said patrick spottiswoode , education director for the globe theatre and curator of the season . and shakespeare 's german connection has strong credentials .
for starters , there are more performances of shakespeare in germany in any given year than in england .
german was the first language shakespeare was ever translated into ; and the first shakespeare society in the world was founded in germany . " the germans in the 18th and 19th century regarded him as ' ganz unser ' - entirely ours , " added spottiswoode . translating frenzy the notion of " ownership " over shakespeare was propagated by a wealth of translations that began to appear as early as 1766 - 150 years after his death - with christoph martin wieland 's prose translation of 22 of the bard 's plays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hamlet , said ferdinand freiligrath " to translate the whole works of shakespeare is quite a task ” , said spottiswoode , " and there were successive translations of the entire works in the 18th and 19th centuries . " between 1818 and 1839 alone , eight separate translations of the entire works of shakespeare were published .
some even say that this helped to " improve " the german language , as new words had to be invented to complete the task . it was the schlegel-tieck edition of 1833 that set the gold standard for shakespeare translation and laid the foundations for successive generations of german writers to attempt their very own versions . a constant contemporary " from wieland and then fontane down to heiner mueller in the post-war period , you have a spectrum of writers of different kinds that all contributed crucially to insuring that every other generation of german readers and viewers would have their very own shakespeare in a new translation , " said professor ruediger goerner , director of anglo-german relations at the university of queen mary in london . " shakespeare has always been a contemporary author for german audiences , " he continued .
this continual element of newness has seen a wealth of unusual and avant-garde interpretations of shakespeare come out of germany . " i think there 's that sense that as soon as you translate him , you are freeing him , " said spottiswoode . the goethe factor one of shakespeare 's greatest advocates was germany 's favorite literary child himself .
in 1771 , a 22-year old johann wolfgang von goethe gave an impassioned speech on the merits of his " friend " across the north sea . spottiswoode commissioned a translation of this lecture into english , sparking the entire " shakespeare is german " season at the globe theatre . " it 's a very beautiful , lyrical , passionate avocation of shakespeare and how he could be important and how german culture and theater could learn so much from shakespeare , " commented spottiswoode .
" he was going to free germany from the shackles of french-style drama . " shakespeare 's plays did not adhere to the classical unities of action , place and time as was common practice in french theater .
goethe once said of these unities that they were " as oppressive as prison . "
shakespeare represented a breath of fresh air and offered a whole new world of creative possibilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the globe is a reconstruction of the theater built by shakespeare 's company focus on nature " he was regarded as a new writer more than anything else , rather than a historical writer , a new type of writer and poet who would clearly bring poetry back to nature , " said goerner .
this idea married well with the principles of german classicism , and slowly shakespeare became an intrinsic part of a very german literary movement . by 1849 , the writer ferdinand freiligrath famously proclaimed " germany is hamlet , " revealing the extent to which shakespeare had infiltrated the german psyche by that time .
the legacy of this close bond with the bard from stratford-upon-avon can still be seen in german classrooms today . " there is indeed an affinity between the german language and the kind of poetic demands shakespeare makes , " said goerner .
" german , in that sense , is incredibly adaptable and you can mould german to capture the shakespearian vein , both in terms of his poetic approach and the sheer drama of the soul . " everyone 's favorite son if you think germany is alone in claiming shakespeare as its own , then think again .
" i had a moroccan film crew coming over they said ' our viewers at home think shakespeare really was an arab ! " ' said spottiswoode . he pointed out that the bard set his plays all over the world , taking his original london audiences on faraway travel .

among those to go is the long-standing ceo of db 's long-distance travel unit . nikolaus breuel was responsible for deutsche bahn 's main-line routes long before 1999 , when the ' db fernverkehr ' subsidiary was founded as part of the db privatization process .
and he has been in charge ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolaus breuel is expected to lose his job but that now looks set to change .
members of db 's body of governors told the dpa news agency on tuesday that a non-scheduled board meeting had been called for friday to discuss personnel issues .
there has been significant speculation over the past weeks that ulrich homburg , managing director of db mobility and logistics , which oversees the long-distance division , is unhappy with breuel 's handling of a string of glitches to hit high-speed ice trains over the past couple of years .
the first major problem arose in 2008 when a broken axel highlighted a necessity for more frequent maintenance checks .
this led to a reduction in the number of reserve trains available on the network and saw service reliability drop as a result .
winter travelers have had to put up with regular delays and cancellations .
bildunterschrift : the heat was too much for too many passengers poor management public outrage reached a peak this summer when air conditioning in several high-speed trains failed and thousands of passengers had to be paid compensation .
in one incident , db customers were stranded for three hours in a tunnel when their train broke down in sweltering temperatures .
several passengers had to be taken to hospital . the combination of events has done nothing to enhance deutsche bahn 's image , and breuel , once pipped as a possible successor to the former ceo of the deutsche bahn group hartmut mehdorn , now looks set to take the rap .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 10.11.2010 opinion : a guilty conscience is no basis for membership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how should the eu deal with turkey 's membership hopes ?
many eu politicians have a guilty conscience over keeping ankara waiting .
but that 's a poor basis for making decisions , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . many eu politicians have a guilty conscience .
they do n't know how to deal with ankara ’ s hopes for speedy progress in the country 's bid for eu membership .
turkey is after all an official membership candidate and is trying to implement the reforms that brussels is calling for .
and from ankara 's perspective , this should eventually lead to full membership once the eu 's demands have been met .
so far , all previous membership candidates have eventually become full members .
but it 's clear that a guilty conscience alone is a poor basis for granting membership .
many european governments today regret that they – or their predecessors – have in past years given the green light for membership talks with turkey .
the doubts within the eu about whether turkey is fit for membership have since then only increased , and the arguments against membership have not changed .
they are not about individual points of criticism – be it cyprus or freedom of expression – but they are , in fact of a more fundamental nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations will continue to improve , but there wo n't be full membership , says hasselbach for instance , the eu still struggles with the consequences of its two previous expansion rounds in 2004 and 2007 .
and even if past expansion was not a mistake – the new members have significantly changed the european union .
the bloc 's ability to speak with one voice seems to be faltering – simply because the member states are too diverse and different .
these changes have to sink in and this process is bound to take time .
accepting turkey with its different history and tradition would from today 's perspective lead to a final stop to european integration .
has anyone ever thought of the fact that turkey would soon surpass germany as the most populous eu member state ?
turkey as a member would therefore have the right to demand more official posts than any of the other countries .
this would change the eu to an extent likely to cause sharp opposition .
and no one can guarantee that turkey will remain a secular state for good .
none of this calls into question the fact that the eu needs turkey and that turkey needs the eu .
the good trade relations and security cooperation should be built upon .
both sides are certain to do this for their very own interests .
and turkey is likely to continue its reform path even without the prospect of eu membership .
that 's why it ’ s wrong to argue that without membership talks , ankara will abandon reforms and look for other partners .
both sides need to look at the current situation .
it 's not a question of all or nothing .
and the eu should be honest with ankara that at the end of the path will be a closer relationship than today – but no full membership .

the case involves airlines that fly around the globe , from air france-klm , to british airways and quantas . the european union 's competition watchdog issued fines tuesday to 11 airlines totaling 799.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- for running a global cargo cartel .
the cargo carriers were found to have coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security over a six-year period , between 1999 and 2006 .
" with today 's decision , the european commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate cartel behavior , " eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner almunia said the case was " deplorable " the fine imposed is one of the biggest in eu history .
the bloc 's rules forbid most forms of price fixing among competitors .
" it is deplorable that so many major airlines coordinated their pricing to the detriment of european businesses and european consumers , " almunia added .
no fine for the whistleblower air france-klm was hit with the largest fine of 310 million euros .
british airways came in second , having to pay a 104-million-euro penalty .
luxembourg 's cargolux will have to pay 79.9 million euros , while scandinavian carrier sas was ordered to pay 70.2 million euros .
other airlines involved in the cartel and slapped with fines were singapore airlines , air canada , quantas , lan chile , martinair and japan airlines .
the commission said it dropped charges against eleven other airlines , including german carrier lufthansa and its subsidiary swiss air , because it was the first to provide information about the cartel .
according to the commission the cartel the airlines began fixing fuel-surcharges in 1999 .
later the cooperation expanded with the introduction of a security surcharge and refused to pay a commission on those surcharges to their clients .
" by refusing to pay a commission , the airlines ensured that surcharges did not become subject to competition through the granting of discounts to customers .
such practices are in breach of the eu competition rules , " the commission said in a statement .

" the energy challenge is one of the greatest tests europe has to face , " oettinger said on wednesday at the presentation of the bloc 's energy strategy for the next 10 years . " putting our energy system onto a new , more sustainable and secure path may take time but ambitious decisions need to be taken now . " the energy chief said individual governments ' priorities in the 27-member bloc had limited european energy policy in the past , and that this must change . " to have an efficient , competitive and low-carbon economy we have to europeanize our energy policy and focus on a few , but pressing , priorities , " oettinger said . energy connections between member states tend to be scattered and inefficient , a hangover from pre-eu times when most national grids were the property of state-run monopolies . " failing to achieve a well-functioning european energy market will only increase the costs for consumers and put europe 's competitiveness at risk , " he added . ending energy isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : encouraging energy savings was another of the report 's priorities in the context of russia 's gas disputes with its neighbours in recent years – and their knock-on consequences for europe – oettinger indicated that security was another reason for integrating networks , so as to prevent states from becoming overly dependent upon a single energy provider . " by 2015 , no member state should be isolated , " a european commission statement said on wednesday . oettinger said the eu 's executive would propose legislation in five key areas in the coming 18 months , including energy efficiency measures for businesses and private housholds . it will also push eu member states to accept a deadline of 2015 to link up all 27 national energy markets . the eu as well as european countries will have to update the energy grid to allow for decentralized power generation and distribution , according to stefan gsaenger , secretary general of the world wind energy association . " up to 10 or 20 years ago in germany we had dozens of huge power stations , " he told deutsche welle .
" today there are hundreds of thousands of power generation units in solar systems and wind farms that are all over germany .
that completely changes the grid . " gsaenger said he expects generation of local , small-scale renewable energy generation to continue increasing as the eu member states strive reach their announced goal of collectively sourcing 20 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2020 , which implies about 35 percent of electricity . funding for electricity grid improvements will come from taxpayers and power companies . german chancellor angela merkel had said earlier that european members should ensure new energy projects are commercially viable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.11.2010 currency likely to take center stage at seoul g20 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 summit starts in seoul on thursday the annual g20 summit starts in seoul on thursday , and artificial currency manipulation is likely to be a central issue .
in addition to keeping the " global currency war " from escalating , a common goal must be reaffirmed . the sheer scale of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit can be staggering .
representing 90 percent of the world 's economic power , and four-fifths of global trade , the summit is crisis-oriented .
it was called into life in 1999 as a reaction to financial crises in asia , brazil and russia , and was initially a meeting of financial ministers .
when lehman brothers investment bank collapsed in the fall of 2008 , it unleashed a global financial crisis , and the g20 became a vehicle to combat recession .
that 's when heads of state became involved .
it has been nearly two years since a package of financial measures was decided on in washington .
their aim is to ensure such an unprecedented global crisis never happens again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique strauss-kahn says global cooperation is needed for dominique strauss-kahn , a french politician and managing director of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the most important realization of the crisis is that egoism on the national level needs to yield to global cooperation .
" in my view one of the main features of this crisis has been the emergence of a willingness to work together , of a new kind of economic cooperation at the global level which never existed , never happened in the past , " strauss-kahn said in october at the annual meeting of the imf in washington .
according to strauss-kahn , that spirit of cooperation was present at past g20 summits in london , pittsburgh and toronto .
but the meeting starting thursday in seoul may show a decrease in countries ' willingness to cooperate at a global level .
" that is a real threat … there is no domestic solution to a global crisis , " he said .
summit as a litmus test the g20 summit participants surely know global cooperation is the way forward .
in the end , however , each country has to master its own national politics in order to institute financial reform .
that 's why german chancellor angela merkel says she is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far " in terms of the financial sector 's participation in carrying the costs of the crisis , the german government could have pictured more , " she told german parliamentarians in october as she outlined her goals for the seoul gathering .
while germany imposed a nationwide " financial crisis responsibility fee " on its banks , the g20 failed to agree on an international tax on financial markets .
nevertheless , europe will be bringing something to the table in seoul : its oversight of financial systems will be significantly improved .
risky financial products may be forbidden under certain circumstances and control over hedge funds and ratings agencies is being tightened .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has expressed concerns about the seoul g20 summit .
he says it comes at a critical point in time , as all parties will have to accept that global economic imbalances affect them all .
" it will be a real test of whether the g20 can deliver the coordination the world economy needs , " he wrote in an open letter .
no hint of unity despite numerous promises to disallow protectionism , the g20 nations are far from unified in their efforts to do so .
each is primarily acting with the strength its own domestic economy in mind , and the resulting imbalance is fertile ground for another crisis .
the trade balances of the individual countries – the ratio of their exports versus imports – is filled with dormant potential for conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imposed a fee on its banks , but an international tax was not agreed on in outlining her goals for the seoul g20 summit , merkel asked what countries can " do together for sustainable , strong and balanced growth . "
she wants to see this entirely accomplished by unadulterated market forces as such balances are an expression of economic competitiveness .
no answers on currency currency exchange rates are an inevitable source of controversy in the current scenario of global trade , and some analysts have already dubbed the situation a " global currency war . "
the problem is that some countries are trying to gain a competitive edge by devaluing their own currencies to make exports more attractive .
china and the united states are the primary practitioners of this tactic , with south korea , japan and brazil jointing in too .
a precarious race has begun .
the seoul g20 summit wo n't solve this problem , but merkel says that exchange rates should accurately reflect the fundamental data of a country 's domestic prosperity for the time being .
" a political scenario which targets currency distortion to strengthen economic competitiveness must be avoided , " merkel said .
france , which is due to take over south korea 's presidency of the g20 , wants to make currency policies a central issue .
still , one central issue may be the most important of all during the talks – whether the 20 nations can demonstrate they are all moving in the same direction , even if they were forced into negotiations by a crisis .

the case involves airlines that fly around the globe , from air france-klm , to british airways and quantas . the european union 's competition watchdog issued fines tuesday to 11 airlines totaling 799.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- for running a global cargo cartel .
the cargo carriers were found to have coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security over a six-year period , between 1999 and 2006 .
" with today 's decision , the european commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate cartel behavior , " eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner almunia said the case was " deplorable " the fine imposed is one of the biggest in eu history .
the bloc 's rules forbid most forms of price fixing among competitors .
" it is deplorable that so many major airlines coordinated their pricing to the detriment of european businesses and european consumers , " almunia added .
no fine for the whistleblower air france-klm was hit with the largest fine of 310 million euros .
british airways came in second , having to pay a 104-million-euro penalty .
luxembourg 's cargolux will have to pay 79.9 million euros , while scandinavian carrier sas was ordered to pay 70.2 million euros .
other airlines involved in the cartel and slapped with fines were singapore airlines , air canada , quantas , lan chile , martinair and japan airlines .
the commission said it dropped charges against eleven other airlines , including german carrier lufthansa and its subsidiary swiss air , because it was the first to provide information about the cartel .
according to the commission the cartel the airlines began fixing fuel-surcharges in 1999 .
later the cooperation expanded with the introduction of a security surcharge and refused to pay a commission on those surcharges to their clients .
" by refusing to pay a commission , the airlines ensured that surcharges did not become subject to competition through the granting of discounts to customers .
such practices are in breach of the eu competition rules , " the commission said in a statement .

consumers in the united states are central to its plans . after weathering a difficult year in 2009 and pinning its hopes on the 2010 world cup in south africa , german sporting goods company adidas has surged ahead in profits and now says it wants to outperform leading rival nike .
adidas wants to grow faster than nike through 2015 and increase its turnover by 45-50 percent to 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.4 billion -rrb- .
" we 're hoping this faster rate of growth will let us lay a foundation to be the market leader at a later point in time , " an adidas spokeswoman told deutsche welle .
nike , however , is moving forward with goals of its own .
it hopes to generate 19.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 27 billion -rrb- in revenue by 2015 .
in the first nine months of 2010 , adidas primarily grew in the united states , china and russia , according to the company 's spokeswoman .
most of the growth was generated in the sports style , fashion and lifestyle sectors , as well as the reebok brand , which it bought in 2006 .

but that pales in comparison to the us . "
powell also said that both adidas and reebok had been losing market share in footwear " until very recently . "
" i really think that part of why adidas has struggled in the us is because they really do n't have a clear understanding of what the us consumer wants , " he said . " -lrb- but -rrb- i think they 're doing a much better job today than they were five years ago . "

lidl has come under particular fire over pay and practices . supermarkets across germany are popular places to buy clothes .
prices are cheap : you can buy a men 's shirt for seven euros -lrb- nine us dollars -rrb- or a pair of women 's trousers for under 10 euros .
however two women from bangladesh are currently on a speaking tour of germany to highlight how these cheap prices come at a human cost .
26-year-old jessmin begum and 36-year-old arifa akter both work as seamstresses in clothes factories in dhaka that make clothes for european stores .
they say the working conditions are terrible and the pay is inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers complain about cramped conditions , dirty water and tough bosses " i 'm proud of my work , especially when i see people here wearing my clothes , " said begum , who works for a factory that supplies clothes to german-based supermarket chain lidl .
" but it makes me mad that what we get for our work in bangladesh is nothing . "
not a living wage as a seamstress , jessmin begum earns around 35 euros a month -lrb- just under 4,000 bangladesh taka -rrb- .
the monthly rent for a one room apartment in dhaka is around 25 euros a month .
" it is not even close to the living wage we have calculated , " said khorshed alam from the campaigning group alternative movement for resources and freedom society -lrb- amrf -rrb- .
with calculations based on someone working a 12- to 14-hour day , the amrf estimates around 5,000 taka a month -lrb- 52 euros -rrb- is necessary for a single worker .
a family needs to earn around 9-10,000 taka .
dirty water , mean bosses , unpaid overtime the two seamstresses are using their tour of germany to highlight how bad working conditions are in the factories .
" the drinking water is dirty and we are packed in with little space between the machines , " said begum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessmin begum has been working as a seamstress in dhaka for eight years " our supervisors insult us and put us under pressure to work harder .
almost every day i do overtime and i hardly ever come home much earlier than midnight , " she added .
the workers have no sick pay or other benefits , so most seamstresses continue to work even when ill .
highlighting the problem jessmin and arifa 's tour of germany was organized by the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- , which campaigns worldwide to promote better working conditions and fair wages .
the ccc wants international corporations to stick to their pledges to provide better labor conditions .
" for years companies have been saying they are willing to meet certain standards , but it 's only on paper , not in actions , " said the ccc 's gisela burckhardt .
" we want a proper legal framework so that companies can see the impact of their activities on the environment and people in other countries , " burckhardt argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this dhaka garment factory was visited by the ccc in 2009 khorshed alam from the amrf added that it is also the responsibility of the bangladeshi government to monitor the brands which manufacture clothes in the country , and to ensure they implement local labor laws .
making consumers aware in addition to putting pressure on manufacturers and local governments , the tour aims to give consumers more awareness of the origin of their cheap shirts and trousers .
" i came here because the people who buy our products have no idea where they came from , or how much we suffer , " said begum .
the amrf want consumers to question companies like lidl who sell cheap clothes , while claiming they pay their workers well .
in response to the claims , a spokesperson for lidl said they completely oppose any form of child labor and violations of workers ' rights .
they also added that lidl was the first german discount store to join the business social compliance initiative which works to improve working conditions in supply networks worldwide .

major powers are likely to disagree on currency policy and plans to end exceptional economic stimulus measures . chancellor angela merkel called on world powers to coordinate plans for weaning their national economies off economic stimulus measures , and warned against creating new asset bubbles .
" there will of course be a discussion about exit strategies , " merkel told reporters before flying to seoul for the meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- top rich and emerging nations .
" it is naturally desirable that the leading economic powers do not come up with answers which are too varied to the question as to when the exit strategy should begin , " she said .
" this could be a thoroughly lively debate . "
defusing the dollar asked about the united states ' policy of " quantitative easing , " which has seen the federal reserve pump 600 billion dollars into its fragile economy , merkel said : " we are going to discuss this issue with the americans in a spirit of partnership . "
" nobody has an interest in creating new bubbles .
rather , we must see to it that growth in the global economy this year is more sustainable and enduring than we had a few years ago , " she said .
critics argue that the fed 's quantitative easing amounts to an effective dollar devaluation , and has the potential to trigger a 1930s-style trade war if other countries respond in kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is accused of weakening its currency to promote economic growth with this in mind , merkel also pressed her fellow leaders to avoid any form of protectionism , amid criticism that certain countries , notably china and japan , are keeping their currencies artificially low to encourage exports .
but she declined to criticize beijing for its foreign exchange policy , saying : " i assume that china has a very strong interest in sending a positive signal from this summit . "
" china also needs sustainable growth for its overall economic situation , " the chancellor added .
germany is the world 's second-biggest exporter after china .
its strong export sector has helped it stage an impressive economic comeback this year , but its trade surpluses have also drawn criticism abroad .
no fixed numbers merkel said germany would not accept fixed targets for addressing countries ' trade gaps .
" we reject quantified bandwidths for acceptable imbalances for good reason because ... competitiveness must be able to express itself , also in export ratios . "
merkel said germany wants to see leaders commit themselves to the final stretch of the doha round of global trade talks .
she added that trade barriers posed the biggest danger to sustained world growth .
" the biggest danger for sustainable growth is currently coming from protectionism in its different forms , " she said .

major powers are likely to disagree on currency policy and plans to end exceptional economic stimulus measures . chancellor angela merkel called on world powers to coordinate plans for weaning their national economies off economic stimulus measures , and warned against creating new asset bubbles .

" the energy challenge is one of the greatest tests europe has to face , " oettinger said on wednesday at the presentation of the bloc 's energy strategy for the next 10 years . " putting our energy system onto a new , more sustainable and secure path may take time but ambitious decisions need to be taken now . " the energy chief said individual governments ' priorities in the 27-member bloc had limited european energy policy in the past , and that this must change . " to have an efficient , competitive and low-carbon economy we have to europeanize our energy policy and focus on a few , but pressing , priorities , " oettinger said . energy connections between member states tend to be scattered and inefficient , a hangover from pre-eu times when most national grids were the property of state-run monopolies . " failing to achieve a well-functioning european energy market will only increase the costs for consumers and put europe 's competitiveness at risk , " he added . ending energy isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : encouraging energy savings was another of the report 's priorities in the context of russia 's gas disputes with its neighbours in recent years – and their knock-on consequences for europe – oettinger indicated that security was another reason for integrating networks , so as to prevent states from becoming overly dependent upon a single energy provider . " by 2015 , no member state should be isolated , " a european commission statement said on wednesday . oettinger said the eu 's executive would propose legislation in five key areas in the coming 18 months , including energy efficiency measures for businesses and private housholds . it will also push eu member states to accept a deadline of 2015 to link up all 27 national energy markets . the eu as well as european countries will have to update the energy grid to allow for decentralized power generation and distribution , according to stefan gsaenger , secretary general of the world wind energy association . " up to 10 or 20 years ago in germany we had dozens of huge power stations , " he told deutsche welle .
" today there are hundreds of thousands of power generation units in solar systems and wind farms that are all over germany .
that completely changes the grid . " gsaenger said he expects generation of local , small-scale renewable energy generation to continue increasing as the eu member states strive reach their announced goal of collectively sourcing 20 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2020 , which implies about 35 percent of electricity . funding for electricity grid improvements will come from taxpayers and power companies . german chancellor angela merkel had said earlier that european members should ensure new energy projects are commercially viable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.11.2010 as bush plugs his memoir , european anger still simmers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-president bush has reignited dormant anger in europe as george w. bush returns to the public eye to promote his recently published memoirs , he is polarizing opinion .
his book is unlikely to help heal the rift that emerged between the us and europe while he was in office . the 43rd us president 's apparent mission to have his two terms in the white house reassessed and his reputation rehabilitated through his new book , " decision points , " has many europeans shaking their heads . and it 's not just the most inflammatory excerpts - such as bush 's assertion that water-boarding of terror suspects saved lives - that are causing an outcry . bush 's supporters in the us say that every president has the right to defend his record ; " decision points " shows the former president as a man who was ideologically consistent during his eight years in office . his detractors counter that the president 's mistakes and his determination to follow ill-thought-out policies - without a thought for a possible , rectifying change of direction - plunged the us into a decade of war and the worst financial crisis in over 80 years .
while george w. bush may have been a good guy with a difficult job , they say , he does n't deserve to be rehabilitated via his memoirs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush left office with two wars and an economic crisis raging if bush 's single-minded and heavy-handed approach to afghanistan and iraq in the wake of the terror attacks of 9/11 were damaging to his relations with his european allies at the time , his newly released memoirs appear to be giving european readers the chance get angry all over again . europeans , even allies , dismissed as irrelevant " in my opinion , there ’ s been no change in perception of bush in europe , " dr. henning meyer , a transatlantic relations expert at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle . " his legacy projects , such as iraq and afghanistan , are still the main issues associated with his presidency and of course europeans are still affected by these and in most cases are still in opposition to a certain degree .
if you remember , bush ’ s war on terror effectively split europe .
so these things have not been forgotten . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush says the uk 's perception of him does n't matter in " decision points , " bush is dismissive about those europeans who had taken a risk to follow him into war in iraq , and he talks frankly about his reputation in the one country whose leaders followed him most obediently of all : england .
" it does n't matter how people perceive me in england , " he writes .
" it just does n't matter any more .
and frankly , at times , it did n't matter then . " in a veiled dig at what he saw at the time as the rest of europe 's lack of stomach for the fight , bush writes : " people in europe said : ' ah , man , he 's a religious fanatic , cowboy , simpleton . '
all that stuff ...
if you believe that freedom is universal , then you should n't be surprised when people take courageous measures to live in a free society . " he reserves his most scathing treatment for those european leaders who disappointed him most , especially during the iraq war : former german chancellor gerhard schroeder comes in for even worse treatment than former french president jacques chirac , schroeder 's ally in the european anti-war opposition . german emotions still raw over bush 's rush to war in the book , bush accuses schroeder of abusing his trust after allegedly telling the president in 2002 , before the invasion of iraq the following year , that " what goes for afghanistan also goes for iraq .
nations which support terrorism must accept the consequences .
if you go forward fast and resolutely , i am on your side . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush did n't trust schroeder after the latter withdrew his support however , struggling in his re-election campaign in the fall of that year , schroeder hitched his wagon to the huge swell of anti-war feeling in germany and across europe .
he claims bush is lying when he says that he had offered his support for an invasion , and that he 'd made it clear all along that his support was conditional on whether iraq really had weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- . " schroeder 's support -lrb- for the invasion of iraq -rrb- was conditional on evidence being found of terrorists being harbored in iraq , so when there was no evidence delivered , he withdrew his support , " lse professor meyer told deutsche welle .
" bush is attempting to polish his own picture of this situation with the germans by saying that the breakdown in relations was not his fault and that it was schroeder who turned opinion against him . " the bush legacy is still powerfully felt in the united states : the armed forces are embroiled in the two wars he started ; the financial system is struggling to pull out of an overwhelming crisis , and politicians are scrambling to rebuild their credibility on the world stage . but the ripples from his eight-year presidency continue to be felt in europe as well .
under his leadership , decades of trust and cooperation between the us and european governments was damaged . according to thomas klau , a transatlantic relations expert at the european council for foreign relations , the memoir provides new fodder for europeans who are skeptical about the us political system . " europeans , and germans in particular , are still amazed that the us political system has the potential to elect such an incompetent leader who has no respect for western values , " klau said .
" while obama gave some hope , the germans are now saddened to see that a discredited party such as the republicans can be re-elected as the majority in the house of representatives . " germans see the republican mid-term victory as proof that " the us system and electorate has a very short memory and very little wisdom . " european anger reignited over torture statements so far , european reaction to the bush memoirs has been heavily affected by comments in the book that seem to advocate torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims water boarding extracted vital information for meyer , the water-boarding comments are " a very clear example of the philosophical differences between the bush administration and the europeans . " " there is a huge difference in what bush thought was acceptable in terms of the war on terror and what the europeans thought , " he added .
" bush saw approaches such as water-boarding as not a breaking of any laws but a legitimate bending of them . " moreover , bush " made bold statements " that the information gained from water-boarding stopped an attack on london - a claim the uk refutes . " most people in europe say that there were other ways of getting the information and that bush ’ s assertions are just not true , " meyer said . severe - and lasting - damage ? the response to his memoirs suggests that the damage bush did to his country 's reputation in europe remains severe . " bush 's was the worst us presidency that europe and the world has ever seen and his legacy , in political and economic terms , will be seen as one of disaster , " said klau .
" few people will expect to see any change in this perception arising from his memoirs .
in fact , it 's highly likely that his already terrible reputation in europe will take an even worse turn . " bush may have come out with his book to try and put the record straight in his own words .
but in doing so , at least in europe , it appears that he has taken a big stick to a hornet 's nest of his own making . author : nick amies editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 10.11.2010 opinion : a guilty conscience is no basis for membership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how should the eu deal with turkey 's membership hopes ?
many eu politicians have a guilty conscience over keeping ankara waiting .
but that 's a poor basis for making decisions , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . many eu politicians have a guilty conscience .
they do n't know how to deal with ankara ’ s hopes for speedy progress in the country 's bid for eu membership .
turkey is after all an official membership candidate and is trying to implement the reforms that brussels is calling for .
and from ankara 's perspective , this should eventually lead to full membership once the eu 's demands have been met .
so far , all previous membership candidates have eventually become full members .
but it 's clear that a guilty conscience alone is a poor basis for granting membership .
many european governments today regret that they – or their predecessors – have in past years given the green light for membership talks with turkey .
the doubts within the eu about whether turkey is fit for membership have since then only increased , and the arguments against membership have not changed .
they are not about individual points of criticism – be it cyprus or freedom of expression – but they are , in fact of a more fundamental nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations will continue to improve , but there wo n't be full membership , says hasselbach for instance , the eu still struggles with the consequences of its two previous expansion rounds in 2004 and 2007 .
and even if past expansion was not a mistake – the new members have significantly changed the european union .
the bloc 's ability to speak with one voice seems to be faltering – simply because the member states are too diverse and different .
these changes have to sink in and this process is bound to take time .
accepting turkey with its different history and tradition would from today 's perspective lead to a final stop to european integration .
has anyone ever thought of the fact that turkey would soon surpass germany as the most populous eu member state ?
turkey as a member would therefore have the right to demand more official posts than any of the other countries .
this would change the eu to an extent likely to cause sharp opposition .
and no one can guarantee that turkey will remain a secular state for good .
none of this calls into question the fact that the eu needs turkey and that turkey needs the eu .
the good trade relations and security cooperation should be built upon .
both sides are certain to do this for their very own interests .
and turkey is likely to continue its reform path even without the prospect of eu membership .
that 's why it ’ s wrong to argue that without membership talks , ankara will abandon reforms and look for other partners .
both sides need to look at the current situation .
it 's not a question of all or nothing .
and the eu should be honest with ankara that at the end of the path will be a closer relationship than today – but no full membership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 10.11.2010 security flaw discovered in german digital id card software großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new electronic id card was released on november 1 one day after its release , the software used to read new german id cards is shown to be vulnerable to attack .
the federal office for information security has removed links to the program from its website . jan schejbal , a german computer security researcher living in sweden , on tuesday described a way to hack the new electronic german id card software .
the federal office responsible for the program stopped allowing the software to be downloaded on wednesday . the new cards , which became available november 1 and will gradually replace current german cards , contain an rfid wireless chip - the same kind found in many contactless security or payment keycards .
the chip stores digital versions of the card holder 's photo , name , address , date of birth , height , eye and hair color and location of issuance . the interior ministry and the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- have claimed the cards will help the government provide easy-to-use digital signatures and other government services , as well as protection against online scams and phishing attacks .
germans can also use the ids in place of a passport when traveling within the european union . spoofing the server but to be useful to individuals , the digital information on the cards needs to be accessed with a card reader .
it 's the ausweisapp -lrb- " id app " -rrb- software that runs the card reader which is flawed , according to schejbal . after downloading the first version of ausweisapp from a german government website , he noticed a major flaw when the program checks for updates .
the software does not verify the origin of a digital security -lrb- ssl -rrb- certificate , which leaves the program open to a spoof attack that conceivably could lead to the download of malicious software . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia has had digital id cards for eight years " the electronic id itself may have quite a high security level , " said schejbal in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" however , this security becomes worthless if the framework which is used to access this secure core is insecure and allows compromising overall security . " had the new electronic id card already been widely used , the security flaw in updating would have been significant , according to karsten nohl , an independent security expert based in berlin . " fortunately , that is not the case and the bug can be fixed swiftly , " he told deutsche welle .
" this vulnerability is another reminder of the complexity of the id card security system , not all of which has been tested rigorously . " in a statement to the german tech news website heise.de , the bsi said it was looking into the update issue .
it also removed the software from its website to prevent more people from downloading the flawed program . " the media has been made aware of a perceived vulnerability in the software ausweisapp necessary for the eid feature of the new id card , " it wrote .
bsi did not reply to deutsche welle 's request for comment .
" if a vulnerability exists in the software , the bsi will provide a new version of the software without delay and will inform the public accordingly . " digital id cards expanding across europe digital ids have been spreading across the continent in recent years .
estonia has had one for nearly a decade , with a slew of electronic government services , and legally binding digital signatures to go along with it .
belgium , sweden , spain , portugal all currently have electronic id cards , and there are plans in place to release such cards in luxembourg and the czech republic . while schejbal added that he is not opposed to the concept of an electronic id , he advised germans to avoid the cards for as long as possible . " it is not secure , and it will put the user at risk , " he wrote .
" if the electronic identity is abused , the user will have a hard time proving that he did not authorize a transaction . " previous flaws have been discovered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital id cards have a corresponding reader when used with a computer schejbal 's discovery is n't the first time security flaws were found in the new electronic id cards .
in september , the german hacker collective the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- demonstrated how the card reader 's security measures could be circumvented . after obtaining an id card 's pin number by using a program that records individual keystrokes , the hackers were able to rewrite all the information on the id .
card readers come in a variety of models , and the ccc circumvented the most basic model . security researchers have doubts manuel bach , the electronic id project manager at the bsi , responded by saying that germans must take responsibility for their own computer security and ensure their computers remain free of the malicious software needed to steal pins and other personal data . " the germany id card ca n't protect you from trojan horses , it 's just a piece of plastic with a microchip inside , " he told deutsche welle in an interview last month .
" you as a citizen or computer user have a responsibility to secure your system .
if you do that you 're very safe , even with a basic card reader . " but constanze kurz , a ccc spokeswoman , said the government should n't expect all germans to be tech whizzes . " if you pretend that all your citizens are really good with computers , and that they can manage their own it security on their systems , then you are definitely wrong , " she said in an interview with deutsche welle .

lidl has come under particular fire over pay and practices . supermarkets across germany are popular places to buy clothes .
prices are cheap : you can buy a men 's shirt for seven euros -lrb- nine us dollars -rrb- or a pair of women 's trousers for under 10 euros .
however two women from bangladesh are currently on a speaking tour of germany to highlight how these cheap prices come at a human cost .
26-year-old jessmin begum and 36-year-old arifa akter both work as seamstresses in clothes factories in dhaka that make clothes for european stores .
they say the working conditions are terrible and the pay is inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers complain about cramped conditions , dirty water and tough bosses " i 'm proud of my work , especially when i see people here wearing my clothes , " said begum , who works for a factory that supplies clothes to german-based supermarket chain lidl .
" but it makes me mad that what we get for our work in bangladesh is nothing . "
not a living wage as a seamstress , jessmin begum earns around 35 euros a month -lrb- just under 4,000 bangladesh taka -rrb- .
the monthly rent for a one room apartment in dhaka is around 25 euros a month .
" it is not even close to the living wage we have calculated , " said khorshed alam from the campaigning group alternative movement for resources and freedom society -lrb- amrf -rrb- .
with calculations based on someone working a 12- to 14-hour day , the amrf estimates around 5,000 taka a month -lrb- 52 euros -rrb- is necessary for a single worker .
a family needs to earn around 9-10,000 taka .
dirty water , mean bosses , unpaid overtime the two seamstresses are using their tour of germany to highlight how bad working conditions are in the factories .
" the drinking water is dirty and we are packed in with little space between the machines , " said begum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessmin begum has been working as a seamstress in dhaka for eight years " our supervisors insult us and put us under pressure to work harder .
almost every day i do overtime and i hardly ever come home much earlier than midnight , " she added .
the workers have no sick pay or other benefits , so most seamstresses continue to work even when ill .
highlighting the problem jessmin and arifa 's tour of germany was organized by the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- , which campaigns worldwide to promote better working conditions and fair wages .
the ccc wants international corporations to stick to their pledges to provide better labor conditions .
" for years companies have been saying they are willing to meet certain standards , but it 's only on paper , not in actions , " said the ccc 's gisela burckhardt .
" we want a proper legal framework so that companies can see the impact of their activities on the environment and people in other countries , " burckhardt argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this dhaka garment factory was visited by the ccc in 2009 khorshed alam from the amrf added that it is also the responsibility of the bangladeshi government to monitor the brands which manufacture clothes in the country , and to ensure they implement local labor laws .
making consumers aware in addition to putting pressure on manufacturers and local governments , the tour aims to give consumers more awareness of the origin of their cheap shirts and trousers .
" i came here because the people who buy our products have no idea where they came from , or how much we suffer , " said begum .
the amrf want consumers to question companies like lidl who sell cheap clothes , while claiming they pay their workers well .
in response to the claims , a spokesperson for lidl said they completely oppose any form of child labor and violations of workers ' rights .
they also added that lidl was the first german discount store to join the business social compliance initiative which works to improve working conditions in supply networks worldwide .

his book is unlikely to help heal the rift that emerged between the us and europe while he was in office . the 43rd us president 's apparent mission to have his two terms in the white house reassessed and his reputation rehabilitated through his new book , " decision points , " has many europeans shaking their heads . and it 's not just the most inflammatory excerpts - such as bush 's assertion that water-boarding of terror suspects saved lives - that are causing an outcry . bush 's supporters in the us say that every president has the right to defend his record ; " decision points " shows the former president as a man who was ideologically consistent during his eight years in office . his detractors counter that the president 's mistakes and his determination to follow ill-thought-out policies - without a thought for a possible , rectifying change of direction - plunged the us into a decade of war and the worst financial crisis in over 80 years .
while george w. bush may have been a good guy with a difficult job , they say , he does n't deserve to be rehabilitated via his memoirs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush left office with two wars and an economic crisis raging if bush 's single-minded and heavy-handed approach to afghanistan and iraq in the wake of the terror attacks of 9/11 were damaging to his relations with his european allies at the time , his newly released memoirs appear to be giving european readers the chance get angry all over again . europeans , even allies , dismissed as irrelevant " in my opinion , there ’ s been no change in perception of bush in europe , " dr. henning meyer , a transatlantic relations expert at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle .

" it just does n't matter any more .
and frankly , at times , it did n't matter then . " in a veiled dig at what he saw at the time as the rest of europe 's lack of stomach for the fight , bush writes : " people in europe said : ' ah , man , he 's a religious fanatic , cowboy , simpleton . '

" schroeder 's support -lrb- for the invasion of iraq -rrb- was conditional on evidence being found of terrorists being harbored in iraq , so when there was no evidence delivered , he withdrew his support , " lse professor meyer told deutsche welle .
" bush is attempting to polish his own picture of this situation with the germans by saying that the breakdown in relations was not his fault and that it was schroeder who turned opinion against him . " the bush legacy is still powerfully felt in the united states : the armed forces are embroiled in the two wars he started ; the financial system is struggling to pull out of an overwhelming crisis , and politicians are scrambling to rebuild their credibility on the world stage . but the ripples from his eight-year presidency continue to be felt in europe as well .

sarkozy wasted no time in signing the bill on wednesday , just hours after the court ruling .
he said in a statement that while he heard the concerns expressed by opponents during the debate , it was his " duty " to ensure the pension fund 's integrity .
" with this law , our redistributive pension system has been saved , " he said .
" french citizens can now be assured that they can count on their retirement and that pension payments will be maintained . "
sarkozy 's right-of-center government insisted the reform , which raises the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the full retirement age from 65 to 67 , was necessary to fill a major budget gap as france 's population ages and few workers are paying into the system .
the law will gradually come into effect in july 2011 and will be fully enacted by 2018 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive strikes and protests against the reform disrupted society socialists vow a repeal opposition socialists and other parties asked the country 's highest court to examine the constitutionality of the law on november 2 , saying it contradicted france 's principles of equality .
the court rejected the challenge , but the socialists have vowed to repeal the law if they win the next presidential election in 2012 .
" the president is confusing appearance with reality , he thinks that by putting his head down and charging forward without listening , he 's showing courage , " said socialist leader martine aubry .
" it would have been courage to put in place a reform that really solves the problem of retirement . "
as the reform was in debate in the legislature , massive protests and nationwide strikes crippled the country 's transportation system and all but shut down the oil industry , leaving many gas stations without fuel for cars .
unions have called for another day of strikes on november 23 , but it was unclear how many would take part , as the public opposition to the bill was running out of steam toward the end of the debate .

lidl has come under particular fire over pay and practices . supermarkets across germany are popular places to buy clothes .
prices are cheap : you can buy a men 's shirt for seven euros -lrb- nine us dollars -rrb- or a pair of women 's trousers for under 10 euros .
however two women from bangladesh are currently on a speaking tour of germany to highlight how these cheap prices come at a human cost .
26-year-old jessmin begum and 36-year-old arifa akter both work as seamstresses in clothes factories in dhaka that make clothes for european stores .
they say the working conditions are terrible and the pay is inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers complain about cramped conditions , dirty water and tough bosses " i 'm proud of my work , especially when i see people here wearing my clothes , " said begum , who works for a factory that supplies clothes to german-based supermarket chain lidl .
" but it makes me mad that what we get for our work in bangladesh is nothing . "
not a living wage as a seamstress , jessmin begum earns around 35 euros a month -lrb- just under 4,000 bangladesh taka -rrb- .
the monthly rent for a one room apartment in dhaka is around 25 euros a month .
" it is not even close to the living wage we have calculated , " said khorshed alam from the campaigning group alternative movement for resources and freedom society -lrb- amrf -rrb- .
with calculations based on someone working a 12- to 14-hour day , the amrf estimates around 5,000 taka a month -lrb- 52 euros -rrb- is necessary for a single worker .
a family needs to earn around 9-10,000 taka .
dirty water , mean bosses , unpaid overtime the two seamstresses are using their tour of germany to highlight how bad working conditions are in the factories .
" the drinking water is dirty and we are packed in with little space between the machines , " said begum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessmin begum has been working as a seamstress in dhaka for eight years " our supervisors insult us and put us under pressure to work harder .
almost every day i do overtime and i hardly ever come home much earlier than midnight , " she added .
the workers have no sick pay or other benefits , so most seamstresses continue to work even when ill .
highlighting the problem jessmin and arifa 's tour of germany was organized by the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- , which campaigns worldwide to promote better working conditions and fair wages .
the ccc wants international corporations to stick to their pledges to provide better labor conditions .
" for years companies have been saying they are willing to meet certain standards , but it 's only on paper , not in actions , " said the ccc 's gisela burckhardt .
" we want a proper legal framework so that companies can see the impact of their activities on the environment and people in other countries , " burckhardt argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this dhaka garment factory was visited by the ccc in 2009 khorshed alam from the amrf added that it is also the responsibility of the bangladeshi government to monitor the brands which manufacture clothes in the country , and to ensure they implement local labor laws .
making consumers aware in addition to putting pressure on manufacturers and local governments , the tour aims to give consumers more awareness of the origin of their cheap shirts and trousers .
" i came here because the people who buy our products have no idea where they came from , or how much we suffer , " said begum .
the amrf want consumers to question companies like lidl who sell cheap clothes , while claiming they pay their workers well .
in response to the claims , a spokesperson for lidl said they completely oppose any form of child labor and violations of workers ' rights .
they also added that lidl was the first german discount store to join the business social compliance initiative which works to improve working conditions in supply networks worldwide .

the case involves airlines that fly around the globe , from air france-klm , to british airways and quantas . the european union 's competition watchdog issued fines tuesday to 11 airlines totaling 799.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- for running a global cargo cartel .
the cargo carriers were found to have coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security over a six-year period , between 1999 and 2006 .
" with today 's decision , the european commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate cartel behavior , " eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner almunia said the case was " deplorable " the fine imposed is one of the biggest in eu history .
the bloc 's rules forbid most forms of price fixing among competitors .
" it is deplorable that so many major airlines coordinated their pricing to the detriment of european businesses and european consumers , " almunia added .
no fine for the whistleblower air france-klm was hit with the largest fine of 310 million euros .
british airways came in second , having to pay a 104-million-euro penalty .
luxembourg 's cargolux will have to pay 79.9 million euros , while scandinavian carrier sas was ordered to pay 70.2 million euros .
other airlines involved in the cartel and slapped with fines were singapore airlines , air canada , quantas , lan chile , martinair and japan airlines .
the commission said it dropped charges against eleven other airlines , including german carrier lufthansa and its subsidiary swiss air , because it was the first to provide information about the cartel .
according to the commission the cartel the airlines began fixing fuel-surcharges in 1999 .
later the cooperation expanded with the introduction of a security surcharge and refused to pay a commission on those surcharges to their clients .
" by refusing to pay a commission , the airlines ensured that surcharges did not become subject to competition through the granting of discounts to customers .
such practices are in breach of the eu competition rules , " the commission said in a statement .

sarkozy wasted no time in signing the bill on wednesday , just hours after the court ruling .
he said in a statement that while he heard the concerns expressed by opponents during the debate , it was his " duty " to ensure the pension fund 's integrity .
" with this law , our redistributive pension system has been saved , " he said .
" french citizens can now be assured that they can count on their retirement and that pension payments will be maintained . "
sarkozy 's right-of-center government insisted the reform , which raises the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the full retirement age from 65 to 67 , was necessary to fill a major budget gap as france 's population ages and few workers are paying into the system .
the law will gradually come into effect in july 2011 and will be fully enacted by 2018 .

the court rejected the challenge , but the socialists have vowed to repeal the law if they win the next presidential election in 2012 .
" the president is confusing appearance with reality , he thinks that by putting his head down and charging forward without listening , he 's showing courage , " said socialist leader martine aubry .
" it would have been courage to put in place a reform that really solves the problem of retirement . "
as the reform was in debate in the legislature , massive protests and nationwide strikes crippled the country 's transportation system and all but shut down the oil industry , leaving many gas stations without fuel for cars .
unions have called for another day of strikes on november 23 , but it was unclear how many would take part , as the public opposition to the bill was running out of steam toward the end of the debate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 10.11.2010 security flaw discovered in german digital id card software großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new electronic id card was released on november 1 one day after its release , the software used to read new german id cards is shown to be vulnerable to attack .
the federal office for information security has removed links to the program from its website . jan schejbal , a german computer security researcher living in sweden , on tuesday described a way to hack the new electronic german id card software .
the federal office responsible for the program stopped allowing the software to be downloaded on wednesday . the new cards , which became available november 1 and will gradually replace current german cards , contain an rfid wireless chip - the same kind found in many contactless security or payment keycards .
the chip stores digital versions of the card holder 's photo , name , address , date of birth , height , eye and hair color and location of issuance . the interior ministry and the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- have claimed the cards will help the government provide easy-to-use digital signatures and other government services , as well as protection against online scams and phishing attacks .
germans can also use the ids in place of a passport when traveling within the european union . spoofing the server but to be useful to individuals , the digital information on the cards needs to be accessed with a card reader .
it 's the ausweisapp -lrb- " id app " -rrb- software that runs the card reader which is flawed , according to schejbal . after downloading the first version of ausweisapp from a german government website , he noticed a major flaw when the program checks for updates .
the software does not verify the origin of a digital security -lrb- ssl -rrb- certificate , which leaves the program open to a spoof attack that conceivably could lead to the download of malicious software . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia has had digital id cards for eight years " the electronic id itself may have quite a high security level , " said schejbal in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" however , this security becomes worthless if the framework which is used to access this secure core is insecure and allows compromising overall security . " had the new electronic id card already been widely used , the security flaw in updating would have been significant , according to karsten nohl , an independent security expert based in berlin . " fortunately , that is not the case and the bug can be fixed swiftly , " he told deutsche welle .
" this vulnerability is another reminder of the complexity of the id card security system , not all of which has been tested rigorously . " in a statement to the german tech news website heise.de , the bsi said it was looking into the update issue .
it also removed the software from its website to prevent more people from downloading the flawed program . " the media has been made aware of a perceived vulnerability in the software ausweisapp necessary for the eid feature of the new id card , " it wrote .
bsi did not reply to deutsche welle 's request for comment .
" if a vulnerability exists in the software , the bsi will provide a new version of the software without delay and will inform the public accordingly . " digital id cards expanding across europe digital ids have been spreading across the continent in recent years .
estonia has had one for nearly a decade , with a slew of electronic government services , and legally binding digital signatures to go along with it .
belgium , sweden , spain , portugal all currently have electronic id cards , and there are plans in place to release such cards in luxembourg and the czech republic . while schejbal added that he is not opposed to the concept of an electronic id , he advised germans to avoid the cards for as long as possible . " it is not secure , and it will put the user at risk , " he wrote .
" if the electronic identity is abused , the user will have a hard time proving that he did not authorize a transaction . " previous flaws have been discovered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital id cards have a corresponding reader when used with a computer schejbal 's discovery is n't the first time security flaws were found in the new electronic id cards .
in september , the german hacker collective the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- demonstrated how the card reader 's security measures could be circumvented . after obtaining an id card 's pin number by using a program that records individual keystrokes , the hackers were able to rewrite all the information on the id .
card readers come in a variety of models , and the ccc circumvented the most basic model . security researchers have doubts manuel bach , the electronic id project manager at the bsi , responded by saying that germans must take responsibility for their own computer security and ensure their computers remain free of the malicious software needed to steal pins and other personal data . " the germany id card ca n't protect you from trojan horses , it 's just a piece of plastic with a microchip inside , " he told deutsche welle in an interview last month .
" you as a citizen or computer user have a responsibility to secure your system .
if you do that you 're very safe , even with a basic card reader . " but constanze kurz , a ccc spokeswoman , said the government should n't expect all germans to be tech whizzes . " if you pretend that all your citizens are really good with computers , and that they can manage their own it security on their systems , then you are definitely wrong , " she said in an interview with deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 10.11.2010 a year after the suicide of goalkeeper enke – has football changed ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover fans commemorated enke after his suicide the suicide of german national goalkeeper robert enke a year ago sent a wave of shock through the world of soccer .
clubs promised to help depressed players .
however in football , does success come first ? professional football can put enormous pressure on its players .
in the bundesliga , the race for goals , points , championship and money can all pile on the pressure .
however , one year on from the tragic death of former national goalkeeper robert enke , what has really changed to help troubled players ?
as goalkeeper for eintracht frankfurt , bochum , stuttgart and kaiserslautern , thomas ernst has experienced the highs and lows of the football league .
he is currently technical director at second league club bochum .
from his years of playing experience , he knows about the mental condition of the players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas ernst -lrb- right -rrb- with bochum player chong tese " there are situations during a game when people whistle and shout personal insults at you , where every player meets challenges they can not cope with , " ernst told deutsche welle .
" the pressure is there in training , and again when playing in the stadium , " said ernst .
" it can really build up , and that stresses you out . "
footballers ' union provides help even before robert enke 's death , the union that looks after contract footballers , the vdv , was witnessing an increase of players seeking help .
the vdv has been offering psychological and pastoral advice to footballers for several years , said its chief executive ulf baranowsky .
" immediately after the tragic death of robert enke , the number of people inquiring about these services shot up , " said baranowsky .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outpouring of grief after enke 's death highlighted the issue of depression in sports since enke 's death more than two dozen players have sought advice or counseling through the vdv .
players can contact the union in strict confidentiality , or anonymously by email if they wish .
the facade is all part of the game for the psychologist thomas graw , who has worked with several bundesliga professionals , robert enke 's case was not an isolated one . " players learn to have certain internal processes to shield their feelings from the outside , " said graw .
" they see it as part of their job and their career , " he added .
even if a player looks fine from the outside , he could be suffering inside .
the psychologists who work with the vdv look out for whether a player might be suffering from a short-term mood fluctuation , or more long-term depression .
problems include fear of failure , performance anxiety , issues with coaches , bullying and " anything that affects the psyche " said baronowsky .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clubs and teammates need to be more understanding about mental illness added to these problems is a lack of understanding from teammates and coaches .
" i can well imagine that there are many coaches and teammates who reject the idea completely and just say , ' all right , well , he has no place playing here then , " ' said graw .
change unlikely in many of the speeches which were made after robert enke 's death , voices from across the world of soccer said more must be done to help those suffering from mental illness .
a major rethink was ordered across the multi-million dollar business of football .
however , according to thomas ernst at bochum , these words have failed to turn into real actions .
there has been little progress in clubs ' understanding and tackling of those with mental illness .
" basically , in the businesses and in the processes , nothing has changed . "

dw-world.de sports psychologists make slow inroads into german soccer professional athletes are under enormous pressure , and for some players the burden can be too much .
in soccer , more than other sports , the taboo on seeking help is a hard one to break .

many eu politicians have a guilty conscience over keeping ankara waiting .
but that 's a poor basis for making decisions , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . many eu politicians have a guilty conscience .
they do n't know how to deal with ankara ’ s hopes for speedy progress in the country 's bid for eu membership .
turkey is after all an official membership candidate and is trying to implement the reforms that brussels is calling for .
and from ankara 's perspective , this should eventually lead to full membership once the eu 's demands have been met .
so far , all previous membership candidates have eventually become full members .
but it 's clear that a guilty conscience alone is a poor basis for granting membership .
many european governments today regret that they – or their predecessors – have in past years given the green light for membership talks with turkey .
the doubts within the eu about whether turkey is fit for membership have since then only increased , and the arguments against membership have not changed .
they are not about individual points of criticism – be it cyprus or freedom of expression – but they are , in fact of a more fundamental nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations will continue to improve , but there wo n't be full membership , says hasselbach for instance , the eu still struggles with the consequences of its two previous expansion rounds in 2004 and 2007 .
and even if past expansion was not a mistake – the new members have significantly changed the european union .
the bloc 's ability to speak with one voice seems to be faltering – simply because the member states are too diverse and different .
these changes have to sink in and this process is bound to take time .
accepting turkey with its different history and tradition would from today 's perspective lead to a final stop to european integration .
has anyone ever thought of the fact that turkey would soon surpass germany as the most populous eu member state ?
turkey as a member would therefore have the right to demand more official posts than any of the other countries .
this would change the eu to an extent likely to cause sharp opposition .
and no one can guarantee that turkey will remain a secular state for good .
none of this calls into question the fact that the eu needs turkey and that turkey needs the eu .
the good trade relations and security cooperation should be built upon .
both sides are certain to do this for their very own interests .
and turkey is likely to continue its reform path even without the prospect of eu membership .
that 's why it ’ s wrong to argue that without membership talks , ankara will abandon reforms and look for other partners .
both sides need to look at the current situation .
it 's not a question of all or nothing .
and the eu should be honest with ankara that at the end of the path will be a closer relationship than today – but no full membership .

lidl has come under particular fire over pay and practices . supermarkets across germany are popular places to buy clothes .
prices are cheap : you can buy a men 's shirt for seven euros -lrb- nine us dollars -rrb- or a pair of women 's trousers for under 10 euros .
however two women from bangladesh are currently on a speaking tour of germany to highlight how these cheap prices come at a human cost .
26-year-old jessmin begum and 36-year-old arifa akter both work as seamstresses in clothes factories in dhaka that make clothes for european stores .
they say the working conditions are terrible and the pay is inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers complain about cramped conditions , dirty water and tough bosses " i 'm proud of my work , especially when i see people here wearing my clothes , " said begum , who works for a factory that supplies clothes to german-based supermarket chain lidl .
" but it makes me mad that what we get for our work in bangladesh is nothing . "
not a living wage as a seamstress , jessmin begum earns around 35 euros a month -lrb- just under 4,000 bangladesh taka -rrb- .
the monthly rent for a one room apartment in dhaka is around 25 euros a month .
" it is not even close to the living wage we have calculated , " said khorshed alam from the campaigning group alternative movement for resources and freedom society -lrb- amrf -rrb- .
with calculations based on someone working a 12- to 14-hour day , the amrf estimates around 5,000 taka a month -lrb- 52 euros -rrb- is necessary for a single worker .
a family needs to earn around 9-10,000 taka .
dirty water , mean bosses , unpaid overtime the two seamstresses are using their tour of germany to highlight how bad working conditions are in the factories .
" the drinking water is dirty and we are packed in with little space between the machines , " said begum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessmin begum has been working as a seamstress in dhaka for eight years " our supervisors insult us and put us under pressure to work harder .
almost every day i do overtime and i hardly ever come home much earlier than midnight , " she added .
the workers have no sick pay or other benefits , so most seamstresses continue to work even when ill .
highlighting the problem jessmin and arifa 's tour of germany was organized by the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- , which campaigns worldwide to promote better working conditions and fair wages .
the ccc wants international corporations to stick to their pledges to provide better labor conditions .
" for years companies have been saying they are willing to meet certain standards , but it 's only on paper , not in actions , " said the ccc 's gisela burckhardt .
" we want a proper legal framework so that companies can see the impact of their activities on the environment and people in other countries , " burckhardt argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this dhaka garment factory was visited by the ccc in 2009 khorshed alam from the amrf added that it is also the responsibility of the bangladeshi government to monitor the brands which manufacture clothes in the country , and to ensure they implement local labor laws .
making consumers aware in addition to putting pressure on manufacturers and local governments , the tour aims to give consumers more awareness of the origin of their cheap shirts and trousers .
" i came here because the people who buy our products have no idea where they came from , or how much we suffer , " said begum .
the amrf want consumers to question companies like lidl who sell cheap clothes , while claiming they pay their workers well .
in response to the claims , a spokesperson for lidl said they completely oppose any form of child labor and violations of workers ' rights .
they also added that lidl was the first german discount store to join the business social compliance initiative which works to improve working conditions in supply networks worldwide .

many eu politicians have a guilty conscience over keeping ankara waiting .
but that 's a poor basis for making decisions , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . many eu politicians have a guilty conscience .
they do n't know how to deal with ankara ’ s hopes for speedy progress in the country 's bid for eu membership .
turkey is after all an official membership candidate and is trying to implement the reforms that brussels is calling for .
and from ankara 's perspective , this should eventually lead to full membership once the eu 's demands have been met .
so far , all previous membership candidates have eventually become full members .
but it 's clear that a guilty conscience alone is a poor basis for granting membership .
many european governments today regret that they – or their predecessors – have in past years given the green light for membership talks with turkey .
the doubts within the eu about whether turkey is fit for membership have since then only increased , and the arguments against membership have not changed .
they are not about individual points of criticism – be it cyprus or freedom of expression – but they are , in fact of a more fundamental nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations will continue to improve , but there wo n't be full membership , says hasselbach for instance , the eu still struggles with the consequences of its two previous expansion rounds in 2004 and 2007 .
and even if past expansion was not a mistake – the new members have significantly changed the european union .
the bloc 's ability to speak with one voice seems to be faltering – simply because the member states are too diverse and different .
these changes have to sink in and this process is bound to take time .
accepting turkey with its different history and tradition would from today 's perspective lead to a final stop to european integration .
has anyone ever thought of the fact that turkey would soon surpass germany as the most populous eu member state ?
turkey as a member would therefore have the right to demand more official posts than any of the other countries .
this would change the eu to an extent likely to cause sharp opposition .
and no one can guarantee that turkey will remain a secular state for good .
none of this calls into question the fact that the eu needs turkey and that turkey needs the eu .
the good trade relations and security cooperation should be built upon .
both sides are certain to do this for their very own interests .
and turkey is likely to continue its reform path even without the prospect of eu membership .
that 's why it ’ s wrong to argue that without membership talks , ankara will abandon reforms and look for other partners .
both sides need to look at the current situation .
it 's not a question of all or nothing .
and the eu should be honest with ankara that at the end of the path will be a closer relationship than today – but no full membership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 10.11.2010 london 's globe theatre honors shakespeare 's german connection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been in love with shakespeare for centuries for many , shakespeare is synonymous with all things english , yet germany has a history of claiming the bard as " ganz unser " - their " very own . "
this season , the globe theatre pays homage to this special relationship . blasphemous as it might seem at first glance , the globe theatre 's current program serves to highlight a rather special bond between the world 's most famous writer and a whole country . " what i am discovering more and more is how deeply -lsb- shakespeare -rsb- entered into the german psyche from the 18th century on , " said patrick spottiswoode , education director for the globe theatre and curator of the season . and shakespeare 's german connection has strong credentials .
for starters , there are more performances of shakespeare in germany in any given year than in england .
german was the first language shakespeare was ever translated into ; and the first shakespeare society in the world was founded in germany . " the germans in the 18th and 19th century regarded him as ' ganz unser ' - entirely ours , " added spottiswoode . translating frenzy the notion of " ownership " over shakespeare was propagated by a wealth of translations that began to appear as early as 1766 - 150 years after his death - with christoph martin wieland 's prose translation of 22 of the bard 's plays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hamlet , said ferdinand freiligrath " to translate the whole works of shakespeare is quite a task ” , said spottiswoode , " and there were successive translations of the entire works in the 18th and 19th centuries . " between 1818 and 1839 alone , eight separate translations of the entire works of shakespeare were published .
some even say that this helped to " improve " the german language , as new words had to be invented to complete the task . it was the schlegel-tieck edition of 1833 that set the gold standard for shakespeare translation and laid the foundations for successive generations of german writers to attempt their very own versions . a constant contemporary " from wieland and then fontane down to heiner mueller in the post-war period , you have a spectrum of writers of different kinds that all contributed crucially to insuring that every other generation of german readers and viewers would have their very own shakespeare in a new translation , " said professor ruediger goerner , director of anglo-german relations at the university of queen mary in london . " shakespeare has always been a contemporary author for german audiences , " he continued .
this continual element of newness has seen a wealth of unusual and avant-garde interpretations of shakespeare come out of germany . " i think there 's that sense that as soon as you translate him , you are freeing him , " said spottiswoode . the goethe factor one of shakespeare 's greatest advocates was germany 's favorite literary child himself .
in 1771 , a 22-year old johann wolfgang von goethe gave an impassioned speech on the merits of his " friend " across the north sea . spottiswoode commissioned a translation of this lecture into english , sparking the entire " shakespeare is german " season at the globe theatre . " it 's a very beautiful , lyrical , passionate avocation of shakespeare and how he could be important and how german culture and theater could learn so much from shakespeare , " commented spottiswoode .
" he was going to free germany from the shackles of french-style drama . " shakespeare 's plays did not adhere to the classical unities of action , place and time as was common practice in french theater .
goethe once said of these unities that they were " as oppressive as prison . "
shakespeare represented a breath of fresh air and offered a whole new world of creative possibilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the globe is a reconstruction of the theater built by shakespeare 's company focus on nature " he was regarded as a new writer more than anything else , rather than a historical writer , a new type of writer and poet who would clearly bring poetry back to nature , " said goerner .
this idea married well with the principles of german classicism , and slowly shakespeare became an intrinsic part of a very german literary movement . by 1849 , the writer ferdinand freiligrath famously proclaimed " germany is hamlet , " revealing the extent to which shakespeare had infiltrated the german psyche by that time .
the legacy of this close bond with the bard from stratford-upon-avon can still be seen in german classrooms today . " there is indeed an affinity between the german language and the kind of poetic demands shakespeare makes , " said goerner .
" german , in that sense , is incredibly adaptable and you can mould german to capture the shakespearian vein , both in terms of his poetic approach and the sheer drama of the soul . " everyone 's favorite son if you think germany is alone in claiming shakespeare as its own , then think again .
" i had a moroccan film crew coming over they said ' our viewers at home think shakespeare really was an arab ! " ' said spottiswoode . he pointed out that the bard set his plays all over the world , taking his original london audiences on faraway travel .
it 's only fitting that his work has since gone around the world and been translated into some 90 languages .

major powers are likely to disagree on currency policy and plans to end exceptional economic stimulus measures . chancellor angela merkel called on world powers to coordinate plans for weaning their national economies off economic stimulus measures , and warned against creating new asset bubbles .

germany is the world 's second-biggest exporter after china .
its strong export sector has helped it stage an impressive economic comeback this year , but its trade surpluses have also drawn criticism abroad .

"
this season , the globe theatre pays homage to this special relationship . blasphemous as it might seem at first glance , the globe theatre 's current program serves to highlight a rather special bond between the world 's most famous writer and a whole country . " what i am discovering more and more is how deeply -lsb- shakespeare -rsb- entered into the german psyche from the 18th century on , " said patrick spottiswoode , education director for the globe theatre and curator of the season . and shakespeare 's german connection has strong credentials .
for starters , there are more performances of shakespeare in germany in any given year than in england .
german was the first language shakespeare was ever translated into ; and the first shakespeare society in the world was founded in germany . " the germans in the 18th and 19th century regarded him as ' ganz unser ' - entirely ours , " added spottiswoode . translating frenzy the notion of " ownership " over shakespeare was propagated by a wealth of translations that began to appear as early as 1766 - 150 years after his death - with christoph martin wieland 's prose translation of 22 of the bard 's plays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hamlet , said ferdinand freiligrath " to translate the whole works of shakespeare is quite a task ” , said spottiswoode , " and there were successive translations of the entire works in the 18th and 19th centuries . " between 1818 and 1839 alone , eight separate translations of the entire works of shakespeare were published .
some even say that this helped to " improve " the german language , as new words had to be invented to complete the task . it was the schlegel-tieck edition of 1833 that set the gold standard for shakespeare translation and laid the foundations for successive generations of german writers to attempt their very own versions . a constant contemporary " from wieland and then fontane down to heiner mueller in the post-war period , you have a spectrum of writers of different kinds that all contributed crucially to insuring that every other generation of german readers and viewers would have their very own shakespeare in a new translation , " said professor ruediger goerner , director of anglo-german relations at the university of queen mary in london . " shakespeare has always been a contemporary author for german audiences , " he continued .
this continual element of newness has seen a wealth of unusual and avant-garde interpretations of shakespeare come out of germany . " i think there 's that sense that as soon as you translate him , you are freeing him , " said spottiswoode . the goethe factor one of shakespeare 's greatest advocates was germany 's favorite literary child himself .
in 1771 , a 22-year old johann wolfgang von goethe gave an impassioned speech on the merits of his " friend " across the north sea . spottiswoode commissioned a translation of this lecture into english , sparking the entire " shakespeare is german " season at the globe theatre . " it 's a very beautiful , lyrical , passionate avocation of shakespeare and how he could be important and how german culture and theater could learn so much from shakespeare , " commented spottiswoode .
" he was going to free germany from the shackles of french-style drama . " shakespeare 's plays did not adhere to the classical unities of action , place and time as was common practice in french theater .
goethe once said of these unities that they were " as oppressive as prison . "
shakespeare represented a breath of fresh air and offered a whole new world of creative possibilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the globe is a reconstruction of the theater built by shakespeare 's company focus on nature " he was regarded as a new writer more than anything else , rather than a historical writer , a new type of writer and poet who would clearly bring poetry back to nature , " said goerner .
this idea married well with the principles of german classicism , and slowly shakespeare became an intrinsic part of a very german literary movement . by 1849 , the writer ferdinand freiligrath famously proclaimed " germany is hamlet , " revealing the extent to which shakespeare had infiltrated the german psyche by that time .
the legacy of this close bond with the bard from stratford-upon-avon can still be seen in german classrooms today . " there is indeed an affinity between the german language and the kind of poetic demands shakespeare makes , " said goerner .
" german , in that sense , is incredibly adaptable and you can mould german to capture the shakespearian vein , both in terms of his poetic approach and the sheer drama of the soul . " everyone 's favorite son if you think germany is alone in claiming shakespeare as its own , then think again .
" i had a moroccan film crew coming over they said ' our viewers at home think shakespeare really was an arab ! " ' said spottiswoode . he pointed out that the bard set his plays all over the world , taking his original london audiences on faraway travel .
it 's only fitting that his work has since gone around the world and been translated into some 90 languages .

t-shirts or trousers might cost as little as two euros .
this is great for low-income families .
but there is a downside . most of the textiles and clothes found in the stores of industrialised countries are sewn in developing countries .
bangladesh , india and indonesia top the list .
30 euros for a month 's work cheap clothes can be found at all of germany ’ s popular discount stores – for example lidl , aldi and kik .
they attract society ’ s low-earning groups , tempted by well-made shirts and trousers with a price tag of under five euros .
but the harsh truth is that the rest of the price is paid by asia 's garment workers , who receive very low wages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at germany 's discount store kik a t-shirt can be bought for one euro jasmine begum is a bangladeshi garment worker .
" in the year 2000 , i started working as an assistant operator in a garment factory , " she said . " then i was off work for some years .
i came back as an operator .
i earn 3,500 taka per month .
this is not enough for me to run my family .
i want everything to change .
i want a pay rise so that i can survive with my family .
i want to send my son to school . " 3,500 taka is about 30 euros .
jasmine , who receives no support from her husband , also lives with her mother and her elder brother .
she can not find another job because she is illiterate .
she says she is stuck in the garments sector .
foreign companies pay too little to manufacturing factories arifa akhter also once worked in garments .
she is now a member of the national garments workers federation and wants to help the girls and women who make up 80 percent of the employees in the garment sector .
she not only wants to improve working conditions but also wages .
" our garments factory owners do n't get enough money to get the job done .
that 's why they ca n't pay the workers .
if the owners were better paid by the foreign companies then the employees would also get a fraction of it if not the whole .
we demand that the foreign companies understand the problems and take the necessary measures , " said arifa akhter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration of bangladeshi garment workers for better wages “ clean clothing campaign ” in the past , such demands have often fallen on deaf ears .
one organization in germany is very concerned .
gisela bruckhardt ’ s “ clean clothing campaign ” promotes clothes that are untainted by human rights violations , exploitation , harassment and low wages .
bruckhardt says companies in germany should be fully accountable : " we want these organizations to pay garment workers accordingly .
wages must be high enough for any employee to be able to survive with her / his family .
these organizations must visit these factories every now and then to see how things are run .
but we ca n't really force them to visit .
this is a serious problem . "
gisela bruckhardt says the german government should come forward in such cases , enact laws to defend and protect these employees : " after all they are producing for us .
these employees should be able to sue german companies in a federal court and claim their rights . "
there are almost two million garments workers in bangladesh and thousands of garments factories .

" the germans in the 18th and 19th century regarded him as ' ganz unser ' - entirely ours , " added spottiswoode . translating frenzy the notion of " ownership " over shakespeare was propagated by a wealth of translations that began to appear as early as 1766 - 150 years after his death - with christoph martin wieland 's prose translation of 22 of the bard 's plays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hamlet , said ferdinand freiligrath " to translate the whole works of shakespeare is quite a task ” , said spottiswoode , " and there were successive translations of the entire works in the 18th and 19th centuries . " between 1818 and 1839 alone , eight separate translations of the entire works of shakespeare were published .
some even say that this helped to " improve " the german language , as new words had to be invented to complete the task . it was the schlegel-tieck edition of 1833 that set the gold standard for shakespeare translation and laid the foundations for successive generations of german writers to attempt their very own versions . a constant contemporary " from wieland and then fontane down to heiner mueller in the post-war period , you have a spectrum of writers of different kinds that all contributed crucially to insuring that every other generation of german readers and viewers would have their very own shakespeare in a new translation , " said professor ruediger goerner , director of anglo-german relations at the university of queen mary in london . " shakespeare has always been a contemporary author for german audiences , " he continued .
this continual element of newness has seen a wealth of unusual and avant-garde interpretations of shakespeare come out of germany . " i think there 's that sense that as soon as you translate him , you are freeing him , " said spottiswoode . the goethe factor one of shakespeare 's greatest advocates was germany 's favorite literary child himself .
in 1771 , a 22-year old johann wolfgang von goethe gave an impassioned speech on the merits of his " friend " across the north sea . spottiswoode commissioned a translation of this lecture into english , sparking the entire " shakespeare is german " season at the globe theatre . " it 's a very beautiful , lyrical , passionate avocation of shakespeare and how he could be important and how german culture and theater could learn so much from shakespeare , " commented spottiswoode .
" he was going to free germany from the shackles of french-style drama . " shakespeare 's plays did not adhere to the classical unities of action , place and time as was common practice in french theater .
goethe once said of these unities that they were " as oppressive as prison . "
shakespeare represented a breath of fresh air and offered a whole new world of creative possibilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the globe is a reconstruction of the theater built by shakespeare 's company focus on nature " he was regarded as a new writer more than anything else , rather than a historical writer , a new type of writer and poet who would clearly bring poetry back to nature , " said goerner .
this idea married well with the principles of german classicism , and slowly shakespeare became an intrinsic part of a very german literary movement . by 1849 , the writer ferdinand freiligrath famously proclaimed " germany is hamlet , " revealing the extent to which shakespeare had infiltrated the german psyche by that time .
the legacy of this close bond with the bard from stratford-upon-avon can still be seen in german classrooms today . " there is indeed an affinity between the german language and the kind of poetic demands shakespeare makes , " said goerner .
" german , in that sense , is incredibly adaptable and you can mould german to capture the shakespearian vein , both in terms of his poetic approach and the sheer drama of the soul . " everyone 's favorite son if you think germany is alone in claiming shakespeare as its own , then think again .
" i had a moroccan film crew coming over they said ' our viewers at home think shakespeare really was an arab ! " ' said spottiswoode . he pointed out that the bard set his plays all over the world , taking his original london audiences on faraway travel .
it 's only fitting that his work has since gone around the world and been translated into some 90 languages . " shakespeare seems to touch everybody , " added spottiswoode . author : sarah stolarz editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his book is unlikely to help heal the rift that emerged between the us and europe while he was in office . the 43rd us president 's apparent mission to have his two terms in the white house reassessed and his reputation rehabilitated through his new book , " decision points , " has many europeans shaking their heads . and it 's not just the most inflammatory excerpts - such as bush 's assertion that water-boarding of terror suspects saved lives - that are causing an outcry . bush 's supporters in the us say that every president has the right to defend his record ; " decision points " shows the former president as a man who was ideologically consistent during his eight years in office . his detractors counter that the president 's mistakes and his determination to follow ill-thought-out policies - without a thought for a possible , rectifying change of direction - plunged the us into a decade of war and the worst financial crisis in over 80 years .
while george w. bush may have been a good guy with a difficult job , they say , he does n't deserve to be rehabilitated via his memoirs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush left office with two wars and an economic crisis raging if bush 's single-minded and heavy-handed approach to afghanistan and iraq in the wake of the terror attacks of 9/11 were damaging to his relations with his european allies at the time , his newly released memoirs appear to be giving european readers the chance get angry all over again . europeans , even allies , dismissed as irrelevant " in my opinion , there ’ s been no change in perception of bush in europe , " dr. henning meyer , a transatlantic relations expert at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle . " his legacy projects , such as iraq and afghanistan , are still the main issues associated with his presidency and of course europeans are still affected by these and in most cases are still in opposition to a certain degree .
if you remember , bush ’ s war on terror effectively split europe .
so these things have not been forgotten . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush says the uk 's perception of him does n't matter in " decision points , " bush is dismissive about those europeans who had taken a risk to follow him into war in iraq , and he talks frankly about his reputation in the one country whose leaders followed him most obediently of all : england .
" it does n't matter how people perceive me in england , " he writes .
" it just does n't matter any more .
and frankly , at times , it did n't matter then . " in a veiled dig at what he saw at the time as the rest of europe 's lack of stomach for the fight , bush writes : " people in europe said : ' ah , man , he 's a religious fanatic , cowboy , simpleton . '
all that stuff ...
if you believe that freedom is universal , then you should n't be surprised when people take courageous measures to live in a free society . " he reserves his most scathing treatment for those european leaders who disappointed him most , especially during the iraq war : former german chancellor gerhard schroeder comes in for even worse treatment than former french president jacques chirac , schroeder 's ally in the european anti-war opposition . german emotions still raw over bush 's rush to war in the book , bush accuses schroeder of abusing his trust after allegedly telling the president in 2002 , before the invasion of iraq the following year , that " what goes for afghanistan also goes for iraq .
nations which support terrorism must accept the consequences .
if you go forward fast and resolutely , i am on your side . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush did n't trust schroeder after the latter withdrew his support however , struggling in his re-election campaign in the fall of that year , schroeder hitched his wagon to the huge swell of anti-war feeling in germany and across europe .
he claims bush is lying when he says that he had offered his support for an invasion , and that he 'd made it clear all along that his support was conditional on whether iraq really had weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- . " schroeder 's support -lrb- for the invasion of iraq -rrb- was conditional on evidence being found of terrorists being harbored in iraq , so when there was no evidence delivered , he withdrew his support , " lse professor meyer told deutsche welle .
" bush is attempting to polish his own picture of this situation with the germans by saying that the breakdown in relations was not his fault and that it was schroeder who turned opinion against him . " the bush legacy is still powerfully felt in the united states : the armed forces are embroiled in the two wars he started ; the financial system is struggling to pull out of an overwhelming crisis , and politicians are scrambling to rebuild their credibility on the world stage . but the ripples from his eight-year presidency continue to be felt in europe as well .
under his leadership , decades of trust and cooperation between the us and european governments was damaged . according to thomas klau , a transatlantic relations expert at the european council for foreign relations , the memoir provides new fodder for europeans who are skeptical about the us political system . " europeans , and germans in particular , are still amazed that the us political system has the potential to elect such an incompetent leader who has no respect for western values , " klau said .
" while obama gave some hope , the germans are now saddened to see that a discredited party such as the republicans can be re-elected as the majority in the house of representatives . " germans see the republican mid-term victory as proof that " the us system and electorate has a very short memory and very little wisdom . " european anger reignited over torture statements so far , european reaction to the bush memoirs has been heavily affected by comments in the book that seem to advocate torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims water boarding extracted vital information for meyer , the water-boarding comments are " a very clear example of the philosophical differences between the bush administration and the europeans . " " there is a huge difference in what bush thought was acceptable in terms of the war on terror and what the europeans thought , " he added .
" bush saw approaches such as water-boarding as not a breaking of any laws but a legitimate bending of them . " moreover , bush " made bold statements " that the information gained from water-boarding stopped an attack on london - a claim the uk refutes . " most people in europe say that there were other ways of getting the information and that bush ’ s assertions are just not true , " meyer said . severe - and lasting - damage ? the response to his memoirs suggests that the damage bush did to his country 's reputation in europe remains severe .

among those to go is the long-standing ceo of db 's long-distance travel unit . nikolaus breuel was responsible for deutsche bahn 's main-line routes long before 1999 , when the ' db fernverkehr ' subsidiary was founded as part of the db privatization process .
and he has been in charge ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolaus breuel is expected to lose his job but that now looks set to change .
members of db 's body of governors told the dpa news agency on tuesday that a non-scheduled board meeting had been called for friday to discuss personnel issues .
there has been significant speculation over the past weeks that ulrich homburg , managing director of db mobility and logistics , which oversees the long-distance division , is unhappy with breuel 's handling of a string of glitches to hit high-speed ice trains over the past couple of years .
the first major problem arose in 2008 when a broken axel highlighted a necessity for more frequent maintenance checks .
this led to a reduction in the number of reserve trains available on the network and saw service reliability drop as a result .
winter travelers have had to put up with regular delays and cancellations .
bildunterschrift : the heat was too much for too many passengers poor management public outrage reached a peak this summer when air conditioning in several high-speed trains failed and thousands of passengers had to be paid compensation .
in one incident , db customers were stranded for three hours in a tunnel when their train broke down in sweltering temperatures .
several passengers had to be taken to hospital . the combination of events has done nothing to enhance deutsche bahn 's image , and breuel , once pipped as a possible successor to the former ceo of the deutsche bahn group hartmut mehdorn , now looks set to take the rap .

the south korean government is taking preparations for the g20 very seriously .
it ’ s the largest international gathering the country has held since the 2002 world cup .
this week ’ s summit also marks the first time a non-g8 and asian nation has hosted the economic forum .
south korea proud to host g20 and considering that several decades ago , south korea was one of the world ’ s poorest nations , its quick rise to the top makes it a model for other nations to emulate , says un secretary general ban ki moon .

activists protest against " unequal economic policies " but some opposed to the g20 are using this moment to raise attention what they call its flawed economic policies .

lidl has come under particular fire over pay and practices . supermarkets across germany are popular places to buy clothes .
prices are cheap : you can buy a men 's shirt for seven euros -lrb- nine us dollars -rrb- or a pair of women 's trousers for under 10 euros .
however two women from bangladesh are currently on a speaking tour of germany to highlight how these cheap prices come at a human cost .
26-year-old jessmin begum and 36-year-old arifa akter both work as seamstresses in clothes factories in dhaka that make clothes for european stores .
they say the working conditions are terrible and the pay is inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers complain about cramped conditions , dirty water and tough bosses " i 'm proud of my work , especially when i see people here wearing my clothes , " said begum , who works for a factory that supplies clothes to german-based supermarket chain lidl .
" but it makes me mad that what we get for our work in bangladesh is nothing . "
not a living wage as a seamstress , jessmin begum earns around 35 euros a month -lrb- just under 4,000 bangladesh taka -rrb- .
the monthly rent for a one room apartment in dhaka is around 25 euros a month .
" it is not even close to the living wage we have calculated , " said khorshed alam from the campaigning group alternative movement for resources and freedom society -lrb- amrf -rrb- .
with calculations based on someone working a 12- to 14-hour day , the amrf estimates around 5,000 taka a month -lrb- 52 euros -rrb- is necessary for a single worker .
a family needs to earn around 9-10,000 taka .
dirty water , mean bosses , unpaid overtime the two seamstresses are using their tour of germany to highlight how bad working conditions are in the factories .
" the drinking water is dirty and we are packed in with little space between the machines , " said begum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessmin begum has been working as a seamstress in dhaka for eight years " our supervisors insult us and put us under pressure to work harder .
almost every day i do overtime and i hardly ever come home much earlier than midnight , " she added .
the workers have no sick pay or other benefits , so most seamstresses continue to work even when ill .
highlighting the problem jessmin and arifa 's tour of germany was organized by the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- , which campaigns worldwide to promote better working conditions and fair wages .
the ccc wants international corporations to stick to their pledges to provide better labor conditions .
" for years companies have been saying they are willing to meet certain standards , but it 's only on paper , not in actions , " said the ccc 's gisela burckhardt .
" we want a proper legal framework so that companies can see the impact of their activities on the environment and people in other countries , " burckhardt argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this dhaka garment factory was visited by the ccc in 2009 khorshed alam from the amrf added that it is also the responsibility of the bangladeshi government to monitor the brands which manufacture clothes in the country , and to ensure they implement local labor laws .
making consumers aware in addition to putting pressure on manufacturers and local governments , the tour aims to give consumers more awareness of the origin of their cheap shirts and trousers .
" i came here because the people who buy our products have no idea where they came from , or how much we suffer , " said begum .
the amrf want consumers to question companies like lidl who sell cheap clothes , while claiming they pay their workers well .
in response to the claims , a spokesperson for lidl said they completely oppose any form of child labor and violations of workers ' rights .
they also added that lidl was the first german discount store to join the business social compliance initiative which works to improve working conditions in supply networks worldwide .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers complain about cramped conditions , dirty water and tough bosses " i 'm proud of my work , especially when i see people here wearing my clothes , " said begum , who works for a factory that supplies clothes to german-based supermarket chain lidl .
" but it makes me mad that what we get for our work in bangladesh is nothing . "
not a living wage as a seamstress , jessmin begum earns around 35 euros a month -lrb- just under 4,000 bangladesh taka -rrb- .
the monthly rent for a one room apartment in dhaka is around 25 euros a month .
" it is not even close to the living wage we have calculated , " said khorshed alam from the campaigning group alternative movement for resources and freedom society -lrb- amrf -rrb- .
with calculations based on someone working a 12- to 14-hour day , the amrf estimates around 5,000 taka a month -lrb- 52 euros -rrb- is necessary for a single worker .
a family needs to earn around 9-10,000 taka .
dirty water , mean bosses , unpaid overtime the two seamstresses are using their tour of germany to highlight how bad working conditions are in the factories .
" the drinking water is dirty and we are packed in with little space between the machines , " said begum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessmin begum has been working as a seamstress in dhaka for eight years " our supervisors insult us and put us under pressure to work harder .
almost every day i do overtime and i hardly ever come home much earlier than midnight , " she added .
the workers have no sick pay or other benefits , so most seamstresses continue to work even when ill .
highlighting the problem jessmin and arifa 's tour of germany was organized by the clean clothes campaign -lrb- ccc -rrb- , which campaigns worldwide to promote better working conditions and fair wages .
the ccc wants international corporations to stick to their pledges to provide better labor conditions .
" for years companies have been saying they are willing to meet certain standards , but it 's only on paper , not in actions , " said the ccc 's gisela burckhardt .
" we want a proper legal framework so that companies can see the impact of their activities on the environment and people in other countries , " burckhardt argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this dhaka garment factory was visited by the ccc in 2009 khorshed alam from the amrf added that it is also the responsibility of the bangladeshi government to monitor the brands which manufacture clothes in the country , and to ensure they implement local labor laws .
making consumers aware in addition to putting pressure on manufacturers and local governments , the tour aims to give consumers more awareness of the origin of their cheap shirts and trousers .
" i came here because the people who buy our products have no idea where they came from , or how much we suffer , " said begum .
the amrf want consumers to question companies like lidl who sell cheap clothes , while claiming they pay their workers well .
in response to the claims , a spokesperson for lidl said they completely oppose any form of child labor and violations of workers ' rights .
they also added that lidl was the first german discount store to join the business social compliance initiative which works to improve working conditions in supply networks worldwide .

many eu politicians have a guilty conscience over keeping ankara waiting .
but that 's a poor basis for making decisions , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . many eu politicians have a guilty conscience .
they do n't know how to deal with ankara ’ s hopes for speedy progress in the country 's bid for eu membership .
turkey is after all an official membership candidate and is trying to implement the reforms that brussels is calling for .
and from ankara 's perspective , this should eventually lead to full membership once the eu 's demands have been met .
so far , all previous membership candidates have eventually become full members .
but it 's clear that a guilty conscience alone is a poor basis for granting membership .
many european governments today regret that they – or their predecessors – have in past years given the green light for membership talks with turkey .
the doubts within the eu about whether turkey is fit for membership have since then only increased , and the arguments against membership have not changed .
they are not about individual points of criticism – be it cyprus or freedom of expression – but they are , in fact of a more fundamental nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations will continue to improve , but there wo n't be full membership , says hasselbach for instance , the eu still struggles with the consequences of its two previous expansion rounds in 2004 and 2007 .
and even if past expansion was not a mistake – the new members have significantly changed the european union .
the bloc 's ability to speak with one voice seems to be faltering – simply because the member states are too diverse and different .
these changes have to sink in and this process is bound to take time .
accepting turkey with its different history and tradition would from today 's perspective lead to a final stop to european integration .
has anyone ever thought of the fact that turkey would soon surpass germany as the most populous eu member state ?
turkey as a member would therefore have the right to demand more official posts than any of the other countries .
this would change the eu to an extent likely to cause sharp opposition .
and no one can guarantee that turkey will remain a secular state for good .
none of this calls into question the fact that the eu needs turkey and that turkey needs the eu .
the good trade relations and security cooperation should be built upon .
both sides are certain to do this for their very own interests .
and turkey is likely to continue its reform path even without the prospect of eu membership .
that 's why it ’ s wrong to argue that without membership talks , ankara will abandon reforms and look for other partners .
both sides need to look at the current situation .
it 's not a question of all or nothing .
and the eu should be honest with ankara that at the end of the path will be a closer relationship than today – but no full membership .

"
this season , the globe theatre pays homage to this special relationship . blasphemous as it might seem at first glance , the globe theatre 's current program serves to highlight a rather special bond between the world 's most famous writer and a whole country . " what i am discovering more and more is how deeply -lsb- shakespeare -rsb- entered into the german psyche from the 18th century on , " said patrick spottiswoode , education director for the globe theatre and curator of the season . and shakespeare 's german connection has strong credentials .
for starters , there are more performances of shakespeare in germany in any given year than in england .
german was the first language shakespeare was ever translated into ; and the first shakespeare society in the world was founded in germany . " the germans in the 18th and 19th century regarded him as ' ganz unser ' - entirely ours , " added spottiswoode . translating frenzy the notion of " ownership " over shakespeare was propagated by a wealth of translations that began to appear as early as 1766 - 150 years after his death - with christoph martin wieland 's prose translation of 22 of the bard 's plays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hamlet , said ferdinand freiligrath " to translate the whole works of shakespeare is quite a task ” , said spottiswoode , " and there were successive translations of the entire works in the 18th and 19th centuries . " between 1818 and 1839 alone , eight separate translations of the entire works of shakespeare were published .
some even say that this helped to " improve " the german language , as new words had to be invented to complete the task . it was the schlegel-tieck edition of 1833 that set the gold standard for shakespeare translation and laid the foundations for successive generations of german writers to attempt their very own versions . a constant contemporary " from wieland and then fontane down to heiner mueller in the post-war period , you have a spectrum of writers of different kinds that all contributed crucially to insuring that every other generation of german readers and viewers would have their very own shakespeare in a new translation , " said professor ruediger goerner , director of anglo-german relations at the university of queen mary in london . " shakespeare has always been a contemporary author for german audiences , " he continued .
this continual element of newness has seen a wealth of unusual and avant-garde interpretations of shakespeare come out of germany . " i think there 's that sense that as soon as you translate him , you are freeing him , " said spottiswoode . the goethe factor one of shakespeare 's greatest advocates was germany 's favorite literary child himself .
in 1771 , a 22-year old johann wolfgang von goethe gave an impassioned speech on the merits of his " friend " across the north sea . spottiswoode commissioned a translation of this lecture into english , sparking the entire " shakespeare is german " season at the globe theatre . " it 's a very beautiful , lyrical , passionate avocation of shakespeare and how he could be important and how german culture and theater could learn so much from shakespeare , " commented spottiswoode .
" he was going to free germany from the shackles of french-style drama . " shakespeare 's plays did not adhere to the classical unities of action , place and time as was common practice in french theater .
goethe once said of these unities that they were " as oppressive as prison . "
shakespeare represented a breath of fresh air and offered a whole new world of creative possibilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the globe is a reconstruction of the theater built by shakespeare 's company focus on nature " he was regarded as a new writer more than anything else , rather than a historical writer , a new type of writer and poet who would clearly bring poetry back to nature , " said goerner .
this idea married well with the principles of german classicism , and slowly shakespeare became an intrinsic part of a very german literary movement . by 1849 , the writer ferdinand freiligrath famously proclaimed " germany is hamlet , " revealing the extent to which shakespeare had infiltrated the german psyche by that time .
the legacy of this close bond with the bard from stratford-upon-avon can still be seen in german classrooms today . " there is indeed an affinity between the german language and the kind of poetic demands shakespeare makes , " said goerner .
" german , in that sense , is incredibly adaptable and you can mould german to capture the shakespearian vein , both in terms of his poetic approach and the sheer drama of the soul . " everyone 's favorite son if you think germany is alone in claiming shakespeare as its own , then think again .
" i had a moroccan film crew coming over they said ' our viewers at home think shakespeare really was an arab ! " ' said spottiswoode . he pointed out that the bard set his plays all over the world , taking his original london audiences on faraway travel .
it 's only fitting that his work has since gone around the world and been translated into some 90 languages .

some even say that this helped to " improve " the german language , as new words had to be invented to complete the task . it was the schlegel-tieck edition of 1833 that set the gold standard for shakespeare translation and laid the foundations for successive generations of german writers to attempt their very own versions . a constant contemporary " from wieland and then fontane down to heiner mueller in the post-war period , you have a spectrum of writers of different kinds that all contributed crucially to insuring that every other generation of german readers and viewers would have their very own shakespeare in a new translation , " said professor ruediger goerner , director of anglo-german relations at the university of queen mary in london . " shakespeare has always been a contemporary author for german audiences , " he continued .
this continual element of newness has seen a wealth of unusual and avant-garde interpretations of shakespeare come out of germany . " i think there 's that sense that as soon as you translate him , you are freeing him , " said spottiswoode . the goethe factor one of shakespeare 's greatest advocates was germany 's favorite literary child himself .
in 1771 , a 22-year old johann wolfgang von goethe gave an impassioned speech on the merits of his " friend " across the north sea . spottiswoode commissioned a translation of this lecture into english , sparking the entire " shakespeare is german " season at the globe theatre . " it 's a very beautiful , lyrical , passionate avocation of shakespeare and how he could be important and how german culture and theater could learn so much from shakespeare , " commented spottiswoode .
" he was going to free germany from the shackles of french-style drama . " shakespeare 's plays did not adhere to the classical unities of action , place and time as was common practice in french theater .
goethe once said of these unities that they were " as oppressive as prison . "
shakespeare represented a breath of fresh air and offered a whole new world of creative possibilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the globe is a reconstruction of the theater built by shakespeare 's company focus on nature " he was regarded as a new writer more than anything else , rather than a historical writer , a new type of writer and poet who would clearly bring poetry back to nature , " said goerner .
this idea married well with the principles of german classicism , and slowly shakespeare became an intrinsic part of a very german literary movement . by 1849 , the writer ferdinand freiligrath famously proclaimed " germany is hamlet , " revealing the extent to which shakespeare had infiltrated the german psyche by that time .
the legacy of this close bond with the bard from stratford-upon-avon can still be seen in german classrooms today . " there is indeed an affinity between the german language and the kind of poetic demands shakespeare makes , " said goerner .
" german , in that sense , is incredibly adaptable and you can mould german to capture the shakespearian vein , both in terms of his poetic approach and the sheer drama of the soul . " everyone 's favorite son if you think germany is alone in claiming shakespeare as its own , then think again .
" i had a moroccan film crew coming over they said ' our viewers at home think shakespeare really was an arab ! " ' said spottiswoode . he pointed out that the bard set his plays all over the world , taking his original london audiences on faraway travel .
it 's only fitting that his work has since gone around the world and been translated into some 90 languages . " shakespeare seems to touch everybody , " added spottiswoode . author : sarah stolarz editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

among those to go is the long-standing ceo of db 's long-distance travel unit . nikolaus breuel was responsible for deutsche bahn 's main-line routes long before 1999 , when the ' db fernverkehr ' subsidiary was founded as part of the db privatization process .
and he has been in charge ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolaus breuel is expected to lose his job but that now looks set to change .
members of db 's body of governors told the dpa news agency on tuesday that a non-scheduled board meeting had been called for friday to discuss personnel issues .
there has been significant speculation over the past weeks that ulrich homburg , managing director of db mobility and logistics , which oversees the long-distance division , is unhappy with breuel 's handling of a string of glitches to hit high-speed ice trains over the past couple of years .
the first major problem arose in 2008 when a broken axel highlighted a necessity for more frequent maintenance checks .
this led to a reduction in the number of reserve trains available on the network and saw service reliability drop as a result .
winter travelers have had to put up with regular delays and cancellations .
bildunterschrift : the heat was too much for too many passengers poor management public outrage reached a peak this summer when air conditioning in several high-speed trains failed and thousands of passengers had to be paid compensation .
in one incident , db customers were stranded for three hours in a tunnel when their train broke down in sweltering temperatures .
several passengers had to be taken to hospital . the combination of events has done nothing to enhance deutsche bahn 's image , and breuel , once pipped as a possible successor to the former ceo of the deutsche bahn group hartmut mehdorn , now looks set to take the rap .

" the energy challenge is one of the greatest tests europe has to face , " oettinger said on wednesday at the presentation of the bloc 's energy strategy for the next 10 years . " putting our energy system onto a new , more sustainable and secure path may take time but ambitious decisions need to be taken now . " the energy chief said individual governments ' priorities in the 27-member bloc had limited european energy policy in the past , and that this must change . " to have an efficient , competitive and low-carbon economy we have to europeanize our energy policy and focus on a few , but pressing , priorities , " oettinger said . energy connections between member states tend to be scattered and inefficient , a hangover from pre-eu times when most national grids were the property of state-run monopolies . " failing to achieve a well-functioning european energy market will only increase the costs for consumers and put europe 's competitiveness at risk , " he added . ending energy isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : encouraging energy savings was another of the report 's priorities in the context of russia 's gas disputes with its neighbours in recent years – and their knock-on consequences for europe – oettinger indicated that security was another reason for integrating networks , so as to prevent states from becoming overly dependent upon a single energy provider . " by 2015 , no member state should be isolated , " a european commission statement said on wednesday . oettinger said the eu 's executive would propose legislation in five key areas in the coming 18 months , including energy efficiency measures for businesses and private housholds . it will also push eu member states to accept a deadline of 2015 to link up all 27 national energy markets . the eu as well as european countries will have to update the energy grid to allow for decentralized power generation and distribution , according to stefan gsaenger , secretary general of the world wind energy association . " up to 10 or 20 years ago in germany we had dozens of huge power stations , " he told deutsche welle .
" today there are hundreds of thousands of power generation units in solar systems and wind farms that are all over germany .
that completely changes the grid . " gsaenger said he expects generation of local , small-scale renewable energy generation to continue increasing as the eu member states strive reach their announced goal of collectively sourcing 20 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2020 , which implies about 35 percent of electricity . funding for electricity grid improvements will come from taxpayers and power companies . german chancellor angela merkel had said earlier that european members should ensure new energy projects are commercially viable .

major powers are likely to disagree on currency policy and plans to end exceptional economic stimulus measures . chancellor angela merkel called on world powers to coordinate plans for weaning their national economies off economic stimulus measures , and warned against creating new asset bubbles .
" there will of course be a discussion about exit strategies , " merkel told reporters before flying to seoul for the meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- top rich and emerging nations .
" it is naturally desirable that the leading economic powers do not come up with answers which are too varied to the question as to when the exit strategy should begin , " she said .
" this could be a thoroughly lively debate . "
defusing the dollar asked about the united states ' policy of " quantitative easing , " which has seen the federal reserve pump 600 billion dollars into its fragile economy , merkel said : " we are going to discuss this issue with the americans in a spirit of partnership . "
" nobody has an interest in creating new bubbles .
rather , we must see to it that growth in the global economy this year is more sustainable and enduring than we had a few years ago , " she said .
critics argue that the fed 's quantitative easing amounts to an effective dollar devaluation , and has the potential to trigger a 1930s-style trade war if other countries respond in kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is accused of weakening its currency to promote economic growth with this in mind , merkel also pressed her fellow leaders to avoid any form of protectionism , amid criticism that certain countries , notably china and japan , are keeping their currencies artificially low to encourage exports .
but she declined to criticize beijing for its foreign exchange policy , saying : " i assume that china has a very strong interest in sending a positive signal from this summit . "
" china also needs sustainable growth for its overall economic situation , " the chancellor added .
germany is the world 's second-biggest exporter after china .
its strong export sector has helped it stage an impressive economic comeback this year , but its trade surpluses have also drawn criticism abroad .
no fixed numbers merkel said germany would not accept fixed targets for addressing countries ' trade gaps .
" we reject quantified bandwidths for acceptable imbalances for good reason because ... competitiveness must be able to express itself , also in export ratios . "
merkel said germany wants to see leaders commit themselves to the final stretch of the doha round of global trade talks .
she added that trade barriers posed the biggest danger to sustained world growth .
" the biggest danger for sustainable growth is currently coming from protectionism in its different forms , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 10.11.2010 german economic sages point to increased growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang franz and his team of ' wise men ' have n't delivered such good news for some time the german government 's team of five economic ' wise men ' have predicted consistent economic growth , lower unemployment , and reduced budget deficits for 2010 and 2011 .
however , they have warned against sudden tax cuts . the german council of economic experts predicted on wednesday that germany 's economy will grow by 3.7 percent in 2010 , and by 2.2 percent in 2011 - a prognosis that even exceeds the latest official estimates from chancellor angela merkel 's government .
" the pleasing upward trend in the german economy offers the chance for a stable , if relatively flat , path of growth , " the council 's chairman , wolfgang franz said .
" also , the government is in a position to considerably bolster these chances with solid economic policies . "
increased consumption , investments and demand for german exports are fuelling the recovery , and should lead to reduced levels of unemployment and state borrowing , the experts said .
however , they also cautioned that a repeat of germany 's so-called economic miracle in the post-war era was not on the cards .
the council , often referred to as the five wise men of the economy -lrb- in fact , one is a woman -rrb- , was set up in 1963 to advise the government on economic policy . " i think we are all delighted that the situation this year looks a lot more optimistic than last year , " chancellor angela merkel said on receiving the report , promising to continue with governent plans to save money .
" we are well aware that the structure of our current budget - designed as a response to the recent crisis with over 50 percent of spending going towards social security - is not a sustainable model for the future , especially considering our ageing population . "
taxation and borrowing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government says reducing borrowing still takes priority over tax cuts the chairman of the expert panel , wolfgang franz , told chancellor merkel that her government could support the fragile growth by issuing stricter regulations on the global financial sector and continuing to consolidate german overspending .
he also issued two warnings to governments , employers , and trade unions - advising against " rash cuts in taxes " and " excessive increases in wages . "
tax cuts were a major campaign platform of merkel 's pro-business coalition partners , the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , and the party - which is struggling in the polls - is keen that they are introduced sooner rather than later .
economic minister rainer bruederle , a member of the fdp , told german public television on wednesday that his party would be patient before cutting taxes , but the cuts would come .
" not today , but soon .
because if the economy really does grow as predicted , then - after implementing the measures to balance the budget that we have made priority number one - there might be a bit of lee-way for some slight cuts in the middle-bracket . "
bruederle said .
" but , as our coalition keeps saying , we must reduce the budget deficit as a short-term priority , and then think about taxation in the medium term . "
bruederle said that the government might be in a position to start the process by 2012 - especially in light of the panel 's prediction that germany might dip below the prescribed eu budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 .
but the economists see this matter very differently , arguing that there will be no room for tax cuts during the current legislative period -lrb- which ends in 2013 -rrb- , and saying it may not even be possible early in the next one .
instead , the group suggested that berlin might be forced to raise taxes slightly in order to meet its target of cutting 80 billion euros in spending between 2010 and 2014 .
job market to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to target germany 's unemployment problem the german economic experts also predicted reduced joblessness for 2011 , with germany set to dip below 3 million unemployed next year .
earlier in the week , buoyed by the prospect of good news from her experts , chancellor merkel told the focus news magazine that full employment was a major goal for her government .
" i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " she said .
" we must , and can , get these people back to work . "
however , the cologne-based institute for economic research predicts that a rate of around 5 percent unemployment , meaning roughly 2 million germans out of work , would be a more realistic goal in the foreseeable future .
" at that point the structural issues behind joblessness start to become a problem , " the institute 's president michael huether explained .
" things like a lack of qualifications , the unsuitability of candidates for the jobs on offer , and vice versa . "
economic envy in the english press germany is leading eu member states as the bloc struggles to emerge from recession - something which has caused the british media to take note in recent weeks .
as britain 's coalition government , elected earlier this year , looks to introduce tough spending cuts and jumpstart the faltering economy , more and more media outlets are reevaluating the merits of the relatively export-heavy , frugal economic policies which germans call " rhineland capitalism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's new leadership duo are making drastic cuts for little reward " a decade ago we considered the german economy a write-off .
now -lrb- prime minister -rrb- david cameron looks to angela merkel for inspiration , " a columnist at the left-leaning guardian newspaper , david gow , wrote in a recent commentary .
germany only partially followed the anglo-american movement towards dependence on the financial and services sectors in the latter half of the 20th century , preferring to maintain some industrial output and favoring a relatively cautious banking community .
the decision was often derided as backward , and even harmful to less cautious western neighbors , but now british commentators are asking whether the same caution has proved the key to a relatively swift recovery .
even the conservative newspaper , the times , has recently turned against the higher-risk capitalism favored in the english-speaking world , suggesting that germany 's export-heavy model is " leaving britain behind . "
yet there are other voices in the uk , like london-based financial analysts lombard street research , who point to decreasing demand in china and continued economic problems in the us and much of southern europe , suggesting that this could mean that germany 's export-driven recovery might falter in the near future .

he also issued two warnings to governments , employers , and trade unions - advising against " rash cuts in taxes " and " excessive increases in wages . "
tax cuts were a major campaign platform of merkel 's pro-business coalition partners , the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , and the party - which is struggling in the polls - is keen that they are introduced sooner rather than later .
economic minister rainer bruederle , a member of the fdp , told german public television on wednesday that his party would be patient before cutting taxes , but the cuts would come .
" not today , but soon .
because if the economy really does grow as predicted , then - after implementing the measures to balance the budget that we have made priority number one - there might be a bit of lee-way for some slight cuts in the middle-bracket . "
bruederle said .
" but , as our coalition keeps saying , we must reduce the budget deficit as a short-term priority , and then think about taxation in the medium term . "
bruederle said that the government might be in a position to start the process by 2012 - especially in light of the panel 's prediction that germany might dip below the prescribed eu budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 .
but the economists see this matter very differently , arguing that there will be no room for tax cuts during the current legislative period -lrb- which ends in 2013 -rrb- , and saying it may not even be possible early in the next one .
instead , the group suggested that berlin might be forced to raise taxes slightly in order to meet its target of cutting 80 billion euros in spending between 2010 and 2014 .
job market to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to target germany 's unemployment problem the german economic experts also predicted reduced joblessness for 2011 , with germany set to dip below 3 million unemployed next year .
earlier in the week , buoyed by the prospect of good news from her experts , chancellor merkel told the focus news magazine that full employment was a major goal for her government .
" i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " she said .
" we must , and can , get these people back to work . "
however , the cologne-based institute for economic research predicts that a rate of around 5 percent unemployment , meaning roughly 2 million germans out of work , would be a more realistic goal in the foreseeable future .
" at that point the structural issues behind joblessness start to become a problem , " the institute 's president michael huether explained .
" things like a lack of qualifications , the unsuitability of candidates for the jobs on offer , and vice versa . "
economic envy in the english press germany is leading eu member states as the bloc struggles to emerge from recession - something which has caused the british media to take note in recent weeks .
as britain 's coalition government , elected earlier this year , looks to introduce tough spending cuts and jumpstart the faltering economy , more and more media outlets are reevaluating the merits of the relatively export-heavy , frugal economic policies which germans call " rhineland capitalism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's new leadership duo are making drastic cuts for little reward " a decade ago we considered the german economy a write-off .
now -lrb- prime minister -rrb- david cameron looks to angela merkel for inspiration , " a columnist at the left-leaning guardian newspaper , david gow , wrote in a recent commentary .
germany only partially followed the anglo-american movement towards dependence on the financial and services sectors in the latter half of the 20th century , preferring to maintain some industrial output and favoring a relatively cautious banking community .
the decision was often derided as backward , and even harmful to less cautious western neighbors , but now british commentators are asking whether the same caution has proved the key to a relatively swift recovery .
even the conservative newspaper , the times , has recently turned against the higher-risk capitalism favored in the english-speaking world , suggesting that germany 's export-heavy model is " leaving britain behind . "
yet there are other voices in the uk , like london-based financial analysts lombard street research , who point to decreasing demand in china and continued economic problems in the us and much of southern europe , suggesting that this could mean that germany 's export-driven recovery might falter in the near future .

in a press release , the icfr said there was widespread fear in the sector that the g20 could " fail to make progress on its goals , as domestic considerations move back center-stage . "
it urged leaders to agree on financial reforms most likely improve economic stability and achieve international implementation . " we are calling on the g20 to prioritize more effective cross-border coordination by supervisors , and for agreement on the way forward on crisis resolution to allow for the orderly wind-down of complex banks , " barbara ridpath , ceo of the watchdog said in a statement .
" time for unity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki moon has urged leaders to find common ground the icfr calls were echoed by united nations secretary general ban ki-moon , who is in the south korean capital for the international summit .
on the eve of the meeting , he expressed concern over national differences of opinion on global rebalancing and currency policies .
" the global economic recovery remains fragile .
64 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty this year , " ban said , adding that this was a time for unity .
he said the world could not afford to think narrowly about development and economic growth , and that " all countries and all peoples have a stake in the management of the global economy . "
on the agenda leaders at the seoul g20 summit , the first to be held in an emerging market economy , are expected to sign off on the basel iii agreement , which is designed to tighten global capital and liquidity requirements for banks from 2013 onwards . bildunterschrift : the summit is being watched closely by managers in frankfurt 's banking towers drafted by the basel committee of central bankers and regulators back in september , the package is considered a significant step down the path towards financial stability .
it also tipped by observers to be one of the few items on the regulation agenda that is likely to receive broad support in seoul .
the only other real progress the talks are expected to yield is the endorsement of a series of agreements aimed at tightening supervision of the derivatives market and ensuring the standardization of contracts to facilitate central clearing processes and trading on exchanges .
safety nets on the issue of " too big to fail " banks , analysts are expecting little movement .
the financial stability board -lrb- fsb -rrb- , which is responsible for the implementation of g20 regulatory pledges , is expected to lay out a set of recommendations on " systemically important financial institutions , " otherwise known as sifis , involving the largest 20 or so global banks .
under the terms of the proposals , regulators would be required to make sure that sifis , the list of which is yet to be finalized , prepare living wills outlining how , if necessary , they could be wound up without causing major upset on the markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsbc is likely to feature on the list of global banks deemed too big to fail g20 members have not , as yet , been able to agree on many of the details of sifis , but there is speculation that the list will not include big asian banks .
their business is conducted primarily in domestic markets .
they therefore pose little threat to the wider world if they go under .
ratings , commodities and accounting summit delegates are , however , tipped to rubber-stamp fsb proposals for reducing market reliance on rating agencies .
if they do green-light the suggestion , they will have to find alternative ways of assessing creditworthiness .
regulators say the move would reduce what is known as the cliff effect , which contributes to market destabilization .
in the name of yet greater stability , the group of 20 wealthy and emerging nations is also calling for more transparency in commodity markets .
this week , regulators ruled a major overhaul , but they did concede more pricing information was needed from physical commodity markets .
there is little hope of movement on the establishment of a single set of global accounting standards .
the june 2011 deadline is likely to be overshot due to differences between the g20 member states , but analysts say the summit could be an opportunity to push for resolution .

however , they have warned against sudden tax cuts . the german council of economic experts predicted on wednesday that germany 's economy will grow by 3.7 percent in 2010 , and by 2.2 percent in 2011 - a prognosis that even exceeds the latest official estimates from chancellor angela merkel 's government .
" the pleasing upward trend in the german economy offers the chance for a stable , if relatively flat , path of growth , " the council 's chairman , wolfgang franz said .
" also , the government is in a position to considerably bolster these chances with solid economic policies . "
increased consumption , investments and demand for german exports are fuelling the recovery , and should lead to reduced levels of unemployment and state borrowing , the experts said .
however , they also cautioned that a repeat of germany 's so-called economic miracle in the post-war era was not on the cards .
the council , often referred to as the five wise men of the economy -lrb- in fact , one is a woman -rrb- , was set up in 1963 to advise the government on economic policy . " i think we are all delighted that the situation this year looks a lot more optimistic than last year , " chancellor angela merkel said on receiving the report , promising to continue with governent plans to save money .
" we are well aware that the structure of our current budget - designed as a response to the recent crisis with over 50 percent of spending going towards social security - is not a sustainable model for the future , especially considering our ageing population . "
taxation and borrowing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government says reducing borrowing still takes priority over tax cuts the chairman of the expert panel , wolfgang franz , told chancellor merkel that her government could support the fragile growth by issuing stricter regulations on the global financial sector and continuing to consolidate german overspending .
he also issued two warnings to governments , employers , and trade unions - advising against " rash cuts in taxes " and " excessive increases in wages . "
tax cuts were a major campaign platform of merkel 's pro-business coalition partners , the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , and the party - which is struggling in the polls - is keen that they are introduced sooner rather than later .
economic minister rainer bruederle , a member of the fdp , told german public television on wednesday that his party would be patient before cutting taxes , but the cuts would come .
" not today , but soon .
because if the economy really does grow as predicted , then - after implementing the measures to balance the budget that we have made priority number one - there might be a bit of lee-way for some slight cuts in the middle-bracket . "
bruederle said .
" but , as our coalition keeps saying , we must reduce the budget deficit as a short-term priority , and then think about taxation in the medium term . "
bruederle said that the government might be in a position to start the process by 2012 - especially in light of the panel 's prediction that germany might dip below the prescribed eu budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 .
but the economists see this matter very differently , arguing that there will be no room for tax cuts during the current legislative period -lrb- which ends in 2013 -rrb- , and saying it may not even be possible early in the next one .
instead , the group suggested that berlin might be forced to raise taxes slightly in order to meet its target of cutting 80 billion euros in spending between 2010 and 2014 .
job market to grow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor wants to target germany 's unemployment problem the german economic experts also predicted reduced joblessness for 2011 , with germany set to dip below 3 million unemployed next year .
earlier in the week , buoyed by the prospect of good news from her experts , chancellor merkel told the focus news magazine that full employment was a major goal for her government .
" i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " she said .
" we must , and can , get these people back to work . "
however , the cologne-based institute for economic research predicts that a rate of around 5 percent unemployment , meaning roughly 2 million germans out of work , would be a more realistic goal in the foreseeable future .
" at that point the structural issues behind joblessness start to become a problem , " the institute 's president michael huether explained .
" things like a lack of qualifications , the unsuitability of candidates for the jobs on offer , and vice versa . "
economic envy in the english press germany is leading eu member states as the bloc struggles to emerge from recession - something which has caused the british media to take note in recent weeks .
as britain 's coalition government , elected earlier this year , looks to introduce tough spending cuts and jumpstart the faltering economy , more and more media outlets are reevaluating the merits of the relatively export-heavy , frugal economic policies which germans call " rhineland capitalism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's new leadership duo are making drastic cuts for little reward " a decade ago we considered the german economy a write-off .
now -lrb- prime minister -rrb- david cameron looks to angela merkel for inspiration , " a columnist at the left-leaning guardian newspaper , david gow , wrote in a recent commentary .
germany only partially followed the anglo-american movement towards dependence on the financial and services sectors in the latter half of the 20th century , preferring to maintain some industrial output and favoring a relatively cautious banking community .
the decision was often derided as backward , and even harmful to less cautious western neighbors , but now british commentators are asking whether the same caution has proved the key to a relatively swift recovery .
even the conservative newspaper , the times , has recently turned against the higher-risk capitalism favored in the english-speaking world , suggesting that germany 's export-heavy model is " leaving britain behind . "
yet there are other voices in the uk , like london-based financial analysts lombard street research , who point to decreasing demand in china and continued economic problems in the us and much of southern europe , suggesting that this could mean that germany 's export-driven recovery might falter in the near future .

many eu politicians have a guilty conscience over keeping ankara waiting .
but that 's a poor basis for making decisions , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . many eu politicians have a guilty conscience .
they do n't know how to deal with ankara ’ s hopes for speedy progress in the country 's bid for eu membership .
turkey is after all an official membership candidate and is trying to implement the reforms that brussels is calling for .
and from ankara 's perspective , this should eventually lead to full membership once the eu 's demands have been met .
so far , all previous membership candidates have eventually become full members .
but it 's clear that a guilty conscience alone is a poor basis for granting membership .
many european governments today regret that they – or their predecessors – have in past years given the green light for membership talks with turkey .
the doubts within the eu about whether turkey is fit for membership have since then only increased , and the arguments against membership have not changed .
they are not about individual points of criticism – be it cyprus or freedom of expression – but they are , in fact of a more fundamental nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations will continue to improve , but there wo n't be full membership , says hasselbach for instance , the eu still struggles with the consequences of its two previous expansion rounds in 2004 and 2007 .
and even if past expansion was not a mistake – the new members have significantly changed the european union .
the bloc 's ability to speak with one voice seems to be faltering – simply because the member states are too diverse and different .
these changes have to sink in and this process is bound to take time .
accepting turkey with its different history and tradition would from today 's perspective lead to a final stop to european integration .
has anyone ever thought of the fact that turkey would soon surpass germany as the most populous eu member state ?
turkey as a member would therefore have the right to demand more official posts than any of the other countries .
this would change the eu to an extent likely to cause sharp opposition .
and no one can guarantee that turkey will remain a secular state for good .
none of this calls into question the fact that the eu needs turkey and that turkey needs the eu .
the good trade relations and security cooperation should be built upon .
both sides are certain to do this for their very own interests .
and turkey is likely to continue its reform path even without the prospect of eu membership .
that 's why it ’ s wrong to argue that without membership talks , ankara will abandon reforms and look for other partners .
both sides need to look at the current situation .
it 's not a question of all or nothing .
and the eu should be honest with ankara that at the end of the path will be a closer relationship than today – but no full membership .

sarkozy wasted no time in signing the bill on wednesday , just hours after the court ruling .
he said in a statement that while he heard the concerns expressed by opponents during the debate , it was his " duty " to ensure the pension fund 's integrity .
" with this law , our redistributive pension system has been saved , " he said .
" french citizens can now be assured that they can count on their retirement and that pension payments will be maintained . "
sarkozy 's right-of-center government insisted the reform , which raises the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the full retirement age from 65 to 67 , was necessary to fill a major budget gap as france 's population ages and few workers are paying into the system .
the law will gradually come into effect in july 2011 and will be fully enacted by 2018 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive strikes and protests against the reform disrupted society socialists vow a repeal opposition socialists and other parties asked the country 's highest court to examine the constitutionality of the law on november 2 , saying it contradicted france 's principles of equality .
the court rejected the challenge , but the socialists have vowed to repeal the law if they win the next presidential election in 2012 .
" the president is confusing appearance with reality , he thinks that by putting his head down and charging forward without listening , he 's showing courage , " said socialist leader martine aubry .
" it would have been courage to put in place a reform that really solves the problem of retirement . "
as the reform was in debate in the legislature , massive protests and nationwide strikes crippled the country 's transportation system and all but shut down the oil industry , leaving many gas stations without fuel for cars .
unions have called for another day of strikes on november 23 , but it was unclear how many would take part , as the public opposition to the bill was running out of steam toward the end of the debate .

the case involves airlines that fly around the globe , from air france-klm , to british airways and quantas . the european union 's competition watchdog issued fines tuesday to 11 airlines totaling 799.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- for running a global cargo cartel .
the cargo carriers were found to have coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security over a six-year period , between 1999 and 2006 .
" with today 's decision , the european commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate cartel behavior , " eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner almunia said the case was " deplorable " the fine imposed is one of the biggest in eu history .
the bloc 's rules forbid most forms of price fixing among competitors .
" it is deplorable that so many major airlines coordinated their pricing to the detriment of european businesses and european consumers , " almunia added .
no fine for the whistleblower air france-klm was hit with the largest fine of 310 million euros .
british airways came in second , having to pay a 104-million-euro penalty .
luxembourg 's cargolux will have to pay 79.9 million euros , while scandinavian carrier sas was ordered to pay 70.2 million euros .
other airlines involved in the cartel and slapped with fines were singapore airlines , air canada , quantas , lan chile , martinair and japan airlines .
the commission said it dropped charges against eleven other airlines , including german carrier lufthansa and its subsidiary swiss air , because it was the first to provide information about the cartel .
according to the commission the cartel the airlines began fixing fuel-surcharges in 1999 .
later the cooperation expanded with the introduction of a security surcharge and refused to pay a commission on those surcharges to their clients .
" by refusing to pay a commission , the airlines ensured that surcharges did not become subject to competition through the granting of discounts to customers .
such practices are in breach of the eu competition rules , " the commission said in a statement .

his book is unlikely to help heal the rift that emerged between the us and europe while he was in office . the 43rd us president 's apparent mission to have his two terms in the white house reassessed and his reputation rehabilitated through his new book , " decision points , " has many europeans shaking their heads . and it 's not just the most inflammatory excerpts - such as bush 's assertion that water-boarding of terror suspects saved lives - that are causing an outcry . bush 's supporters in the us say that every president has the right to defend his record ; " decision points " shows the former president as a man who was ideologically consistent during his eight years in office . his detractors counter that the president 's mistakes and his determination to follow ill-thought-out policies - without a thought for a possible , rectifying change of direction - plunged the us into a decade of war and the worst financial crisis in over 80 years .
while george w. bush may have been a good guy with a difficult job , they say , he does n't deserve to be rehabilitated via his memoirs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush left office with two wars and an economic crisis raging if bush 's single-minded and heavy-handed approach to afghanistan and iraq in the wake of the terror attacks of 9/11 were damaging to his relations with his european allies at the time , his newly released memoirs appear to be giving european readers the chance get angry all over again . europeans , even allies , dismissed as irrelevant " in my opinion , there ’ s been no change in perception of bush in europe , " dr. henning meyer , a transatlantic relations expert at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle . " his legacy projects , such as iraq and afghanistan , are still the main issues associated with his presidency and of course europeans are still affected by these and in most cases are still in opposition to a certain degree .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush says the uk 's perception of him does n't matter in " decision points , " bush is dismissive about those europeans who had taken a risk to follow him into war in iraq , and he talks frankly about his reputation in the one country whose leaders followed him most obediently of all : england .
" it does n't matter how people perceive me in england , " he writes .
" it just does n't matter any more .
and frankly , at times , it did n't matter then . " in a veiled dig at what he saw at the time as the rest of europe 's lack of stomach for the fight , bush writes : " people in europe said : ' ah , man , he 's a religious fanatic , cowboy , simpleton . '
all that stuff ...
if you believe that freedom is universal , then you should n't be surprised when people take courageous measures to live in a free society . " he reserves his most scathing treatment for those european leaders who disappointed him most , especially during the iraq war : former german chancellor gerhard schroeder comes in for even worse treatment than former french president jacques chirac , schroeder 's ally in the european anti-war opposition . german emotions still raw over bush 's rush to war in the book , bush accuses schroeder of abusing his trust after allegedly telling the president in 2002 , before the invasion of iraq the following year , that " what goes for afghanistan also goes for iraq .

" schroeder 's support -lrb- for the invasion of iraq -rrb- was conditional on evidence being found of terrorists being harbored in iraq , so when there was no evidence delivered , he withdrew his support , " lse professor meyer told deutsche welle .
" bush is attempting to polish his own picture of this situation with the germans by saying that the breakdown in relations was not his fault and that it was schroeder who turned opinion against him . " the bush legacy is still powerfully felt in the united states : the armed forces are embroiled in the two wars he started ; the financial system is struggling to pull out of an overwhelming crisis , and politicians are scrambling to rebuild their credibility on the world stage . but the ripples from his eight-year presidency continue to be felt in europe as well .
under his leadership , decades of trust and cooperation between the us and european governments was damaged . according to thomas klau , a transatlantic relations expert at the european council for foreign relations , the memoir provides new fodder for europeans who are skeptical about the us political system .

" while obama gave some hope , the germans are now saddened to see that a discredited party such as the republicans can be re-elected as the majority in the house of representatives .

major powers are likely to disagree on currency policy and plans to end exceptional economic stimulus measures . chancellor angela merkel called on world powers to coordinate plans for weaning their national economies off economic stimulus measures , and warned against creating new asset bubbles .
" there will of course be a discussion about exit strategies , " merkel told reporters before flying to seoul for the meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- top rich and emerging nations .
" it is naturally desirable that the leading economic powers do not come up with answers which are too varied to the question as to when the exit strategy should begin , " she said .
" this could be a thoroughly lively debate . "
defusing the dollar asked about the united states ' policy of " quantitative easing , " which has seen the federal reserve pump 600 billion dollars into its fragile economy , merkel said : " we are going to discuss this issue with the americans in a spirit of partnership . "
" nobody has an interest in creating new bubbles .
rather , we must see to it that growth in the global economy this year is more sustainable and enduring than we had a few years ago , " she said .
critics argue that the fed 's quantitative easing amounts to an effective dollar devaluation , and has the potential to trigger a 1930s-style trade war if other countries respond in kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is accused of weakening its currency to promote economic growth with this in mind , merkel also pressed her fellow leaders to avoid any form of protectionism , amid criticism that certain countries , notably china and japan , are keeping their currencies artificially low to encourage exports .
but she declined to criticize beijing for its foreign exchange policy , saying : " i assume that china has a very strong interest in sending a positive signal from this summit . "
" china also needs sustainable growth for its overall economic situation , " the chancellor added .
germany is the world 's second-biggest exporter after china .
its strong export sector has helped it stage an impressive economic comeback this year , but its trade surpluses have also drawn criticism abroad .
no fixed numbers merkel said germany would not accept fixed targets for addressing countries ' trade gaps .
" we reject quantified bandwidths for acceptable imbalances for good reason because ... competitiveness must be able to express itself , also in export ratios . "
merkel said germany wants to see leaders commit themselves to the final stretch of the doha round of global trade talks .
she added that trade barriers posed the biggest danger to sustained world growth .
" the biggest danger for sustainable growth is currently coming from protectionism in its different forms , " she said .

lidl has come under particular fire over pay and practices . supermarkets across germany are popular places to buy clothes .
prices are cheap : you can buy a men 's shirt for seven euros -lrb- nine us dollars -rrb- or a pair of women 's trousers for under 10 euros .
however two women from bangladesh are currently on a speaking tour of germany to highlight how these cheap prices come at a human cost .
26-year-old jessmin begum and 36-year-old arifa akter both work as seamstresses in clothes factories in dhaka that make clothes for european stores .
they say the working conditions are terrible and the pay is inadequate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers complain about cramped conditions , dirty water and tough bosses " i 'm proud of my work , especially when i see people here wearing my clothes , " said begum , who works for a factory that supplies clothes to german-based supermarket chain lidl .
" but it makes me mad that what we get for our work in bangladesh is nothing . "
not a living wage as a seamstress , jessmin begum earns around 35 euros a month -lrb- just under 4,000 bangladesh taka -rrb- .
the monthly rent for a one room apartment in dhaka is around 25 euros a month .
" it is not even close to the living wage we have calculated , " said khorshed alam from the campaigning group alternative movement for resources and freedom society -lrb- amrf -rrb- .
with calculations based on someone working a 12- to 14-hour day , the amrf estimates around 5,000 taka a month -lrb- 52 euros -rrb- is necessary for a single worker .
a family needs to earn around 9-10,000 taka .
dirty water , mean bosses , unpaid overtime the two seamstresses are using their tour of germany to highlight how bad working conditions are in the factories .
" the drinking water is dirty and we are packed in with little space between the machines , " said begum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessmin begum has been working as a seamstress in dhaka for eight years " our supervisors insult us and put us under pressure to work harder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 10.11.2010 opinion : a guilty conscience is no basis for membership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how should the eu deal with turkey 's membership hopes ?
many eu politicians have a guilty conscience over keeping ankara waiting .
but that 's a poor basis for making decisions , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . many eu politicians have a guilty conscience .
they do n't know how to deal with ankara ’ s hopes for speedy progress in the country 's bid for eu membership .
turkey is after all an official membership candidate and is trying to implement the reforms that brussels is calling for .
and from ankara 's perspective , this should eventually lead to full membership once the eu 's demands have been met .
so far , all previous membership candidates have eventually become full members .
but it 's clear that a guilty conscience alone is a poor basis for granting membership .
many european governments today regret that they – or their predecessors – have in past years given the green light for membership talks with turkey .
the doubts within the eu about whether turkey is fit for membership have since then only increased , and the arguments against membership have not changed .
they are not about individual points of criticism – be it cyprus or freedom of expression – but they are , in fact of a more fundamental nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations will continue to improve , but there wo n't be full membership , says hasselbach for instance , the eu still struggles with the consequences of its two previous expansion rounds in 2004 and 2007 .
and even if past expansion was not a mistake – the new members have significantly changed the european union .
the bloc 's ability to speak with one voice seems to be faltering – simply because the member states are too diverse and different .
these changes have to sink in and this process is bound to take time .
accepting turkey with its different history and tradition would from today 's perspective lead to a final stop to european integration .
has anyone ever thought of the fact that turkey would soon surpass germany as the most populous eu member state ?
turkey as a member would therefore have the right to demand more official posts than any of the other countries .
this would change the eu to an extent likely to cause sharp opposition .
and no one can guarantee that turkey will remain a secular state for good .
none of this calls into question the fact that the eu needs turkey and that turkey needs the eu .
the good trade relations and security cooperation should be built upon .
both sides are certain to do this for their very own interests .
and turkey is likely to continue its reform path even without the prospect of eu membership .
that 's why it ’ s wrong to argue that without membership talks , ankara will abandon reforms and look for other partners .
both sides need to look at the current situation .
it 's not a question of all or nothing .
and the eu should be honest with ankara that at the end of the path will be a closer relationship than today – but no full membership .

many eu politicians have a guilty conscience over keeping ankara waiting .
but that 's a poor basis for making decisions , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . many eu politicians have a guilty conscience .
they do n't know how to deal with ankara ’ s hopes for speedy progress in the country 's bid for eu membership .
turkey is after all an official membership candidate and is trying to implement the reforms that brussels is calling for .
and from ankara 's perspective , this should eventually lead to full membership once the eu 's demands have been met .
so far , all previous membership candidates have eventually become full members .
but it 's clear that a guilty conscience alone is a poor basis for granting membership .
many european governments today regret that they – or their predecessors – have in past years given the green light for membership talks with turkey .
the doubts within the eu about whether turkey is fit for membership have since then only increased , and the arguments against membership have not changed .
they are not about individual points of criticism – be it cyprus or freedom of expression – but they are , in fact of a more fundamental nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations will continue to improve , but there wo n't be full membership , says hasselbach for instance , the eu still struggles with the consequences of its two previous expansion rounds in 2004 and 2007 .
and even if past expansion was not a mistake – the new members have significantly changed the european union .
the bloc 's ability to speak with one voice seems to be faltering – simply because the member states are too diverse and different .
these changes have to sink in and this process is bound to take time .
accepting turkey with its different history and tradition would from today 's perspective lead to a final stop to european integration .
has anyone ever thought of the fact that turkey would soon surpass germany as the most populous eu member state ?
turkey as a member would therefore have the right to demand more official posts than any of the other countries .
this would change the eu to an extent likely to cause sharp opposition .
and no one can guarantee that turkey will remain a secular state for good .
none of this calls into question the fact that the eu needs turkey and that turkey needs the eu .
the good trade relations and security cooperation should be built upon .
both sides are certain to do this for their very own interests .
and turkey is likely to continue its reform path even without the prospect of eu membership .
that 's why it ’ s wrong to argue that without membership talks , ankara will abandon reforms and look for other partners .
both sides need to look at the current situation .
it 's not a question of all or nothing .
and the eu should be honest with ankara that at the end of the path will be a closer relationship than today – but no full membership .

with the spotlight on south korea , the government there has taken a number of steps to ensure the forum goes off without a hitch . south korea is in the grips of g20 fever.television ads play around the clock proclaiming korea ’ s readiness to host the summit .
banners hung around seoul urge residents to say hello and be extra courteous to the visiting foreigners .
the south korean government is taking preparations for the g20 very seriously .
it ’ s the largest international gathering the country has held since the 2002 world cup .
this week ’ s summit also marks the first time a non-g8 and asian nation has hosted the economic forum .
south korea proud to host g20 and considering that several decades ago , south korea was one of the world ’ s poorest nations , its quick rise to the top makes it a model for other nations to emulate , says un secretary general ban ki moon .
the former south korean foreign minister says he ’ s proud of his nation ’ s accomplishments that have been made in the light of its division and war with north korea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea has undertaken the largest-ever security operation he spoke during a press briefing today in seoul : " i think we meet at a critical moment , the spotlight is on korea and is the first g20 summit in an emerging market economy .
korea is a bridge between the developed and developing world .
this role has never been more necessary and important and so there is something very special about this g20 moment . "
activists protest against " unequal economic policies " but some opposed to the g20 are using this moment to raise attention what they call its flawed economic policies .
an umbrella organization representing 80 south korean labor and civic groups says the top economies have done little to help the world ’ s poor and offset global unemployment , which they say is the highest in years .
chun hyoung baek of the civic group people ’ s solidarity for participatory democracy delivered the activists ’ official statement .
she spoke through an interpreter : " we call upon the g20 to regulate financial capital , which have brought suffering to so many people .
we call on the g20 to tax speculators and use the revenues to expand welfare .
the g20 has revamped the international monetary fund whose structural adjustment programs have devastated the lives of people all around the world . "
and now as the g20 gets under way , korean and foreign activists are taking their message to the streets of seoul .
earlier this week , tens of thousands of protesters rallied against the g20 .
they were met by squads of korean riot police , who have been put on high alert ahead of the summit .
security tight in seoul some reports say the police used pepper spray to hold demonstrators back .
to keep protests like this under control and away from the g20 venues , seoul authorities have created a two kilometer buffer zone around the convention center .
it ’ s the largest security operation the nation has undertaken , according to the national police agency .
but south korea ’ s measures have only aggravated some protestors .
kim young hoon , president of the korean confederation of trade unions , says that president lee myung bak is denying their right to protest during the summit .
violence between trade unions and police has erupted in the past during anti free trade rallies .
police have been criticized for turning water cannons on protestors .
bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate in seoul to draw attention to global poverty issues and kim says that he can not ensure that his members won ’ t resort to violence again , if police prevent them from demonstrating : " excessive use of force to crack down on demonstrations and rallies , to crack down and oppress our rights , will induce or provoke the demonstrations to become violent , that nobody wants . "
south korean riot police are prepared to confront activist groups on thursday , the first day of the g20 summit , as protestors plan to march through the capital .

when lehman brothers investment bank collapsed in the fall of 2008 , it unleashed a global financial crisis , and the g20 became a vehicle to combat recession .

their aim is to ensure such an unprecedented global crisis never happens again .

" in my view one of the main features of this crisis has been the emergence of a willingness to work together , of a new kind of economic cooperation at the global level which never existed , never happened in the past , " strauss-kahn said in october at the annual meeting of the imf in washington .
according to strauss-kahn , that spirit of cooperation was present at past g20 summits in london , pittsburgh and toronto .
but the meeting starting thursday in seoul may show a decrease in countries ' willingness to cooperate at a global level .
" that is a real threat … there is no domestic solution to a global crisis , " he said .
summit as a litmus test the g20 summit participants surely know global cooperation is the way forward .
in the end , however , each country has to master its own national politics in order to institute financial reform .
that 's why german chancellor angela merkel says she is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far " in terms of the financial sector 's participation in carrying the costs of the crisis , the german government could have pictured more , " she told german parliamentarians in october as she outlined her goals for the seoul gathering .
while germany imposed a nationwide " financial crisis responsibility fee " on its banks , the g20 failed to agree on an international tax on financial markets .
nevertheless , europe will be bringing something to the table in seoul : its oversight of financial systems will be significantly improved .
risky financial products may be forbidden under certain circumstances and control over hedge funds and ratings agencies is being tightened .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has expressed concerns about the seoul g20 summit .
he says it comes at a critical point in time , as all parties will have to accept that global economic imbalances affect them all .
" it will be a real test of whether the g20 can deliver the coordination the world economy needs , " he wrote in an open letter .
no hint of unity despite numerous promises to disallow protectionism , the g20 nations are far from unified in their efforts to do so .
each is primarily acting with the strength its own domestic economy in mind , and the resulting imbalance is fertile ground for another crisis .
the trade balances of the individual countries – the ratio of their exports versus imports – is filled with dormant potential for conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imposed a fee on its banks , but an international tax was not agreed on in outlining her goals for the seoul g20 summit , merkel asked what countries can " do together for sustainable , strong and balanced growth . "
she wants to see this entirely accomplished by unadulterated market forces as such balances are an expression of economic competitiveness .
no answers on currency currency exchange rates are an inevitable source of controversy in the current scenario of global trade , and some analysts have already dubbed the situation a " global currency war . "
the problem is that some countries are trying to gain a competitive edge by devaluing their own currencies to make exports more attractive .
china and the united states are the primary practitioners of this tactic , with south korea , japan and brazil jointing in too .
a precarious race has begun .
the seoul g20 summit wo n't solve this problem , but merkel says that exchange rates should accurately reflect the fundamental data of a country 's domestic prosperity for the time being .
" a political scenario which targets currency distortion to strengthen economic competitiveness must be avoided , " merkel said .
france , which is due to take over south korea 's presidency of the g20 , wants to make currency policies a central issue .
still , one central issue may be the most important of all during the talks – whether the 20 nations can demonstrate they are all moving in the same direction , even if they were forced into negotiations by a crisis .

in addition to keeping the " global currency war " from escalating , a common goal must be reaffirmed . the sheer scale of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit can be staggering .
representing 90 percent of the world 's economic power , and four-fifths of global trade , the summit is crisis-oriented .
it was called into life in 1999 as a reaction to financial crises in asia , brazil and russia , and was initially a meeting of financial ministers .
when lehman brothers investment bank collapsed in the fall of 2008 , it unleashed a global financial crisis , and the g20 became a vehicle to combat recession .
that 's when heads of state became involved .
it has been nearly two years since a package of financial measures was decided on in washington .
their aim is to ensure such an unprecedented global crisis never happens again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique strauss-kahn says global cooperation is needed for dominique strauss-kahn , a french politician and managing director of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the most important realization of the crisis is that egoism on the national level needs to yield to global cooperation .
" in my view one of the main features of this crisis has been the emergence of a willingness to work together , of a new kind of economic cooperation at the global level which never existed , never happened in the past , " strauss-kahn said in october at the annual meeting of the imf in washington .
according to strauss-kahn , that spirit of cooperation was present at past g20 summits in london , pittsburgh and toronto .
but the meeting starting thursday in seoul may show a decrease in countries ' willingness to cooperate at a global level .
" that is a real threat … there is no domestic solution to a global crisis , " he said .
summit as a litmus test the g20 summit participants surely know global cooperation is the way forward .
in the end , however , each country has to master its own national politics in order to institute financial reform .
that 's why german chancellor angela merkel says she is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is n't satisfied with what has been accomplished so far " in terms of the financial sector 's participation in carrying the costs of the crisis , the german government could have pictured more , " she told german parliamentarians in october as she outlined her goals for the seoul gathering .
while germany imposed a nationwide " financial crisis responsibility fee " on its banks , the g20 failed to agree on an international tax on financial markets .
nevertheless , europe will be bringing something to the table in seoul : its oversight of financial systems will be significantly improved .
risky financial products may be forbidden under certain circumstances and control over hedge funds and ratings agencies is being tightened .
european commission president jose manuel barroso has expressed concerns about the seoul g20 summit .
he says it comes at a critical point in time , as all parties will have to accept that global economic imbalances affect them all .
" it will be a real test of whether the g20 can deliver the coordination the world economy needs , " he wrote in an open letter .
no hint of unity despite numerous promises to disallow protectionism , the g20 nations are far from unified in their efforts to do so .
each is primarily acting with the strength its own domestic economy in mind , and the resulting imbalance is fertile ground for another crisis .
the trade balances of the individual countries – the ratio of their exports versus imports – is filled with dormant potential for conflict .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imposed a fee on its banks , but an international tax was not agreed on in outlining her goals for the seoul g20 summit , merkel asked what countries can " do together for sustainable , strong and balanced growth . "
she wants to see this entirely accomplished by unadulterated market forces as such balances are an expression of economic competitiveness .
no answers on currency currency exchange rates are an inevitable source of controversy in the current scenario of global trade , and some analysts have already dubbed the situation a " global currency war . "
the problem is that some countries are trying to gain a competitive edge by devaluing their own currencies to make exports more attractive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 10.11.2010 eu fines airlines over air cargo cartel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airlines were found to be in clear violation of eu rules the eu has slapped one of its biggest fines in history on a number of airlines for fixing cargo prices .
the case involves airlines that fly around the globe , from air france-klm , to british airways and quantas . the european union 's competition watchdog issued fines tuesday to 11 airlines totaling 799.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- for running a global cargo cartel .
the cargo carriers were found to have coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security over a six-year period , between 1999 and 2006 .
" with today 's decision , the european commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate cartel behavior , " eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia told reporters in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner almunia said the case was " deplorable " the fine imposed is one of the biggest in eu history .
the bloc 's rules forbid most forms of price fixing among competitors .
" it is deplorable that so many major airlines coordinated their pricing to the detriment of european businesses and european consumers , " almunia added .
no fine for the whistleblower air france-klm was hit with the largest fine of 310 million euros .
british airways came in second , having to pay a 104-million-euro penalty .
luxembourg 's cargolux will have to pay 79.9 million euros , while scandinavian carrier sas was ordered to pay 70.2 million euros .
other airlines involved in the cartel and slapped with fines were singapore airlines , air canada , quantas , lan chile , martinair and japan airlines .
the commission said it dropped charges against eleven other airlines , including german carrier lufthansa and its subsidiary swiss air , because it was the first to provide information about the cartel .
according to the commission the cartel the airlines began fixing fuel-surcharges in 1999 .
later the cooperation expanded with the introduction of a security surcharge and refused to pay a commission on those surcharges to their clients .
" by refusing to pay a commission , the airlines ensured that surcharges did not become subject to competition through the granting of discounts to customers .
such practices are in breach of the eu competition rules , " the commission said in a statement .

his book is unlikely to help heal the rift that emerged between the us and europe while he was in office . the 43rd us president 's apparent mission to have his two terms in the white house reassessed and his reputation rehabilitated through his new book , " decision points , " has many europeans shaking their heads . and it 's not just the most inflammatory excerpts - such as bush 's assertion that water-boarding of terror suspects saved lives - that are causing an outcry . bush 's supporters in the us say that every president has the right to defend his record ; " decision points " shows the former president as a man who was ideologically consistent during his eight years in office . his detractors counter that the president 's mistakes and his determination to follow ill-thought-out policies - without a thought for a possible , rectifying change of direction - plunged the us into a decade of war and the worst financial crisis in over 80 years .
while george w. bush may have been a good guy with a difficult job , they say , he does n't deserve to be rehabilitated via his memoirs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush left office with two wars and an economic crisis raging if bush 's single-minded and heavy-handed approach to afghanistan and iraq in the wake of the terror attacks of 9/11 were damaging to his relations with his european allies at the time , his newly released memoirs appear to be giving european readers the chance get angry all over again . europeans , even allies , dismissed as irrelevant " in my opinion , there ’ s been no change in perception of bush in europe , " dr. henning meyer , a transatlantic relations expert at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle . " his legacy projects , such as iraq and afghanistan , are still the main issues associated with his presidency and of course europeans are still affected by these and in most cases are still in opposition to a certain degree .
if you remember , bush ’ s war on terror effectively split europe .
so these things have not been forgotten . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush says the uk 's perception of him does n't matter in " decision points , " bush is dismissive about those europeans who had taken a risk to follow him into war in iraq , and he talks frankly about his reputation in the one country whose leaders followed him most obediently of all : england .
" it does n't matter how people perceive me in england , " he writes .
" it just does n't matter any more .
and frankly , at times , it did n't matter then . " in a veiled dig at what he saw at the time as the rest of europe 's lack of stomach for the fight , bush writes : " people in europe said : ' ah , man , he 's a religious fanatic , cowboy , simpleton . '
all that stuff ...
if you believe that freedom is universal , then you should n't be surprised when people take courageous measures to live in a free society . " he reserves his most scathing treatment for those european leaders who disappointed him most , especially during the iraq war : former german chancellor gerhard schroeder comes in for even worse treatment than former french president jacques chirac , schroeder 's ally in the european anti-war opposition . german emotions still raw over bush 's rush to war in the book , bush accuses schroeder of abusing his trust after allegedly telling the president in 2002 , before the invasion of iraq the following year , that " what goes for afghanistan also goes for iraq .
nations which support terrorism must accept the consequences .
if you go forward fast and resolutely , i am on your side . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush did n't trust schroeder after the latter withdrew his support however , struggling in his re-election campaign in the fall of that year , schroeder hitched his wagon to the huge swell of anti-war feeling in germany and across europe .
he claims bush is lying when he says that he had offered his support for an invasion , and that he 'd made it clear all along that his support was conditional on whether iraq really had weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- . " schroeder 's support -lrb- for the invasion of iraq -rrb- was conditional on evidence being found of terrorists being harbored in iraq , so when there was no evidence delivered , he withdrew his support , " lse professor meyer told deutsche welle .
" bush is attempting to polish his own picture of this situation with the germans by saying that the breakdown in relations was not his fault and that it was schroeder who turned opinion against him . " the bush legacy is still powerfully felt in the united states : the armed forces are embroiled in the two wars he started ; the financial system is struggling to pull out of an overwhelming crisis , and politicians are scrambling to rebuild their credibility on the world stage . but the ripples from his eight-year presidency continue to be felt in europe as well .
under his leadership , decades of trust and cooperation between the us and european governments was damaged . according to thomas klau , a transatlantic relations expert at the european council for foreign relations , the memoir provides new fodder for europeans who are skeptical about the us political system . " europeans , and germans in particular , are still amazed that the us political system has the potential to elect such an incompetent leader who has no respect for western values , " klau said .
" while obama gave some hope , the germans are now saddened to see that a discredited party such as the republicans can be re-elected as the majority in the house of representatives . " germans see the republican mid-term victory as proof that " the us system and electorate has a very short memory and very little wisdom . " european anger reignited over torture statements so far , european reaction to the bush memoirs has been heavily affected by comments in the book that seem to advocate torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims water boarding extracted vital information for meyer , the water-boarding comments are " a very clear example of the philosophical differences between the bush administration and the europeans . " " there is a huge difference in what bush thought was acceptable in terms of the war on terror and what the europeans thought , " he added .
" bush saw approaches such as water-boarding as not a breaking of any laws but a legitimate bending of them . " moreover , bush " made bold statements " that the information gained from water-boarding stopped an attack on london - a claim the uk refutes . " most people in europe say that there were other ways of getting the information and that bush ’ s assertions are just not true , " meyer said . severe - and lasting - damage ? the response to his memoirs suggests that the damage bush did to his country 's reputation in europe remains severe . " bush 's was the worst us presidency that europe and the world has ever seen and his legacy , in political and economic terms , will be seen as one of disaster , " said klau .
" few people will expect to see any change in this perception arising from his memoirs .
in fact , it 's highly likely that his already terrible reputation in europe will take an even worse turn . " bush may have come out with his book to try and put the record straight in his own words .

his book is unlikely to help heal the rift that emerged between the us and europe while he was in office . the 43rd us president 's apparent mission to have his two terms in the white house reassessed and his reputation rehabilitated through his new book , " decision points , " has many europeans shaking their heads . and it 's not just the most inflammatory excerpts - such as bush 's assertion that water-boarding of terror suspects saved lives - that are causing an outcry . bush 's supporters in the us say that every president has the right to defend his record ; " decision points " shows the former president as a man who was ideologically consistent during his eight years in office . his detractors counter that the president 's mistakes and his determination to follow ill-thought-out policies - without a thought for a possible , rectifying change of direction - plunged the us into a decade of war and the worst financial crisis in over 80 years .
while george w. bush may have been a good guy with a difficult job , they say , he does n't deserve to be rehabilitated via his memoirs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush left office with two wars and an economic crisis raging if bush 's single-minded and heavy-handed approach to afghanistan and iraq in the wake of the terror attacks of 9/11 were damaging to his relations with his european allies at the time , his newly released memoirs appear to be giving european readers the chance get angry all over again . europeans , even allies , dismissed as irrelevant " in my opinion , there ’ s been no change in perception of bush in europe , " dr. henning meyer , a transatlantic relations expert at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle . " his legacy projects , such as iraq and afghanistan , are still the main issues associated with his presidency and of course europeans are still affected by these and in most cases are still in opposition to a certain degree .
if you remember , bush ’ s war on terror effectively split europe .
so these things have not been forgotten . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush says the uk 's perception of him does n't matter in " decision points , " bush is dismissive about those europeans who had taken a risk to follow him into war in iraq , and he talks frankly about his reputation in the one country whose leaders followed him most obediently of all : england .
" it does n't matter how people perceive me in england , " he writes .
" it just does n't matter any more .
and frankly , at times , it did n't matter then . " in a veiled dig at what he saw at the time as the rest of europe 's lack of stomach for the fight , bush writes : " people in europe said : ' ah , man , he 's a religious fanatic , cowboy , simpleton . '

major powers are likely to disagree on currency policy and plans to end exceptional economic stimulus measures . chancellor angela merkel called on world powers to coordinate plans for weaning their national economies off economic stimulus measures , and warned against creating new asset bubbles .
" there will of course be a discussion about exit strategies , " merkel told reporters before flying to seoul for the meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- top rich and emerging nations .
" it is naturally desirable that the leading economic powers do not come up with answers which are too varied to the question as to when the exit strategy should begin , " she said .
" this could be a thoroughly lively debate . "
defusing the dollar asked about the united states ' policy of " quantitative easing , " which has seen the federal reserve pump 600 billion dollars into its fragile economy , merkel said : " we are going to discuss this issue with the americans in a spirit of partnership . "
" nobody has an interest in creating new bubbles .
rather , we must see to it that growth in the global economy this year is more sustainable and enduring than we had a few years ago , " she said .
critics argue that the fed 's quantitative easing amounts to an effective dollar devaluation , and has the potential to trigger a 1930s-style trade war if other countries respond in kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is accused of weakening its currency to promote economic growth with this in mind , merkel also pressed her fellow leaders to avoid any form of protectionism , amid criticism that certain countries , notably china and japan , are keeping their currencies artificially low to encourage exports .
but she declined to criticize beijing for its foreign exchange policy , saying : " i assume that china has a very strong interest in sending a positive signal from this summit . "
" china also needs sustainable growth for its overall economic situation , " the chancellor added .
germany is the world 's second-biggest exporter after china .
its strong export sector has helped it stage an impressive economic comeback this year , but its trade surpluses have also drawn criticism abroad .
no fixed numbers merkel said germany would not accept fixed targets for addressing countries ' trade gaps .
" we reject quantified bandwidths for acceptable imbalances for good reason because ... competitiveness must be able to express itself , also in export ratios . "
merkel said germany wants to see leaders commit themselves to the final stretch of the doha round of global trade talks .
she added that trade barriers posed the biggest danger to sustained world growth .
" the biggest danger for sustainable growth is currently coming from protectionism in its different forms , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 10.11.2010 opinion : a guilty conscience is no basis for membership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how should the eu deal with turkey 's membership hopes ?
many eu politicians have a guilty conscience over keeping ankara waiting .
but that 's a poor basis for making decisions , says dw 's christoph hasselbach . many eu politicians have a guilty conscience .
they do n't know how to deal with ankara ’ s hopes for speedy progress in the country 's bid for eu membership .
turkey is after all an official membership candidate and is trying to implement the reforms that brussels is calling for .
and from ankara 's perspective , this should eventually lead to full membership once the eu 's demands have been met .
so far , all previous membership candidates have eventually become full members .
but it 's clear that a guilty conscience alone is a poor basis for granting membership .
many european governments today regret that they – or their predecessors – have in past years given the green light for membership talks with turkey .
the doubts within the eu about whether turkey is fit for membership have since then only increased , and the arguments against membership have not changed .
they are not about individual points of criticism – be it cyprus or freedom of expression – but they are , in fact of a more fundamental nature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations will continue to improve , but there wo n't be full membership , says hasselbach for instance , the eu still struggles with the consequences of its two previous expansion rounds in 2004 and 2007 .
and even if past expansion was not a mistake – the new members have significantly changed the european union .
the bloc 's ability to speak with one voice seems to be faltering – simply because the member states are too diverse and different .
these changes have to sink in and this process is bound to take time .
accepting turkey with its different history and tradition would from today 's perspective lead to a final stop to european integration .
has anyone ever thought of the fact that turkey would soon surpass germany as the most populous eu member state ?
turkey as a member would therefore have the right to demand more official posts than any of the other countries .
this would change the eu to an extent likely to cause sharp opposition .
and no one can guarantee that turkey will remain a secular state for good .
none of this calls into question the fact that the eu needs turkey and that turkey needs the eu .
the good trade relations and security cooperation should be built upon .
both sides are certain to do this for their very own interests .
and turkey is likely to continue its reform path even without the prospect of eu membership .
that 's why it ’ s wrong to argue that without membership talks , ankara will abandon reforms and look for other partners .
both sides need to look at the current situation .
it 's not a question of all or nothing .
and the eu should be honest with ankara that at the end of the path will be a closer relationship than today – but no full membership .

he is currently technical director at second league club bochum .
from his years of playing experience , he knows about the mental condition of the players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas ernst -lrb- right -rrb- with bochum player chong tese " there are situations during a game when people whistle and shout personal insults at you , where every player meets challenges they can not cope with , " ernst told deutsche welle .
" the pressure is there in training , and again when playing in the stadium , " said ernst .
" it can really build up , and that stresses you out . "
footballers ' union provides help even before robert enke 's death , the union that looks after contract footballers , the vdv , was witnessing an increase of players seeking help .
the vdv has been offering psychological and pastoral advice to footballers for several years , said its chief executive ulf baranowsky .
" immediately after the tragic death of robert enke , the number of people inquiring about these services shot up , " said baranowsky .

players can contact the union in strict confidentiality , or anonymously by email if they wish .
the facade is all part of the game for the psychologist thomas graw , who has worked with several bundesliga professionals , robert enke 's case was not an isolated one . " players learn to have certain internal processes to shield their feelings from the outside , " said graw .
" they see it as part of their job and their career , " he added .
even if a player looks fine from the outside , he could be suffering inside .
the psychologists who work with the vdv look out for whether a player might be suffering from a short-term mood fluctuation , or more long-term depression .
problems include fear of failure , performance anxiety , issues with coaches , bullying and " anything that affects the psyche " said baronowsky .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clubs and teammates need to be more understanding about mental illness added to these problems is a lack of understanding from teammates and coaches .

a major rethink was ordered across the multi-million dollar business of football .
however , according to thomas ernst at bochum , these words have failed to turn into real actions .
there has been little progress in clubs ' understanding and tackling of those with mental illness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 10.11.2010 world leaders told not to waver on financial reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial regulation is high on the agenda in seoul an international financial think-tank has warned world leaders attending the g20 summit of top economies to concentrate on improving global banking regulations . following a two-day meeting attended by financial executives , regulators and policy-makers , the international centre for financial regulation -lrb- icfr -rrb- has called on leaders attending the g20 summit in seoul to focus on the most workable reforms .
in a press release , the icfr said there was widespread fear in the sector that the g20 could " fail to make progress on its goals , as domestic considerations move back center-stage . "
it urged leaders to agree on financial reforms most likely improve economic stability and achieve international implementation . " we are calling on the g20 to prioritize more effective cross-border coordination by supervisors , and for agreement on the way forward on crisis resolution to allow for the orderly wind-down of complex banks , " barbara ridpath , ceo of the watchdog said in a statement .
" time for unity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki moon has urged leaders to find common ground the icfr calls were echoed by united nations secretary general ban ki-moon , who is in the south korean capital for the international summit .
on the eve of the meeting , he expressed concern over national differences of opinion on global rebalancing and currency policies .
" the global economic recovery remains fragile .
64 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty this year , " ban said , adding that this was a time for unity .
he said the world could not afford to think narrowly about development and economic growth , and that " all countries and all peoples have a stake in the management of the global economy . "
on the agenda leaders at the seoul g20 summit , the first to be held in an emerging market economy , are expected to sign off on the basel iii agreement , which is designed to tighten global capital and liquidity requirements for banks from 2013 onwards . bildunterschrift : the summit is being watched closely by managers in frankfurt 's banking towers drafted by the basel committee of central bankers and regulators back in september , the package is considered a significant step down the path towards financial stability .
it also tipped by observers to be one of the few items on the regulation agenda that is likely to receive broad support in seoul .
the only other real progress the talks are expected to yield is the endorsement of a series of agreements aimed at tightening supervision of the derivatives market and ensuring the standardization of contracts to facilitate central clearing processes and trading on exchanges .
safety nets on the issue of " too big to fail " banks , analysts are expecting little movement .
the financial stability board -lrb- fsb -rrb- , which is responsible for the implementation of g20 regulatory pledges , is expected to lay out a set of recommendations on " systemically important financial institutions , " otherwise known as sifis , involving the largest 20 or so global banks .
under the terms of the proposals , regulators would be required to make sure that sifis , the list of which is yet to be finalized , prepare living wills outlining how , if necessary , they could be wound up without causing major upset on the markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsbc is likely to feature on the list of global banks deemed too big to fail g20 members have not , as yet , been able to agree on many of the details of sifis , but there is speculation that the list will not include big asian banks .
their business is conducted primarily in domestic markets .
they therefore pose little threat to the wider world if they go under .
ratings , commodities and accounting summit delegates are , however , tipped to rubber-stamp fsb proposals for reducing market reliance on rating agencies .
if they do green-light the suggestion , they will have to find alternative ways of assessing creditworthiness .
regulators say the move would reduce what is known as the cliff effect , which contributes to market destabilization .
in the name of yet greater stability , the group of 20 wealthy and emerging nations is also calling for more transparency in commodity markets .
this week , regulators ruled a major overhaul , but they did concede more pricing information was needed from physical commodity markets .
there is little hope of movement on the establishment of a single set of global accounting standards .
the june 2011 deadline is likely to be overshot due to differences between the g20 member states , but analysts say the summit could be an opportunity to push for resolution .

in a press release , the icfr said there was widespread fear in the sector that the g20 could " fail to make progress on its goals , as domestic considerations move back center-stage . "
it urged leaders to agree on financial reforms most likely improve economic stability and achieve international implementation . " we are calling on the g20 to prioritize more effective cross-border coordination by supervisors , and for agreement on the way forward on crisis resolution to allow for the orderly wind-down of complex banks , " barbara ridpath , ceo of the watchdog said in a statement .
" time for unity " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki moon has urged leaders to find common ground the icfr calls were echoed by united nations secretary general ban ki-moon , who is in the south korean capital for the international summit .
on the eve of the meeting , he expressed concern over national differences of opinion on global rebalancing and currency policies .
" the global economic recovery remains fragile .
64 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty this year , " ban said , adding that this was a time for unity .
he said the world could not afford to think narrowly about development and economic growth , and that " all countries and all peoples have a stake in the management of the global economy . "
on the agenda leaders at the seoul g20 summit , the first to be held in an emerging market economy , are expected to sign off on the basel iii agreement , which is designed to tighten global capital and liquidity requirements for banks from 2013 onwards . bildunterschrift : the summit is being watched closely by managers in frankfurt 's banking towers drafted by the basel committee of central bankers and regulators back in september , the package is considered a significant step down the path towards financial stability .
it also tipped by observers to be one of the few items on the regulation agenda that is likely to receive broad support in seoul .
the only other real progress the talks are expected to yield is the endorsement of a series of agreements aimed at tightening supervision of the derivatives market and ensuring the standardization of contracts to facilitate central clearing processes and trading on exchanges .
safety nets on the issue of " too big to fail " banks , analysts are expecting little movement .
the financial stability board -lrb- fsb -rrb- , which is responsible for the implementation of g20 regulatory pledges , is expected to lay out a set of recommendations on " systemically important financial institutions , " otherwise known as sifis , involving the largest 20 or so global banks .
under the terms of the proposals , regulators would be required to make sure that sifis , the list of which is yet to be finalized , prepare living wills outlining how , if necessary , they could be wound up without causing major upset on the markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsbc is likely to feature on the list of global banks deemed too big to fail g20 members have not , as yet , been able to agree on many of the details of sifis , but there is speculation that the list will not include big asian banks .
their business is conducted primarily in domestic markets .
they therefore pose little threat to the wider world if they go under .
ratings , commodities and accounting summit delegates are , however , tipped to rubber-stamp fsb proposals for reducing market reliance on rating agencies .
if they do green-light the suggestion , they will have to find alternative ways of assessing creditworthiness .
regulators say the move would reduce what is known as the cliff effect , which contributes to market destabilization .
in the name of yet greater stability , the group of 20 wealthy and emerging nations is also calling for more transparency in commodity markets .
this week , regulators ruled a major overhaul , but they did concede more pricing information was needed from physical commodity markets .
there is little hope of movement on the establishment of a single set of global accounting standards .
the june 2011 deadline is likely to be overshot due to differences between the g20 member states , but analysts say the summit could be an opportunity to push for resolution .

t-shirts or trousers might cost as little as two euros .
this is great for low-income families .
but there is a downside . most of the textiles and clothes found in the stores of industrialised countries are sewn in developing countries .
bangladesh , india and indonesia top the list .
30 euros for a month 's work cheap clothes can be found at all of germany ’ s popular discount stores – for example lidl , aldi and kik .
they attract society ’ s low-earning groups , tempted by well-made shirts and trousers with a price tag of under five euros .
but the harsh truth is that the rest of the price is paid by asia 's garment workers , who receive very low wages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at germany 's discount store kik a t-shirt can be bought for one euro jasmine begum is a bangladeshi garment worker .
" in the year 2000 , i started working as an assistant operator in a garment factory , " she said . " then i was off work for some years .
i came back as an operator .
i earn 3,500 taka per month .
this is not enough for me to run my family .
i want everything to change .
i want a pay rise so that i can survive with my family .
i want to send my son to school . " 3,500 taka is about 30 euros .
jasmine , who receives no support from her husband , also lives with her mother and her elder brother .
she can not find another job because she is illiterate .
she says she is stuck in the garments sector .
foreign companies pay too little to manufacturing factories arifa akhter also once worked in garments .
she is now a member of the national garments workers federation and wants to help the girls and women who make up 80 percent of the employees in the garment sector .
she not only wants to improve working conditions but also wages .
" our garments factory owners do n't get enough money to get the job done .
that 's why they ca n't pay the workers .
if the owners were better paid by the foreign companies then the employees would also get a fraction of it if not the whole .
we demand that the foreign companies understand the problems and take the necessary measures , " said arifa akhter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration of bangladeshi garment workers for better wages “ clean clothing campaign ” in the past , such demands have often fallen on deaf ears .
one organization in germany is very concerned .
gisela bruckhardt ’ s “ clean clothing campaign ” promotes clothes that are untainted by human rights violations , exploitation , harassment and low wages .
bruckhardt says companies in germany should be fully accountable : " we want these organizations to pay garment workers accordingly .
wages must be high enough for any employee to be able to survive with her / his family .
these organizations must visit these factories every now and then to see how things are run .
but we ca n't really force them to visit .
this is a serious problem . "
gisela bruckhardt says the german government should come forward in such cases , enact laws to defend and protect these employees : " after all they are producing for us .
these employees should be able to sue german companies in a federal court and claim their rights . "
there are almost two million garments workers in bangladesh and thousands of garments factories .

in romania , 1 percent of the 2.25 billion euros made available by the european social fund has been implemented . the low rate of absorption of the eu funds in romania is due to a weak and inefficient civil service , as well as a lack of transparency , according to oana niculescu-mizil , a member of romanian parliament from the ferentari district . " it 's a lack of political will , " she told deutsche welle .
" the government does n't have experts .
even the agency for roma is badly managed .
the funds provide a lot of money which could be absorbed by romania , but it does n't come to roma community .
what can i say ?
the national strategy does n't exist . " european commissioner for employment , social affairs and inclusion laszlo andor agreed that infrastructure in romania is weak . " what we see in romania and other countries is the consequences of ignorance of several decades , " he said , adding that the poor are not benefiting from foreign aid . " the role of the eu is about support and coordination , and we are ready to upgrade our efforts , " he told deutsche welle .
" but we 've made it very clear the fundamental responsibility lies with member states where roma are citizens .
it 's the obligation of the state to take care of people who live there . " but that 's proving extremely difficult for the romanian government .
integration projects - including the one operating at school 136 - are going bankrupt because it has not come up with the promised funds . the closure of welfare programs like this is common in romania , according to david mark from the roma civic alliance . " unfortunately this is a common story among organizations that are implementing social funds , " he said .
" if you are waiting for 10 months or over one year for reimbursements then how can you concentrate on problems on the ground ?
i think the bureaucratic overburdening of implementers is seriously affecting the impact these projects are going to have . " author : sasha pavey editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
