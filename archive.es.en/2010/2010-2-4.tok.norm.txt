the alliance 's head said he will now push defense ministers for more trainers . nato defense ministers on wednesday began two day of talks in istanbul that will touch on restructuring the alliance , troop levels in kosovo and the ongoing united nations-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in afghanistan .
while many of the involved countries have provided more combat troops , fulfilling a target set by isaf 's commander , us general stanley mcchrystal , it does n't mean there wo n't be calls for more .
" allies and partners have made significant contributions , but it is n't yet sufficient , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen told a news briefing on monday .
he said more contributions may be needed , especially in the area of police and military training .
" this training mission is of utmost importance to accomplish the strategy we all agree on , " he said .
" the more we invest in this transition now , the sooner the day when the afghans can take responsibility themselves . "
thousands more needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has already begun shifting its focus in afghanistan to police training according to rasmussen , nato needs 21 more army training teams and more than 100 police training teams if they are to get afghan forces up to the levels currently required .
each police training team consists of 20 to 30 trainers .
officials say the police training is difficult .
like more than half of afghans , many police recruits can not read and must spend months in the classroom learning to read well enough to understand drivers licenses and identity papers before they begin their eight-week police course .
the european union has promised to send 400 police trainers .
but european police must volunteer to be sent to afghanistan , and only about 240 have done so - apparently due to safety concerns .
troop reductions in kosovo on thursday night the defense ministers are set to discuss spending and streamlining nato 's structures .
the talks on afghanistan are scheduled for friday morning , with mcchrystal to attend along with the non-nato members taking part in isaf , outgoing un special envoy in kabul kai eide and eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton .
also on the agenda for friday is kosovo .
on monday it was decided to reduce troops there to 10,200 , and the ministers are set to confirm those numbers will drop even further , to 5,700 , by the end of the year if the region remains calm. hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the munich international security conference gets underway , we ask two experts just how important these meetings really are . it 's the same procedure every january .
the year is barely a few weeks old and a massive stream of business travelers from all over the world is already en route to europe .
the main destinations for thousands of political leaders and executives are davos and munich .
in the swiss mountains the world economic forum , as it regularly does , this year attracted more than 2000 delegates . munich 's security conference traditionally taking place this week usually attracts around 300 participants .
but that 's not all .
add to those long established venues this year 's new global zero summit with its focus on nuclear disarmament held in paris squeezed in the few remaining days between davos and munich and the dld conference on digital innovation in munich right before the world economic forum and you can appreciate why a good travel consultant is necessary for the many people participating in more than one conference .
while the meetings in davos and munich by now have a long history , they are criticized on a regular basis for what essentially are two contradictory reasons .
one is that at these private gatherings , high-profile figures make decisions behind close doors and thus effectively undermine the work of the legitimate international bodies .
and two , that these meetings are just hyped-up talking shops that have no real significance and therefore are basically superfluous . no threat to un " i would n't share this criticism , " says juergen chrobog , a former state secretary in the german foreign office and ambassador to the us .
" i think the conferences in munich or davos are not meant to solve problems , to lead to certain results . " werner weidenfeld , who served for twelve years as the german government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations and currently directs the munich based think tank center for applied policy research , agrees that conferences such as davos and munich do not undermine the work of united nations and other institutions designated to solving global problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private meetings are no threat to the work of the un , say experts both experts point out that these conferences in no way can or want to rival the formal decision making processes at un level or other official venues .
no politician would skip an important un meeting because of these private conferences .
major decisions , the experts argue , are prepared long before important global meetings and concluded at these meetings .
what about the claim then that these private meetings are essentially much ado about nothing ?
chrobog , who declares jokingly that he himself has not only attended many , but too many of these conferences and has limited his participation in recent years , nevertheless believes that this meetings do serve an important function .
" it 's simply for people to get together and have a free exchange of views and to allow them develop their own ideas , " he says .
" that 's very important .
people have to meet , they have to get together , they have to build networks . "
events like davos and munich are attractive because they make it easy to do exactly that participants can meet lots of people in a very short time .
nothing wrong with communication just because these conferences do n't produce results , does n't mean they are n't valuable , weidenfeld told deutsche welle and points to an important , but often neglected aspect of the nature of politics .
" you have to realize that politics is also about communication , " he says .
" everything is perception .
how do the other actors perceive the reality and the problems .
what do the others think that i am thinking and what is their reaction to my way of thinking about a problem .
i think this is the positive aspect of these kind of activities . "
while chrobog and weidenfeld argue that private gatherings like the ones in davos and munich have a place in the political calendar , they both feel that with many new venues springing up all the time , the conference circuit has gotten very crowded and events have become too big and similar in nature .
the biggest danger for the conferences however , stems not from the meetings themselves , but from the expectations of concrete outcomes .
people and the media should n't exaggerate the meaning of those conferences and expect concrete results . " it 's more or less a market place of politics to exchange perceptions " , says weidenfeld .
" it is a certain form of a vanity fair with a great deficit on strategic thinking and real problem solving . "
no problem solving " i think they have a certain importance , but they will not change the world " , says juergen chrobog who currently heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt .
" they never helped me to solve a problem , to be very frank . "
but , he adds , some of the people he met at conferences did actually help him to solve problems later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicholas sarkozy did n't mince words last year in munich asked about how he personally benefitted from these conferences , werner weidenfeld tells an anecdote about last year 's security conference in munich involving french president nicolas sarkozy .
the president had just delivered a very tough speech that stood out from the previous soft addresses given by other leaders .
" then there was a coffee break and i observed that none of the other top politicians from america , from germany or elsewhere talked to president sarkozy .
he stood alone in the corner , nobody talked to him , because his speech had been too tough in their mind .
then i myself went to him and talked to him and he was so grateful that he almost tried to kiss me .
so i learned first hand that sarkozy does n't only have friends in international politics . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 04.02.2010 press review : 100 days - a coalition in political puberty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel rules a coalition with two prickly junior partners germany 's newspapers have given a scathing assessment of the first 100 days of the new government .
the junior coalition partners , the free democratic party , have been condemned in particular as " unfit to govern . " the new german government under chancellor angela merkel could hardly have feared worse reviews on its first 100 days in office .
not a single major newspaper could muster a kind assessment , and some have been merciless .
squabbling , indecisive , and naïve fairly sums up the opinion of most political commentators , and they also agree on who to blame : the free democratic party led by foreign minister and vice chancellor guido westerwelle , the party regarded as the big winners of last september 's election .
" with an election result of more than 14 percent , the fdp suddenly had big hopes to fulfil , " says the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" and they are not up to it yet . "
the successful election campaign seemed to promise that the fdp would establish itself outside its traditional voter base .
but it is " squandering its opportunity permanently , " the paper says .
as for merkel 's christian democratic union , they are desperate " not to be seen as the neo-liberal spectre that the opposition made them out to be before the election . "
the sueddeutsche zeitung uses a botanical metaphor to illustrate its thoughts on the new government .
the national paper likens the constantly squabbling leaders of merkel 's allies - westerwelle and christian social union leader horst seehofer - to the mimosa , a prickly , sensitive plant that closes rapidly when touched or shaken .
" angela merkel is in charge of a mimosa coalition , " the paper concludes .
" we 've seen the husk .
it 's time for the fruit . "
several papers have noted that the last government , a coalition of the center-right cdu and the center-left social democratic party , seemed to function much better , despite being considered at the time as an unworkable marriage of convenience .
as munich tabloid abendzeitung says , " many think back to it with nostalgia . "
the combination of cdu and fdp only seems to work at a state level , the paper argues .
the cologne-based koelnische rundschau also compares this coalition unfavourably to its predecessors , particularly as the cdu and the fdp went into the last election as declared allies .
" the spd / green alliance was unprepared in 1998 , and the cdu and the spd could not bring themselves to trust each other in 2005 , " the paper says , " but the cdu and the fdp do not give the impression that they want to work together . "
" what do the cdu and fdp want ? " the paper asks .
but perhaps the bluntest assessment came from the berliner zeitung , and was aimed specifically at westerwelle 's party : " they ca n't do it .
they are unfit to govern .
angela merkel has brought an unpredictable , chaotic bunch into the cabinet .
angela merkel is governing with people who are in political puberty .
if they do n't grow up soon , we have another 1,360 days of hysterics and wrong decisions to look forward to . " bk / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de 100 days in office - germany 's governing coalition feels the strain expectations were high when germany 's governing coalition came to power 100 days ago .
but the coalition has been grappling with the economic crisis and the contentious mission in afghanistan ever since .

-lrb- 17.01.2010 -rrb- german coalition deal draws praise and criticism the coalition deal between chancellor merkel 's conservatives and the business-friendly fdp based on major tax cut plans paves the way for a new center-right government .
but it 's sparked mixed reactions in germany .

squabbling , indecisive , and naïve fairly sums up the opinion of most political commentators , and they also agree on who to blame : the free democratic party led by foreign minister and vice chancellor guido westerwelle , the party regarded as the big winners of last september 's election .
" with an election result of more than 14 percent , the fdp suddenly had big hopes to fulfil , " says the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" and they are not up to it yet . "
the successful election campaign seemed to promise that the fdp would establish itself outside its traditional voter base .
but it is " squandering its opportunity permanently , " the paper says .
as for merkel 's christian democratic union , they are desperate " not to be seen as the neo-liberal spectre that the opposition made them out to be before the election . "
the sueddeutsche zeitung uses a botanical metaphor to illustrate its thoughts on the new government .
the national paper likens the constantly squabbling leaders of merkel 's allies - westerwelle and christian social union leader horst seehofer - to the mimosa , a prickly , sensitive plant that closes rapidly when touched or shaken .
" angela merkel is in charge of a mimosa coalition , " the paper concludes .
" we 've seen the husk .
it 's time for the fruit . "
several papers have noted that the last government , a coalition of the center-right cdu and the center-left social democratic party , seemed to function much better , despite being considered at the time as an unworkable marriage of convenience .
as munich tabloid abendzeitung says , " many think back to it with nostalgia . "
the combination of cdu and fdp only seems to work at a state level , the paper argues .
the cologne-based koelnische rundschau also compares this coalition unfavourably to its predecessors , particularly as the cdu and the fdp went into the last election as declared allies .
" the spd / green alliance was unprepared in 1998 , and the cdu and the spd could not bring themselves to trust each other in 2005 , " the paper says , " but the cdu and the fdp do not give the impression that they want to work together . "
" what do the cdu and fdp want ? " the paper asks .
but perhaps the bluntest assessment came from the berliner zeitung , and was aimed specifically at westerwelle 's party : " they ca n't do it .
they are unfit to govern .
angela merkel has brought an unpredictable , chaotic bunch into the cabinet .

in december , the first connections between the capital kampala and the global broadband network went live , thanks to a submarine fiber-optic cable that links to broadband networks in india and europe .
since then , the east african nation has been in an e-frenzy as excited locals begin exploring all that the web has to offer , from downloading music to watching films online .
many ugandans are euphoric , but for some the new cable offers fresh disappointments : a lack of telephone cables means high speed internet will remain out of reach for most ugandans .
for those already hooked up , however , the 17,000-kilometer -lrb- 10,563 mile -rrb- long broadband cable – known as the seacom – is a boon .
grace natabaalo , a web designer who works for the online department of the ugandan newspaper monitor , is one of the seacom 's latest converts .
she realizes that uganda is no where near european speed , but compared the cable makes the internet lightning quick compared to how it used to be .
as if to demonstrate , she clicks on a video clip on her screen ; within seconds , the clip is downloaded .
“ back then , you would download something overnight , leave the computer on and find it downloaded in the morning , after twelve hours of downloading … you could never watch this ! ”
since gaining access to the higher speed internet , natabaalo 's newspaper relaunched its website , which now incorporates previously unheard-of features like picture galleries and a video section .
bildunterschrift : the seacom cable is slowly working its way through africa opening uganda to the world though the seacom cable was officially launched in east africa mid-2009 , broadband access has only begun to trickle through to uganda over the past few weeks .
the new connection allows a much faster data transfer of 200 kilobytes per second , allowing an increasing number of ugandans to take advantage of the features natabaalo and her colleagues have already discovered .
for constantine bitwayiki , the improved web access is cause for celebration .
bitwayiki , the ugandan president 's advisor on internet issues , has big ideas about ways the new technology could be harnessed to overhaul administrative procedures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed internet will give ugandan children access to the world bitwayiki believes that greater internet use in government and private firms could be used to improve efficiency and even tackle corruption .
high speed internet could also prove invaluable for ordinary ugandans when it comes to basic tasks like getting a driving permit , which for many involves traveling long distances to the capital .
“ i 'd just need to do some basic form-filling online , if i have to pay then i go to the nearest bank and i pay , if -lsb- a picture is needed -rsb- then i send a picture online , and then my driving permit is delivered . ”
ugandan minister for trade and industry kahinda otafire is equally optimistic .
he hopes the improved connections may also entice foreign investors into the country .
otafire 's vision for uganda is one of an outsourcing hub for the rest of the world .
“ the best english is spoken in east africa , and particularly in uganda , ” he said .
“ we 've got a lot of educated people ; we 've got a lot of trained manpower , so i do n't see why we do n't engage in outsourcing and getting in touch with the rest of the world . ”
infrastructure holds things back but not everyone is convinced .
so far , only government departments , the university of kampala and some major companies , like the newspaper monitor , are connected to broadband .
the rest of the country must make do with a far slower connection , and for most ugandans , internet cafés remain the only way to get online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait for the internet continues for many ugandans daniel biranda , planning director at the university of kampala 's computer sciences faculty , does not expect big changes in the near future .
“ you know , people are talking about the internet .
they are excited .
but they do n't know the technology . ”
in the early 1990s , biranda became the first ugandan to program a ugandan website .
today , he is looking for ways to connect villages outside the capital to the high-speed broad band cable and he says the key missing ingredient is the humble telephone cable .
“ in , say , stuttgart , every building -lsb- can have -rsb- internet , simply because there is a telephone line .
but the buildings we have in town , they have electricity , but they do n't have telephone lines . ”
because of that , the cost of connecting to the broadband network is expensive , and could easily outweigh the financial opportunities offered by a higher-speed connection , biranda said .
“ will that internet café generate something like the $ 3000 in a month -lsb- to cover the costs -rsb- ?
it ca n't . ”
there is a simple explanation for all of this .
in uganda , as in many developing countries , there has never been an extensive net of landline phones .
they simply skipped that step and went right to mobile phones .
and beyond the capital , little infrastructure exists already that could be used to easily set up internet connections .
this means that for the majority of ugandans , high speed internet access at home may not be a reality for years to come .

he 'll soon head to his native germany to serve as president of the jury for the berlinale - where he 'll watch far more films than he 's used to . herzog claims that he normally only watches two to three films per year .
he made this surprising statement shortly after being announced jury president of the 2010 berlinale .
but how could someone who so rarely sets foot in a movie theater end up in this position ?
and why does he pass on seeing so many movies ?
probably because he is very busy making them himself . at home in america werner herzog lives in los angeles , where he churns out one film after another .
but just a few years ago , no one would have expected him to ever get this far .
after all , his counterparts - german filmmakers wim wenders and volker schloendorff - gave up on their hollywood careers a long time ago and have since returned to their homeland . munich-born herzog , on the other hand , has taken a step forward in his career and now makes big-budget movies in the us , working with a-list stars like christian bale and nicolas cage .
herzog has never been a stranger to success , though ; he is credited with injecting new spirit into german cinema with his first films in the late 1960s . bildunterschrift : herzog 's " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " stars nicolas cage after that he relocated five times with his favorite actor , klaus kinski , in order to tackle daring film projects in places like south america .
his film " fitzcarraldo " has been made the subject of various books and documentaries , and his 1979 film " nosferatu the vampyre " has been hailed as one of the greatest achievements of new german cinema . following these cinematic conquests , herzog temporarily withdrew from the big screen , perhaps partly due to the death of klaus kinski .
over the next few years , he produced unconventional documentaries and staged operas . it was n't until just a few years ago that herzog claimed a real foothold in the us .
this is not a well-known fact in germany , though - maybe because some of herzog 's american-made films did not make it into german cinemas . " i never forgot about germany , " said herzog at one stage .
" but - i do n't know why - germany forgot about me . " he has repeatedly emphasized how close he still feels to his homeland : " i have left my country and live in los angeles today .
and i make films in antarctica , in south america , in the usa .
but despite this i have never abandoned my culture . " herzog 's americana based on true events , herzog 's 2007 film " rescue dawn " tells the story of a us soldier with a german background who is shot down and imprisoned in laos during the vietnam war .
then there are also his more recent american films - " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " and " my son , my son , what have ye done " - both of which premiered at the 2009 venice film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog 's favorite actor , klaus kinski , worked with him on several films whoever has had the chance to meet werner herzog at a film festival or to interview him , knows that this filmmaker is also a great entertainer .

he 'll soon head to his native germany to serve as president of the jury for the berlinale - where he 'll watch far more films than he 's used to . herzog claims that he normally only watches two to three films per year .
he made this surprising statement shortly after being announced jury president of the 2010 berlinale .
but how could someone who so rarely sets foot in a movie theater end up in this position ?
and why does he pass on seeing so many movies ?
probably because he is very busy making them himself . at home in america werner herzog lives in los angeles , where he churns out one film after another .
but just a few years ago , no one would have expected him to ever get this far .
after all , his counterparts - german filmmakers wim wenders and volker schloendorff - gave up on their hollywood careers a long time ago and have since returned to their homeland . munich-born herzog , on the other hand , has taken a step forward in his career and now makes big-budget movies in the us , working with a-list stars like christian bale and nicolas cage .
herzog has never been a stranger to success , though ; he is credited with injecting new spirit into german cinema with his first films in the late 1960s . bildunterschrift : herzog 's " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " stars nicolas cage after that he relocated five times with his favorite actor , klaus kinski , in order to tackle daring film projects in places like south america .
his film " fitzcarraldo " has been made the subject of various books and documentaries , and his 1979 film " nosferatu the vampyre " has been hailed as one of the greatest achievements of new german cinema . following these cinematic conquests , herzog temporarily withdrew from the big screen , perhaps partly due to the death of klaus kinski .
over the next few years , he produced unconventional documentaries and staged operas . it was n't until just a few years ago that herzog claimed a real foothold in the us .
this is not a well-known fact in germany , though - maybe because some of herzog 's american-made films did not make it into german cinemas . " i never forgot about germany , " said herzog at one stage .
" but - i do n't know why - germany forgot about me . " he has repeatedly emphasized how close he still feels to his homeland : " i have left my country and live in los angeles today .
and i make films in antarctica , in south america , in the usa .
but despite this i have never abandoned my culture . " herzog 's americana based on true events , herzog 's 2007 film " rescue dawn " tells the story of a us soldier with a german background who is shot down and imprisoned in laos during the vietnam war .

in december , the first connections between the capital kampala and the global broadband network went live , thanks to a submarine fiber-optic cable that links to broadband networks in india and europe .
since then , the east african nation has been in an e-frenzy as excited locals begin exploring all that the web has to offer , from downloading music to watching films online .
many ugandans are euphoric , but for some the new cable offers fresh disappointments : a lack of telephone cables means high speed internet will remain out of reach for most ugandans .
for those already hooked up , however , the 17,000-kilometer -lrb- 10,563 mile -rrb- long broadband cable – known as the seacom – is a boon .
grace natabaalo , a web designer who works for the online department of the ugandan newspaper monitor , is one of the seacom 's latest converts .
she realizes that uganda is no where near european speed , but compared the cable makes the internet lightning quick compared to how it used to be .
as if to demonstrate , she clicks on a video clip on her screen ; within seconds , the clip is downloaded .
“ back then , you would download something overnight , leave the computer on and find it downloaded in the morning , after twelve hours of downloading … you could never watch this ! ”
since gaining access to the higher speed internet , natabaalo 's newspaper relaunched its website , which now incorporates previously unheard-of features like picture galleries and a video section .
bildunterschrift : the seacom cable is slowly working its way through africa opening uganda to the world though the seacom cable was officially launched in east africa mid-2009 , broadband access has only begun to trickle through to uganda over the past few weeks .
the new connection allows a much faster data transfer of 200 kilobytes per second , allowing an increasing number of ugandans to take advantage of the features natabaalo and her colleagues have already discovered .
for constantine bitwayiki , the improved web access is cause for celebration .
bitwayiki , the ugandan president 's advisor on internet issues , has big ideas about ways the new technology could be harnessed to overhaul administrative procedures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed internet will give ugandan children access to the world bitwayiki believes that greater internet use in government and private firms could be used to improve efficiency and even tackle corruption .
high speed internet could also prove invaluable for ordinary ugandans when it comes to basic tasks like getting a driving permit , which for many involves traveling long distances to the capital .
“ i 'd just need to do some basic form-filling online , if i have to pay then i go to the nearest bank and i pay , if -lsb- a picture is needed -rsb- then i send a picture online , and then my driving permit is delivered . ”
ugandan minister for trade and industry kahinda otafire is equally optimistic .
he hopes the improved connections may also entice foreign investors into the country .
otafire 's vision for uganda is one of an outsourcing hub for the rest of the world .
“ the best english is spoken in east africa , and particularly in uganda , ” he said .
“ we 've got a lot of educated people ; we 've got a lot of trained manpower , so i do n't see why we do n't engage in outsourcing and getting in touch with the rest of the world . ”
infrastructure holds things back but not everyone is convinced .
so far , only government departments , the university of kampala and some major companies , like the newspaper monitor , are connected to broadband .
the rest of the country must make do with a far slower connection , and for most ugandans , internet cafés remain the only way to get online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait for the internet continues for many ugandans daniel biranda , planning director at the university of kampala 's computer sciences faculty , does not expect big changes in the near future .
“ you know , people are talking about the internet .
they are excited .
but they do n't know the technology . ”
in the early 1990s , biranda became the first ugandan to program a ugandan website .
today , he is looking for ways to connect villages outside the capital to the high-speed broad band cable and he says the key missing ingredient is the humble telephone cable .
“ in , say , stuttgart , every building -lsb- can have -rsb- internet , simply because there is a telephone line .
but the buildings we have in town , they have electricity , but they do n't have telephone lines . ”
because of that , the cost of connecting to the broadband network is expensive , and could easily outweigh the financial opportunities offered by a higher-speed connection , biranda said .
“ will that internet café generate something like the $ 3000 in a month -lsb- to cover the costs -rsb- ?
it ca n't . ”
there is a simple explanation for all of this .
in uganda , as in many developing countries , there has never been an extensive net of landline phones .
they simply skipped that step and went right to mobile phones .
and beyond the capital , little infrastructure exists already that could be used to easily set up internet connections .
this means that for the majority of ugandans , high speed internet access at home may not be a reality for years to come .

negotiations are n't set to resume until after the world cup in june . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- has said the fate of national team coach joachim loew will not be decided until after the upcoming world cup in south africa in june .
what looked like it would be a simple contract extension has turned into a power struggle , with loew reportedly asking for a signing-on fee equivalent to a year 's salary .
" basically , both sides are still interested in working together but we were unable to reach agreement on important aspects of a deal , " explained dfb president theo zwanziger after a specially convened board meeting thursday at the organization 's headquarters in frankfurt .
loew 's current contract expires after the next world cup , where germany has been pooled with australia , serbia and ghana .
zwanziger announced last december that a two-year contract extension had been agreed with loew , keeping him at the helm of the national team until after euro 2012 in poland and ukraine .
but that deal was supposed to be approved at thursday 's meeting .
germany team manager oliver bierhoff , who is part of the three-man coaching team renegotiating their contracts , admitted the news was a blow .
" we would have liked to clear up the contract extension details quickly with the world cup fast approaching , but we accept the president 's decision , " he said .

he 'll soon head to his native germany to serve as president of the jury for the berlinale - where he 'll watch far more films than he 's used to . herzog claims that he normally only watches two to three films per year .
he made this surprising statement shortly after being announced jury president of the 2010 berlinale .
but how could someone who so rarely sets foot in a movie theater end up in this position ?
and why does he pass on seeing so many movies ?
probably because he is very busy making them himself . at home in america werner herzog lives in los angeles , where he churns out one film after another .
but just a few years ago , no one would have expected him to ever get this far .
after all , his counterparts - german filmmakers wim wenders and volker schloendorff - gave up on their hollywood careers a long time ago and have since returned to their homeland . munich-born herzog , on the other hand , has taken a step forward in his career and now makes big-budget movies in the us , working with a-list stars like christian bale and nicolas cage .
herzog has never been a stranger to success , though ; he is credited with injecting new spirit into german cinema with his first films in the late 1960s . bildunterschrift : herzog 's " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " stars nicolas cage after that he relocated five times with his favorite actor , klaus kinski , in order to tackle daring film projects in places like south america .
his film " fitzcarraldo " has been made the subject of various books and documentaries , and his 1979 film " nosferatu the vampyre " has been hailed as one of the greatest achievements of new german cinema . following these cinematic conquests , herzog temporarily withdrew from the big screen , perhaps partly due to the death of klaus kinski .
over the next few years , he produced unconventional documentaries and staged operas . it was n't until just a few years ago that herzog claimed a real foothold in the us .
this is not a well-known fact in germany , though - maybe because some of herzog 's american-made films did not make it into german cinemas . " i never forgot about germany , " said herzog at one stage .
" but - i do n't know why - germany forgot about me . " he has repeatedly emphasized how close he still feels to his homeland : " i have left my country and live in los angeles today .
and i make films in antarctica , in south america , in the usa .
but despite this i have never abandoned my culture . " herzog 's americana based on true events , herzog 's 2007 film " rescue dawn " tells the story of a us soldier with a german background who is shot down and imprisoned in laos during the vietnam war .

negotiations are n't set to resume until after the world cup in june . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- has said the fate of national team coach joachim loew will not be decided until after the upcoming world cup in south africa in june .
what looked like it would be a simple contract extension has turned into a power struggle , with loew reportedly asking for a signing-on fee equivalent to a year 's salary .
" basically , both sides are still interested in working together but we were unable to reach agreement on important aspects of a deal , " explained dfb president theo zwanziger after a specially convened board meeting thursday at the organization 's headquarters in frankfurt .
loew 's current contract expires after the next world cup , where germany has been pooled with australia , serbia and ghana .
zwanziger announced last december that a two-year contract extension had been agreed with loew , keeping him at the helm of the national team until after euro 2012 in poland and ukraine .
but that deal was supposed to be approved at thursday 's meeting .
germany team manager oliver bierhoff , who is part of the three-man coaching team renegotiating their contracts , admitted the news was a blow .
" we would have liked to clear up the contract extension details quickly with the world cup fast approaching , but we accept the president 's decision , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 04.02.2010 german institute seeks to reprint hitler 's ' mein kampf ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is yet undecided on what to do with ' mein kampf ' a fresh controversy has erupted around one of the most dangerous books in literary history - hitler 's " mein kampf . "
a munich-based institute now wants to republish the nazi manifesto on racial purity and anti-semitism . a german history institute has announced it is preparing an annotated version of adolf hitler 's propaganda manifesto " mein kampf " for publication in germany .
edith raim , a historian with the munich-based institute of contemporary history , which is behind the project , said an annotated version of hitler 's memoir would serve to inform current and future generations of the evils of the dictator 's racist ideology .
" we want to obstruct new publications -lsb- of " mein kampf " -rsb- by the radical far-right once the copyright of the book runs out , " said raim .
a new edition of " mein kampf " can only be published after 2015 , when the copyright held by the bavarian state government expires , 70 years after hitler 's death .
" mein kampf , " or " my struggle " as it translates into english , contains hitler 's views on racial purity and vitriol against jews and communists .
raim said that publishing the book could help dispel the fear and reverence many feel towards it .
she said she did not believe the new publication would be used by neo-nazis to stir racism and hatred towards foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear neo-nazis will use the new book as a bible " this book will be published with scholarly annotation and will have a very limited run , " she said .
" after all , it 'll be so expensive that i can not imagine that any neo-nazi will ever buy it . "
staunch opposition german authorities still consider " mein kampf " to be dangerous .
it has not been allowed to be reprinted here since the end of world war ii .
some academics argue that the book does n't provide any answers to questions about how the nazi regime gained power , as it primarily contains hitler 's own personal views .
in a statement on thursday , the state government of bavaria , which holds the copyright , said it had not given the institute permission to print the book and would seek to ban the publication in court .
" furthermore , following the expiration of the copyright in 2015 , the spreading of national-socialist ideas in germany will remain forbidden and punishable under the criminal code , " the statement added .
the institute of contemporary history has pointed out that copies of the original " mein kampf " can easily be bought outside of germany and that it would be wrong to leave the local market to foreign publishing houses once the copyright expires. uh / dfm / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he 'll soon head to his native germany to serve as president of the jury for the berlinale - where he 'll watch far more films than he 's used to . herzog claims that he normally only watches two to three films per year .
he made this surprising statement shortly after being announced jury president of the 2010 berlinale .
but how could someone who so rarely sets foot in a movie theater end up in this position ?
and why does he pass on seeing so many movies ?
probably because he is very busy making them himself . at home in america werner herzog lives in los angeles , where he churns out one film after another .
but just a few years ago , no one would have expected him to ever get this far .
after all , his counterparts - german filmmakers wim wenders and volker schloendorff - gave up on their hollywood careers a long time ago and have since returned to their homeland . munich-born herzog , on the other hand , has taken a step forward in his career and now makes big-budget movies in the us , working with a-list stars like christian bale and nicolas cage .
herzog has never been a stranger to success , though ; he is credited with injecting new spirit into german cinema with his first films in the late 1960s . bildunterschrift : herzog 's " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " stars nicolas cage after that he relocated five times with his favorite actor , klaus kinski , in order to tackle daring film projects in places like south america .
his film " fitzcarraldo " has been made the subject of various books and documentaries , and his 1979 film " nosferatu the vampyre " has been hailed as one of the greatest achievements of new german cinema . following these cinematic conquests , herzog temporarily withdrew from the big screen , perhaps partly due to the death of klaus kinski .
over the next few years , he produced unconventional documentaries and staged operas . it was n't until just a few years ago that herzog claimed a real foothold in the us .
this is not a well-known fact in germany , though - maybe because some of herzog 's american-made films did not make it into german cinemas . " i never forgot about germany , " said herzog at one stage .
" but - i do n't know why - germany forgot about me . " he has repeatedly emphasized how close he still feels to his homeland : " i have left my country and live in los angeles today .
and i make films in antarctica , in south america , in the usa .
but despite this i have never abandoned my culture . " herzog 's americana based on true events , herzog 's 2007 film " rescue dawn " tells the story of a us soldier with a german background who is shot down and imprisoned in laos during the vietnam war .
then there are also his more recent american films - " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " and " my son , my son , what have ye done " - both of which premiered at the 2009 venice film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog 's favorite actor , klaus kinski , worked with him on several films whoever has had the chance to meet werner herzog at a film festival or to interview him , knows that this filmmaker is also a great entertainer .
he likes to surprise people , is keen to go against the grain , and does not like to be categorized . the audience at the 2010 berlinale festival should also be prepared for surprises when the awards are handed out on february 20 under werner herzog 's presiding eye . the berlinale runs from february 11-21 . author : jochen kuerten -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
a munich-based institute now wants to republish the nazi manifesto on racial purity and anti-semitism . a german history institute has announced it is preparing an annotated version of adolf hitler 's propaganda manifesto " mein kampf " for publication in germany .
edith raim , a historian with the munich-based institute of contemporary history , which is behind the project , said an annotated version of hitler 's memoir would serve to inform current and future generations of the evils of the dictator 's racist ideology .
" we want to obstruct new publications -lsb- of " mein kampf " -rsb- by the radical far-right once the copyright of the book runs out , " said raim .
a new edition of " mein kampf " can only be published after 2015 , when the copyright held by the bavarian state government expires , 70 years after hitler 's death .
" mein kampf , " or " my struggle " as it translates into english , contains hitler 's views on racial purity and vitriol against jews and communists .
raim said that publishing the book could help dispel the fear and reverence many feel towards it .
she said she did not believe the new publication would be used by neo-nazis to stir racism and hatred towards foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear neo-nazis will use the new book as a bible " this book will be published with scholarly annotation and will have a very limited run , " she said .

staunch opposition german authorities still consider " mein kampf " to be dangerous .
it has not been allowed to be reprinted here since the end of world war ii .
some academics argue that the book does n't provide any answers to questions about how the nazi regime gained power , as it primarily contains hitler 's own personal views .
in a statement on thursday , the state government of bavaria , which holds the copyright , said it had not given the institute permission to print the book and would seek to ban the publication in court .
" furthermore , following the expiration of the copyright in 2015 , the spreading of national-socialist ideas in germany will remain forbidden and punishable under the criminal code , " the statement added .

in december , the first connections between the capital kampala and the global broadband network went live , thanks to a submarine fiber-optic cable that links to broadband networks in india and europe .
since then , the east african nation has been in an e-frenzy as excited locals begin exploring all that the web has to offer , from downloading music to watching films online .
many ugandans are euphoric , but for some the new cable offers fresh disappointments : a lack of telephone cables means high speed internet will remain out of reach for most ugandans .
for those already hooked up , however , the 17,000-kilometer -lrb- 10,563 mile -rrb- long broadband cable – known as the seacom – is a boon .
grace natabaalo , a web designer who works for the online department of the ugandan newspaper monitor , is one of the seacom 's latest converts .
she realizes that uganda is no where near european speed , but compared the cable makes the internet lightning quick compared to how it used to be .
as if to demonstrate , she clicks on a video clip on her screen ; within seconds , the clip is downloaded .
“ back then , you would download something overnight , leave the computer on and find it downloaded in the morning , after twelve hours of downloading … you could never watch this ! ”
since gaining access to the higher speed internet , natabaalo 's newspaper relaunched its website , which now incorporates previously unheard-of features like picture galleries and a video section .
bildunterschrift : the seacom cable is slowly working its way through africa opening uganda to the world though the seacom cable was officially launched in east africa mid-2009 , broadband access has only begun to trickle through to uganda over the past few weeks .
the new connection allows a much faster data transfer of 200 kilobytes per second , allowing an increasing number of ugandans to take advantage of the features natabaalo and her colleagues have already discovered .
for constantine bitwayiki , the improved web access is cause for celebration .
bitwayiki , the ugandan president 's advisor on internet issues , has big ideas about ways the new technology could be harnessed to overhaul administrative procedures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed internet will give ugandan children access to the world bitwayiki believes that greater internet use in government and private firms could be used to improve efficiency and even tackle corruption .
high speed internet could also prove invaluable for ordinary ugandans when it comes to basic tasks like getting a driving permit , which for many involves traveling long distances to the capital .
“ i 'd just need to do some basic form-filling online , if i have to pay then i go to the nearest bank and i pay , if -lsb- a picture is needed -rsb- then i send a picture online , and then my driving permit is delivered . ”
ugandan minister for trade and industry kahinda otafire is equally optimistic .
he hopes the improved connections may also entice foreign investors into the country .
otafire 's vision for uganda is one of an outsourcing hub for the rest of the world .
“ the best english is spoken in east africa , and particularly in uganda , ” he said .
“ we 've got a lot of educated people ; we 've got a lot of trained manpower , so i do n't see why we do n't engage in outsourcing and getting in touch with the rest of the world . ”
infrastructure holds things back but not everyone is convinced .
so far , only government departments , the university of kampala and some major companies , like the newspaper monitor , are connected to broadband .
the rest of the country must make do with a far slower connection , and for most ugandans , internet cafés remain the only way to get online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait for the internet continues for many ugandans daniel biranda , planning director at the university of kampala 's computer sciences faculty , does not expect big changes in the near future .
“ you know , people are talking about the internet .
they are excited .
but they do n't know the technology . ”
in the early 1990s , biranda became the first ugandan to program a ugandan website .
today , he is looking for ways to connect villages outside the capital to the high-speed broad band cable and he says the key missing ingredient is the humble telephone cable .
“ in , say , stuttgart , every building -lsb- can have -rsb- internet , simply because there is a telephone line .
but the buildings we have in town , they have electricity , but they do n't have telephone lines . ”
because of that , the cost of connecting to the broadband network is expensive , and could easily outweigh the financial opportunities offered by a higher-speed connection , biranda said .
“ will that internet café generate something like the $ 3000 in a month -lsb- to cover the costs -rsb- ?
it ca n't . ”
there is a simple explanation for all of this .
in uganda , as in many developing countries , there has never been an extensive net of landline phones .
they simply skipped that step and went right to mobile phones .
and beyond the capital , little infrastructure exists already that could be used to easily set up internet connections .
this means that for the majority of ugandans , high speed internet access at home may not be a reality for years to come .

he 'll soon head to his native germany to serve as president of the jury for the berlinale - where he 'll watch far more films than he 's used to . herzog claims that he normally only watches two to three films per year .
he made this surprising statement shortly after being announced jury president of the 2010 berlinale .
but how could someone who so rarely sets foot in a movie theater end up in this position ?
and why does he pass on seeing so many movies ?
probably because he is very busy making them himself . at home in america werner herzog lives in los angeles , where he churns out one film after another .
but just a few years ago , no one would have expected him to ever get this far .
after all , his counterparts - german filmmakers wim wenders and volker schloendorff - gave up on their hollywood careers a long time ago and have since returned to their homeland . munich-born herzog , on the other hand , has taken a step forward in his career and now makes big-budget movies in the us , working with a-list stars like christian bale and nicolas cage .
herzog has never been a stranger to success , though ; he is credited with injecting new spirit into german cinema with his first films in the late 1960s . bildunterschrift : herzog 's " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " stars nicolas cage after that he relocated five times with his favorite actor , klaus kinski , in order to tackle daring film projects in places like south america .
his film " fitzcarraldo " has been made the subject of various books and documentaries , and his 1979 film " nosferatu the vampyre " has been hailed as one of the greatest achievements of new german cinema . following these cinematic conquests , herzog temporarily withdrew from the big screen , perhaps partly due to the death of klaus kinski .
over the next few years , he produced unconventional documentaries and staged operas . it was n't until just a few years ago that herzog claimed a real foothold in the us .
this is not a well-known fact in germany , though - maybe because some of herzog 's american-made films did not make it into german cinemas . " i never forgot about germany , " said herzog at one stage .
" but - i do n't know why - germany forgot about me . " he has repeatedly emphasized how close he still feels to his homeland : " i have left my country and live in los angeles today .
and i make films in antarctica , in south america , in the usa .
but despite this i have never abandoned my culture . " herzog 's americana based on true events , herzog 's 2007 film " rescue dawn " tells the story of a us soldier with a german background who is shot down and imprisoned in laos during the vietnam war .
then there are also his more recent american films - " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " and " my son , my son , what have ye done " - both of which premiered at the 2009 venice film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog 's favorite actor , klaus kinski , worked with him on several films whoever has had the chance to meet werner herzog at a film festival or to interview him , knows that this filmmaker is also a great entertainer .
he likes to surprise people , is keen to go against the grain , and does not like to be categorized . the audience at the 2010 berlinale festival should also be prepared for surprises when the awards are handed out on february 20 under werner herzog 's presiding eye . the berlinale runs from february 11-21 . author : jochen kuerten -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in december , the first connections between the capital kampala and the global broadband network went live , thanks to a submarine fiber-optic cable that links to broadband networks in india and europe .
since then , the east african nation has been in an e-frenzy as excited locals begin exploring all that the web has to offer , from downloading music to watching films online .
many ugandans are euphoric , but for some the new cable offers fresh disappointments : a lack of telephone cables means high speed internet will remain out of reach for most ugandans .
for those already hooked up , however , the 17,000-kilometer -lrb- 10,563 mile -rrb- long broadband cable – known as the seacom – is a boon .
grace natabaalo , a web designer who works for the online department of the ugandan newspaper monitor , is one of the seacom 's latest converts .
she realizes that uganda is no where near european speed , but compared the cable makes the internet lightning quick compared to how it used to be .
as if to demonstrate , she clicks on a video clip on her screen ; within seconds , the clip is downloaded .
“ back then , you would download something overnight , leave the computer on and find it downloaded in the morning , after twelve hours of downloading … you could never watch this ! ”
since gaining access to the higher speed internet , natabaalo 's newspaper relaunched its website , which now incorporates previously unheard-of features like picture galleries and a video section .
bildunterschrift : the seacom cable is slowly working its way through africa opening uganda to the world though the seacom cable was officially launched in east africa mid-2009 , broadband access has only begun to trickle through to uganda over the past few weeks .
the new connection allows a much faster data transfer of 200 kilobytes per second , allowing an increasing number of ugandans to take advantage of the features natabaalo and her colleagues have already discovered .
for constantine bitwayiki , the improved web access is cause for celebration .
bitwayiki , the ugandan president 's advisor on internet issues , has big ideas about ways the new technology could be harnessed to overhaul administrative procedures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed internet will give ugandan children access to the world bitwayiki believes that greater internet use in government and private firms could be used to improve efficiency and even tackle corruption .
high speed internet could also prove invaluable for ordinary ugandans when it comes to basic tasks like getting a driving permit , which for many involves traveling long distances to the capital .
“ i 'd just need to do some basic form-filling online , if i have to pay then i go to the nearest bank and i pay , if -lsb- a picture is needed -rsb- then i send a picture online , and then my driving permit is delivered . ”
ugandan minister for trade and industry kahinda otafire is equally optimistic .
he hopes the improved connections may also entice foreign investors into the country .
otafire 's vision for uganda is one of an outsourcing hub for the rest of the world .
“ the best english is spoken in east africa , and particularly in uganda , ” he said .
“ we 've got a lot of educated people ; we 've got a lot of trained manpower , so i do n't see why we do n't engage in outsourcing and getting in touch with the rest of the world . ”
infrastructure holds things back but not everyone is convinced .
so far , only government departments , the university of kampala and some major companies , like the newspaper monitor , are connected to broadband .
the rest of the country must make do with a far slower connection , and for most ugandans , internet cafés remain the only way to get online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait for the internet continues for many ugandans daniel biranda , planning director at the university of kampala 's computer sciences faculty , does not expect big changes in the near future .
“ you know , people are talking about the internet .
they are excited .
but they do n't know the technology . ”
in the early 1990s , biranda became the first ugandan to program a ugandan website .
today , he is looking for ways to connect villages outside the capital to the high-speed broad band cable and he says the key missing ingredient is the humble telephone cable .
“ in , say , stuttgart , every building -lsb- can have -rsb- internet , simply because there is a telephone line .
but the buildings we have in town , they have electricity , but they do n't have telephone lines . ”
because of that , the cost of connecting to the broadband network is expensive , and could easily outweigh the financial opportunities offered by a higher-speed connection , biranda said .
“ will that internet café generate something like the $ 3000 in a month -lsb- to cover the costs -rsb- ?
it ca n't . ”
there is a simple explanation for all of this .
in uganda , as in many developing countries , there has never been an extensive net of landline phones .
they simply skipped that step and went right to mobile phones .
and beyond the capital , little infrastructure exists already that could be used to easily set up internet connections .
this means that for the majority of ugandans , high speed internet access at home may not be a reality for years to come .

in december , the first connections between the capital kampala and the global broadband network went live , thanks to a submarine fiber-optic cable that links to broadband networks in india and europe .
since then , the east african nation has been in an e-frenzy as excited locals begin exploring all that the web has to offer , from downloading music to watching films online .
many ugandans are euphoric , but for some the new cable offers fresh disappointments : a lack of telephone cables means high speed internet will remain out of reach for most ugandans .
for those already hooked up , however , the 17,000-kilometer -lrb- 10,563 mile -rrb- long broadband cable – known as the seacom – is a boon .
grace natabaalo , a web designer who works for the online department of the ugandan newspaper monitor , is one of the seacom 's latest converts .
she realizes that uganda is no where near european speed , but compared the cable makes the internet lightning quick compared to how it used to be .
as if to demonstrate , she clicks on a video clip on her screen ; within seconds , the clip is downloaded .
“ back then , you would download something overnight , leave the computer on and find it downloaded in the morning , after twelve hours of downloading … you could never watch this ! ”
since gaining access to the higher speed internet , natabaalo 's newspaper relaunched its website , which now incorporates previously unheard-of features like picture galleries and a video section .
bildunterschrift : the seacom cable is slowly working its way through africa opening uganda to the world though the seacom cable was officially launched in east africa mid-2009 , broadband access has only begun to trickle through to uganda over the past few weeks .
the new connection allows a much faster data transfer of 200 kilobytes per second , allowing an increasing number of ugandans to take advantage of the features natabaalo and her colleagues have already discovered .
for constantine bitwayiki , the improved web access is cause for celebration .
bitwayiki , the ugandan president 's advisor on internet issues , has big ideas about ways the new technology could be harnessed to overhaul administrative procedures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed internet will give ugandan children access to the world bitwayiki believes that greater internet use in government and private firms could be used to improve efficiency and even tackle corruption .
high speed internet could also prove invaluable for ordinary ugandans when it comes to basic tasks like getting a driving permit , which for many involves traveling long distances to the capital .
“ i 'd just need to do some basic form-filling online , if i have to pay then i go to the nearest bank and i pay , if -lsb- a picture is needed -rsb- then i send a picture online , and then my driving permit is delivered . ”
ugandan minister for trade and industry kahinda otafire is equally optimistic .
he hopes the improved connections may also entice foreign investors into the country .
otafire 's vision for uganda is one of an outsourcing hub for the rest of the world .
“ the best english is spoken in east africa , and particularly in uganda , ” he said .
“ we 've got a lot of educated people ; we 've got a lot of trained manpower , so i do n't see why we do n't engage in outsourcing and getting in touch with the rest of the world . ”
infrastructure holds things back but not everyone is convinced .
so far , only government departments , the university of kampala and some major companies , like the newspaper monitor , are connected to broadband .
the rest of the country must make do with a far slower connection , and for most ugandans , internet cafés remain the only way to get online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait for the internet continues for many ugandans daniel biranda , planning director at the university of kampala 's computer sciences faculty , does not expect big changes in the near future .
“ you know , people are talking about the internet .
they are excited .
but they do n't know the technology . ”
in the early 1990s , biranda became the first ugandan to program a ugandan website .
today , he is looking for ways to connect villages outside the capital to the high-speed broad band cable and he says the key missing ingredient is the humble telephone cable .
“ in , say , stuttgart , every building -lsb- can have -rsb- internet , simply because there is a telephone line .
but the buildings we have in town , they have electricity , but they do n't have telephone lines . ”
because of that , the cost of connecting to the broadband network is expensive , and could easily outweigh the financial opportunities offered by a higher-speed connection , biranda said .
“ will that internet café generate something like the $ 3000 in a month -lsb- to cover the costs -rsb- ?
it ca n't . ”
there is a simple explanation for all of this .
in uganda , as in many developing countries , there has never been an extensive net of landline phones .
they simply skipped that step and went right to mobile phones .
and beyond the capital , little infrastructure exists already that could be used to easily set up internet connections .
this means that for the majority of ugandans , high speed internet access at home may not be a reality for years to come .

he 'll soon head to his native germany to serve as president of the jury for the berlinale - where he 'll watch far more films than he 's used to . herzog claims that he normally only watches two to three films per year .
he made this surprising statement shortly after being announced jury president of the 2010 berlinale .
but how could someone who so rarely sets foot in a movie theater end up in this position ?
and why does he pass on seeing so many movies ?
probably because he is very busy making them himself . at home in america werner herzog lives in los angeles , where he churns out one film after another .
but just a few years ago , no one would have expected him to ever get this far .
after all , his counterparts - german filmmakers wim wenders and volker schloendorff - gave up on their hollywood careers a long time ago and have since returned to their homeland . munich-born herzog , on the other hand , has taken a step forward in his career and now makes big-budget movies in the us , working with a-list stars like christian bale and nicolas cage .
herzog has never been a stranger to success , though ; he is credited with injecting new spirit into german cinema with his first films in the late 1960s . bildunterschrift : herzog 's " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " stars nicolas cage after that he relocated five times with his favorite actor , klaus kinski , in order to tackle daring film projects in places like south america .
his film " fitzcarraldo " has been made the subject of various books and documentaries , and his 1979 film " nosferatu the vampyre " has been hailed as one of the greatest achievements of new german cinema . following these cinematic conquests , herzog temporarily withdrew from the big screen , perhaps partly due to the death of klaus kinski .
over the next few years , he produced unconventional documentaries and staged operas . it was n't until just a few years ago that herzog claimed a real foothold in the us .
this is not a well-known fact in germany , though - maybe because some of herzog 's american-made films did not make it into german cinemas . " i never forgot about germany , " said herzog at one stage .
" but - i do n't know why - germany forgot about me . " he has repeatedly emphasized how close he still feels to his homeland : " i have left my country and live in los angeles today .
and i make films in antarctica , in south america , in the usa .
but despite this i have never abandoned my culture . " herzog 's americana based on true events , herzog 's 2007 film " rescue dawn " tells the story of a us soldier with a german background who is shot down and imprisoned in laos during the vietnam war .
then there are also his more recent american films - " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " and " my son , my son , what have ye done " - both of which premiered at the 2009 venice film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog 's favorite actor , klaus kinski , worked with him on several films whoever has had the chance to meet werner herzog at a film festival or to interview him , knows that this filmmaker is also a great entertainer .
he likes to surprise people , is keen to go against the grain , and does not like to be categorized . the audience at the 2010 berlinale festival should also be prepared for surprises when the awards are handed out on february 20 under werner herzog 's presiding eye . the berlinale runs from february 11-21 . author : jochen kuerten -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
a munich-based institute now wants to republish the nazi manifesto on racial purity and anti-semitism . a german history institute has announced it is preparing an annotated version of adolf hitler 's propaganda manifesto " mein kampf " for publication in germany .
edith raim , a historian with the munich-based institute of contemporary history , which is behind the project , said an annotated version of hitler 's memoir would serve to inform current and future generations of the evils of the dictator 's racist ideology .
" we want to obstruct new publications -lsb- of " mein kampf " -rsb- by the radical far-right once the copyright of the book runs out , " said raim .
a new edition of " mein kampf " can only be published after 2015 , when the copyright held by the bavarian state government expires , 70 years after hitler 's death .
" mein kampf , " or " my struggle " as it translates into english , contains hitler 's views on racial purity and vitriol against jews and communists .
raim said that publishing the book could help dispel the fear and reverence many feel towards it .
she said she did not believe the new publication would be used by neo-nazis to stir racism and hatred towards foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear neo-nazis will use the new book as a bible " this book will be published with scholarly annotation and will have a very limited run , " she said .

staunch opposition german authorities still consider " mein kampf " to be dangerous .
it has not been allowed to be reprinted here since the end of world war ii .
some academics argue that the book does n't provide any answers to questions about how the nazi regime gained power , as it primarily contains hitler 's own personal views .
in a statement on thursday , the state government of bavaria , which holds the copyright , said it had not given the institute permission to print the book and would seek to ban the publication in court .
" furthermore , following the expiration of the copyright in 2015 , the spreading of national-socialist ideas in germany will remain forbidden and punishable under the criminal code , " the statement added .
the institute of contemporary history has pointed out that copies of the original " mein kampf " can easily be bought outside of germany and that it would be wrong to leave the local market to foreign publishing houses once the copyright expires. uh / dfm / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

high speed internet could also prove invaluable for ordinary ugandans when it comes to basic tasks like getting a driving permit , which for many involves traveling long distances to the capital .
“ i 'd just need to do some basic form-filling online , if i have to pay then i go to the nearest bank and i pay , if -lsb- a picture is needed -rsb- then i send a picture online , and then my driving permit is delivered . ”
ugandan minister for trade and industry kahinda otafire is equally optimistic .
he hopes the improved connections may also entice foreign investors into the country .
otafire 's vision for uganda is one of an outsourcing hub for the rest of the world .
“ the best english is spoken in east africa , and particularly in uganda , ” he said .
“ we 've got a lot of educated people ; we 've got a lot of trained manpower , so i do n't see why we do n't engage in outsourcing and getting in touch with the rest of the world . ”
infrastructure holds things back but not everyone is convinced .
so far , only government departments , the university of kampala and some major companies , like the newspaper monitor , are connected to broadband .
the rest of the country must make do with a far slower connection , and for most ugandans , internet cafés remain the only way to get online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait for the internet continues for many ugandans daniel biranda , planning director at the university of kampala 's computer sciences faculty , does not expect big changes in the near future .
“ you know , people are talking about the internet .
they are excited .
but they do n't know the technology . ”
in the early 1990s , biranda became the first ugandan to program a ugandan website .
today , he is looking for ways to connect villages outside the capital to the high-speed broad band cable and he says the key missing ingredient is the humble telephone cable .
“ in , say , stuttgart , every building -lsb- can have -rsb- internet , simply because there is a telephone line .
but the buildings we have in town , they have electricity , but they do n't have telephone lines . ”
because of that , the cost of connecting to the broadband network is expensive , and could easily outweigh the financial opportunities offered by a higher-speed connection , biranda said .
“ will that internet café generate something like the $ 3000 in a month -lsb- to cover the costs -rsb- ?
it ca n't . ”
there is a simple explanation for all of this .
in uganda , as in many developing countries , there has never been an extensive net of landline phones .
they simply skipped that step and went right to mobile phones .
and beyond the capital , little infrastructure exists already that could be used to easily set up internet connections .
this means that for the majority of ugandans , high speed internet access at home may not be a reality for years to come .

"
a munich-based institute now wants to republish the nazi manifesto on racial purity and anti-semitism . a german history institute has announced it is preparing an annotated version of adolf hitler 's propaganda manifesto " mein kampf " for publication in germany .
edith raim , a historian with the munich-based institute of contemporary history , which is behind the project , said an annotated version of hitler 's memoir would serve to inform current and future generations of the evils of the dictator 's racist ideology .
" we want to obstruct new publications -lsb- of " mein kampf " -rsb- by the radical far-right once the copyright of the book runs out , " said raim .
a new edition of " mein kampf " can only be published after 2015 , when the copyright held by the bavarian state government expires , 70 years after hitler 's death .
" mein kampf , " or " my struggle " as it translates into english , contains hitler 's views on racial purity and vitriol against jews and communists .
raim said that publishing the book could help dispel the fear and reverence many feel towards it .
she said she did not believe the new publication would be used by neo-nazis to stir racism and hatred towards foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear neo-nazis will use the new book as a bible " this book will be published with scholarly annotation and will have a very limited run , " she said .
" after all , it 'll be so expensive that i can not imagine that any neo-nazi will ever buy it . "
staunch opposition german authorities still consider " mein kampf " to be dangerous .
it has not been allowed to be reprinted here since the end of world war ii .
some academics argue that the book does n't provide any answers to questions about how the nazi regime gained power , as it primarily contains hitler 's own personal views .
in a statement on thursday , the state government of bavaria , which holds the copyright , said it had not given the institute permission to print the book and would seek to ban the publication in court .
" furthermore , following the expiration of the copyright in 2015 , the spreading of national-socialist ideas in germany will remain forbidden and punishable under the criminal code , " the statement added .
the institute of contemporary history has pointed out that copies of the original " mein kampf " can easily be bought outside of germany and that it would be wrong to leave the local market to foreign publishing houses once the copyright expires. uh / dfm / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he 'll soon head to his native germany to serve as president of the jury for the berlinale - where he 'll watch far more films than he 's used to . herzog claims that he normally only watches two to three films per year .
he made this surprising statement shortly after being announced jury president of the 2010 berlinale .
but how could someone who so rarely sets foot in a movie theater end up in this position ?
and why does he pass on seeing so many movies ?
probably because he is very busy making them himself . at home in america werner herzog lives in los angeles , where he churns out one film after another .
but just a few years ago , no one would have expected him to ever get this far .
after all , his counterparts - german filmmakers wim wenders and volker schloendorff - gave up on their hollywood careers a long time ago and have since returned to their homeland . munich-born herzog , on the other hand , has taken a step forward in his career and now makes big-budget movies in the us , working with a-list stars like christian bale and nicolas cage .
herzog has never been a stranger to success , though ; he is credited with injecting new spirit into german cinema with his first films in the late 1960s . bildunterschrift : herzog 's " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " stars nicolas cage after that he relocated five times with his favorite actor , klaus kinski , in order to tackle daring film projects in places like south america .
his film " fitzcarraldo " has been made the subject of various books and documentaries , and his 1979 film " nosferatu the vampyre " has been hailed as one of the greatest achievements of new german cinema . following these cinematic conquests , herzog temporarily withdrew from the big screen , perhaps partly due to the death of klaus kinski .
over the next few years , he produced unconventional documentaries and staged operas . it was n't until just a few years ago that herzog claimed a real foothold in the us .
this is not a well-known fact in germany , though - maybe because some of herzog 's american-made films did not make it into german cinemas . " i never forgot about germany , " said herzog at one stage .
" but - i do n't know why - germany forgot about me . " he has repeatedly emphasized how close he still feels to his homeland : " i have left my country and live in los angeles today .
and i make films in antarctica , in south america , in the usa .
but despite this i have never abandoned my culture . " herzog 's americana based on true events , herzog 's 2007 film " rescue dawn " tells the story of a us soldier with a german background who is shot down and imprisoned in laos during the vietnam war .
then there are also his more recent american films - " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " and " my son , my son , what have ye done " - both of which premiered at the 2009 venice film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog 's favorite actor , klaus kinski , worked with him on several films whoever has had the chance to meet werner herzog at a film festival or to interview him , knows that this filmmaker is also a great entertainer .
he likes to surprise people , is keen to go against the grain , and does not like to be categorized . the audience at the 2010 berlinale festival should also be prepared for surprises when the awards are handed out on february 20 under werner herzog 's presiding eye . the berlinale runs from february 11-21 . author : jochen kuerten -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in december , the first connections between the capital kampala and the global broadband network went live , thanks to a submarine fiber-optic cable that links to broadband networks in india and europe .
since then , the east african nation has been in an e-frenzy as excited locals begin exploring all that the web has to offer , from downloading music to watching films online .
many ugandans are euphoric , but for some the new cable offers fresh disappointments : a lack of telephone cables means high speed internet will remain out of reach for most ugandans .
for those already hooked up , however , the 17,000-kilometer -lrb- 10,563 mile -rrb- long broadband cable – known as the seacom – is a boon .
grace natabaalo , a web designer who works for the online department of the ugandan newspaper monitor , is one of the seacom 's latest converts .
she realizes that uganda is no where near european speed , but compared the cable makes the internet lightning quick compared to how it used to be .
as if to demonstrate , she clicks on a video clip on her screen ; within seconds , the clip is downloaded .
“ back then , you would download something overnight , leave the computer on and find it downloaded in the morning , after twelve hours of downloading … you could never watch this ! ”
since gaining access to the higher speed internet , natabaalo 's newspaper relaunched its website , which now incorporates previously unheard-of features like picture galleries and a video section .
bildunterschrift : the seacom cable is slowly working its way through africa opening uganda to the world though the seacom cable was officially launched in east africa mid-2009 , broadband access has only begun to trickle through to uganda over the past few weeks .
the new connection allows a much faster data transfer of 200 kilobytes per second , allowing an increasing number of ugandans to take advantage of the features natabaalo and her colleagues have already discovered .
for constantine bitwayiki , the improved web access is cause for celebration .
bitwayiki , the ugandan president 's advisor on internet issues , has big ideas about ways the new technology could be harnessed to overhaul administrative procedures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed internet will give ugandan children access to the world bitwayiki believes that greater internet use in government and private firms could be used to improve efficiency and even tackle corruption .
high speed internet could also prove invaluable for ordinary ugandans when it comes to basic tasks like getting a driving permit , which for many involves traveling long distances to the capital .
“ i 'd just need to do some basic form-filling online , if i have to pay then i go to the nearest bank and i pay , if -lsb- a picture is needed -rsb- then i send a picture online , and then my driving permit is delivered . ”
ugandan minister for trade and industry kahinda otafire is equally optimistic .
he hopes the improved connections may also entice foreign investors into the country .
otafire 's vision for uganda is one of an outsourcing hub for the rest of the world .
“ the best english is spoken in east africa , and particularly in uganda , ” he said .
“ we 've got a lot of educated people ; we 've got a lot of trained manpower , so i do n't see why we do n't engage in outsourcing and getting in touch with the rest of the world . ”
infrastructure holds things back but not everyone is convinced .
so far , only government departments , the university of kampala and some major companies , like the newspaper monitor , are connected to broadband .
the rest of the country must make do with a far slower connection , and for most ugandans , internet cafés remain the only way to get online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait for the internet continues for many ugandans daniel biranda , planning director at the university of kampala 's computer sciences faculty , does not expect big changes in the near future .
“ you know , people are talking about the internet .
they are excited .
but they do n't know the technology . ”
in the early 1990s , biranda became the first ugandan to program a ugandan website .
today , he is looking for ways to connect villages outside the capital to the high-speed broad band cable and he says the key missing ingredient is the humble telephone cable .
“ in , say , stuttgart , every building -lsb- can have -rsb- internet , simply because there is a telephone line .
but the buildings we have in town , they have electricity , but they do n't have telephone lines . ”
because of that , the cost of connecting to the broadband network is expensive , and could easily outweigh the financial opportunities offered by a higher-speed connection , biranda said .
“ will that internet café generate something like the $ 3000 in a month -lsb- to cover the costs -rsb- ?
it ca n't . ”
there is a simple explanation for all of this .
in uganda , as in many developing countries , there has never been an extensive net of landline phones .
they simply skipped that step and went right to mobile phones .
and beyond the capital , little infrastructure exists already that could be used to easily set up internet connections .
this means that for the majority of ugandans , high speed internet access at home may not be a reality for years to come .

high speed internet could also prove invaluable for ordinary ugandans when it comes to basic tasks like getting a driving permit , which for many involves traveling long distances to the capital .
“ i 'd just need to do some basic form-filling online , if i have to pay then i go to the nearest bank and i pay , if -lsb- a picture is needed -rsb- then i send a picture online , and then my driving permit is delivered . ”
ugandan minister for trade and industry kahinda otafire is equally optimistic .
he hopes the improved connections may also entice foreign investors into the country .
otafire 's vision for uganda is one of an outsourcing hub for the rest of the world .
“ the best english is spoken in east africa , and particularly in uganda , ” he said .
“ we 've got a lot of educated people ; we 've got a lot of trained manpower , so i do n't see why we do n't engage in outsourcing and getting in touch with the rest of the world . ”
infrastructure holds things back but not everyone is convinced .
so far , only government departments , the university of kampala and some major companies , like the newspaper monitor , are connected to broadband .
the rest of the country must make do with a far slower connection , and for most ugandans , internet cafés remain the only way to get online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait for the internet continues for many ugandans daniel biranda , planning director at the university of kampala 's computer sciences faculty , does not expect big changes in the near future .
“ you know , people are talking about the internet .
they are excited .
but they do n't know the technology . ”
in the early 1990s , biranda became the first ugandan to program a ugandan website .
today , he is looking for ways to connect villages outside the capital to the high-speed broad band cable and he says the key missing ingredient is the humble telephone cable .
“ in , say , stuttgart , every building -lsb- can have -rsb- internet , simply because there is a telephone line .
but the buildings we have in town , they have electricity , but they do n't have telephone lines . ”
because of that , the cost of connecting to the broadband network is expensive , and could easily outweigh the financial opportunities offered by a higher-speed connection , biranda said .
“ will that internet café generate something like the $ 3000 in a month -lsb- to cover the costs -rsb- ?
it ca n't . ”
there is a simple explanation for all of this .
in uganda , as in many developing countries , there has never been an extensive net of landline phones .
they simply skipped that step and went right to mobile phones .
and beyond the capital , little infrastructure exists already that could be used to easily set up internet connections .
this means that for the majority of ugandans , high speed internet access at home may not be a reality for years to come .

in december , the first connections between the capital kampala and the global broadband network went live , thanks to a submarine fiber-optic cable that links to broadband networks in india and europe .
since then , the east african nation has been in an e-frenzy as excited locals begin exploring all that the web has to offer , from downloading music to watching films online .
many ugandans are euphoric , but for some the new cable offers fresh disappointments : a lack of telephone cables means high speed internet will remain out of reach for most ugandans .
for those already hooked up , however , the 17,000-kilometer -lrb- 10,563 mile -rrb- long broadband cable – known as the seacom – is a boon .
grace natabaalo , a web designer who works for the online department of the ugandan newspaper monitor , is one of the seacom 's latest converts .
she realizes that uganda is no where near european speed , but compared the cable makes the internet lightning quick compared to how it used to be .
as if to demonstrate , she clicks on a video clip on her screen ; within seconds , the clip is downloaded .
“ back then , you would download something overnight , leave the computer on and find it downloaded in the morning , after twelve hours of downloading … you could never watch this ! ”
since gaining access to the higher speed internet , natabaalo 's newspaper relaunched its website , which now incorporates previously unheard-of features like picture galleries and a video section .
bildunterschrift : the seacom cable is slowly working its way through africa opening uganda to the world though the seacom cable was officially launched in east africa mid-2009 , broadband access has only begun to trickle through to uganda over the past few weeks .
the new connection allows a much faster data transfer of 200 kilobytes per second , allowing an increasing number of ugandans to take advantage of the features natabaalo and her colleagues have already discovered .
for constantine bitwayiki , the improved web access is cause for celebration .
bitwayiki , the ugandan president 's advisor on internet issues , has big ideas about ways the new technology could be harnessed to overhaul administrative procedures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed internet will give ugandan children access to the world bitwayiki believes that greater internet use in government and private firms could be used to improve efficiency and even tackle corruption .

he 'll soon head to his native germany to serve as president of the jury for the berlinale - where he 'll watch far more films than he 's used to . herzog claims that he normally only watches two to three films per year .
he made this surprising statement shortly after being announced jury president of the 2010 berlinale .
but how could someone who so rarely sets foot in a movie theater end up in this position ?
and why does he pass on seeing so many movies ?
probably because he is very busy making them himself . at home in america werner herzog lives in los angeles , where he churns out one film after another .
but just a few years ago , no one would have expected him to ever get this far .
after all , his counterparts - german filmmakers wim wenders and volker schloendorff - gave up on their hollywood careers a long time ago and have since returned to their homeland . munich-born herzog , on the other hand , has taken a step forward in his career and now makes big-budget movies in the us , working with a-list stars like christian bale and nicolas cage .
herzog has never been a stranger to success , though ; he is credited with injecting new spirit into german cinema with his first films in the late 1960s . bildunterschrift : herzog 's " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " stars nicolas cage after that he relocated five times with his favorite actor , klaus kinski , in order to tackle daring film projects in places like south america .
his film " fitzcarraldo " has been made the subject of various books and documentaries , and his 1979 film " nosferatu the vampyre " has been hailed as one of the greatest achievements of new german cinema . following these cinematic conquests , herzog temporarily withdrew from the big screen , perhaps partly due to the death of klaus kinski .
over the next few years , he produced unconventional documentaries and staged operas . it was n't until just a few years ago that herzog claimed a real foothold in the us .
this is not a well-known fact in germany , though - maybe because some of herzog 's american-made films did not make it into german cinemas . " i never forgot about germany , " said herzog at one stage .
" but - i do n't know why - germany forgot about me . " he has repeatedly emphasized how close he still feels to his homeland : " i have left my country and live in los angeles today .
and i make films in antarctica , in south america , in the usa .
but despite this i have never abandoned my culture . " herzog 's americana based on true events , herzog 's 2007 film " rescue dawn " tells the story of a us soldier with a german background who is shot down and imprisoned in laos during the vietnam war .
then there are also his more recent american films - " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " and " my son , my son , what have ye done " - both of which premiered at the 2009 venice film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog 's favorite actor , klaus kinski , worked with him on several films whoever has had the chance to meet werner herzog at a film festival or to interview him , knows that this filmmaker is also a great entertainer .

he 'll soon head to his native germany to serve as president of the jury for the berlinale - where he 'll watch far more films than he 's used to . herzog claims that he normally only watches two to three films per year .
he made this surprising statement shortly after being announced jury president of the 2010 berlinale .
but how could someone who so rarely sets foot in a movie theater end up in this position ?
and why does he pass on seeing so many movies ?
probably because he is very busy making them himself . at home in america werner herzog lives in los angeles , where he churns out one film after another .
but just a few years ago , no one would have expected him to ever get this far .
after all , his counterparts - german filmmakers wim wenders and volker schloendorff - gave up on their hollywood careers a long time ago and have since returned to their homeland . munich-born herzog , on the other hand , has taken a step forward in his career and now makes big-budget movies in the us , working with a-list stars like christian bale and nicolas cage .

negotiations are n't set to resume until after the world cup in june . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- has said the fate of national team coach joachim loew will not be decided until after the upcoming world cup in south africa in june .
what looked like it would be a simple contract extension has turned into a power struggle , with loew reportedly asking for a signing-on fee equivalent to a year 's salary .
" basically , both sides are still interested in working together but we were unable to reach agreement on important aspects of a deal , " explained dfb president theo zwanziger after a specially convened board meeting thursday at the organization 's headquarters in frankfurt .
loew 's current contract expires after the next world cup , where germany has been pooled with australia , serbia and ghana .
zwanziger announced last december that a two-year contract extension had been agreed with loew , keeping him at the helm of the national team until after euro 2012 in poland and ukraine .
but that deal was supposed to be approved at thursday 's meeting .
germany team manager oliver bierhoff , who is part of the three-man coaching team renegotiating their contracts , admitted the news was a blow .
" we would have liked to clear up the contract extension details quickly with the world cup fast approaching , but we accept the president 's decision , " he said .

negotiations are n't set to resume until after the world cup in june . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- has said the fate of national team coach joachim loew will not be decided until after the upcoming world cup in south africa in june .
what looked like it would be a simple contract extension has turned into a power struggle , with loew reportedly asking for a signing-on fee equivalent to a year 's salary .
" basically , both sides are still interested in working together but we were unable to reach agreement on important aspects of a deal , " explained dfb president theo zwanziger after a specially convened board meeting thursday at the organization 's headquarters in frankfurt .
loew 's current contract expires after the next world cup , where germany has been pooled with australia , serbia and ghana .
zwanziger announced last december that a two-year contract extension had been agreed with loew , keeping him at the helm of the national team until after euro 2012 in poland and ukraine .
but that deal was supposed to be approved at thursday 's meeting .
germany team manager oliver bierhoff , who is part of the three-man coaching team renegotiating their contracts , admitted the news was a blow .
" we would have liked to clear up the contract extension details quickly with the world cup fast approaching , but we accept the president 's decision , " he said .
loew was handed the national team reins following a decision by former coach juergen klinsmann not to extend his contract after the last world cup in germany in 2006. dfm / dpa / afp editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
a munich-based institute now wants to republish the nazi manifesto on racial purity and anti-semitism . a german history institute has announced it is preparing an annotated version of adolf hitler 's propaganda manifesto " mein kampf " for publication in germany .
edith raim , a historian with the munich-based institute of contemporary history , which is behind the project , said an annotated version of hitler 's memoir would serve to inform current and future generations of the evils of the dictator 's racist ideology .
" we want to obstruct new publications -lsb- of " mein kampf " -rsb- by the radical far-right once the copyright of the book runs out , " said raim .
a new edition of " mein kampf " can only be published after 2015 , when the copyright held by the bavarian state government expires , 70 years after hitler 's death .
" mein kampf , " or " my struggle " as it translates into english , contains hitler 's views on racial purity and vitriol against jews and communists .

it has not been allowed to be reprinted here since the end of world war ii .
some academics argue that the book does n't provide any answers to questions about how the nazi regime gained power , as it primarily contains hitler 's own personal views .
in a statement on thursday , the state government of bavaria , which holds the copyright , said it had not given the institute permission to print the book and would seek to ban the publication in court .
" furthermore , following the expiration of the copyright in 2015 , the spreading of national-socialist ideas in germany will remain forbidden and punishable under the criminal code , " the statement added .

"
a munich-based institute now wants to republish the nazi manifesto on racial purity and anti-semitism . a german history institute has announced it is preparing an annotated version of adolf hitler 's propaganda manifesto " mein kampf " for publication in germany .
edith raim , a historian with the munich-based institute of contemporary history , which is behind the project , said an annotated version of hitler 's memoir would serve to inform current and future generations of the evils of the dictator 's racist ideology .
" we want to obstruct new publications -lsb- of " mein kampf " -rsb- by the radical far-right once the copyright of the book runs out , " said raim .
a new edition of " mein kampf " can only be published after 2015 , when the copyright held by the bavarian state government expires , 70 years after hitler 's death .
" mein kampf , " or " my struggle " as it translates into english , contains hitler 's views on racial purity and vitriol against jews and communists .
raim said that publishing the book could help dispel the fear and reverence many feel towards it .
she said she did not believe the new publication would be used by neo-nazis to stir racism and hatred towards foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear neo-nazis will use the new book as a bible " this book will be published with scholarly annotation and will have a very limited run , " she said .
" after all , it 'll be so expensive that i can not imagine that any neo-nazi will ever buy it . "
staunch opposition german authorities still consider " mein kampf " to be dangerous .
it has not been allowed to be reprinted here since the end of world war ii .
some academics argue that the book does n't provide any answers to questions about how the nazi regime gained power , as it primarily contains hitler 's own personal views .
in a statement on thursday , the state government of bavaria , which holds the copyright , said it had not given the institute permission to print the book and would seek to ban the publication in court .
" furthermore , following the expiration of the copyright in 2015 , the spreading of national-socialist ideas in germany will remain forbidden and punishable under the criminal code , " the statement added .

negotiations are n't set to resume until after the world cup in june . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- has said the fate of national team coach joachim loew will not be decided until after the upcoming world cup in south africa in june .
what looked like it would be a simple contract extension has turned into a power struggle , with loew reportedly asking for a signing-on fee equivalent to a year 's salary .
" basically , both sides are still interested in working together but we were unable to reach agreement on important aspects of a deal , " explained dfb president theo zwanziger after a specially convened board meeting thursday at the organization 's headquarters in frankfurt .
loew 's current contract expires after the next world cup , where germany has been pooled with australia , serbia and ghana .
zwanziger announced last december that a two-year contract extension had been agreed with loew , keeping him at the helm of the national team until after euro 2012 in poland and ukraine .
but that deal was supposed to be approved at thursday 's meeting .
germany team manager oliver bierhoff , who is part of the three-man coaching team renegotiating their contracts , admitted the news was a blow .
" we would have liked to clear up the contract extension details quickly with the world cup fast approaching , but we accept the president 's decision , " he said .

negotiations are n't set to resume until after the world cup in june . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- has said the fate of national team coach joachim loew will not be decided until after the upcoming world cup in south africa in june .
what looked like it would be a simple contract extension has turned into a power struggle , with loew reportedly asking for a signing-on fee equivalent to a year 's salary .

the junior coalition partners , the free democratic party , have been condemned in particular as " unfit to govern . " the new german government under chancellor angela merkel could hardly have feared worse reviews on its first 100 days in office .
not a single major newspaper could muster a kind assessment , and some have been merciless .
squabbling , indecisive , and naïve fairly sums up the opinion of most political commentators , and they also agree on who to blame : the free democratic party led by foreign minister and vice chancellor guido westerwelle , the party regarded as the big winners of last september 's election .
" with an election result of more than 14 percent , the fdp suddenly had big hopes to fulfil , " says the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" and they are not up to it yet . "
the successful election campaign seemed to promise that the fdp would establish itself outside its traditional voter base .
but it is " squandering its opportunity permanently , " the paper says .
as for merkel 's christian democratic union , they are desperate " not to be seen as the neo-liberal spectre that the opposition made them out to be before the election . "
the sueddeutsche zeitung uses a botanical metaphor to illustrate its thoughts on the new government .
the national paper likens the constantly squabbling leaders of merkel 's allies - westerwelle and christian social union leader horst seehofer - to the mimosa , a prickly , sensitive plant that closes rapidly when touched or shaken .
" angela merkel is in charge of a mimosa coalition , " the paper concludes .
" we 've seen the husk .
it 's time for the fruit . "
several papers have noted that the last government , a coalition of the center-right cdu and the center-left social democratic party , seemed to function much better , despite being considered at the time as an unworkable marriage of convenience .
as munich tabloid abendzeitung says , " many think back to it with nostalgia . "
the combination of cdu and fdp only seems to work at a state level , the paper argues .
the cologne-based koelnische rundschau also compares this coalition unfavourably to its predecessors , particularly as the cdu and the fdp went into the last election as declared allies .
" the spd / green alliance was unprepared in 1998 , and the cdu and the spd could not bring themselves to trust each other in 2005 , " the paper says , " but the cdu and the fdp do not give the impression that they want to work together . "
" what do the cdu and fdp want ? " the paper asks .
but perhaps the bluntest assessment came from the berliner zeitung , and was aimed specifically at westerwelle 's party : " they ca n't do it .
they are unfit to govern .
angela merkel has brought an unpredictable , chaotic bunch into the cabinet .

the junior coalition partners , the free democratic party , have been condemned in particular as " unfit to govern . " the new german government under chancellor angela merkel could hardly have feared worse reviews on its first 100 days in office .
not a single major newspaper could muster a kind assessment , and some have been merciless .
squabbling , indecisive , and naïve fairly sums up the opinion of most political commentators , and they also agree on who to blame : the free democratic party led by foreign minister and vice chancellor guido westerwelle , the party regarded as the big winners of last september 's election .
" with an election result of more than 14 percent , the fdp suddenly had big hopes to fulfil , " says the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" and they are not up to it yet . "
the successful election campaign seemed to promise that the fdp would establish itself outside its traditional voter base .
but it is " squandering its opportunity permanently , " the paper says .
as for merkel 's christian democratic union , they are desperate " not to be seen as the neo-liberal spectre that the opposition made them out to be before the election . "
the sueddeutsche zeitung uses a botanical metaphor to illustrate its thoughts on the new government .
the national paper likens the constantly squabbling leaders of merkel 's allies - westerwelle and christian social union leader horst seehofer - to the mimosa , a prickly , sensitive plant that closes rapidly when touched or shaken .
" angela merkel is in charge of a mimosa coalition , " the paper concludes .
" we 've seen the husk .
it 's time for the fruit . "
several papers have noted that the last government , a coalition of the center-right cdu and the center-left social democratic party , seemed to function much better , despite being considered at the time as an unworkable marriage of convenience .
as munich tabloid abendzeitung says , " many think back to it with nostalgia . "
the combination of cdu and fdp only seems to work at a state level , the paper argues .
the cologne-based koelnische rundschau also compares this coalition unfavourably to its predecessors , particularly as the cdu and the fdp went into the last election as declared allies .
" the spd / green alliance was unprepared in 1998 , and the cdu and the spd could not bring themselves to trust each other in 2005 , " the paper says , " but the cdu and the fdp do not give the impression that they want to work together . "
" what do the cdu and fdp want ? " the paper asks .
but perhaps the bluntest assessment came from the berliner zeitung , and was aimed specifically at westerwelle 's party : " they ca n't do it .
they are unfit to govern .

in december , the first connections between the capital kampala and the global broadband network went live , thanks to a submarine fiber-optic cable that links to broadband networks in india and europe .
since then , the east african nation has been in an e-frenzy as excited locals begin exploring all that the web has to offer , from downloading music to watching films online .
many ugandans are euphoric , but for some the new cable offers fresh disappointments : a lack of telephone cables means high speed internet will remain out of reach for most ugandans .
for those already hooked up , however , the 17,000-kilometer -lrb- 10,563 mile -rrb- long broadband cable – known as the seacom – is a boon .
grace natabaalo , a web designer who works for the online department of the ugandan newspaper monitor , is one of the seacom 's latest converts .
she realizes that uganda is no where near european speed , but compared the cable makes the internet lightning quick compared to how it used to be .
as if to demonstrate , she clicks on a video clip on her screen ; within seconds , the clip is downloaded .
“ back then , you would download something overnight , leave the computer on and find it downloaded in the morning , after twelve hours of downloading … you could never watch this ! ”
since gaining access to the higher speed internet , natabaalo 's newspaper relaunched its website , which now incorporates previously unheard-of features like picture galleries and a video section .
bildunterschrift : the seacom cable is slowly working its way through africa opening uganda to the world though the seacom cable was officially launched in east africa mid-2009 , broadband access has only begun to trickle through to uganda over the past few weeks .
the new connection allows a much faster data transfer of 200 kilobytes per second , allowing an increasing number of ugandans to take advantage of the features natabaalo and her colleagues have already discovered .
for constantine bitwayiki , the improved web access is cause for celebration .
bitwayiki , the ugandan president 's advisor on internet issues , has big ideas about ways the new technology could be harnessed to overhaul administrative procedures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed internet will give ugandan children access to the world bitwayiki believes that greater internet use in government and private firms could be used to improve efficiency and even tackle corruption .
high speed internet could also prove invaluable for ordinary ugandans when it comes to basic tasks like getting a driving permit , which for many involves traveling long distances to the capital .
“ i 'd just need to do some basic form-filling online , if i have to pay then i go to the nearest bank and i pay , if -lsb- a picture is needed -rsb- then i send a picture online , and then my driving permit is delivered . ”
ugandan minister for trade and industry kahinda otafire is equally optimistic .
he hopes the improved connections may also entice foreign investors into the country .
otafire 's vision for uganda is one of an outsourcing hub for the rest of the world .
“ the best english is spoken in east africa , and particularly in uganda , ” he said .
“ we 've got a lot of educated people ; we 've got a lot of trained manpower , so i do n't see why we do n't engage in outsourcing and getting in touch with the rest of the world . ”
infrastructure holds things back but not everyone is convinced .
so far , only government departments , the university of kampala and some major companies , like the newspaper monitor , are connected to broadband .
the rest of the country must make do with a far slower connection , and for most ugandans , internet cafés remain the only way to get online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait for the internet continues for many ugandans daniel biranda , planning director at the university of kampala 's computer sciences faculty , does not expect big changes in the near future .
“ you know , people are talking about the internet .
they are excited .
but they do n't know the technology . ”
in the early 1990s , biranda became the first ugandan to program a ugandan website .
today , he is looking for ways to connect villages outside the capital to the high-speed broad band cable and he says the key missing ingredient is the humble telephone cable .
“ in , say , stuttgart , every building -lsb- can have -rsb- internet , simply because there is a telephone line .
but the buildings we have in town , they have electricity , but they do n't have telephone lines . ”
because of that , the cost of connecting to the broadband network is expensive , and could easily outweigh the financial opportunities offered by a higher-speed connection , biranda said .
“ will that internet café generate something like the $ 3000 in a month -lsb- to cover the costs -rsb- ?
it ca n't . ”
there is a simple explanation for all of this .
in uganda , as in many developing countries , there has never been an extensive net of landline phones .
they simply skipped that step and went right to mobile phones .
and beyond the capital , little infrastructure exists already that could be used to easily set up internet connections .
this means that for the majority of ugandans , high speed internet access at home may not be a reality for years to come .

in december , the first connections between the capital kampala and the global broadband network went live , thanks to a submarine fiber-optic cable that links to broadband networks in india and europe .
since then , the east african nation has been in an e-frenzy as excited locals begin exploring all that the web has to offer , from downloading music to watching films online .
many ugandans are euphoric , but for some the new cable offers fresh disappointments : a lack of telephone cables means high speed internet will remain out of reach for most ugandans .
for those already hooked up , however , the 17,000-kilometer -lrb- 10,563 mile -rrb- long broadband cable – known as the seacom – is a boon .
grace natabaalo , a web designer who works for the online department of the ugandan newspaper monitor , is one of the seacom 's latest converts .
she realizes that uganda is no where near european speed , but compared the cable makes the internet lightning quick compared to how it used to be .
as if to demonstrate , she clicks on a video clip on her screen ; within seconds , the clip is downloaded .
“ back then , you would download something overnight , leave the computer on and find it downloaded in the morning , after twelve hours of downloading … you could never watch this ! ”
since gaining access to the higher speed internet , natabaalo 's newspaper relaunched its website , which now incorporates previously unheard-of features like picture galleries and a video section .
bildunterschrift : the seacom cable is slowly working its way through africa opening uganda to the world though the seacom cable was officially launched in east africa mid-2009 , broadband access has only begun to trickle through to uganda over the past few weeks .
the new connection allows a much faster data transfer of 200 kilobytes per second , allowing an increasing number of ugandans to take advantage of the features natabaalo and her colleagues have already discovered .
for constantine bitwayiki , the improved web access is cause for celebration .
bitwayiki , the ugandan president 's advisor on internet issues , has big ideas about ways the new technology could be harnessed to overhaul administrative procedures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed internet will give ugandan children access to the world bitwayiki believes that greater internet use in government and private firms could be used to improve efficiency and even tackle corruption .
high speed internet could also prove invaluable for ordinary ugandans when it comes to basic tasks like getting a driving permit , which for many involves traveling long distances to the capital .
“ i 'd just need to do some basic form-filling online , if i have to pay then i go to the nearest bank and i pay , if -lsb- a picture is needed -rsb- then i send a picture online , and then my driving permit is delivered . ”
ugandan minister for trade and industry kahinda otafire is equally optimistic .
he hopes the improved connections may also entice foreign investors into the country .
otafire 's vision for uganda is one of an outsourcing hub for the rest of the world .
“ the best english is spoken in east africa , and particularly in uganda , ” he said .
“ we 've got a lot of educated people ; we 've got a lot of trained manpower , so i do n't see why we do n't engage in outsourcing and getting in touch with the rest of the world . ”
infrastructure holds things back but not everyone is convinced .
so far , only government departments , the university of kampala and some major companies , like the newspaper monitor , are connected to broadband .
the rest of the country must make do with a far slower connection , and for most ugandans , internet cafés remain the only way to get online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait for the internet continues for many ugandans daniel biranda , planning director at the university of kampala 's computer sciences faculty , does not expect big changes in the near future .
“ you know , people are talking about the internet .
they are excited .
but they do n't know the technology . ”
in the early 1990s , biranda became the first ugandan to program a ugandan website .
today , he is looking for ways to connect villages outside the capital to the high-speed broad band cable and he says the key missing ingredient is the humble telephone cable .
“ in , say , stuttgart , every building -lsb- can have -rsb- internet , simply because there is a telephone line .
but the buildings we have in town , they have electricity , but they do n't have telephone lines . ”
because of that , the cost of connecting to the broadband network is expensive , and could easily outweigh the financial opportunities offered by a higher-speed connection , biranda said .
“ will that internet café generate something like the $ 3000 in a month -lsb- to cover the costs -rsb- ?
it ca n't . ”
there is a simple explanation for all of this .
in uganda , as in many developing countries , there has never been an extensive net of landline phones .
they simply skipped that step and went right to mobile phones .
and beyond the capital , little infrastructure exists already that could be used to easily set up internet connections .
this means that for the majority of ugandans , high speed internet access at home may not be a reality for years to come .

"
a munich-based institute now wants to republish the nazi manifesto on racial purity and anti-semitism . a german history institute has announced it is preparing an annotated version of adolf hitler 's propaganda manifesto " mein kampf " for publication in germany .
edith raim , a historian with the munich-based institute of contemporary history , which is behind the project , said an annotated version of hitler 's memoir would serve to inform current and future generations of the evils of the dictator 's racist ideology .
" we want to obstruct new publications -lsb- of " mein kampf " -rsb- by the radical far-right once the copyright of the book runs out , " said raim .
a new edition of " mein kampf " can only be published after 2015 , when the copyright held by the bavarian state government expires , 70 years after hitler 's death .
" mein kampf , " or " my struggle " as it translates into english , contains hitler 's views on racial purity and vitriol against jews and communists .
raim said that publishing the book could help dispel the fear and reverence many feel towards it .
she said she did not believe the new publication would be used by neo-nazis to stir racism and hatred towards foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear neo-nazis will use the new book as a bible " this book will be published with scholarly annotation and will have a very limited run , " she said .
" after all , it 'll be so expensive that i can not imagine that any neo-nazi will ever buy it . "
staunch opposition german authorities still consider " mein kampf " to be dangerous .
it has not been allowed to be reprinted here since the end of world war ii .
some academics argue that the book does n't provide any answers to questions about how the nazi regime gained power , as it primarily contains hitler 's own personal views .
in a statement on thursday , the state government of bavaria , which holds the copyright , said it had not given the institute permission to print the book and would seek to ban the publication in court .
" furthermore , following the expiration of the copyright in 2015 , the spreading of national-socialist ideas in germany will remain forbidden and punishable under the criminal code , " the statement added .
the institute of contemporary history has pointed out that copies of the original " mein kampf " can easily be bought outside of germany and that it would be wrong to leave the local market to foreign publishing houses once the copyright expires. uh / dfm / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the munich international security conference gets underway , we ask two experts just how important these meetings really are . it 's the same procedure every january .
the year is barely a few weeks old and a massive stream of business travelers from all over the world is already en route to europe .
the main destinations for thousands of political leaders and executives are davos and munich .
in the swiss mountains the world economic forum , as it regularly does , this year attracted more than 2000 delegates . munich 's security conference traditionally taking place this week usually attracts around 300 participants .

add to those long established venues this year 's new global zero summit with its focus on nuclear disarmament held in paris squeezed in the few remaining days between davos and munich and the dld conference on digital innovation in munich right before the world economic forum and you can appreciate why a good travel consultant is necessary for the many people participating in more than one conference .
while the meetings in davos and munich by now have a long history , they are criticized on a regular basis for what essentially are two contradictory reasons .
one is that at these private gatherings , high-profile figures make decisions behind close doors and thus effectively undermine the work of the legitimate international bodies .
and two , that these meetings are just hyped-up talking shops that have no real significance and therefore are basically superfluous . no threat to un " i would n't share this criticism , " says juergen chrobog , a former state secretary in the german foreign office and ambassador to the us .
" i think the conferences in munich or davos are not meant to solve problems , to lead to certain results .

no politician would skip an important un meeting because of these private conferences .
major decisions , the experts argue , are prepared long before important global meetings and concluded at these meetings .
what about the claim then that these private meetings are essentially much ado about nothing ?
chrobog , who declares jokingly that he himself has not only attended many , but too many of these conferences and has limited his participation in recent years , nevertheless believes that this meetings do serve an important function .
" it 's simply for people to get together and have a free exchange of views and to allow them develop their own ideas , " he says .
" that 's very important .
people have to meet , they have to get together , they have to build networks . "
events like davos and munich are attractive because they make it easy to do exactly that participants can meet lots of people in a very short time .
nothing wrong with communication just because these conferences do n't produce results , does n't mean they are n't valuable , weidenfeld told deutsche welle and points to an important , but often neglected aspect of the nature of politics .
" you have to realize that politics is also about communication , " he says .
" everything is perception .
how do the other actors perceive the reality and the problems .
what do the others think that i am thinking and what is their reaction to my way of thinking about a problem .
i think this is the positive aspect of these kind of activities . "
while chrobog and weidenfeld argue that private gatherings like the ones in davos and munich have a place in the political calendar , they both feel that with many new venues springing up all the time , the conference circuit has gotten very crowded and events have become too big and similar in nature .
the biggest danger for the conferences however , stems not from the meetings themselves , but from the expectations of concrete outcomes .
people and the media should n't exaggerate the meaning of those conferences and expect concrete results . " it 's more or less a market place of politics to exchange perceptions " , says weidenfeld .
" it is a certain form of a vanity fair with a great deficit on strategic thinking and real problem solving . "
no problem solving " i think they have a certain importance , but they will not change the world " , says juergen chrobog who currently heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt .

he stood alone in the corner , nobody talked to him , because his speech had been too tough in their mind .

as the munich international security conference gets underway , we ask two experts just how important these meetings really are . it 's the same procedure every january .
the year is barely a few weeks old and a massive stream of business travelers from all over the world is already en route to europe .
the main destinations for thousands of political leaders and executives are davos and munich .
in the swiss mountains the world economic forum , as it regularly does , this year attracted more than 2000 delegates . munich 's security conference traditionally taking place this week usually attracts around 300 participants .

add to those long established venues this year 's new global zero summit with its focus on nuclear disarmament held in paris squeezed in the few remaining days between davos and munich and the dld conference on digital innovation in munich right before the world economic forum and you can appreciate why a good travel consultant is necessary for the many people participating in more than one conference .
while the meetings in davos and munich by now have a long history , they are criticized on a regular basis for what essentially are two contradictory reasons .
one is that at these private gatherings , high-profile figures make decisions behind close doors and thus effectively undermine the work of the legitimate international bodies .
and two , that these meetings are just hyped-up talking shops that have no real significance and therefore are basically superfluous . no threat to un " i would n't share this criticism , " says juergen chrobog , a former state secretary in the german foreign office and ambassador to the us .
" i think the conferences in munich or davos are not meant to solve problems , to lead to certain results . " werner weidenfeld , who served for twelve years as the german government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations and currently directs the munich based think tank center for applied policy research , agrees that conferences such as davos and munich do not undermine the work of united nations and other institutions designated to solving global problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private meetings are no threat to the work of the un , say experts both experts point out that these conferences in no way can or want to rival the formal decision making processes at un level or other official venues .
no politician would skip an important un meeting because of these private conferences .
major decisions , the experts argue , are prepared long before important global meetings and concluded at these meetings .
what about the claim then that these private meetings are essentially much ado about nothing ?
chrobog , who declares jokingly that he himself has not only attended many , but too many of these conferences and has limited his participation in recent years , nevertheless believes that this meetings do serve an important function .
" it 's simply for people to get together and have a free exchange of views and to allow them develop their own ideas , " he says .
" that 's very important .
people have to meet , they have to get together , they have to build networks . "
events like davos and munich are attractive because they make it easy to do exactly that participants can meet lots of people in a very short time .
nothing wrong with communication just because these conferences do n't produce results , does n't mean they are n't valuable , weidenfeld told deutsche welle and points to an important , but often neglected aspect of the nature of politics .
" you have to realize that politics is also about communication , " he says .
" everything is perception .
how do the other actors perceive the reality and the problems .
what do the others think that i am thinking and what is their reaction to my way of thinking about a problem .
i think this is the positive aspect of these kind of activities . "
while chrobog and weidenfeld argue that private gatherings like the ones in davos and munich have a place in the political calendar , they both feel that with many new venues springing up all the time , the conference circuit has gotten very crowded and events have become too big and similar in nature .
the biggest danger for the conferences however , stems not from the meetings themselves , but from the expectations of concrete outcomes .

twice as much money as had been thought could be hidden in swiss accounts , as bank documents come to light . a controversial investigation into german tax-evaders with swiss bank accounts could yield more money for the taxman than had been thought , according to german daily newspaper suddeutsche zeitung . some 200 million euros in recouped taxes could be raised , sueddeutsche zeitung journalist hans leyendecker told public television channel ard on wednesday evening .
the probe comes after the german government bought a cd containing details of about 1,500 alleged tax dodgers .
the figure is twice the amount previously estimated . internal documents from the bank credit suisse reveal that the extent of tax evasion might go further than had been thought , according to the newpaper report .
the majority of its german customers might have hidden their money , the bank document is reported to have said , with many eager to have as little contact with bank as possible , to avoid detection . give it up german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has asked tax dodgers to turn themselves in following berlin 's decision to pay a whistle-blower for a list of alleged suspects who have stashed money in switzerland . " i can only advise anyone who thinks he may have evaded taxes in the past to use the provisions in our tax code to declare it voluntarily , " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the augsburger allgemeine daily in an interview . the german government agreed to pay a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.5 million -rrb- to an informer for the list of those alleged to be hiding money in secret accounts . a handful of other european countries have lined up behind germany , with the netherlands , belgium and austria having all reportedly expressed interest in obtaining a copy of the latest cd . " should there be evidence that the cd -lsb- with the stolen bank data -rsb- contains information on austrian taxpayers , we would naturally have great interest in analyzing those , " a spokesman for austrian finance minister josef proell was quoted as saying to der standard newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeuble appealed to suspected tax evaders a dutch finance ministry spokesman said the netherlands , where deputy finance minister jan kees de jager is pushing through a crackdown on tax-dodgers , told berlin he would be interested in having any data on dutch taxpayers , news agency reuters reported . liechtenstein precedent the affair has soured relations between germany and its alpine neighbor , which sees the purchasing of the disc as another attack on its cherished banking secrecy . " here we have a new form of bank robbery , " swiss lawmaker pirmin bischof told germany 's deutschlandfunk radio .
" before , you had to go to the bank and get hold of the money with a weapon .
today you can do it electronically by stealing data . ” but schaeuble has said that the government would be legally justified in buying the stolen data .
chancellor angela merkel said on monday she was in favor of acquiring the cd . " in principle , the decision was made two years ago , " schaeuble told the augsburger allgemeine newspaper , referring to a similar case in 2007 , when the government handed over as much as five million euros for stolen tax data from liechtenstein . party divided controversy over the cd has led to a row developing within merkel ’ s christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the party 's economic affairs council has spoken out against the move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants to be tough on tax evaders " the state is obliged to use all legal means to arrest the man who has stolen the data , " council chairman kurt lauk told tuesday 's edition of the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper . the deputy leader of the cdu 's parliamentary faction , guenter krings , urged his superiors to proceed with caution .
" it would be good if we got the data and could get at those tax evaders , " he told the koelner stadt-anzeiger . but krings insisted that to cooperate with criminals should remain an absolute exception .
" if we start setting this example , there is a huge risk that criminals double their money . "
siegfried kauder , chairman of the german parliament 's judiciary committee , and also a member of the cdu , advised against a deal .
" we 're sending data thieves a message : if you steal , we 'll buy it off you , " he said . rc / dfm / bk / rb / dpa / apn / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" then there was a coffee break and i observed that none of the other top politicians from america , from germany or elsewhere talked to president sarkozy .
he stood alone in the corner , nobody talked to him , because his speech had been too tough in their mind .
then i myself went to him and talked to him and he was so grateful that he almost tried to kiss me .
so i learned first hand that sarkozy does n't only have friends in international politics . "

as the munich international security conference gets underway , we ask two experts just how important these meetings really are . it 's the same procedure every january .
the year is barely a few weeks old and a massive stream of business travelers from all over the world is already en route to europe .
the main destinations for thousands of political leaders and executives are davos and munich .
in the swiss mountains the world economic forum , as it regularly does , this year attracted more than 2000 delegates . munich 's security conference traditionally taking place this week usually attracts around 300 participants .
but that 's not all .
add to those long established venues this year 's new global zero summit with its focus on nuclear disarmament held in paris squeezed in the few remaining days between davos and munich and the dld conference on digital innovation in munich right before the world economic forum and you can appreciate why a good travel consultant is necessary for the many people participating in more than one conference .
while the meetings in davos and munich by now have a long history , they are criticized on a regular basis for what essentially are two contradictory reasons .
one is that at these private gatherings , high-profile figures make decisions behind close doors and thus effectively undermine the work of the legitimate international bodies .
and two , that these meetings are just hyped-up talking shops that have no real significance and therefore are basically superfluous . no threat to un " i would n't share this criticism , " says juergen chrobog , a former state secretary in the german foreign office and ambassador to the us .
" i think the conferences in munich or davos are not meant to solve problems , to lead to certain results . " werner weidenfeld , who served for twelve years as the german government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations and currently directs the munich based think tank center for applied policy research , agrees that conferences such as davos and munich do not undermine the work of united nations and other institutions designated to solving global problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private meetings are no threat to the work of the un , say experts both experts point out that these conferences in no way can or want to rival the formal decision making processes at un level or other official venues .
no politician would skip an important un meeting because of these private conferences .
major decisions , the experts argue , are prepared long before important global meetings and concluded at these meetings .
what about the claim then that these private meetings are essentially much ado about nothing ?
chrobog , who declares jokingly that he himself has not only attended many , but too many of these conferences and has limited his participation in recent years , nevertheless believes that this meetings do serve an important function .
" it 's simply for people to get together and have a free exchange of views and to allow them develop their own ideas , " he says .
" that 's very important .
people have to meet , they have to get together , they have to build networks . "
events like davos and munich are attractive because they make it easy to do exactly that participants can meet lots of people in a very short time .
nothing wrong with communication just because these conferences do n't produce results , does n't mean they are n't valuable , weidenfeld told deutsche welle and points to an important , but often neglected aspect of the nature of politics .
" you have to realize that politics is also about communication , " he says .
" everything is perception .
how do the other actors perceive the reality and the problems .
what do the others think that i am thinking and what is their reaction to my way of thinking about a problem .
i think this is the positive aspect of these kind of activities . "
while chrobog and weidenfeld argue that private gatherings like the ones in davos and munich have a place in the political calendar , they both feel that with many new venues springing up all the time , the conference circuit has gotten very crowded and events have become too big and similar in nature .
the biggest danger for the conferences however , stems not from the meetings themselves , but from the expectations of concrete outcomes .
people and the media should n't exaggerate the meaning of those conferences and expect concrete results . " it 's more or less a market place of politics to exchange perceptions " , says weidenfeld .
" it is a certain form of a vanity fair with a great deficit on strategic thinking and real problem solving . "
no problem solving " i think they have a certain importance , but they will not change the world " , says juergen chrobog who currently heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt .
" they never helped me to solve a problem , to be very frank . "

as the munich international security conference gets underway , we ask two experts just how important these meetings really are . it 's the same procedure every january .
the year is barely a few weeks old and a massive stream of business travelers from all over the world is already en route to europe .
the main destinations for thousands of political leaders and executives are davos and munich .
in the swiss mountains the world economic forum , as it regularly does , this year attracted more than 2000 delegates . munich 's security conference traditionally taking place this week usually attracts around 300 participants .
but that 's not all .
add to those long established venues this year 's new global zero summit with its focus on nuclear disarmament held in paris squeezed in the few remaining days between davos and munich and the dld conference on digital innovation in munich right before the world economic forum and you can appreciate why a good travel consultant is necessary for the many people participating in more than one conference .
while the meetings in davos and munich by now have a long history , they are criticized on a regular basis for what essentially are two contradictory reasons .
one is that at these private gatherings , high-profile figures make decisions behind close doors and thus effectively undermine the work of the legitimate international bodies .
and two , that these meetings are just hyped-up talking shops that have no real significance and therefore are basically superfluous . no threat to un " i would n't share this criticism , " says juergen chrobog , a former state secretary in the german foreign office and ambassador to the us .
" i think the conferences in munich or davos are not meant to solve problems , to lead to certain results . " werner weidenfeld , who served for twelve years as the german government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations and currently directs the munich based think tank center for applied policy research , agrees that conferences such as davos and munich do not undermine the work of united nations and other institutions designated to solving global problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private meetings are no threat to the work of the un , say experts both experts point out that these conferences in no way can or want to rival the formal decision making processes at un level or other official venues .
no politician would skip an important un meeting because of these private conferences .
major decisions , the experts argue , are prepared long before important global meetings and concluded at these meetings .
what about the claim then that these private meetings are essentially much ado about nothing ?
chrobog , who declares jokingly that he himself has not only attended many , but too many of these conferences and has limited his participation in recent years , nevertheless believes that this meetings do serve an important function .
" it 's simply for people to get together and have a free exchange of views and to allow them develop their own ideas , " he says .
" that 's very important .
people have to meet , they have to get together , they have to build networks . "
events like davos and munich are attractive because they make it easy to do exactly that participants can meet lots of people in a very short time .
nothing wrong with communication just because these conferences do n't produce results , does n't mean they are n't valuable , weidenfeld told deutsche welle and points to an important , but often neglected aspect of the nature of politics .
" you have to realize that politics is also about communication , " he says .
" everything is perception .
how do the other actors perceive the reality and the problems .
what do the others think that i am thinking and what is their reaction to my way of thinking about a problem .
i think this is the positive aspect of these kind of activities . "
while chrobog and weidenfeld argue that private gatherings like the ones in davos and munich have a place in the political calendar , they both feel that with many new venues springing up all the time , the conference circuit has gotten very crowded and events have become too big and similar in nature .
the biggest danger for the conferences however , stems not from the meetings themselves , but from the expectations of concrete outcomes .
people and the media should n't exaggerate the meaning of those conferences and expect concrete results . " it 's more or less a market place of politics to exchange perceptions " , says weidenfeld .
" it is a certain form of a vanity fair with a great deficit on strategic thinking and real problem solving . "
no problem solving " i think they have a certain importance , but they will not change the world " , says juergen chrobog who currently heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt .
" they never helped me to solve a problem , to be very frank . "
but , he adds , some of the people he met at conferences did actually help him to solve problems later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicholas sarkozy did n't mince words last year in munich asked about how he personally benefitted from these conferences , werner weidenfeld tells an anecdote about last year 's security conference in munich involving french president nicolas sarkozy .

twice as much money as had been thought could be hidden in swiss accounts , as bank documents come to light . a controversial investigation into german tax-evaders with swiss bank accounts could yield more money for the taxman than had been thought , according to german daily newspaper suddeutsche zeitung . some 200 million euros in recouped taxes could be raised , sueddeutsche zeitung journalist hans leyendecker told public television channel ard on wednesday evening .
the probe comes after the german government bought a cd containing details of about 1,500 alleged tax dodgers .
the figure is twice the amount previously estimated . internal documents from the bank credit suisse reveal that the extent of tax evasion might go further than had been thought , according to the newpaper report .
the majority of its german customers might have hidden their money , the bank document is reported to have said , with many eager to have as little contact with bank as possible , to avoid detection . give it up german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has asked tax dodgers to turn themselves in following berlin 's decision to pay a whistle-blower for a list of alleged suspects who have stashed money in switzerland . " i can only advise anyone who thinks he may have evaded taxes in the past to use the provisions in our tax code to declare it voluntarily , " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the augsburger allgemeine daily in an interview . the german government agreed to pay a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.5 million -rrb- to an informer for the list of those alleged to be hiding money in secret accounts . a handful of other european countries have lined up behind germany , with the netherlands , belgium and austria having all reportedly expressed interest in obtaining a copy of the latest cd .

" here we have a new form of bank robbery , " swiss lawmaker pirmin bischof told germany 's deutschlandfunk radio .
" before , you had to go to the bank and get hold of the money with a weapon .
today you can do it electronically by stealing data . ” but schaeuble has said that the government would be legally justified in buying the stolen data .
chancellor angela merkel said on monday she was in favor of acquiring the cd . " in principle , the decision was made two years ago , " schaeuble told the augsburger allgemeine newspaper , referring to a similar case in 2007 , when the government handed over as much as five million euros for stolen tax data from liechtenstein . party divided controversy over the cd has led to a row developing within merkel ’ s christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the party 's economic affairs council has spoken out against the move .

in december , the first connections between the capital kampala and the global broadband network went live , thanks to a submarine fiber-optic cable that links to broadband networks in india and europe .
since then , the east african nation has been in an e-frenzy as excited locals begin exploring all that the web has to offer , from downloading music to watching films online .
many ugandans are euphoric , but for some the new cable offers fresh disappointments : a lack of telephone cables means high speed internet will remain out of reach for most ugandans .
for those already hooked up , however , the 17,000-kilometer -lrb- 10,563 mile -rrb- long broadband cable – known as the seacom – is a boon .
grace natabaalo , a web designer who works for the online department of the ugandan newspaper monitor , is one of the seacom 's latest converts .
she realizes that uganda is no where near european speed , but compared the cable makes the internet lightning quick compared to how it used to be .
as if to demonstrate , she clicks on a video clip on her screen ; within seconds , the clip is downloaded .
“ back then , you would download something overnight , leave the computer on and find it downloaded in the morning , after twelve hours of downloading … you could never watch this ! ”
since gaining access to the higher speed internet , natabaalo 's newspaper relaunched its website , which now incorporates previously unheard-of features like picture galleries and a video section .
bildunterschrift : the seacom cable is slowly working its way through africa opening uganda to the world though the seacom cable was officially launched in east africa mid-2009 , broadband access has only begun to trickle through to uganda over the past few weeks .
the new connection allows a much faster data transfer of 200 kilobytes per second , allowing an increasing number of ugandans to take advantage of the features natabaalo and her colleagues have already discovered .
for constantine bitwayiki , the improved web access is cause for celebration .
bitwayiki , the ugandan president 's advisor on internet issues , has big ideas about ways the new technology could be harnessed to overhaul administrative procedures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed internet will give ugandan children access to the world bitwayiki believes that greater internet use in government and private firms could be used to improve efficiency and even tackle corruption .
high speed internet could also prove invaluable for ordinary ugandans when it comes to basic tasks like getting a driving permit , which for many involves traveling long distances to the capital .
“ i 'd just need to do some basic form-filling online , if i have to pay then i go to the nearest bank and i pay , if -lsb- a picture is needed -rsb- then i send a picture online , and then my driving permit is delivered . ”
ugandan minister for trade and industry kahinda otafire is equally optimistic .
he hopes the improved connections may also entice foreign investors into the country .
otafire 's vision for uganda is one of an outsourcing hub for the rest of the world .
“ the best english is spoken in east africa , and particularly in uganda , ” he said .
“ we 've got a lot of educated people ; we 've got a lot of trained manpower , so i do n't see why we do n't engage in outsourcing and getting in touch with the rest of the world . ”
infrastructure holds things back but not everyone is convinced .
so far , only government departments , the university of kampala and some major companies , like the newspaper monitor , are connected to broadband .
the rest of the country must make do with a far slower connection , and for most ugandans , internet cafés remain the only way to get online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait for the internet continues for many ugandans daniel biranda , planning director at the university of kampala 's computer sciences faculty , does not expect big changes in the near future .
“ you know , people are talking about the internet .
they are excited .
but they do n't know the technology . ”
in the early 1990s , biranda became the first ugandan to program a ugandan website .
today , he is looking for ways to connect villages outside the capital to the high-speed broad band cable and he says the key missing ingredient is the humble telephone cable .
“ in , say , stuttgart , every building -lsb- can have -rsb- internet , simply because there is a telephone line .
but the buildings we have in town , they have electricity , but they do n't have telephone lines . ”
because of that , the cost of connecting to the broadband network is expensive , and could easily outweigh the financial opportunities offered by a higher-speed connection , biranda said .
“ will that internet café generate something like the $ 3000 in a month -lsb- to cover the costs -rsb- ?
it ca n't . ”
there is a simple explanation for all of this .
in uganda , as in many developing countries , there has never been an extensive net of landline phones .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 04.02.2010 nato defense ministers consider sending more trainers to afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop levels will remain on the agenda at the meeting member states have made available nearly all the extra combat troops requested by nato for afghanistan .
the alliance 's head said he will now push defense ministers for more trainers . nato defense ministers on wednesday began two day of talks in istanbul that will touch on restructuring the alliance , troop levels in kosovo and the ongoing united nations-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in afghanistan .
while many of the involved countries have provided more combat troops , fulfilling a target set by isaf 's commander , us general stanley mcchrystal , it does n't mean there wo n't be calls for more .
" allies and partners have made significant contributions , but it is n't yet sufficient , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen told a news briefing on monday .
he said more contributions may be needed , especially in the area of police and military training .
" this training mission is of utmost importance to accomplish the strategy we all agree on , " he said .
" the more we invest in this transition now , the sooner the day when the afghans can take responsibility themselves . "
thousands more needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has already begun shifting its focus in afghanistan to police training according to rasmussen , nato needs 21 more army training teams and more than 100 police training teams if they are to get afghan forces up to the levels currently required .
each police training team consists of 20 to 30 trainers .
officials say the police training is difficult .
like more than half of afghans , many police recruits can not read and must spend months in the classroom learning to read well enough to understand drivers licenses and identity papers before they begin their eight-week police course .
the european union has promised to send 400 police trainers .
but european police must volunteer to be sent to afghanistan , and only about 240 have done so - apparently due to safety concerns .
troop reductions in kosovo on thursday night the defense ministers are set to discuss spending and streamlining nato 's structures .
the talks on afghanistan are scheduled for friday morning , with mcchrystal to attend along with the non-nato members taking part in isaf , outgoing un special envoy in kabul kai eide and eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton .
also on the agenda for friday is kosovo .
on monday it was decided to reduce troops there to 10,200 , and the ministers are set to confirm those numbers will drop even further , to 5,700 , by the end of the year if the region remains calm. hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in december , the first connections between the capital kampala and the global broadband network went live , thanks to a submarine fiber-optic cable that links to broadband networks in india and europe .
since then , the east african nation has been in an e-frenzy as excited locals begin exploring all that the web has to offer , from downloading music to watching films online .
many ugandans are euphoric , but for some the new cable offers fresh disappointments : a lack of telephone cables means high speed internet will remain out of reach for most ugandans .
for those already hooked up , however , the 17,000-kilometer -lrb- 10,563 mile -rrb- long broadband cable – known as the seacom – is a boon .
grace natabaalo , a web designer who works for the online department of the ugandan newspaper monitor , is one of the seacom 's latest converts .
she realizes that uganda is no where near european speed , but compared the cable makes the internet lightning quick compared to how it used to be .
as if to demonstrate , she clicks on a video clip on her screen ; within seconds , the clip is downloaded .
“ back then , you would download something overnight , leave the computer on and find it downloaded in the morning , after twelve hours of downloading … you could never watch this ! ”
since gaining access to the higher speed internet , natabaalo 's newspaper relaunched its website , which now incorporates previously unheard-of features like picture galleries and a video section .
bildunterschrift : the seacom cable is slowly working its way through africa opening uganda to the world though the seacom cable was officially launched in east africa mid-2009 , broadband access has only begun to trickle through to uganda over the past few weeks .
the new connection allows a much faster data transfer of 200 kilobytes per second , allowing an increasing number of ugandans to take advantage of the features natabaalo and her colleagues have already discovered .
for constantine bitwayiki , the improved web access is cause for celebration .
bitwayiki , the ugandan president 's advisor on internet issues , has big ideas about ways the new technology could be harnessed to overhaul administrative procedures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed internet will give ugandan children access to the world bitwayiki believes that greater internet use in government and private firms could be used to improve efficiency and even tackle corruption .
high speed internet could also prove invaluable for ordinary ugandans when it comes to basic tasks like getting a driving permit , which for many involves traveling long distances to the capital .
“ i 'd just need to do some basic form-filling online , if i have to pay then i go to the nearest bank and i pay , if -lsb- a picture is needed -rsb- then i send a picture online , and then my driving permit is delivered . ”
ugandan minister for trade and industry kahinda otafire is equally optimistic .
he hopes the improved connections may also entice foreign investors into the country .
otafire 's vision for uganda is one of an outsourcing hub for the rest of the world .
“ the best english is spoken in east africa , and particularly in uganda , ” he said .
“ we 've got a lot of educated people ; we 've got a lot of trained manpower , so i do n't see why we do n't engage in outsourcing and getting in touch with the rest of the world . ”
infrastructure holds things back but not everyone is convinced .
so far , only government departments , the university of kampala and some major companies , like the newspaper monitor , are connected to broadband .
the rest of the country must make do with a far slower connection , and for most ugandans , internet cafés remain the only way to get online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait for the internet continues for many ugandans daniel biranda , planning director at the university of kampala 's computer sciences faculty , does not expect big changes in the near future .
“ you know , people are talking about the internet .
they are excited .
but they do n't know the technology . ”
in the early 1990s , biranda became the first ugandan to program a ugandan website .
today , he is looking for ways to connect villages outside the capital to the high-speed broad band cable and he says the key missing ingredient is the humble telephone cable .
“ in , say , stuttgart , every building -lsb- can have -rsb- internet , simply because there is a telephone line .
but the buildings we have in town , they have electricity , but they do n't have telephone lines . ”
because of that , the cost of connecting to the broadband network is expensive , and could easily outweigh the financial opportunities offered by a higher-speed connection , biranda said .
“ will that internet café generate something like the $ 3000 in a month -lsb- to cover the costs -rsb- ?
it ca n't . ”
there is a simple explanation for all of this .
in uganda , as in many developing countries , there has never been an extensive net of landline phones .
they simply skipped that step and went right to mobile phones .
and beyond the capital , little infrastructure exists already that could be used to easily set up internet connections .
this means that for the majority of ugandans , high speed internet access at home may not be a reality for years to come .

as the munich international security conference gets underway , we ask two experts just how important these meetings really are . it 's the same procedure every january .
the year is barely a few weeks old and a massive stream of business travelers from all over the world is already en route to europe .
the main destinations for thousands of political leaders and executives are davos and munich .
in the swiss mountains the world economic forum , as it regularly does , this year attracted more than 2000 delegates . munich 's security conference traditionally taking place this week usually attracts around 300 participants .
but that 's not all .
add to those long established venues this year 's new global zero summit with its focus on nuclear disarmament held in paris squeezed in the few remaining days between davos and munich and the dld conference on digital innovation in munich right before the world economic forum and you can appreciate why a good travel consultant is necessary for the many people participating in more than one conference .
while the meetings in davos and munich by now have a long history , they are criticized on a regular basis for what essentially are two contradictory reasons .
one is that at these private gatherings , high-profile figures make decisions behind close doors and thus effectively undermine the work of the legitimate international bodies .
and two , that these meetings are just hyped-up talking shops that have no real significance and therefore are basically superfluous . no threat to un " i would n't share this criticism , " says juergen chrobog , a former state secretary in the german foreign office and ambassador to the us .
" i think the conferences in munich or davos are not meant to solve problems , to lead to certain results . " werner weidenfeld , who served for twelve years as the german government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations and currently directs the munich based think tank center for applied policy research , agrees that conferences such as davos and munich do not undermine the work of united nations and other institutions designated to solving global problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private meetings are no threat to the work of the un , say experts both experts point out that these conferences in no way can or want to rival the formal decision making processes at un level or other official venues .
no politician would skip an important un meeting because of these private conferences .
major decisions , the experts argue , are prepared long before important global meetings and concluded at these meetings .
what about the claim then that these private meetings are essentially much ado about nothing ?
chrobog , who declares jokingly that he himself has not only attended many , but too many of these conferences and has limited his participation in recent years , nevertheless believes that this meetings do serve an important function .
" it 's simply for people to get together and have a free exchange of views and to allow them develop their own ideas , " he says .
" that 's very important .
people have to meet , they have to get together , they have to build networks . "
events like davos and munich are attractive because they make it easy to do exactly that participants can meet lots of people in a very short time .
nothing wrong with communication just because these conferences do n't produce results , does n't mean they are n't valuable , weidenfeld told deutsche welle and points to an important , but often neglected aspect of the nature of politics .
" you have to realize that politics is also about communication , " he says .
" everything is perception .
how do the other actors perceive the reality and the problems .
what do the others think that i am thinking and what is their reaction to my way of thinking about a problem .
i think this is the positive aspect of these kind of activities . "
while chrobog and weidenfeld argue that private gatherings like the ones in davos and munich have a place in the political calendar , they both feel that with many new venues springing up all the time , the conference circuit has gotten very crowded and events have become too big and similar in nature .
the biggest danger for the conferences however , stems not from the meetings themselves , but from the expectations of concrete outcomes .
people and the media should n't exaggerate the meaning of those conferences and expect concrete results . " it 's more or less a market place of politics to exchange perceptions " , says weidenfeld .
" it is a certain form of a vanity fair with a great deficit on strategic thinking and real problem solving . "
no problem solving " i think they have a certain importance , but they will not change the world " , says juergen chrobog who currently heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt .
" they never helped me to solve a problem , to be very frank . "
but , he adds , some of the people he met at conferences did actually help him to solve problems later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicholas sarkozy did n't mince words last year in munich asked about how he personally benefitted from these conferences , werner weidenfeld tells an anecdote about last year 's security conference in munich involving french president nicolas sarkozy .
the president had just delivered a very tough speech that stood out from the previous soft addresses given by other leaders .
" then there was a coffee break and i observed that none of the other top politicians from america , from germany or elsewhere talked to president sarkozy .
he stood alone in the corner , nobody talked to him , because his speech had been too tough in their mind .
then i myself went to him and talked to him and he was so grateful that he almost tried to kiss me .
so i learned first hand that sarkozy does n't only have friends in international politics . "

in december , the first connections between the capital kampala and the global broadband network went live , thanks to a submarine fiber-optic cable that links to broadband networks in india and europe .
since then , the east african nation has been in an e-frenzy as excited locals begin exploring all that the web has to offer , from downloading music to watching films online .
many ugandans are euphoric , but for some the new cable offers fresh disappointments : a lack of telephone cables means high speed internet will remain out of reach for most ugandans .
for those already hooked up , however , the 17,000-kilometer -lrb- 10,563 mile -rrb- long broadband cable – known as the seacom – is a boon .
grace natabaalo , a web designer who works for the online department of the ugandan newspaper monitor , is one of the seacom 's latest converts .
she realizes that uganda is no where near european speed , but compared the cable makes the internet lightning quick compared to how it used to be .
as if to demonstrate , she clicks on a video clip on her screen ; within seconds , the clip is downloaded .
“ back then , you would download something overnight , leave the computer on and find it downloaded in the morning , after twelve hours of downloading … you could never watch this ! ”
since gaining access to the higher speed internet , natabaalo 's newspaper relaunched its website , which now incorporates previously unheard-of features like picture galleries and a video section .
bildunterschrift : the seacom cable is slowly working its way through africa opening uganda to the world though the seacom cable was officially launched in east africa mid-2009 , broadband access has only begun to trickle through to uganda over the past few weeks .
the new connection allows a much faster data transfer of 200 kilobytes per second , allowing an increasing number of ugandans to take advantage of the features natabaalo and her colleagues have already discovered .
for constantine bitwayiki , the improved web access is cause for celebration .
bitwayiki , the ugandan president 's advisor on internet issues , has big ideas about ways the new technology could be harnessed to overhaul administrative procedures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed internet will give ugandan children access to the world bitwayiki believes that greater internet use in government and private firms could be used to improve efficiency and even tackle corruption .
high speed internet could also prove invaluable for ordinary ugandans when it comes to basic tasks like getting a driving permit , which for many involves traveling long distances to the capital .
“ i 'd just need to do some basic form-filling online , if i have to pay then i go to the nearest bank and i pay , if -lsb- a picture is needed -rsb- then i send a picture online , and then my driving permit is delivered . ”
ugandan minister for trade and industry kahinda otafire is equally optimistic .
he hopes the improved connections may also entice foreign investors into the country .
otafire 's vision for uganda is one of an outsourcing hub for the rest of the world .
“ the best english is spoken in east africa , and particularly in uganda , ” he said .
“ we 've got a lot of educated people ; we 've got a lot of trained manpower , so i do n't see why we do n't engage in outsourcing and getting in touch with the rest of the world . ”
infrastructure holds things back but not everyone is convinced .
so far , only government departments , the university of kampala and some major companies , like the newspaper monitor , are connected to broadband .
the rest of the country must make do with a far slower connection , and for most ugandans , internet cafés remain the only way to get online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait for the internet continues for many ugandans daniel biranda , planning director at the university of kampala 's computer sciences faculty , does not expect big changes in the near future .
“ you know , people are talking about the internet .
they are excited .
but they do n't know the technology . ”
in the early 1990s , biranda became the first ugandan to program a ugandan website .
today , he is looking for ways to connect villages outside the capital to the high-speed broad band cable and he says the key missing ingredient is the humble telephone cable .
“ in , say , stuttgart , every building -lsb- can have -rsb- internet , simply because there is a telephone line .
but the buildings we have in town , they have electricity , but they do n't have telephone lines . ”
because of that , the cost of connecting to the broadband network is expensive , and could easily outweigh the financial opportunities offered by a higher-speed connection , biranda said .
“ will that internet café generate something like the $ 3000 in a month -lsb- to cover the costs -rsb- ?
it ca n't . ”
there is a simple explanation for all of this .
in uganda , as in many developing countries , there has never been an extensive net of landline phones .
they simply skipped that step and went right to mobile phones .
and beyond the capital , little infrastructure exists already that could be used to easily set up internet connections .
this means that for the majority of ugandans , high speed internet access at home may not be a reality for years to come .

he 'll soon head to his native germany to serve as president of the jury for the berlinale - where he 'll watch far more films than he 's used to . herzog claims that he normally only watches two to three films per year .
he made this surprising statement shortly after being announced jury president of the 2010 berlinale .
but how could someone who so rarely sets foot in a movie theater end up in this position ?
and why does he pass on seeing so many movies ?
probably because he is very busy making them himself . at home in america werner herzog lives in los angeles , where he churns out one film after another .
but just a few years ago , no one would have expected him to ever get this far .
after all , his counterparts - german filmmakers wim wenders and volker schloendorff - gave up on their hollywood careers a long time ago and have since returned to their homeland . munich-born herzog , on the other hand , has taken a step forward in his career and now makes big-budget movies in the us , working with a-list stars like christian bale and nicolas cage .
herzog has never been a stranger to success , though ; he is credited with injecting new spirit into german cinema with his first films in the late 1960s . bildunterschrift : herzog 's " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " stars nicolas cage after that he relocated five times with his favorite actor , klaus kinski , in order to tackle daring film projects in places like south america .
his film " fitzcarraldo " has been made the subject of various books and documentaries , and his 1979 film " nosferatu the vampyre " has been hailed as one of the greatest achievements of new german cinema . following these cinematic conquests , herzog temporarily withdrew from the big screen , perhaps partly due to the death of klaus kinski .
over the next few years , he produced unconventional documentaries and staged operas . it was n't until just a few years ago that herzog claimed a real foothold in the us .
this is not a well-known fact in germany , though - maybe because some of herzog 's american-made films did not make it into german cinemas . " i never forgot about germany , " said herzog at one stage .
" but - i do n't know why - germany forgot about me . " he has repeatedly emphasized how close he still feels to his homeland : " i have left my country and live in los angeles today .
and i make films in antarctica , in south america , in the usa .
but despite this i have never abandoned my culture . " herzog 's americana based on true events , herzog 's 2007 film " rescue dawn " tells the story of a us soldier with a german background who is shot down and imprisoned in laos during the vietnam war .
then there are also his more recent american films - " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " and " my son , my son , what have ye done " - both of which premiered at the 2009 venice film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog 's favorite actor , klaus kinski , worked with him on several films whoever has had the chance to meet werner herzog at a film festival or to interview him , knows that this filmmaker is also a great entertainer .
he likes to surprise people , is keen to go against the grain , and does not like to be categorized . the audience at the 2010 berlinale festival should also be prepared for surprises when the awards are handed out on february 20 under werner herzog 's presiding eye . the berlinale runs from february 11-21 . author : jochen kuerten -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the alliance 's head said he will now push defense ministers for more trainers . nato defense ministers on wednesday began two day of talks in istanbul that will touch on restructuring the alliance , troop levels in kosovo and the ongoing united nations-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in afghanistan .
while many of the involved countries have provided more combat troops , fulfilling a target set by isaf 's commander , us general stanley mcchrystal , it does n't mean there wo n't be calls for more .
" allies and partners have made significant contributions , but it is n't yet sufficient , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen told a news briefing on monday .
he said more contributions may be needed , especially in the area of police and military training .
" this training mission is of utmost importance to accomplish the strategy we all agree on , " he said .
" the more we invest in this transition now , the sooner the day when the afghans can take responsibility themselves . "
thousands more needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has already begun shifting its focus in afghanistan to police training according to rasmussen , nato needs 21 more army training teams and more than 100 police training teams if they are to get afghan forces up to the levels currently required .
each police training team consists of 20 to 30 trainers .
officials say the police training is difficult .
like more than half of afghans , many police recruits can not read and must spend months in the classroom learning to read well enough to understand drivers licenses and identity papers before they begin their eight-week police course .
the european union has promised to send 400 police trainers .
but european police must volunteer to be sent to afghanistan , and only about 240 have done so - apparently due to safety concerns .
troop reductions in kosovo on thursday night the defense ministers are set to discuss spending and streamlining nato 's structures .
the talks on afghanistan are scheduled for friday morning , with mcchrystal to attend along with the non-nato members taking part in isaf , outgoing un special envoy in kabul kai eide and eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton .
also on the agenda for friday is kosovo .
on monday it was decided to reduce troops there to 10,200 , and the ministers are set to confirm those numbers will drop even further , to 5,700 , by the end of the year if the region remains calm. hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

twice as much money as had been thought could be hidden in swiss accounts , as bank documents come to light . a controversial investigation into german tax-evaders with swiss bank accounts could yield more money for the taxman than had been thought , according to german daily newspaper suddeutsche zeitung . some 200 million euros in recouped taxes could be raised , sueddeutsche zeitung journalist hans leyendecker told public television channel ard on wednesday evening .
the probe comes after the german government bought a cd containing details of about 1,500 alleged tax dodgers .
the figure is twice the amount previously estimated . internal documents from the bank credit suisse reveal that the extent of tax evasion might go further than had been thought , according to the newpaper report .
the majority of its german customers might have hidden their money , the bank document is reported to have said , with many eager to have as little contact with bank as possible , to avoid detection . give it up german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has asked tax dodgers to turn themselves in following berlin 's decision to pay a whistle-blower for a list of alleged suspects who have stashed money in switzerland . " i can only advise anyone who thinks he may have evaded taxes in the past to use the provisions in our tax code to declare it voluntarily , " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the augsburger allgemeine daily in an interview . the german government agreed to pay a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.5 million -rrb- to an informer for the list of those alleged to be hiding money in secret accounts . a handful of other european countries have lined up behind germany , with the netherlands , belgium and austria having all reportedly expressed interest in obtaining a copy of the latest cd . " should there be evidence that the cd -lsb- with the stolen bank data -rsb- contains information on austrian taxpayers , we would naturally have great interest in analyzing those , " a spokesman for austrian finance minister josef proell was quoted as saying to der standard newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeuble appealed to suspected tax evaders a dutch finance ministry spokesman said the netherlands , where deputy finance minister jan kees de jager is pushing through a crackdown on tax-dodgers , told berlin he would be interested in having any data on dutch taxpayers , news agency reuters reported . liechtenstein precedent the affair has soured relations between germany and its alpine neighbor , which sees the purchasing of the disc as another attack on its cherished banking secrecy . " here we have a new form of bank robbery , " swiss lawmaker pirmin bischof told germany 's deutschlandfunk radio .
" before , you had to go to the bank and get hold of the money with a weapon .
today you can do it electronically by stealing data . ” but schaeuble has said that the government would be legally justified in buying the stolen data .
chancellor angela merkel said on monday she was in favor of acquiring the cd . " in principle , the decision was made two years ago , " schaeuble told the augsburger allgemeine newspaper , referring to a similar case in 2007 , when the government handed over as much as five million euros for stolen tax data from liechtenstein . party divided controversy over the cd has led to a row developing within merkel ’ s christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the party 's economic affairs council has spoken out against the move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants to be tough on tax evaders " the state is obliged to use all legal means to arrest the man who has stolen the data , " council chairman kurt lauk told tuesday 's edition of the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper . the deputy leader of the cdu 's parliamentary faction , guenter krings , urged his superiors to proceed with caution .
" it would be good if we got the data and could get at those tax evaders , " he told the koelner stadt-anzeiger . but krings insisted that to cooperate with criminals should remain an absolute exception .
" if we start setting this example , there is a huge risk that criminals double their money . "
siegfried kauder , chairman of the german parliament 's judiciary committee , and also a member of the cdu , advised against a deal .

twice as much money as had been thought could be hidden in swiss accounts , as bank documents come to light . a controversial investigation into german tax-evaders with swiss bank accounts could yield more money for the taxman than had been thought , according to german daily newspaper suddeutsche zeitung . some 200 million euros in recouped taxes could be raised , sueddeutsche zeitung journalist hans leyendecker told public television channel ard on wednesday evening .
the probe comes after the german government bought a cd containing details of about 1,500 alleged tax dodgers .
the figure is twice the amount previously estimated . internal documents from the bank credit suisse reveal that the extent of tax evasion might go further than had been thought , according to the newpaper report .
the majority of its german customers might have hidden their money , the bank document is reported to have said , with many eager to have as little contact with bank as possible , to avoid detection . give it up german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has asked tax dodgers to turn themselves in following berlin 's decision to pay a whistle-blower for a list of alleged suspects who have stashed money in switzerland . " i can only advise anyone who thinks he may have evaded taxes in the past to use the provisions in our tax code to declare it voluntarily , " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the augsburger allgemeine daily in an interview . the german government agreed to pay a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.5 million -rrb- to an informer for the list of those alleged to be hiding money in secret accounts . a handful of other european countries have lined up behind germany , with the netherlands , belgium and austria having all reportedly expressed interest in obtaining a copy of the latest cd . " should there be evidence that the cd -lsb- with the stolen bank data -rsb- contains information on austrian taxpayers , we would naturally have great interest in analyzing those , " a spokesman for austrian finance minister josef proell was quoted as saying to der standard newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeuble appealed to suspected tax evaders a dutch finance ministry spokesman said the netherlands , where deputy finance minister jan kees de jager is pushing through a crackdown on tax-dodgers , told berlin he would be interested in having any data on dutch taxpayers , news agency reuters reported . liechtenstein precedent the affair has soured relations between germany and its alpine neighbor , which sees the purchasing of the disc as another attack on its cherished banking secrecy . " here we have a new form of bank robbery , " swiss lawmaker pirmin bischof told germany 's deutschlandfunk radio .
" before , you had to go to the bank and get hold of the money with a weapon .
today you can do it electronically by stealing data . ” but schaeuble has said that the government would be legally justified in buying the stolen data .
chancellor angela merkel said on monday she was in favor of acquiring the cd . " in principle , the decision was made two years ago , " schaeuble told the augsburger allgemeine newspaper , referring to a similar case in 2007 , when the government handed over as much as five million euros for stolen tax data from liechtenstein . party divided controversy over the cd has led to a row developing within merkel ’ s christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the party 's economic affairs council has spoken out against the move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants to be tough on tax evaders " the state is obliged to use all legal means to arrest the man who has stolen the data , " council chairman kurt lauk told tuesday 's edition of the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper . the deputy leader of the cdu 's parliamentary faction , guenter krings , urged his superiors to proceed with caution .
" it would be good if we got the data and could get at those tax evaders , " he told the koelner stadt-anzeiger . but krings insisted that to cooperate with criminals should remain an absolute exception .
" if we start setting this example , there is a huge risk that criminals double their money . "
siegfried kauder , chairman of the german parliament 's judiciary committee , and also a member of the cdu , advised against a deal .
" we 're sending data thieves a message : if you steal , we 'll buy it off you , " he said . rc / dfm / bk / rb / dpa / apn / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the president had just delivered a very tough speech that stood out from the previous soft addresses given by other leaders .
" then there was a coffee break and i observed that none of the other top politicians from america , from germany or elsewhere talked to president sarkozy .
he stood alone in the corner , nobody talked to him , because his speech had been too tough in their mind .
then i myself went to him and talked to him and he was so grateful that he almost tried to kiss me .
so i learned first hand that sarkozy does n't only have friends in international politics . "

as the munich international security conference gets underway , we ask two experts just how important these meetings really are . it 's the same procedure every january .
the year is barely a few weeks old and a massive stream of business travelers from all over the world is already en route to europe .
the main destinations for thousands of political leaders and executives are davos and munich .
in the swiss mountains the world economic forum , as it regularly does , this year attracted more than 2000 delegates . munich 's security conference traditionally taking place this week usually attracts around 300 participants .
but that 's not all .
add to those long established venues this year 's new global zero summit with its focus on nuclear disarmament held in paris squeezed in the few remaining days between davos and munich and the dld conference on digital innovation in munich right before the world economic forum and you can appreciate why a good travel consultant is necessary for the many people participating in more than one conference .
while the meetings in davos and munich by now have a long history , they are criticized on a regular basis for what essentially are two contradictory reasons .
one is that at these private gatherings , high-profile figures make decisions behind close doors and thus effectively undermine the work of the legitimate international bodies .
and two , that these meetings are just hyped-up talking shops that have no real significance and therefore are basically superfluous . no threat to un " i would n't share this criticism , " says juergen chrobog , a former state secretary in the german foreign office and ambassador to the us .
" i think the conferences in munich or davos are not meant to solve problems , to lead to certain results . " werner weidenfeld , who served for twelve years as the german government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations and currently directs the munich based think tank center for applied policy research , agrees that conferences such as davos and munich do not undermine the work of united nations and other institutions designated to solving global problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private meetings are no threat to the work of the un , say experts both experts point out that these conferences in no way can or want to rival the formal decision making processes at un level or other official venues .
no politician would skip an important un meeting because of these private conferences .
major decisions , the experts argue , are prepared long before important global meetings and concluded at these meetings .
what about the claim then that these private meetings are essentially much ado about nothing ?
chrobog , who declares jokingly that he himself has not only attended many , but too many of these conferences and has limited his participation in recent years , nevertheless believes that this meetings do serve an important function .
" it 's simply for people to get together and have a free exchange of views and to allow them develop their own ideas , " he says .
" that 's very important .
people have to meet , they have to get together , they have to build networks . "
events like davos and munich are attractive because they make it easy to do exactly that participants can meet lots of people in a very short time .
nothing wrong with communication just because these conferences do n't produce results , does n't mean they are n't valuable , weidenfeld told deutsche welle and points to an important , but often neglected aspect of the nature of politics .
" you have to realize that politics is also about communication , " he says .
" everything is perception .
how do the other actors perceive the reality and the problems .
what do the others think that i am thinking and what is their reaction to my way of thinking about a problem .
i think this is the positive aspect of these kind of activities . "
while chrobog and weidenfeld argue that private gatherings like the ones in davos and munich have a place in the political calendar , they both feel that with many new venues springing up all the time , the conference circuit has gotten very crowded and events have become too big and similar in nature .
the biggest danger for the conferences however , stems not from the meetings themselves , but from the expectations of concrete outcomes .
people and the media should n't exaggerate the meaning of those conferences and expect concrete results . " it 's more or less a market place of politics to exchange perceptions " , says weidenfeld .
" it is a certain form of a vanity fair with a great deficit on strategic thinking and real problem solving . "
no problem solving " i think they have a certain importance , but they will not change the world " , says juergen chrobog who currently heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt .
" they never helped me to solve a problem , to be very frank . "
but , he adds , some of the people he met at conferences did actually help him to solve problems later .

as the munich international security conference gets underway , we ask two experts just how important these meetings really are . it 's the same procedure every january .
the year is barely a few weeks old and a massive stream of business travelers from all over the world is already en route to europe .
the main destinations for thousands of political leaders and executives are davos and munich .

add to those long established venues this year 's new global zero summit with its focus on nuclear disarmament held in paris squeezed in the few remaining days between davos and munich and the dld conference on digital innovation in munich right before the world economic forum and you can appreciate why a good travel consultant is necessary for the many people participating in more than one conference .
while the meetings in davos and munich by now have a long history , they are criticized on a regular basis for what essentially are two contradictory reasons .
one is that at these private gatherings , high-profile figures make decisions behind close doors and thus effectively undermine the work of the legitimate international bodies .
and two , that these meetings are just hyped-up talking shops that have no real significance and therefore are basically superfluous . no threat to un " i would n't share this criticism , " says juergen chrobog , a former state secretary in the german foreign office and ambassador to the us .
" i think the conferences in munich or davos are not meant to solve problems , to lead to certain results .

major decisions , the experts argue , are prepared long before important global meetings and concluded at these meetings .
what about the claim then that these private meetings are essentially much ado about nothing ?
chrobog , who declares jokingly that he himself has not only attended many , but too many of these conferences and has limited his participation in recent years , nevertheless believes that this meetings do serve an important function .
" it 's simply for people to get together and have a free exchange of views and to allow them develop their own ideas , " he says .
" that 's very important .
people have to meet , they have to get together , they have to build networks . "
events like davos and munich are attractive because they make it easy to do exactly that participants can meet lots of people in a very short time .
nothing wrong with communication just because these conferences do n't produce results , does n't mean they are n't valuable , weidenfeld told deutsche welle and points to an important , but often neglected aspect of the nature of politics .
" you have to realize that politics is also about communication , " he says .

while chrobog and weidenfeld argue that private gatherings like the ones in davos and munich have a place in the political calendar , they both feel that with many new venues springing up all the time , the conference circuit has gotten very crowded and events have become too big and similar in nature .
the biggest danger for the conferences however , stems not from the meetings themselves , but from the expectations of concrete outcomes .
people and the media should n't exaggerate the meaning of those conferences and expect concrete results . " it 's more or less a market place of politics to exchange perceptions " , says weidenfeld .

twice as much money as had been thought could be hidden in swiss accounts , as bank documents come to light . a controversial investigation into german tax-evaders with swiss bank accounts could yield more money for the taxman than had been thought , according to german daily newspaper suddeutsche zeitung . some 200 million euros in recouped taxes could be raised , sueddeutsche zeitung journalist hans leyendecker told public television channel ard on wednesday evening .
the probe comes after the german government bought a cd containing details of about 1,500 alleged tax dodgers .
the figure is twice the amount previously estimated . internal documents from the bank credit suisse reveal that the extent of tax evasion might go further than had been thought , according to the newpaper report .
the majority of its german customers might have hidden their money , the bank document is reported to have said , with many eager to have as little contact with bank as possible , to avoid detection . give it up german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has asked tax dodgers to turn themselves in following berlin 's decision to pay a whistle-blower for a list of alleged suspects who have stashed money in switzerland . " i can only advise anyone who thinks he may have evaded taxes in the past to use the provisions in our tax code to declare it voluntarily , " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble told the augsburger allgemeine daily in an interview . the german government agreed to pay a reported 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.5 million -rrb- to an informer for the list of those alleged to be hiding money in secret accounts . a handful of other european countries have lined up behind germany , with the netherlands , belgium and austria having all reportedly expressed interest in obtaining a copy of the latest cd . " should there be evidence that the cd -lsb- with the stolen bank data -rsb- contains information on austrian taxpayers , we would naturally have great interest in analyzing those , " a spokesman for austrian finance minister josef proell was quoted as saying to der standard newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeuble appealed to suspected tax evaders a dutch finance ministry spokesman said the netherlands , where deputy finance minister jan kees de jager is pushing through a crackdown on tax-dodgers , told berlin he would be interested in having any data on dutch taxpayers , news agency reuters reported . liechtenstein precedent the affair has soured relations between germany and its alpine neighbor , which sees the purchasing of the disc as another attack on its cherished banking secrecy . " here we have a new form of bank robbery , " swiss lawmaker pirmin bischof told germany 's deutschlandfunk radio .
" before , you had to go to the bank and get hold of the money with a weapon .
today you can do it electronically by stealing data . ” but schaeuble has said that the government would be legally justified in buying the stolen data .
chancellor angela merkel said on monday she was in favor of acquiring the cd . " in principle , the decision was made two years ago , " schaeuble told the augsburger allgemeine newspaper , referring to a similar case in 2007 , when the government handed over as much as five million euros for stolen tax data from liechtenstein . party divided controversy over the cd has led to a row developing within merkel ’ s christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the party 's economic affairs council has spoken out against the move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants to be tough on tax evaders " the state is obliged to use all legal means to arrest the man who has stolen the data , " council chairman kurt lauk told tuesday 's edition of the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper . the deputy leader of the cdu 's parliamentary faction , guenter krings , urged his superiors to proceed with caution .
" it would be good if we got the data and could get at those tax evaders , " he told the koelner stadt-anzeiger . but krings insisted that to cooperate with criminals should remain an absolute exception .
" if we start setting this example , there is a huge risk that criminals double their money . "
siegfried kauder , chairman of the german parliament 's judiciary committee , and also a member of the cdu , advised against a deal .

negotiations are n't set to resume until after the world cup in june . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- has said the fate of national team coach joachim loew will not be decided until after the upcoming world cup in south africa in june .
what looked like it would be a simple contract extension has turned into a power struggle , with loew reportedly asking for a signing-on fee equivalent to a year 's salary .
" basically , both sides are still interested in working together but we were unable to reach agreement on important aspects of a deal , " explained dfb president theo zwanziger after a specially convened board meeting thursday at the organization 's headquarters in frankfurt .
loew 's current contract expires after the next world cup , where germany has been pooled with australia , serbia and ghana .
zwanziger announced last december that a two-year contract extension had been agreed with loew , keeping him at the helm of the national team until after euro 2012 in poland and ukraine .
but that deal was supposed to be approved at thursday 's meeting .
germany team manager oliver bierhoff , who is part of the three-man coaching team renegotiating their contracts , admitted the news was a blow .
" we would have liked to clear up the contract extension details quickly with the world cup fast approaching , but we accept the president 's decision , " he said .
loew was handed the national team reins following a decision by former coach juergen klinsmann not to extend his contract after the last world cup in germany in 2006. dfm / dpa / afp editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the junior coalition partners , the free democratic party , have been condemned in particular as " unfit to govern . " the new german government under chancellor angela merkel could hardly have feared worse reviews on its first 100 days in office .
not a single major newspaper could muster a kind assessment , and some have been merciless .
squabbling , indecisive , and naïve fairly sums up the opinion of most political commentators , and they also agree on who to blame : the free democratic party led by foreign minister and vice chancellor guido westerwelle , the party regarded as the big winners of last september 's election .
" with an election result of more than 14 percent , the fdp suddenly had big hopes to fulfil , " says the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" and they are not up to it yet . "
the successful election campaign seemed to promise that the fdp would establish itself outside its traditional voter base .
but it is " squandering its opportunity permanently , " the paper says .
as for merkel 's christian democratic union , they are desperate " not to be seen as the neo-liberal spectre that the opposition made them out to be before the election . "
the sueddeutsche zeitung uses a botanical metaphor to illustrate its thoughts on the new government .
the national paper likens the constantly squabbling leaders of merkel 's allies - westerwelle and christian social union leader horst seehofer - to the mimosa , a prickly , sensitive plant that closes rapidly when touched or shaken .
" angela merkel is in charge of a mimosa coalition , " the paper concludes .
" we 've seen the husk .
it 's time for the fruit . "
several papers have noted that the last government , a coalition of the center-right cdu and the center-left social democratic party , seemed to function much better , despite being considered at the time as an unworkable marriage of convenience .
as munich tabloid abendzeitung says , " many think back to it with nostalgia . "
the combination of cdu and fdp only seems to work at a state level , the paper argues .
the cologne-based koelnische rundschau also compares this coalition unfavourably to its predecessors , particularly as the cdu and the fdp went into the last election as declared allies .
" the spd / green alliance was unprepared in 1998 , and the cdu and the spd could not bring themselves to trust each other in 2005 , " the paper says , " but the cdu and the fdp do not give the impression that they want to work together . "
" what do the cdu and fdp want ? " the paper asks .
but perhaps the bluntest assessment came from the berliner zeitung , and was aimed specifically at westerwelle 's party : " they ca n't do it .
they are unfit to govern .
angela merkel has brought an unpredictable , chaotic bunch into the cabinet .

the junior coalition partners , the free democratic party , have been condemned in particular as " unfit to govern . " the new german government under chancellor angela merkel could hardly have feared worse reviews on its first 100 days in office .
not a single major newspaper could muster a kind assessment , and some have been merciless .
squabbling , indecisive , and naïve fairly sums up the opinion of most political commentators , and they also agree on who to blame : the free democratic party led by foreign minister and vice chancellor guido westerwelle , the party regarded as the big winners of last september 's election .
" with an election result of more than 14 percent , the fdp suddenly had big hopes to fulfil , " says the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" and they are not up to it yet . "
the successful election campaign seemed to promise that the fdp would establish itself outside its traditional voter base .

many ugandans are euphoric , but for some the new cable offers fresh disappointments : a lack of telephone cables means high speed internet will remain out of reach for most ugandans .
for those already hooked up , however , the 17,000-kilometer -lrb- 10,563 mile -rrb- long broadband cable – known as the seacom – is a boon .

as if to demonstrate , she clicks on a video clip on her screen ; within seconds , the clip is downloaded .
“ back then , you would download something overnight , leave the computer on and find it downloaded in the morning , after twelve hours of downloading … you could never watch this ! ”
since gaining access to the higher speed internet , natabaalo 's newspaper relaunched its website , which now incorporates previously unheard-of features like picture galleries and a video section .
bildunterschrift : the seacom cable is slowly working its way through africa opening uganda to the world though the seacom cable was officially launched in east africa mid-2009 , broadband access has only begun to trickle through to uganda over the past few weeks .
the new connection allows a much faster data transfer of 200 kilobytes per second , allowing an increasing number of ugandans to take advantage of the features natabaalo and her colleagues have already discovered .
for constantine bitwayiki , the improved web access is cause for celebration .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed internet will give ugandan children access to the world bitwayiki believes that greater internet use in government and private firms could be used to improve efficiency and even tackle corruption .
high speed internet could also prove invaluable for ordinary ugandans when it comes to basic tasks like getting a driving permit , which for many involves traveling long distances to the capital .
“ i 'd just need to do some basic form-filling online , if i have to pay then i go to the nearest bank and i pay , if -lsb- a picture is needed -rsb- then i send a picture online , and then my driving permit is delivered . ”

but they do n't know the technology . ”
in the early 1990s , biranda became the first ugandan to program a ugandan website .
today , he is looking for ways to connect villages outside the capital to the high-speed broad band cable and he says the key missing ingredient is the humble telephone cable .
“ in , say , stuttgart , every building -lsb- can have -rsb- internet , simply because there is a telephone line .
but the buildings we have in town , they have electricity , but they do n't have telephone lines . ”
because of that , the cost of connecting to the broadband network is expensive , and could easily outweigh the financial opportunities offered by a higher-speed connection , biranda said .
“ will that internet café generate something like the $ 3000 in a month -lsb- to cover the costs -rsb- ?
it ca n't . ”
there is a simple explanation for all of this .
in uganda , as in many developing countries , there has never been an extensive net of landline phones .
they simply skipped that step and went right to mobile phones .

this means that for the majority of ugandans , high speed internet access at home may not be a reality for years to come .

in december , the first connections between the capital kampala and the global broadband network went live , thanks to a submarine fiber-optic cable that links to broadband networks in india and europe .
since then , the east african nation has been in an e-frenzy as excited locals begin exploring all that the web has to offer , from downloading music to watching films online .
many ugandans are euphoric , but for some the new cable offers fresh disappointments : a lack of telephone cables means high speed internet will remain out of reach for most ugandans .
for those already hooked up , however , the 17,000-kilometer -lrb- 10,563 mile -rrb- long broadband cable – known as the seacom – is a boon .
grace natabaalo , a web designer who works for the online department of the ugandan newspaper monitor , is one of the seacom 's latest converts .
she realizes that uganda is no where near european speed , but compared the cable makes the internet lightning quick compared to how it used to be .
as if to demonstrate , she clicks on a video clip on her screen ; within seconds , the clip is downloaded .
“ back then , you would download something overnight , leave the computer on and find it downloaded in the morning , after twelve hours of downloading … you could never watch this ! ”
since gaining access to the higher speed internet , natabaalo 's newspaper relaunched its website , which now incorporates previously unheard-of features like picture galleries and a video section .
bildunterschrift : the seacom cable is slowly working its way through africa opening uganda to the world though the seacom cable was officially launched in east africa mid-2009 , broadband access has only begun to trickle through to uganda over the past few weeks .
the new connection allows a much faster data transfer of 200 kilobytes per second , allowing an increasing number of ugandans to take advantage of the features natabaalo and her colleagues have already discovered .
for constantine bitwayiki , the improved web access is cause for celebration .
bitwayiki , the ugandan president 's advisor on internet issues , has big ideas about ways the new technology could be harnessed to overhaul administrative procedures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed internet will give ugandan children access to the world bitwayiki believes that greater internet use in government and private firms could be used to improve efficiency and even tackle corruption .
high speed internet could also prove invaluable for ordinary ugandans when it comes to basic tasks like getting a driving permit , which for many involves traveling long distances to the capital .
“ i 'd just need to do some basic form-filling online , if i have to pay then i go to the nearest bank and i pay , if -lsb- a picture is needed -rsb- then i send a picture online , and then my driving permit is delivered . ”
ugandan minister for trade and industry kahinda otafire is equally optimistic .
he hopes the improved connections may also entice foreign investors into the country .
otafire 's vision for uganda is one of an outsourcing hub for the rest of the world .
“ the best english is spoken in east africa , and particularly in uganda , ” he said .
“ we 've got a lot of educated people ; we 've got a lot of trained manpower , so i do n't see why we do n't engage in outsourcing and getting in touch with the rest of the world . ”
infrastructure holds things back but not everyone is convinced .
so far , only government departments , the university of kampala and some major companies , like the newspaper monitor , are connected to broadband .
the rest of the country must make do with a far slower connection , and for most ugandans , internet cafés remain the only way to get online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait for the internet continues for many ugandans daniel biranda , planning director at the university of kampala 's computer sciences faculty , does not expect big changes in the near future .
“ you know , people are talking about the internet .
they are excited .
but they do n't know the technology . ”
in the early 1990s , biranda became the first ugandan to program a ugandan website .
today , he is looking for ways to connect villages outside the capital to the high-speed broad band cable and he says the key missing ingredient is the humble telephone cable .
“ in , say , stuttgart , every building -lsb- can have -rsb- internet , simply because there is a telephone line .
but the buildings we have in town , they have electricity , but they do n't have telephone lines . ”
because of that , the cost of connecting to the broadband network is expensive , and could easily outweigh the financial opportunities offered by a higher-speed connection , biranda said .
“ will that internet café generate something like the $ 3000 in a month -lsb- to cover the costs -rsb- ?
it ca n't . ”
there is a simple explanation for all of this .
in uganda , as in many developing countries , there has never been an extensive net of landline phones .
they simply skipped that step and went right to mobile phones .
and beyond the capital , little infrastructure exists already that could be used to easily set up internet connections .
this means that for the majority of ugandans , high speed internet access at home may not be a reality for years to come .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 04.02.2010 german filmmaker herzog to head 60th berlinale jury großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog still feels a strong connection to germany film director werner herzog has made his home and his career in hollywood .
he 'll soon head to his native germany to serve as president of the jury for the berlinale - where he 'll watch far more films than he 's used to . herzog claims that he normally only watches two to three films per year .
he made this surprising statement shortly after being announced jury president of the 2010 berlinale .
but how could someone who so rarely sets foot in a movie theater end up in this position ?
and why does he pass on seeing so many movies ?
probably because he is very busy making them himself . at home in america werner herzog lives in los angeles , where he churns out one film after another .
but just a few years ago , no one would have expected him to ever get this far .
after all , his counterparts - german filmmakers wim wenders and volker schloendorff - gave up on their hollywood careers a long time ago and have since returned to their homeland . munich-born herzog , on the other hand , has taken a step forward in his career and now makes big-budget movies in the us , working with a-list stars like christian bale and nicolas cage .
herzog has never been a stranger to success , though ; he is credited with injecting new spirit into german cinema with his first films in the late 1960s . bildunterschrift : herzog 's " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " stars nicolas cage after that he relocated five times with his favorite actor , klaus kinski , in order to tackle daring film projects in places like south america .
his film " fitzcarraldo " has been made the subject of various books and documentaries , and his 1979 film " nosferatu the vampyre " has been hailed as one of the greatest achievements of new german cinema . following these cinematic conquests , herzog temporarily withdrew from the big screen , perhaps partly due to the death of klaus kinski .
over the next few years , he produced unconventional documentaries and staged operas . it was n't until just a few years ago that herzog claimed a real foothold in the us .
this is not a well-known fact in germany , though - maybe because some of herzog 's american-made films did not make it into german cinemas . " i never forgot about germany , " said herzog at one stage .
" but - i do n't know why - germany forgot about me . " he has repeatedly emphasized how close he still feels to his homeland : " i have left my country and live in los angeles today .

he 'll soon head to his native germany to serve as president of the jury for the berlinale - where he 'll watch far more films than he 's used to . herzog claims that he normally only watches two to three films per year .
he made this surprising statement shortly after being announced jury president of the 2010 berlinale .
but how could someone who so rarely sets foot in a movie theater end up in this position ?
and why does he pass on seeing so many movies ?
probably because he is very busy making them himself . at home in america werner herzog lives in los angeles , where he churns out one film after another .
but just a few years ago , no one would have expected him to ever get this far .
after all , his counterparts - german filmmakers wim wenders and volker schloendorff - gave up on their hollywood careers a long time ago and have since returned to their homeland . munich-born herzog , on the other hand , has taken a step forward in his career and now makes big-budget movies in the us , working with a-list stars like christian bale and nicolas cage .
herzog has never been a stranger to success , though ; he is credited with injecting new spirit into german cinema with his first films in the late 1960s . bildunterschrift : herzog 's " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " stars nicolas cage after that he relocated five times with his favorite actor , klaus kinski , in order to tackle daring film projects in places like south america .
his film " fitzcarraldo " has been made the subject of various books and documentaries , and his 1979 film " nosferatu the vampyre " has been hailed as one of the greatest achievements of new german cinema . following these cinematic conquests , herzog temporarily withdrew from the big screen , perhaps partly due to the death of klaus kinski .
over the next few years , he produced unconventional documentaries and staged operas . it was n't until just a few years ago that herzog claimed a real foothold in the us .
this is not a well-known fact in germany , though - maybe because some of herzog 's american-made films did not make it into german cinemas . " i never forgot about germany , " said herzog at one stage .
" but - i do n't know why - germany forgot about me . " he has repeatedly emphasized how close he still feels to his homeland : " i have left my country and live in los angeles today .
and i make films in antarctica , in south america , in the usa .
but despite this i have never abandoned my culture . " herzog 's americana based on true events , herzog 's 2007 film " rescue dawn " tells the story of a us soldier with a german background who is shot down and imprisoned in laos during the vietnam war .

"
a munich-based institute now wants to republish the nazi manifesto on racial purity and anti-semitism . a german history institute has announced it is preparing an annotated version of adolf hitler 's propaganda manifesto " mein kampf " for publication in germany .
edith raim , a historian with the munich-based institute of contemporary history , which is behind the project , said an annotated version of hitler 's memoir would serve to inform current and future generations of the evils of the dictator 's racist ideology .
" we want to obstruct new publications -lsb- of " mein kampf " -rsb- by the radical far-right once the copyright of the book runs out , " said raim .
a new edition of " mein kampf " can only be published after 2015 , when the copyright held by the bavarian state government expires , 70 years after hitler 's death .
" mein kampf , " or " my struggle " as it translates into english , contains hitler 's views on racial purity and vitriol against jews and communists .
raim said that publishing the book could help dispel the fear and reverence many feel towards it .
she said she did not believe the new publication would be used by neo-nazis to stir racism and hatred towards foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear neo-nazis will use the new book as a bible " this book will be published with scholarly annotation and will have a very limited run , " she said .
" after all , it 'll be so expensive that i can not imagine that any neo-nazi will ever buy it . "
staunch opposition german authorities still consider " mein kampf " to be dangerous .
it has not been allowed to be reprinted here since the end of world war ii .
some academics argue that the book does n't provide any answers to questions about how the nazi regime gained power , as it primarily contains hitler 's own personal views .
in a statement on thursday , the state government of bavaria , which holds the copyright , said it had not given the institute permission to print the book and would seek to ban the publication in court .
" furthermore , following the expiration of the copyright in 2015 , the spreading of national-socialist ideas in germany will remain forbidden and punishable under the criminal code , " the statement added .
the institute of contemporary history has pointed out that copies of the original " mein kampf " can easily be bought outside of germany and that it would be wrong to leave the local market to foreign publishing houses once the copyright expires. uh / dfm / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
a munich-based institute now wants to republish the nazi manifesto on racial purity and anti-semitism . a german history institute has announced it is preparing an annotated version of adolf hitler 's propaganda manifesto " mein kampf " for publication in germany .
edith raim , a historian with the munich-based institute of contemporary history , which is behind the project , said an annotated version of hitler 's memoir would serve to inform current and future generations of the evils of the dictator 's racist ideology .
" we want to obstruct new publications -lsb- of " mein kampf " -rsb- by the radical far-right once the copyright of the book runs out , " said raim .
a new edition of " mein kampf " can only be published after 2015 , when the copyright held by the bavarian state government expires , 70 years after hitler 's death .
" mein kampf , " or " my struggle " as it translates into english , contains hitler 's views on racial purity and vitriol against jews and communists .
raim said that publishing the book could help dispel the fear and reverence many feel towards it .
she said she did not believe the new publication would be used by neo-nazis to stir racism and hatred towards foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear neo-nazis will use the new book as a bible " this book will be published with scholarly annotation and will have a very limited run , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 04.02.2010 german filmmaker herzog to head 60th berlinale jury großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog still feels a strong connection to germany film director werner herzog has made his home and his career in hollywood .
he 'll soon head to his native germany to serve as president of the jury for the berlinale - where he 'll watch far more films than he 's used to . herzog claims that he normally only watches two to three films per year .
he made this surprising statement shortly after being announced jury president of the 2010 berlinale .
but how could someone who so rarely sets foot in a movie theater end up in this position ?
and why does he pass on seeing so many movies ?
probably because he is very busy making them himself . at home in america werner herzog lives in los angeles , where he churns out one film after another .
but just a few years ago , no one would have expected him to ever get this far .
after all , his counterparts - german filmmakers wim wenders and volker schloendorff - gave up on their hollywood careers a long time ago and have since returned to their homeland . munich-born herzog , on the other hand , has taken a step forward in his career and now makes big-budget movies in the us , working with a-list stars like christian bale and nicolas cage .
herzog has never been a stranger to success , though ; he is credited with injecting new spirit into german cinema with his first films in the late 1960s . bildunterschrift : herzog 's " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " stars nicolas cage after that he relocated five times with his favorite actor , klaus kinski , in order to tackle daring film projects in places like south america .
his film " fitzcarraldo " has been made the subject of various books and documentaries , and his 1979 film " nosferatu the vampyre " has been hailed as one of the greatest achievements of new german cinema . following these cinematic conquests , herzog temporarily withdrew from the big screen , perhaps partly due to the death of klaus kinski .
over the next few years , he produced unconventional documentaries and staged operas . it was n't until just a few years ago that herzog claimed a real foothold in the us .
this is not a well-known fact in germany , though - maybe because some of herzog 's american-made films did not make it into german cinemas . " i never forgot about germany , " said herzog at one stage .
" but - i do n't know why - germany forgot about me . " he has repeatedly emphasized how close he still feels to his homeland : " i have left my country and live in los angeles today .
and i make films in antarctica , in south america , in the usa .
but despite this i have never abandoned my culture . " herzog 's americana based on true events , herzog 's 2007 film " rescue dawn " tells the story of a us soldier with a german background who is shot down and imprisoned in laos during the vietnam war .
then there are also his more recent american films - " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " and " my son , my son , what have ye done " - both of which premiered at the 2009 venice film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog 's favorite actor , klaus kinski , worked with him on several films whoever has had the chance to meet werner herzog at a film festival or to interview him , knows that this filmmaker is also a great entertainer .
he likes to surprise people , is keen to go against the grain , and does not like to be categorized . the audience at the 2010 berlinale festival should also be prepared for surprises when the awards are handed out on february 20 under werner herzog 's presiding eye . the berlinale runs from february 11-21 . author : jochen kuerten -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in december , the first connections between the capital kampala and the global broadband network went live , thanks to a submarine fiber-optic cable that links to broadband networks in india and europe .
since then , the east african nation has been in an e-frenzy as excited locals begin exploring all that the web has to offer , from downloading music to watching films online .
many ugandans are euphoric , but for some the new cable offers fresh disappointments : a lack of telephone cables means high speed internet will remain out of reach for most ugandans .
for those already hooked up , however , the 17,000-kilometer -lrb- 10,563 mile -rrb- long broadband cable – known as the seacom – is a boon .
grace natabaalo , a web designer who works for the online department of the ugandan newspaper monitor , is one of the seacom 's latest converts .
she realizes that uganda is no where near european speed , but compared the cable makes the internet lightning quick compared to how it used to be .
as if to demonstrate , she clicks on a video clip on her screen ; within seconds , the clip is downloaded .
“ back then , you would download something overnight , leave the computer on and find it downloaded in the morning , after twelve hours of downloading … you could never watch this ! ”
since gaining access to the higher speed internet , natabaalo 's newspaper relaunched its website , which now incorporates previously unheard-of features like picture galleries and a video section .
bildunterschrift : the seacom cable is slowly working its way through africa opening uganda to the world though the seacom cable was officially launched in east africa mid-2009 , broadband access has only begun to trickle through to uganda over the past few weeks .
the new connection allows a much faster data transfer of 200 kilobytes per second , allowing an increasing number of ugandans to take advantage of the features natabaalo and her colleagues have already discovered .
for constantine bitwayiki , the improved web access is cause for celebration .
bitwayiki , the ugandan president 's advisor on internet issues , has big ideas about ways the new technology could be harnessed to overhaul administrative procedures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed internet will give ugandan children access to the world bitwayiki believes that greater internet use in government and private firms could be used to improve efficiency and even tackle corruption .
high speed internet could also prove invaluable for ordinary ugandans when it comes to basic tasks like getting a driving permit , which for many involves traveling long distances to the capital .
“ i 'd just need to do some basic form-filling online , if i have to pay then i go to the nearest bank and i pay , if -lsb- a picture is needed -rsb- then i send a picture online , and then my driving permit is delivered . ”
ugandan minister for trade and industry kahinda otafire is equally optimistic .
he hopes the improved connections may also entice foreign investors into the country .
otafire 's vision for uganda is one of an outsourcing hub for the rest of the world .
“ the best english is spoken in east africa , and particularly in uganda , ” he said .
“ we 've got a lot of educated people ; we 've got a lot of trained manpower , so i do n't see why we do n't engage in outsourcing and getting in touch with the rest of the world . ”
infrastructure holds things back but not everyone is convinced .
so far , only government departments , the university of kampala and some major companies , like the newspaper monitor , are connected to broadband .
the rest of the country must make do with a far slower connection , and for most ugandans , internet cafés remain the only way to get online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait for the internet continues for many ugandans daniel biranda , planning director at the university of kampala 's computer sciences faculty , does not expect big changes in the near future .
“ you know , people are talking about the internet .
they are excited .
but they do n't know the technology . ”
in the early 1990s , biranda became the first ugandan to program a ugandan website .
today , he is looking for ways to connect villages outside the capital to the high-speed broad band cable and he says the key missing ingredient is the humble telephone cable .
“ in , say , stuttgart , every building -lsb- can have -rsb- internet , simply because there is a telephone line .
but the buildings we have in town , they have electricity , but they do n't have telephone lines . ”
because of that , the cost of connecting to the broadband network is expensive , and could easily outweigh the financial opportunities offered by a higher-speed connection , biranda said .
“ will that internet café generate something like the $ 3000 in a month -lsb- to cover the costs -rsb- ?
it ca n't . ”
there is a simple explanation for all of this .
in uganda , as in many developing countries , there has never been an extensive net of landline phones .
they simply skipped that step and went right to mobile phones .
and beyond the capital , little infrastructure exists already that could be used to easily set up internet connections .
this means that for the majority of ugandans , high speed internet access at home may not be a reality for years to come .

negotiations are n't set to resume until after the world cup in june . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- has said the fate of national team coach joachim loew will not be decided until after the upcoming world cup in south africa in june .
what looked like it would be a simple contract extension has turned into a power struggle , with loew reportedly asking for a signing-on fee equivalent to a year 's salary .
" basically , both sides are still interested in working together but we were unable to reach agreement on important aspects of a deal , " explained dfb president theo zwanziger after a specially convened board meeting thursday at the organization 's headquarters in frankfurt .
loew 's current contract expires after the next world cup , where germany has been pooled with australia , serbia and ghana .
zwanziger announced last december that a two-year contract extension had been agreed with loew , keeping him at the helm of the national team until after euro 2012 in poland and ukraine .
but that deal was supposed to be approved at thursday 's meeting .
germany team manager oliver bierhoff , who is part of the three-man coaching team renegotiating their contracts , admitted the news was a blow .
" we would have liked to clear up the contract extension details quickly with the world cup fast approaching , but we accept the president 's decision , " he said .

negotiations are n't set to resume until after the world cup in june . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- has said the fate of national team coach joachim loew will not be decided until after the upcoming world cup in south africa in june .
what looked like it would be a simple contract extension has turned into a power struggle , with loew reportedly asking for a signing-on fee equivalent to a year 's salary .
" basically , both sides are still interested in working together but we were unable to reach agreement on important aspects of a deal , " explained dfb president theo zwanziger after a specially convened board meeting thursday at the organization 's headquarters in frankfurt .
loew 's current contract expires after the next world cup , where germany has been pooled with australia , serbia and ghana .
zwanziger announced last december that a two-year contract extension had been agreed with loew , keeping him at the helm of the national team until after euro 2012 in poland and ukraine .
but that deal was supposed to be approved at thursday 's meeting .
germany team manager oliver bierhoff , who is part of the three-man coaching team renegotiating their contracts , admitted the news was a blow .
" we would have liked to clear up the contract extension details quickly with the world cup fast approaching , but we accept the president 's decision , " he said .
loew was handed the national team reins following a decision by former coach juergen klinsmann not to extend his contract after the last world cup in germany in 2006. dfm / dpa / afp editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he 'll soon head to his native germany to serve as president of the jury for the berlinale - where he 'll watch far more films than he 's used to . herzog claims that he normally only watches two to three films per year .
he made this surprising statement shortly after being announced jury president of the 2010 berlinale .
but how could someone who so rarely sets foot in a movie theater end up in this position ?
and why does he pass on seeing so many movies ?
probably because he is very busy making them himself . at home in america werner herzog lives in los angeles , where he churns out one film after another .
but just a few years ago , no one would have expected him to ever get this far .
after all , his counterparts - german filmmakers wim wenders and volker schloendorff - gave up on their hollywood careers a long time ago and have since returned to their homeland . munich-born herzog , on the other hand , has taken a step forward in his career and now makes big-budget movies in the us , working with a-list stars like christian bale and nicolas cage .
herzog has never been a stranger to success , though ; he is credited with injecting new spirit into german cinema with his first films in the late 1960s . bildunterschrift : herzog 's " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " stars nicolas cage after that he relocated five times with his favorite actor , klaus kinski , in order to tackle daring film projects in places like south america .
his film " fitzcarraldo " has been made the subject of various books and documentaries , and his 1979 film " nosferatu the vampyre " has been hailed as one of the greatest achievements of new german cinema . following these cinematic conquests , herzog temporarily withdrew from the big screen , perhaps partly due to the death of klaus kinski .
over the next few years , he produced unconventional documentaries and staged operas . it was n't until just a few years ago that herzog claimed a real foothold in the us .
this is not a well-known fact in germany , though - maybe because some of herzog 's american-made films did not make it into german cinemas . " i never forgot about germany , " said herzog at one stage .
" but - i do n't know why - germany forgot about me . " he has repeatedly emphasized how close he still feels to his homeland : " i have left my country and live in los angeles today .
and i make films in antarctica , in south america , in the usa .
but despite this i have never abandoned my culture . " herzog 's americana based on true events , herzog 's 2007 film " rescue dawn " tells the story of a us soldier with a german background who is shot down and imprisoned in laos during the vietnam war .
then there are also his more recent american films - " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " and " my son , my son , what have ye done " - both of which premiered at the 2009 venice film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog 's favorite actor , klaus kinski , worked with him on several films whoever has had the chance to meet werner herzog at a film festival or to interview him , knows that this filmmaker is also a great entertainer .
he likes to surprise people , is keen to go against the grain , and does not like to be categorized . the audience at the 2010 berlinale festival should also be prepared for surprises when the awards are handed out on february 20 under werner herzog 's presiding eye . the berlinale runs from february 11-21 . author : jochen kuerten -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he 'll soon head to his native germany to serve as president of the jury for the berlinale - where he 'll watch far more films than he 's used to . herzog claims that he normally only watches two to three films per year .
he made this surprising statement shortly after being announced jury president of the 2010 berlinale .
but how could someone who so rarely sets foot in a movie theater end up in this position ?
and why does he pass on seeing so many movies ?
probably because he is very busy making them himself . at home in america werner herzog lives in los angeles , where he churns out one film after another .
but just a few years ago , no one would have expected him to ever get this far .
after all , his counterparts - german filmmakers wim wenders and volker schloendorff - gave up on their hollywood careers a long time ago and have since returned to their homeland . munich-born herzog , on the other hand , has taken a step forward in his career and now makes big-budget movies in the us , working with a-list stars like christian bale and nicolas cage .
herzog has never been a stranger to success , though ; he is credited with injecting new spirit into german cinema with his first films in the late 1960s . bildunterschrift : herzog 's " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " stars nicolas cage after that he relocated five times with his favorite actor , klaus kinski , in order to tackle daring film projects in places like south america .
his film " fitzcarraldo " has been made the subject of various books and documentaries , and his 1979 film " nosferatu the vampyre " has been hailed as one of the greatest achievements of new german cinema . following these cinematic conquests , herzog temporarily withdrew from the big screen , perhaps partly due to the death of klaus kinski .
over the next few years , he produced unconventional documentaries and staged operas . it was n't until just a few years ago that herzog claimed a real foothold in the us .
this is not a well-known fact in germany , though - maybe because some of herzog 's american-made films did not make it into german cinemas . " i never forgot about germany , " said herzog at one stage .
" but - i do n't know why - germany forgot about me . " he has repeatedly emphasized how close he still feels to his homeland : " i have left my country and live in los angeles today .
and i make films in antarctica , in south america , in the usa .
but despite this i have never abandoned my culture . " herzog 's americana based on true events , herzog 's 2007 film " rescue dawn " tells the story of a us soldier with a german background who is shot down and imprisoned in laos during the vietnam war .
then there are also his more recent american films - " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " and " my son , my son , what have ye done " - both of which premiered at the 2009 venice film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog 's favorite actor , klaus kinski , worked with him on several films whoever has had the chance to meet werner herzog at a film festival or to interview him , knows that this filmmaker is also a great entertainer .
he likes to surprise people , is keen to go against the grain , and does not like to be categorized . the audience at the 2010 berlinale festival should also be prepared for surprises when the awards are handed out on february 20 under werner herzog 's presiding eye . the berlinale runs from february 11-21 . author : jochen kuerten -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

negotiations are n't set to resume until after the world cup in june . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- has said the fate of national team coach joachim loew will not be decided until after the upcoming world cup in south africa in june .
what looked like it would be a simple contract extension has turned into a power struggle , with loew reportedly asking for a signing-on fee equivalent to a year 's salary .
" basically , both sides are still interested in working together but we were unable to reach agreement on important aspects of a deal , " explained dfb president theo zwanziger after a specially convened board meeting thursday at the organization 's headquarters in frankfurt .
loew 's current contract expires after the next world cup , where germany has been pooled with australia , serbia and ghana .
zwanziger announced last december that a two-year contract extension had been agreed with loew , keeping him at the helm of the national team until after euro 2012 in poland and ukraine .
but that deal was supposed to be approved at thursday 's meeting .
germany team manager oliver bierhoff , who is part of the three-man coaching team renegotiating their contracts , admitted the news was a blow .
" we would have liked to clear up the contract extension details quickly with the world cup fast approaching , but we accept the president 's decision , " he said .
loew was handed the national team reins following a decision by former coach juergen klinsmann not to extend his contract after the last world cup in germany in 2006. dfm / dpa / afp editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
a munich-based institute now wants to republish the nazi manifesto on racial purity and anti-semitism . a german history institute has announced it is preparing an annotated version of adolf hitler 's propaganda manifesto " mein kampf " for publication in germany .
edith raim , a historian with the munich-based institute of contemporary history , which is behind the project , said an annotated version of hitler 's memoir would serve to inform current and future generations of the evils of the dictator 's racist ideology .
" we want to obstruct new publications -lsb- of " mein kampf " -rsb- by the radical far-right once the copyright of the book runs out , " said raim .
a new edition of " mein kampf " can only be published after 2015 , when the copyright held by the bavarian state government expires , 70 years after hitler 's death .
" mein kampf , " or " my struggle " as it translates into english , contains hitler 's views on racial purity and vitriol against jews and communists .
raim said that publishing the book could help dispel the fear and reverence many feel towards it .
she said she did not believe the new publication would be used by neo-nazis to stir racism and hatred towards foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear neo-nazis will use the new book as a bible " this book will be published with scholarly annotation and will have a very limited run , " she said .
" after all , it 'll be so expensive that i can not imagine that any neo-nazi will ever buy it . "
staunch opposition german authorities still consider " mein kampf " to be dangerous .
it has not been allowed to be reprinted here since the end of world war ii .
some academics argue that the book does n't provide any answers to questions about how the nazi regime gained power , as it primarily contains hitler 's own personal views .
in a statement on thursday , the state government of bavaria , which holds the copyright , said it had not given the institute permission to print the book and would seek to ban the publication in court .
" furthermore , following the expiration of the copyright in 2015 , the spreading of national-socialist ideas in germany will remain forbidden and punishable under the criminal code , " the statement added .
the institute of contemporary history has pointed out that copies of the original " mein kampf " can easily be bought outside of germany and that it would be wrong to leave the local market to foreign publishing houses once the copyright expires. uh / dfm / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
a munich-based institute now wants to republish the nazi manifesto on racial purity and anti-semitism . a german history institute has announced it is preparing an annotated version of adolf hitler 's propaganda manifesto " mein kampf " for publication in germany .
edith raim , a historian with the munich-based institute of contemporary history , which is behind the project , said an annotated version of hitler 's memoir would serve to inform current and future generations of the evils of the dictator 's racist ideology .
" we want to obstruct new publications -lsb- of " mein kampf " -rsb- by the radical far-right once the copyright of the book runs out , " said raim .
a new edition of " mein kampf " can only be published after 2015 , when the copyright held by the bavarian state government expires , 70 years after hitler 's death .
" mein kampf , " or " my struggle " as it translates into english , contains hitler 's views on racial purity and vitriol against jews and communists .
raim said that publishing the book could help dispel the fear and reverence many feel towards it .
she said she did not believe the new publication would be used by neo-nazis to stir racism and hatred towards foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear neo-nazis will use the new book as a bible " this book will be published with scholarly annotation and will have a very limited run , " she said .
" after all , it 'll be so expensive that i can not imagine that any neo-nazi will ever buy it . "
staunch opposition german authorities still consider " mein kampf " to be dangerous .
it has not been allowed to be reprinted here since the end of world war ii .
some academics argue that the book does n't provide any answers to questions about how the nazi regime gained power , as it primarily contains hitler 's own personal views .
in a statement on thursday , the state government of bavaria , which holds the copyright , said it had not given the institute permission to print the book and would seek to ban the publication in court .
" furthermore , following the expiration of the copyright in 2015 , the spreading of national-socialist ideas in germany will remain forbidden and punishable under the criminal code , " the statement added .
the institute of contemporary history has pointed out that copies of the original " mein kampf " can easily be bought outside of germany and that it would be wrong to leave the local market to foreign publishing houses once the copyright expires. uh / dfm / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

negotiations are n't set to resume until after the world cup in june . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- has said the fate of national team coach joachim loew will not be decided until after the upcoming world cup in south africa in june .
what looked like it would be a simple contract extension has turned into a power struggle , with loew reportedly asking for a signing-on fee equivalent to a year 's salary .
" basically , both sides are still interested in working together but we were unable to reach agreement on important aspects of a deal , " explained dfb president theo zwanziger after a specially convened board meeting thursday at the organization 's headquarters in frankfurt .
loew 's current contract expires after the next world cup , where germany has been pooled with australia , serbia and ghana .
zwanziger announced last december that a two-year contract extension had been agreed with loew , keeping him at the helm of the national team until after euro 2012 in poland and ukraine .
but that deal was supposed to be approved at thursday 's meeting .
germany team manager oliver bierhoff , who is part of the three-man coaching team renegotiating their contracts , admitted the news was a blow .
" we would have liked to clear up the contract extension details quickly with the world cup fast approaching , but we accept the president 's decision , " he said .
loew was handed the national team reins following a decision by former coach juergen klinsmann not to extend his contract after the last world cup in germany in 2006. dfm / dpa / afp editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

negotiations are n't set to resume until after the world cup in june . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- has said the fate of national team coach joachim loew will not be decided until after the upcoming world cup in south africa in june .
what looked like it would be a simple contract extension has turned into a power struggle , with loew reportedly asking for a signing-on fee equivalent to a year 's salary .
" basically , both sides are still interested in working together but we were unable to reach agreement on important aspects of a deal , " explained dfb president theo zwanziger after a specially convened board meeting thursday at the organization 's headquarters in frankfurt .
loew 's current contract expires after the next world cup , where germany has been pooled with australia , serbia and ghana .
zwanziger announced last december that a two-year contract extension had been agreed with loew , keeping him at the helm of the national team until after euro 2012 in poland and ukraine .
but that deal was supposed to be approved at thursday 's meeting .
germany team manager oliver bierhoff , who is part of the three-man coaching team renegotiating their contracts , admitted the news was a blow .
" we would have liked to clear up the contract extension details quickly with the world cup fast approaching , but we accept the president 's decision , " he said .

he 'll soon head to his native germany to serve as president of the jury for the berlinale - where he 'll watch far more films than he 's used to . herzog claims that he normally only watches two to three films per year .
he made this surprising statement shortly after being announced jury president of the 2010 berlinale .
but how could someone who so rarely sets foot in a movie theater end up in this position ?
and why does he pass on seeing so many movies ?
probably because he is very busy making them himself . at home in america werner herzog lives in los angeles , where he churns out one film after another .
but just a few years ago , no one would have expected him to ever get this far .
after all , his counterparts - german filmmakers wim wenders and volker schloendorff - gave up on their hollywood careers a long time ago and have since returned to their homeland . munich-born herzog , on the other hand , has taken a step forward in his career and now makes big-budget movies in the us , working with a-list stars like christian bale and nicolas cage .
herzog has never been a stranger to success , though ; he is credited with injecting new spirit into german cinema with his first films in the late 1960s . bildunterschrift : herzog 's " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " stars nicolas cage after that he relocated five times with his favorite actor , klaus kinski , in order to tackle daring film projects in places like south america .
his film " fitzcarraldo " has been made the subject of various books and documentaries , and his 1979 film " nosferatu the vampyre " has been hailed as one of the greatest achievements of new german cinema . following these cinematic conquests , herzog temporarily withdrew from the big screen , perhaps partly due to the death of klaus kinski .
over the next few years , he produced unconventional documentaries and staged operas . it was n't until just a few years ago that herzog claimed a real foothold in the us .
this is not a well-known fact in germany , though - maybe because some of herzog 's american-made films did not make it into german cinemas . " i never forgot about germany , " said herzog at one stage .
" but - i do n't know why - germany forgot about me . " he has repeatedly emphasized how close he still feels to his homeland : " i have left my country and live in los angeles today .
and i make films in antarctica , in south america , in the usa .
but despite this i have never abandoned my culture . " herzog 's americana based on true events , herzog 's 2007 film " rescue dawn " tells the story of a us soldier with a german background who is shot down and imprisoned in laos during the vietnam war .
then there are also his more recent american films - " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " and " my son , my son , what have ye done " - both of which premiered at the 2009 venice film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog 's favorite actor , klaus kinski , worked with him on several films whoever has had the chance to meet werner herzog at a film festival or to interview him , knows that this filmmaker is also a great entertainer .
he likes to surprise people , is keen to go against the grain , and does not like to be categorized . the audience at the 2010 berlinale festival should also be prepared for surprises when the awards are handed out on february 20 under werner herzog 's presiding eye . the berlinale runs from february 11-21 . author : jochen kuerten -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in december , the first connections between the capital kampala and the global broadband network went live , thanks to a submarine fiber-optic cable that links to broadband networks in india and europe .
since then , the east african nation has been in an e-frenzy as excited locals begin exploring all that the web has to offer , from downloading music to watching films online .
many ugandans are euphoric , but for some the new cable offers fresh disappointments : a lack of telephone cables means high speed internet will remain out of reach for most ugandans .
for those already hooked up , however , the 17,000-kilometer -lrb- 10,563 mile -rrb- long broadband cable – known as the seacom – is a boon .
grace natabaalo , a web designer who works for the online department of the ugandan newspaper monitor , is one of the seacom 's latest converts .
she realizes that uganda is no where near european speed , but compared the cable makes the internet lightning quick compared to how it used to be .
as if to demonstrate , she clicks on a video clip on her screen ; within seconds , the clip is downloaded .
“ back then , you would download something overnight , leave the computer on and find it downloaded in the morning , after twelve hours of downloading … you could never watch this ! ”
since gaining access to the higher speed internet , natabaalo 's newspaper relaunched its website , which now incorporates previously unheard-of features like picture galleries and a video section .
bildunterschrift : the seacom cable is slowly working its way through africa opening uganda to the world though the seacom cable was officially launched in east africa mid-2009 , broadband access has only begun to trickle through to uganda over the past few weeks .
the new connection allows a much faster data transfer of 200 kilobytes per second , allowing an increasing number of ugandans to take advantage of the features natabaalo and her colleagues have already discovered .
for constantine bitwayiki , the improved web access is cause for celebration .
bitwayiki , the ugandan president 's advisor on internet issues , has big ideas about ways the new technology could be harnessed to overhaul administrative procedures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed internet will give ugandan children access to the world bitwayiki believes that greater internet use in government and private firms could be used to improve efficiency and even tackle corruption .
high speed internet could also prove invaluable for ordinary ugandans when it comes to basic tasks like getting a driving permit , which for many involves traveling long distances to the capital .
“ i 'd just need to do some basic form-filling online , if i have to pay then i go to the nearest bank and i pay , if -lsb- a picture is needed -rsb- then i send a picture online , and then my driving permit is delivered . ”
ugandan minister for trade and industry kahinda otafire is equally optimistic .
he hopes the improved connections may also entice foreign investors into the country .
otafire 's vision for uganda is one of an outsourcing hub for the rest of the world .
“ the best english is spoken in east africa , and particularly in uganda , ” he said .
“ we 've got a lot of educated people ; we 've got a lot of trained manpower , so i do n't see why we do n't engage in outsourcing and getting in touch with the rest of the world . ”
infrastructure holds things back but not everyone is convinced .
so far , only government departments , the university of kampala and some major companies , like the newspaper monitor , are connected to broadband .
the rest of the country must make do with a far slower connection , and for most ugandans , internet cafés remain the only way to get online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait for the internet continues for many ugandans daniel biranda , planning director at the university of kampala 's computer sciences faculty , does not expect big changes in the near future .
“ you know , people are talking about the internet .
they are excited .
but they do n't know the technology . ”
in the early 1990s , biranda became the first ugandan to program a ugandan website .
today , he is looking for ways to connect villages outside the capital to the high-speed broad band cable and he says the key missing ingredient is the humble telephone cable .
“ in , say , stuttgart , every building -lsb- can have -rsb- internet , simply because there is a telephone line .
but the buildings we have in town , they have electricity , but they do n't have telephone lines . ”
because of that , the cost of connecting to the broadband network is expensive , and could easily outweigh the financial opportunities offered by a higher-speed connection , biranda said .
“ will that internet café generate something like the $ 3000 in a month -lsb- to cover the costs -rsb- ?
it ca n't . ”
there is a simple explanation for all of this .
in uganda , as in many developing countries , there has never been an extensive net of landline phones .
they simply skipped that step and went right to mobile phones .
and beyond the capital , little infrastructure exists already that could be used to easily set up internet connections .
this means that for the majority of ugandans , high speed internet access at home may not be a reality for years to come .

in december , the first connections between the capital kampala and the global broadband network went live , thanks to a submarine fiber-optic cable that links to broadband networks in india and europe .
since then , the east african nation has been in an e-frenzy as excited locals begin exploring all that the web has to offer , from downloading music to watching films online .
many ugandans are euphoric , but for some the new cable offers fresh disappointments : a lack of telephone cables means high speed internet will remain out of reach for most ugandans .
for those already hooked up , however , the 17,000-kilometer -lrb- 10,563 mile -rrb- long broadband cable – known as the seacom – is a boon .
grace natabaalo , a web designer who works for the online department of the ugandan newspaper monitor , is one of the seacom 's latest converts .
she realizes that uganda is no where near european speed , but compared the cable makes the internet lightning quick compared to how it used to be .
as if to demonstrate , she clicks on a video clip on her screen ; within seconds , the clip is downloaded .
“ back then , you would download something overnight , leave the computer on and find it downloaded in the morning , after twelve hours of downloading … you could never watch this ! ”
since gaining access to the higher speed internet , natabaalo 's newspaper relaunched its website , which now incorporates previously unheard-of features like picture galleries and a video section .
bildunterschrift : the seacom cable is slowly working its way through africa opening uganda to the world though the seacom cable was officially launched in east africa mid-2009 , broadband access has only begun to trickle through to uganda over the past few weeks .
the new connection allows a much faster data transfer of 200 kilobytes per second , allowing an increasing number of ugandans to take advantage of the features natabaalo and her colleagues have already discovered .
for constantine bitwayiki , the improved web access is cause for celebration .
bitwayiki , the ugandan president 's advisor on internet issues , has big ideas about ways the new technology could be harnessed to overhaul administrative procedures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed internet will give ugandan children access to the world bitwayiki believes that greater internet use in government and private firms could be used to improve efficiency and even tackle corruption .
high speed internet could also prove invaluable for ordinary ugandans when it comes to basic tasks like getting a driving permit , which for many involves traveling long distances to the capital .
“ i 'd just need to do some basic form-filling online , if i have to pay then i go to the nearest bank and i pay , if -lsb- a picture is needed -rsb- then i send a picture online , and then my driving permit is delivered . ”
ugandan minister for trade and industry kahinda otafire is equally optimistic .
he hopes the improved connections may also entice foreign investors into the country .
otafire 's vision for uganda is one of an outsourcing hub for the rest of the world .
“ the best english is spoken in east africa , and particularly in uganda , ” he said .
“ we 've got a lot of educated people ; we 've got a lot of trained manpower , so i do n't see why we do n't engage in outsourcing and getting in touch with the rest of the world . ”
infrastructure holds things back but not everyone is convinced .
so far , only government departments , the university of kampala and some major companies , like the newspaper monitor , are connected to broadband .
the rest of the country must make do with a far slower connection , and for most ugandans , internet cafés remain the only way to get online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait for the internet continues for many ugandans daniel biranda , planning director at the university of kampala 's computer sciences faculty , does not expect big changes in the near future .
“ you know , people are talking about the internet .
they are excited .
but they do n't know the technology . ”
in the early 1990s , biranda became the first ugandan to program a ugandan website .
today , he is looking for ways to connect villages outside the capital to the high-speed broad band cable and he says the key missing ingredient is the humble telephone cable .
“ in , say , stuttgart , every building -lsb- can have -rsb- internet , simply because there is a telephone line .
but the buildings we have in town , they have electricity , but they do n't have telephone lines . ”
because of that , the cost of connecting to the broadband network is expensive , and could easily outweigh the financial opportunities offered by a higher-speed connection , biranda said .
“ will that internet café generate something like the $ 3000 in a month -lsb- to cover the costs -rsb- ?
it ca n't . ”
there is a simple explanation for all of this .
in uganda , as in many developing countries , there has never been an extensive net of landline phones .
they simply skipped that step and went right to mobile phones .
and beyond the capital , little infrastructure exists already that could be used to easily set up internet connections .
this means that for the majority of ugandans , high speed internet access at home may not be a reality for years to come .

bitwayiki , the ugandan president 's advisor on internet issues , has big ideas about ways the new technology could be harnessed to overhaul administrative procedures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed internet will give ugandan children access to the world bitwayiki believes that greater internet use in government and private firms could be used to improve efficiency and even tackle corruption .
high speed internet could also prove invaluable for ordinary ugandans when it comes to basic tasks like getting a driving permit , which for many involves traveling long distances to the capital .
“ i 'd just need to do some basic form-filling online , if i have to pay then i go to the nearest bank and i pay , if -lsb- a picture is needed -rsb- then i send a picture online , and then my driving permit is delivered . ”
ugandan minister for trade and industry kahinda otafire is equally optimistic .
he hopes the improved connections may also entice foreign investors into the country .
otafire 's vision for uganda is one of an outsourcing hub for the rest of the world .
“ the best english is spoken in east africa , and particularly in uganda , ” he said .
“ we 've got a lot of educated people ; we 've got a lot of trained manpower , so i do n't see why we do n't engage in outsourcing and getting in touch with the rest of the world . ”
infrastructure holds things back but not everyone is convinced .
so far , only government departments , the university of kampala and some major companies , like the newspaper monitor , are connected to broadband .
the rest of the country must make do with a far slower connection , and for most ugandans , internet cafés remain the only way to get online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait for the internet continues for many ugandans daniel biranda , planning director at the university of kampala 's computer sciences faculty , does not expect big changes in the near future .
“ you know , people are talking about the internet .
they are excited .
but they do n't know the technology . ”
in the early 1990s , biranda became the first ugandan to program a ugandan website .
today , he is looking for ways to connect villages outside the capital to the high-speed broad band cable and he says the key missing ingredient is the humble telephone cable .
“ in , say , stuttgart , every building -lsb- can have -rsb- internet , simply because there is a telephone line .
but the buildings we have in town , they have electricity , but they do n't have telephone lines . ”
because of that , the cost of connecting to the broadband network is expensive , and could easily outweigh the financial opportunities offered by a higher-speed connection , biranda said .
“ will that internet café generate something like the $ 3000 in a month -lsb- to cover the costs -rsb- ?
it ca n't . ”
there is a simple explanation for all of this .
in uganda , as in many developing countries , there has never been an extensive net of landline phones .
they simply skipped that step and went right to mobile phones .
and beyond the capital , little infrastructure exists already that could be used to easily set up internet connections .
this means that for the majority of ugandans , high speed internet access at home may not be a reality for years to come .

negotiations are n't set to resume until after the world cup in june . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- has said the fate of national team coach joachim loew will not be decided until after the upcoming world cup in south africa in june .
what looked like it would be a simple contract extension has turned into a power struggle , with loew reportedly asking for a signing-on fee equivalent to a year 's salary .
" basically , both sides are still interested in working together but we were unable to reach agreement on important aspects of a deal , " explained dfb president theo zwanziger after a specially convened board meeting thursday at the organization 's headquarters in frankfurt .
loew 's current contract expires after the next world cup , where germany has been pooled with australia , serbia and ghana .
zwanziger announced last december that a two-year contract extension had been agreed with loew , keeping him at the helm of the national team until after euro 2012 in poland and ukraine .
but that deal was supposed to be approved at thursday 's meeting .
germany team manager oliver bierhoff , who is part of the three-man coaching team renegotiating their contracts , admitted the news was a blow .
" we would have liked to clear up the contract extension details quickly with the world cup fast approaching , but we accept the president 's decision , " he said .
loew was handed the national team reins following a decision by former coach juergen klinsmann not to extend his contract after the last world cup in germany in 2006. dfm / dpa / afp editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in december , the first connections between the capital kampala and the global broadband network went live , thanks to a submarine fiber-optic cable that links to broadband networks in india and europe .
since then , the east african nation has been in an e-frenzy as excited locals begin exploring all that the web has to offer , from downloading music to watching films online .
many ugandans are euphoric , but for some the new cable offers fresh disappointments : a lack of telephone cables means high speed internet will remain out of reach for most ugandans .
for those already hooked up , however , the 17,000-kilometer -lrb- 10,563 mile -rrb- long broadband cable – known as the seacom – is a boon .
grace natabaalo , a web designer who works for the online department of the ugandan newspaper monitor , is one of the seacom 's latest converts .
she realizes that uganda is no where near european speed , but compared the cable makes the internet lightning quick compared to how it used to be .
as if to demonstrate , she clicks on a video clip on her screen ; within seconds , the clip is downloaded .
“ back then , you would download something overnight , leave the computer on and find it downloaded in the morning , after twelve hours of downloading … you could never watch this ! ”
since gaining access to the higher speed internet , natabaalo 's newspaper relaunched its website , which now incorporates previously unheard-of features like picture galleries and a video section .
bildunterschrift : the seacom cable is slowly working its way through africa opening uganda to the world though the seacom cable was officially launched in east africa mid-2009 , broadband access has only begun to trickle through to uganda over the past few weeks .

"
a munich-based institute now wants to republish the nazi manifesto on racial purity and anti-semitism . a german history institute has announced it is preparing an annotated version of adolf hitler 's propaganda manifesto " mein kampf " for publication in germany .
edith raim , a historian with the munich-based institute of contemporary history , which is behind the project , said an annotated version of hitler 's memoir would serve to inform current and future generations of the evils of the dictator 's racist ideology .
" we want to obstruct new publications -lsb- of " mein kampf " -rsb- by the radical far-right once the copyright of the book runs out , " said raim .
a new edition of " mein kampf " can only be published after 2015 , when the copyright held by the bavarian state government expires , 70 years after hitler 's death .
" mein kampf , " or " my struggle " as it translates into english , contains hitler 's views on racial purity and vitriol against jews and communists .
raim said that publishing the book could help dispel the fear and reverence many feel towards it .
she said she did not believe the new publication would be used by neo-nazis to stir racism and hatred towards foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear neo-nazis will use the new book as a bible " this book will be published with scholarly annotation and will have a very limited run , " she said .
" after all , it 'll be so expensive that i can not imagine that any neo-nazi will ever buy it . "
staunch opposition german authorities still consider " mein kampf " to be dangerous .
it has not been allowed to be reprinted here since the end of world war ii .
some academics argue that the book does n't provide any answers to questions about how the nazi regime gained power , as it primarily contains hitler 's own personal views .
in a statement on thursday , the state government of bavaria , which holds the copyright , said it had not given the institute permission to print the book and would seek to ban the publication in court .
" furthermore , following the expiration of the copyright in 2015 , the spreading of national-socialist ideas in germany will remain forbidden and punishable under the criminal code , " the statement added .
the institute of contemporary history has pointed out that copies of the original " mein kampf " can easily be bought outside of germany and that it would be wrong to leave the local market to foreign publishing houses once the copyright expires. uh / dfm / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 04.02.2010 german filmmaker herzog to head 60th berlinale jury großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog still feels a strong connection to germany film director werner herzog has made his home and his career in hollywood .
he 'll soon head to his native germany to serve as president of the jury for the berlinale - where he 'll watch far more films than he 's used to . herzog claims that he normally only watches two to three films per year .
he made this surprising statement shortly after being announced jury president of the 2010 berlinale .
but how could someone who so rarely sets foot in a movie theater end up in this position ?
and why does he pass on seeing so many movies ?
probably because he is very busy making them himself . at home in america werner herzog lives in los angeles , where he churns out one film after another .
but just a few years ago , no one would have expected him to ever get this far .
after all , his counterparts - german filmmakers wim wenders and volker schloendorff - gave up on their hollywood careers a long time ago and have since returned to their homeland . munich-born herzog , on the other hand , has taken a step forward in his career and now makes big-budget movies in the us , working with a-list stars like christian bale and nicolas cage .
herzog has never been a stranger to success , though ; he is credited with injecting new spirit into german cinema with his first films in the late 1960s . bildunterschrift : herzog 's " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " stars nicolas cage after that he relocated five times with his favorite actor , klaus kinski , in order to tackle daring film projects in places like south america .
his film " fitzcarraldo " has been made the subject of various books and documentaries , and his 1979 film " nosferatu the vampyre " has been hailed as one of the greatest achievements of new german cinema . following these cinematic conquests , herzog temporarily withdrew from the big screen , perhaps partly due to the death of klaus kinski .
over the next few years , he produced unconventional documentaries and staged operas . it was n't until just a few years ago that herzog claimed a real foothold in the us .
this is not a well-known fact in germany , though - maybe because some of herzog 's american-made films did not make it into german cinemas . " i never forgot about germany , " said herzog at one stage .
" but - i do n't know why - germany forgot about me . " he has repeatedly emphasized how close he still feels to his homeland : " i have left my country and live in los angeles today .
and i make films in antarctica , in south america , in the usa .
but despite this i have never abandoned my culture . " herzog 's americana based on true events , herzog 's 2007 film " rescue dawn " tells the story of a us soldier with a german background who is shot down and imprisoned in laos during the vietnam war .
then there are also his more recent american films - " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " and " my son , my son , what have ye done " - both of which premiered at the 2009 venice film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog 's favorite actor , klaus kinski , worked with him on several films whoever has had the chance to meet werner herzog at a film festival or to interview him , knows that this filmmaker is also a great entertainer .
he likes to surprise people , is keen to go against the grain , and does not like to be categorized . the audience at the 2010 berlinale festival should also be prepared for surprises when the awards are handed out on february 20 under werner herzog 's presiding eye . the berlinale runs from february 11-21 . author : jochen kuerten -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he 'll soon head to his native germany to serve as president of the jury for the berlinale - where he 'll watch far more films than he 's used to . herzog claims that he normally only watches two to three films per year .
he made this surprising statement shortly after being announced jury president of the 2010 berlinale .
but how could someone who so rarely sets foot in a movie theater end up in this position ?
and why does he pass on seeing so many movies ?
probably because he is very busy making them himself . at home in america werner herzog lives in los angeles , where he churns out one film after another .
but just a few years ago , no one would have expected him to ever get this far .
after all , his counterparts - german filmmakers wim wenders and volker schloendorff - gave up on their hollywood careers a long time ago and have since returned to their homeland . munich-born herzog , on the other hand , has taken a step forward in his career and now makes big-budget movies in the us , working with a-list stars like christian bale and nicolas cage .
herzog has never been a stranger to success , though ; he is credited with injecting new spirit into german cinema with his first films in the late 1960s . bildunterschrift : herzog 's " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " stars nicolas cage after that he relocated five times with his favorite actor , klaus kinski , in order to tackle daring film projects in places like south america .
his film " fitzcarraldo " has been made the subject of various books and documentaries , and his 1979 film " nosferatu the vampyre " has been hailed as one of the greatest achievements of new german cinema . following these cinematic conquests , herzog temporarily withdrew from the big screen , perhaps partly due to the death of klaus kinski .
over the next few years , he produced unconventional documentaries and staged operas . it was n't until just a few years ago that herzog claimed a real foothold in the us .
this is not a well-known fact in germany , though - maybe because some of herzog 's american-made films did not make it into german cinemas . " i never forgot about germany , " said herzog at one stage .
" but - i do n't know why - germany forgot about me . " he has repeatedly emphasized how close he still feels to his homeland : " i have left my country and live in los angeles today .
and i make films in antarctica , in south america , in the usa .
but despite this i have never abandoned my culture . " herzog 's americana based on true events , herzog 's 2007 film " rescue dawn " tells the story of a us soldier with a german background who is shot down and imprisoned in laos during the vietnam war .
then there are also his more recent american films - " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " and " my son , my son , what have ye done " - both of which premiered at the 2009 venice film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog 's favorite actor , klaus kinski , worked with him on several films whoever has had the chance to meet werner herzog at a film festival or to interview him , knows that this filmmaker is also a great entertainer .
he likes to surprise people , is keen to go against the grain , and does not like to be categorized . the audience at the 2010 berlinale festival should also be prepared for surprises when the awards are handed out on february 20 under werner herzog 's presiding eye . the berlinale runs from february 11-21 . author : jochen kuerten -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

negotiations are n't set to resume until after the world cup in june . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- has said the fate of national team coach joachim loew will not be decided until after the upcoming world cup in south africa in june .
what looked like it would be a simple contract extension has turned into a power struggle , with loew reportedly asking for a signing-on fee equivalent to a year 's salary .
" basically , both sides are still interested in working together but we were unable to reach agreement on important aspects of a deal , " explained dfb president theo zwanziger after a specially convened board meeting thursday at the organization 's headquarters in frankfurt .
loew 's current contract expires after the next world cup , where germany has been pooled with australia , serbia and ghana .
zwanziger announced last december that a two-year contract extension had been agreed with loew , keeping him at the helm of the national team until after euro 2012 in poland and ukraine .
but that deal was supposed to be approved at thursday 's meeting .
germany team manager oliver bierhoff , who is part of the three-man coaching team renegotiating their contracts , admitted the news was a blow .
" we would have liked to clear up the contract extension details quickly with the world cup fast approaching , but we accept the president 's decision , " he said .
loew was handed the national team reins following a decision by former coach juergen klinsmann not to extend his contract after the last world cup in germany in 2006. dfm / dpa / afp editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he 'll soon head to his native germany to serve as president of the jury for the berlinale - where he 'll watch far more films than he 's used to . herzog claims that he normally only watches two to three films per year .
he made this surprising statement shortly after being announced jury president of the 2010 berlinale .
but how could someone who so rarely sets foot in a movie theater end up in this position ?
and why does he pass on seeing so many movies ?
probably because he is very busy making them himself . at home in america werner herzog lives in los angeles , where he churns out one film after another .
but just a few years ago , no one would have expected him to ever get this far .
after all , his counterparts - german filmmakers wim wenders and volker schloendorff - gave up on their hollywood careers a long time ago and have since returned to their homeland . munich-born herzog , on the other hand , has taken a step forward in his career and now makes big-budget movies in the us , working with a-list stars like christian bale and nicolas cage .
herzog has never been a stranger to success , though ; he is credited with injecting new spirit into german cinema with his first films in the late 1960s . bildunterschrift : herzog 's " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " stars nicolas cage after that he relocated five times with his favorite actor , klaus kinski , in order to tackle daring film projects in places like south america .
his film " fitzcarraldo " has been made the subject of various books and documentaries , and his 1979 film " nosferatu the vampyre " has been hailed as one of the greatest achievements of new german cinema . following these cinematic conquests , herzog temporarily withdrew from the big screen , perhaps partly due to the death of klaus kinski .
over the next few years , he produced unconventional documentaries and staged operas . it was n't until just a few years ago that herzog claimed a real foothold in the us .
this is not a well-known fact in germany , though - maybe because some of herzog 's american-made films did not make it into german cinemas . " i never forgot about germany , " said herzog at one stage .
" but - i do n't know why - germany forgot about me . " he has repeatedly emphasized how close he still feels to his homeland : " i have left my country and live in los angeles today .
and i make films in antarctica , in south america , in the usa .
but despite this i have never abandoned my culture . " herzog 's americana based on true events , herzog 's 2007 film " rescue dawn " tells the story of a us soldier with a german background who is shot down and imprisoned in laos during the vietnam war .
then there are also his more recent american films - " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " and " my son , my son , what have ye done " - both of which premiered at the 2009 venice film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog 's favorite actor , klaus kinski , worked with him on several films whoever has had the chance to meet werner herzog at a film festival or to interview him , knows that this filmmaker is also a great entertainer .
he likes to surprise people , is keen to go against the grain , and does not like to be categorized . the audience at the 2010 berlinale festival should also be prepared for surprises when the awards are handed out on february 20 under werner herzog 's presiding eye . the berlinale runs from february 11-21 . author : jochen kuerten -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
a munich-based institute now wants to republish the nazi manifesto on racial purity and anti-semitism . a german history institute has announced it is preparing an annotated version of adolf hitler 's propaganda manifesto " mein kampf " for publication in germany .
edith raim , a historian with the munich-based institute of contemporary history , which is behind the project , said an annotated version of hitler 's memoir would serve to inform current and future generations of the evils of the dictator 's racist ideology .
" we want to obstruct new publications -lsb- of " mein kampf " -rsb- by the radical far-right once the copyright of the book runs out , " said raim .
a new edition of " mein kampf " can only be published after 2015 , when the copyright held by the bavarian state government expires , 70 years after hitler 's death .
" mein kampf , " or " my struggle " as it translates into english , contains hitler 's views on racial purity and vitriol against jews and communists .
raim said that publishing the book could help dispel the fear and reverence many feel towards it .
she said she did not believe the new publication would be used by neo-nazis to stir racism and hatred towards foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear neo-nazis will use the new book as a bible " this book will be published with scholarly annotation and will have a very limited run , " she said .
" after all , it 'll be so expensive that i can not imagine that any neo-nazi will ever buy it . "
staunch opposition german authorities still consider " mein kampf " to be dangerous .
it has not been allowed to be reprinted here since the end of world war ii .
some academics argue that the book does n't provide any answers to questions about how the nazi regime gained power , as it primarily contains hitler 's own personal views .
in a statement on thursday , the state government of bavaria , which holds the copyright , said it had not given the institute permission to print the book and would seek to ban the publication in court .
" furthermore , following the expiration of the copyright in 2015 , the spreading of national-socialist ideas in germany will remain forbidden and punishable under the criminal code , " the statement added .
the institute of contemporary history has pointed out that copies of the original " mein kampf " can easily be bought outside of germany and that it would be wrong to leave the local market to foreign publishing houses once the copyright expires. uh / dfm / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

negotiations are n't set to resume until after the world cup in june . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- has said the fate of national team coach joachim loew will not be decided until after the upcoming world cup in south africa in june .
what looked like it would be a simple contract extension has turned into a power struggle , with loew reportedly asking for a signing-on fee equivalent to a year 's salary .
" basically , both sides are still interested in working together but we were unable to reach agreement on important aspects of a deal , " explained dfb president theo zwanziger after a specially convened board meeting thursday at the organization 's headquarters in frankfurt .
loew 's current contract expires after the next world cup , where germany has been pooled with australia , serbia and ghana .
zwanziger announced last december that a two-year contract extension had been agreed with loew , keeping him at the helm of the national team until after euro 2012 in poland and ukraine .
but that deal was supposed to be approved at thursday 's meeting .
germany team manager oliver bierhoff , who is part of the three-man coaching team renegotiating their contracts , admitted the news was a blow .
" we would have liked to clear up the contract extension details quickly with the world cup fast approaching , but we accept the president 's decision , " he said .
loew was handed the national team reins following a decision by former coach juergen klinsmann not to extend his contract after the last world cup in germany in 2006. dfm / dpa / afp editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the munich international security conference gets underway , we ask two experts just how important these meetings really are . it 's the same procedure every january .
the year is barely a few weeks old and a massive stream of business travelers from all over the world is already en route to europe .
the main destinations for thousands of political leaders and executives are davos and munich .
in the swiss mountains the world economic forum , as it regularly does , this year attracted more than 2000 delegates . munich 's security conference traditionally taking place this week usually attracts around 300 participants .
but that 's not all .
add to those long established venues this year 's new global zero summit with its focus on nuclear disarmament held in paris squeezed in the few remaining days between davos and munich and the dld conference on digital innovation in munich right before the world economic forum and you can appreciate why a good travel consultant is necessary for the many people participating in more than one conference .
while the meetings in davos and munich by now have a long history , they are criticized on a regular basis for what essentially are two contradictory reasons .
one is that at these private gatherings , high-profile figures make decisions behind close doors and thus effectively undermine the work of the legitimate international bodies .
and two , that these meetings are just hyped-up talking shops that have no real significance and therefore are basically superfluous . no threat to un " i would n't share this criticism , " says juergen chrobog , a former state secretary in the german foreign office and ambassador to the us .
" i think the conferences in munich or davos are not meant to solve problems , to lead to certain results . " werner weidenfeld , who served for twelve years as the german government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations and currently directs the munich based think tank center for applied policy research , agrees that conferences such as davos and munich do not undermine the work of united nations and other institutions designated to solving global problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private meetings are no threat to the work of the un , say experts both experts point out that these conferences in no way can or want to rival the formal decision making processes at un level or other official venues .
no politician would skip an important un meeting because of these private conferences .
major decisions , the experts argue , are prepared long before important global meetings and concluded at these meetings .
what about the claim then that these private meetings are essentially much ado about nothing ?
chrobog , who declares jokingly that he himself has not only attended many , but too many of these conferences and has limited his participation in recent years , nevertheless believes that this meetings do serve an important function .
" it 's simply for people to get together and have a free exchange of views and to allow them develop their own ideas , " he says .
" that 's very important .
people have to meet , they have to get together , they have to build networks . "
events like davos and munich are attractive because they make it easy to do exactly that participants can meet lots of people in a very short time .
nothing wrong with communication just because these conferences do n't produce results , does n't mean they are n't valuable , weidenfeld told deutsche welle and points to an important , but often neglected aspect of the nature of politics .
" you have to realize that politics is also about communication , " he says .
" everything is perception .
how do the other actors perceive the reality and the problems .
what do the others think that i am thinking and what is their reaction to my way of thinking about a problem .
i think this is the positive aspect of these kind of activities . "
while chrobog and weidenfeld argue that private gatherings like the ones in davos and munich have a place in the political calendar , they both feel that with many new venues springing up all the time , the conference circuit has gotten very crowded and events have become too big and similar in nature .
the biggest danger for the conferences however , stems not from the meetings themselves , but from the expectations of concrete outcomes .
people and the media should n't exaggerate the meaning of those conferences and expect concrete results . " it 's more or less a market place of politics to exchange perceptions " , says weidenfeld .
" it is a certain form of a vanity fair with a great deficit on strategic thinking and real problem solving . "
no problem solving " i think they have a certain importance , but they will not change the world " , says juergen chrobog who currently heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt .
" they never helped me to solve a problem , to be very frank . "
but , he adds , some of the people he met at conferences did actually help him to solve problems later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicholas sarkozy did n't mince words last year in munich asked about how he personally benefitted from these conferences , werner weidenfeld tells an anecdote about last year 's security conference in munich involving french president nicolas sarkozy .
the president had just delivered a very tough speech that stood out from the previous soft addresses given by other leaders .
" then there was a coffee break and i observed that none of the other top politicians from america , from germany or elsewhere talked to president sarkozy .
he stood alone in the corner , nobody talked to him , because his speech had been too tough in their mind .
then i myself went to him and talked to him and he was so grateful that he almost tried to kiss me .
so i learned first hand that sarkozy does n't only have friends in international politics . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 04.02.2010 press review : 100 days - a coalition in political puberty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel rules a coalition with two prickly junior partners germany 's newspapers have given a scathing assessment of the first 100 days of the new government .
the junior coalition partners , the free democratic party , have been condemned in particular as " unfit to govern . " the new german government under chancellor angela merkel could hardly have feared worse reviews on its first 100 days in office .
not a single major newspaper could muster a kind assessment , and some have been merciless .
squabbling , indecisive , and naïve fairly sums up the opinion of most political commentators , and they also agree on who to blame : the free democratic party led by foreign minister and vice chancellor guido westerwelle , the party regarded as the big winners of last september 's election .
" with an election result of more than 14 percent , the fdp suddenly had big hopes to fulfil , " says the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" and they are not up to it yet . "
the successful election campaign seemed to promise that the fdp would establish itself outside its traditional voter base .
but it is " squandering its opportunity permanently , " the paper says .
as for merkel 's christian democratic union , they are desperate " not to be seen as the neo-liberal spectre that the opposition made them out to be before the election . "
the sueddeutsche zeitung uses a botanical metaphor to illustrate its thoughts on the new government .
the national paper likens the constantly squabbling leaders of merkel 's allies - westerwelle and christian social union leader horst seehofer - to the mimosa , a prickly , sensitive plant that closes rapidly when touched or shaken .
" angela merkel is in charge of a mimosa coalition , " the paper concludes .
" we 've seen the husk .
it 's time for the fruit . "
several papers have noted that the last government , a coalition of the center-right cdu and the center-left social democratic party , seemed to function much better , despite being considered at the time as an unworkable marriage of convenience .
as munich tabloid abendzeitung says , " many think back to it with nostalgia . "
the combination of cdu and fdp only seems to work at a state level , the paper argues .
the cologne-based koelnische rundschau also compares this coalition unfavourably to its predecessors , particularly as the cdu and the fdp went into the last election as declared allies .
" the spd / green alliance was unprepared in 1998 , and the cdu and the spd could not bring themselves to trust each other in 2005 , " the paper says , " but the cdu and the fdp do not give the impression that they want to work together . "
" what do the cdu and fdp want ? " the paper asks .
but perhaps the bluntest assessment came from the berliner zeitung , and was aimed specifically at westerwelle 's party : " they ca n't do it .
they are unfit to govern .
angela merkel has brought an unpredictable , chaotic bunch into the cabinet .
angela merkel is governing with people who are in political puberty .
if they do n't grow up soon , we have another 1,360 days of hysterics and wrong decisions to look forward to . " bk / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the meetings in davos and munich by now have a long history , they are criticized on a regular basis for what essentially are two contradictory reasons .

the biggest danger for the conferences however , stems not from the meetings themselves , but from the expectations of concrete outcomes .
people and the media should n't exaggerate the meaning of those conferences and expect concrete results . " it 's more or less a market place of politics to exchange perceptions " , says weidenfeld .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 04.02.2010 press review : 100 days - a coalition in political puberty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel rules a coalition with two prickly junior partners germany 's newspapers have given a scathing assessment of the first 100 days of the new government .
the junior coalition partners , the free democratic party , have been condemned in particular as " unfit to govern . " the new german government under chancellor angela merkel could hardly have feared worse reviews on its first 100 days in office .
not a single major newspaper could muster a kind assessment , and some have been merciless .
squabbling , indecisive , and naïve fairly sums up the opinion of most political commentators , and they also agree on who to blame : the free democratic party led by foreign minister and vice chancellor guido westerwelle , the party regarded as the big winners of last september 's election .
" with an election result of more than 14 percent , the fdp suddenly had big hopes to fulfil , " says the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" and they are not up to it yet . "
the successful election campaign seemed to promise that the fdp would establish itself outside its traditional voter base .
but it is " squandering its opportunity permanently , " the paper says .
as for merkel 's christian democratic union , they are desperate " not to be seen as the neo-liberal spectre that the opposition made them out to be before the election . "
the sueddeutsche zeitung uses a botanical metaphor to illustrate its thoughts on the new government .
the national paper likens the constantly squabbling leaders of merkel 's allies - westerwelle and christian social union leader horst seehofer - to the mimosa , a prickly , sensitive plant that closes rapidly when touched or shaken .
" angela merkel is in charge of a mimosa coalition , " the paper concludes .
" we 've seen the husk .
it 's time for the fruit . "
several papers have noted that the last government , a coalition of the center-right cdu and the center-left social democratic party , seemed to function much better , despite being considered at the time as an unworkable marriage of convenience .
as munich tabloid abendzeitung says , " many think back to it with nostalgia . "
the combination of cdu and fdp only seems to work at a state level , the paper argues .
the cologne-based koelnische rundschau also compares this coalition unfavourably to its predecessors , particularly as the cdu and the fdp went into the last election as declared allies .
" the spd / green alliance was unprepared in 1998 , and the cdu and the spd could not bring themselves to trust each other in 2005 , " the paper says , " but the cdu and the fdp do not give the impression that they want to work together . "
" what do the cdu and fdp want ? " the paper asks .
but perhaps the bluntest assessment came from the berliner zeitung , and was aimed specifically at westerwelle 's party : " they ca n't do it .
they are unfit to govern .
angela merkel has brought an unpredictable , chaotic bunch into the cabinet .
angela merkel is governing with people who are in political puberty .
if they do n't grow up soon , we have another 1,360 days of hysterics and wrong decisions to look forward to . " bk / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de 100 days in office - germany 's governing coalition feels the strain expectations were high when germany 's governing coalition came to power 100 days ago .

as the munich international security conference gets underway , we ask two experts just how important these meetings really are . it 's the same procedure every january .
the year is barely a few weeks old and a massive stream of business travelers from all over the world is already en route to europe .
the main destinations for thousands of political leaders and executives are davos and munich .
in the swiss mountains the world economic forum , as it regularly does , this year attracted more than 2000 delegates . munich 's security conference traditionally taking place this week usually attracts around 300 participants .
but that 's not all .
add to those long established venues this year 's new global zero summit with its focus on nuclear disarmament held in paris squeezed in the few remaining days between davos and munich and the dld conference on digital innovation in munich right before the world economic forum and you can appreciate why a good travel consultant is necessary for the many people participating in more than one conference .
while the meetings in davos and munich by now have a long history , they are criticized on a regular basis for what essentially are two contradictory reasons .
one is that at these private gatherings , high-profile figures make decisions behind close doors and thus effectively undermine the work of the legitimate international bodies .
and two , that these meetings are just hyped-up talking shops that have no real significance and therefore are basically superfluous . no threat to un " i would n't share this criticism , " says juergen chrobog , a former state secretary in the german foreign office and ambassador to the us .
" i think the conferences in munich or davos are not meant to solve problems , to lead to certain results . " werner weidenfeld , who served for twelve years as the german government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations and currently directs the munich based think tank center for applied policy research , agrees that conferences such as davos and munich do not undermine the work of united nations and other institutions designated to solving global problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private meetings are no threat to the work of the un , say experts both experts point out that these conferences in no way can or want to rival the formal decision making processes at un level or other official venues .
no politician would skip an important un meeting because of these private conferences .
major decisions , the experts argue , are prepared long before important global meetings and concluded at these meetings .
what about the claim then that these private meetings are essentially much ado about nothing ?
chrobog , who declares jokingly that he himself has not only attended many , but too many of these conferences and has limited his participation in recent years , nevertheless believes that this meetings do serve an important function .
" it 's simply for people to get together and have a free exchange of views and to allow them develop their own ideas , " he says .
" that 's very important .
people have to meet , they have to get together , they have to build networks . "
events like davos and munich are attractive because they make it easy to do exactly that participants can meet lots of people in a very short time .
nothing wrong with communication just because these conferences do n't produce results , does n't mean they are n't valuable , weidenfeld told deutsche welle and points to an important , but often neglected aspect of the nature of politics .
" you have to realize that politics is also about communication , " he says .
" everything is perception .
how do the other actors perceive the reality and the problems .
what do the others think that i am thinking and what is their reaction to my way of thinking about a problem .
i think this is the positive aspect of these kind of activities . "
while chrobog and weidenfeld argue that private gatherings like the ones in davos and munich have a place in the political calendar , they both feel that with many new venues springing up all the time , the conference circuit has gotten very crowded and events have become too big and similar in nature .
the biggest danger for the conferences however , stems not from the meetings themselves , but from the expectations of concrete outcomes .
people and the media should n't exaggerate the meaning of those conferences and expect concrete results . " it 's more or less a market place of politics to exchange perceptions " , says weidenfeld .
" it is a certain form of a vanity fair with a great deficit on strategic thinking and real problem solving . "
no problem solving " i think they have a certain importance , but they will not change the world " , says juergen chrobog who currently heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt .
" they never helped me to solve a problem , to be very frank . "
but , he adds , some of the people he met at conferences did actually help him to solve problems later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicholas sarkozy did n't mince words last year in munich asked about how he personally benefitted from these conferences , werner weidenfeld tells an anecdote about last year 's security conference in munich involving french president nicolas sarkozy .
the president had just delivered a very tough speech that stood out from the previous soft addresses given by other leaders .
" then there was a coffee break and i observed that none of the other top politicians from america , from germany or elsewhere talked to president sarkozy .
he stood alone in the corner , nobody talked to him , because his speech had been too tough in their mind .
then i myself went to him and talked to him and he was so grateful that he almost tried to kiss me .
so i learned first hand that sarkozy does n't only have friends in international politics . "

the junior coalition partners , the free democratic party , have been condemned in particular as " unfit to govern . " the new german government under chancellor angela merkel could hardly have feared worse reviews on its first 100 days in office .
not a single major newspaper could muster a kind assessment , and some have been merciless .
squabbling , indecisive , and naïve fairly sums up the opinion of most political commentators , and they also agree on who to blame : the free democratic party led by foreign minister and vice chancellor guido westerwelle , the party regarded as the big winners of last september 's election .
" with an election result of more than 14 percent , the fdp suddenly had big hopes to fulfil , " says the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" and they are not up to it yet . "
the successful election campaign seemed to promise that the fdp would establish itself outside its traditional voter base .
but it is " squandering its opportunity permanently , " the paper says .
as for merkel 's christian democratic union , they are desperate " not to be seen as the neo-liberal spectre that the opposition made them out to be before the election . "
the sueddeutsche zeitung uses a botanical metaphor to illustrate its thoughts on the new government .
the national paper likens the constantly squabbling leaders of merkel 's allies - westerwelle and christian social union leader horst seehofer - to the mimosa , a prickly , sensitive plant that closes rapidly when touched or shaken .
" angela merkel is in charge of a mimosa coalition , " the paper concludes .
" we 've seen the husk .
it 's time for the fruit . "
several papers have noted that the last government , a coalition of the center-right cdu and the center-left social democratic party , seemed to function much better , despite being considered at the time as an unworkable marriage of convenience .
as munich tabloid abendzeitung says , " many think back to it with nostalgia . "
the combination of cdu and fdp only seems to work at a state level , the paper argues .
the cologne-based koelnische rundschau also compares this coalition unfavourably to its predecessors , particularly as the cdu and the fdp went into the last election as declared allies .
" the spd / green alliance was unprepared in 1998 , and the cdu and the spd could not bring themselves to trust each other in 2005 , " the paper says , " but the cdu and the fdp do not give the impression that they want to work together . "
" what do the cdu and fdp want ? " the paper asks .
but perhaps the bluntest assessment came from the berliner zeitung , and was aimed specifically at westerwelle 's party : " they ca n't do it .
they are unfit to govern .
angela merkel has brought an unpredictable , chaotic bunch into the cabinet .
angela merkel is governing with people who are in political puberty .
if they do n't grow up soon , we have another 1,360 days of hysterics and wrong decisions to look forward to . " bk / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

squabbling , indecisive , and naïve fairly sums up the opinion of most political commentators , and they also agree on who to blame : the free democratic party led by foreign minister and vice chancellor guido westerwelle , the party regarded as the big winners of last september 's election .
" with an election result of more than 14 percent , the fdp suddenly had big hopes to fulfil , " says the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" and they are not up to it yet . "
the successful election campaign seemed to promise that the fdp would establish itself outside its traditional voter base .
but it is " squandering its opportunity permanently , " the paper says .
as for merkel 's christian democratic union , they are desperate " not to be seen as the neo-liberal spectre that the opposition made them out to be before the election . "
the sueddeutsche zeitung uses a botanical metaphor to illustrate its thoughts on the new government .
the national paper likens the constantly squabbling leaders of merkel 's allies - westerwelle and christian social union leader horst seehofer - to the mimosa , a prickly , sensitive plant that closes rapidly when touched or shaken .
" angela merkel is in charge of a mimosa coalition , " the paper concludes .
" we 've seen the husk .
it 's time for the fruit . "
several papers have noted that the last government , a coalition of the center-right cdu and the center-left social democratic party , seemed to function much better , despite being considered at the time as an unworkable marriage of convenience .
as munich tabloid abendzeitung says , " many think back to it with nostalgia . "
the combination of cdu and fdp only seems to work at a state level , the paper argues .
the cologne-based koelnische rundschau also compares this coalition unfavourably to its predecessors , particularly as the cdu and the fdp went into the last election as declared allies .
" the spd / green alliance was unprepared in 1998 , and the cdu and the spd could not bring themselves to trust each other in 2005 , " the paper says , " but the cdu and the fdp do not give the impression that they want to work together . "
" what do the cdu and fdp want ? " the paper asks .
but perhaps the bluntest assessment came from the berliner zeitung , and was aimed specifically at westerwelle 's party : " they ca n't do it .
they are unfit to govern .
angela merkel has brought an unpredictable , chaotic bunch into the cabinet .
angela merkel is governing with people who are in political puberty .
if they do n't grow up soon , we have another 1,360 days of hysterics and wrong decisions to look forward to . " bk / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the munich international security conference gets underway , we ask two experts just how important these meetings really are . it 's the same procedure every january .
the year is barely a few weeks old and a massive stream of business travelers from all over the world is already en route to europe .
the main destinations for thousands of political leaders and executives are davos and munich .
in the swiss mountains the world economic forum , as it regularly does , this year attracted more than 2000 delegates . munich 's security conference traditionally taking place this week usually attracts around 300 participants .
but that 's not all .
add to those long established venues this year 's new global zero summit with its focus on nuclear disarmament held in paris squeezed in the few remaining days between davos and munich and the dld conference on digital innovation in munich right before the world economic forum and you can appreciate why a good travel consultant is necessary for the many people participating in more than one conference .
while the meetings in davos and munich by now have a long history , they are criticized on a regular basis for what essentially are two contradictory reasons .
one is that at these private gatherings , high-profile figures make decisions behind close doors and thus effectively undermine the work of the legitimate international bodies .
and two , that these meetings are just hyped-up talking shops that have no real significance and therefore are basically superfluous . no threat to un " i would n't share this criticism , " says juergen chrobog , a former state secretary in the german foreign office and ambassador to the us .
" i think the conferences in munich or davos are not meant to solve problems , to lead to certain results . " werner weidenfeld , who served for twelve years as the german government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations and currently directs the munich based think tank center for applied policy research , agrees that conferences such as davos and munich do not undermine the work of united nations and other institutions designated to solving global problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private meetings are no threat to the work of the un , say experts both experts point out that these conferences in no way can or want to rival the formal decision making processes at un level or other official venues .
no politician would skip an important un meeting because of these private conferences .
major decisions , the experts argue , are prepared long before important global meetings and concluded at these meetings .
what about the claim then that these private meetings are essentially much ado about nothing ?
chrobog , who declares jokingly that he himself has not only attended many , but too many of these conferences and has limited his participation in recent years , nevertheless believes that this meetings do serve an important function .
" it 's simply for people to get together and have a free exchange of views and to allow them develop their own ideas , " he says .
" that 's very important .
people have to meet , they have to get together , they have to build networks . "
events like davos and munich are attractive because they make it easy to do exactly that participants can meet lots of people in a very short time .
nothing wrong with communication just because these conferences do n't produce results , does n't mean they are n't valuable , weidenfeld told deutsche welle and points to an important , but often neglected aspect of the nature of politics .
" you have to realize that politics is also about communication , " he says .
" everything is perception .
how do the other actors perceive the reality and the problems .
what do the others think that i am thinking and what is their reaction to my way of thinking about a problem .
i think this is the positive aspect of these kind of activities . "
while chrobog and weidenfeld argue that private gatherings like the ones in davos and munich have a place in the political calendar , they both feel that with many new venues springing up all the time , the conference circuit has gotten very crowded and events have become too big and similar in nature .
the biggest danger for the conferences however , stems not from the meetings themselves , but from the expectations of concrete outcomes .
people and the media should n't exaggerate the meaning of those conferences and expect concrete results . " it 's more or less a market place of politics to exchange perceptions " , says weidenfeld .
" it is a certain form of a vanity fair with a great deficit on strategic thinking and real problem solving . "
no problem solving " i think they have a certain importance , but they will not change the world " , says juergen chrobog who currently heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt .
" they never helped me to solve a problem , to be very frank . "
but , he adds , some of the people he met at conferences did actually help him to solve problems later .

" then there was a coffee break and i observed that none of the other top politicians from america , from germany or elsewhere talked to president sarkozy .
he stood alone in the corner , nobody talked to him , because his speech had been too tough in their mind .
then i myself went to him and talked to him and he was so grateful that he almost tried to kiss me .

as the munich international security conference gets underway , we ask two experts just how important these meetings really are . it 's the same procedure every january .
the year is barely a few weeks old and a massive stream of business travelers from all over the world is already en route to europe .
the main destinations for thousands of political leaders and executives are davos and munich .
in the swiss mountains the world economic forum , as it regularly does , this year attracted more than 2000 delegates . munich 's security conference traditionally taking place this week usually attracts around 300 participants .
but that 's not all .
add to those long established venues this year 's new global zero summit with its focus on nuclear disarmament held in paris squeezed in the few remaining days between davos and munich and the dld conference on digital innovation in munich right before the world economic forum and you can appreciate why a good travel consultant is necessary for the many people participating in more than one conference .
while the meetings in davos and munich by now have a long history , they are criticized on a regular basis for what essentially are two contradictory reasons .
one is that at these private gatherings , high-profile figures make decisions behind close doors and thus effectively undermine the work of the legitimate international bodies .
and two , that these meetings are just hyped-up talking shops that have no real significance and therefore are basically superfluous . no threat to un " i would n't share this criticism , " says juergen chrobog , a former state secretary in the german foreign office and ambassador to the us .
" i think the conferences in munich or davos are not meant to solve problems , to lead to certain results . " werner weidenfeld , who served for twelve years as the german government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations and currently directs the munich based think tank center for applied policy research , agrees that conferences such as davos and munich do not undermine the work of united nations and other institutions designated to solving global problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private meetings are no threat to the work of the un , say experts both experts point out that these conferences in no way can or want to rival the formal decision making processes at un level or other official venues .
no politician would skip an important un meeting because of these private conferences .
major decisions , the experts argue , are prepared long before important global meetings and concluded at these meetings .
what about the claim then that these private meetings are essentially much ado about nothing ?
chrobog , who declares jokingly that he himself has not only attended many , but too many of these conferences and has limited his participation in recent years , nevertheless believes that this meetings do serve an important function .
" it 's simply for people to get together and have a free exchange of views and to allow them develop their own ideas , " he says .
" that 's very important .
people have to meet , they have to get together , they have to build networks . "
events like davos and munich are attractive because they make it easy to do exactly that participants can meet lots of people in a very short time .
nothing wrong with communication just because these conferences do n't produce results , does n't mean they are n't valuable , weidenfeld told deutsche welle and points to an important , but often neglected aspect of the nature of politics .
" you have to realize that politics is also about communication , " he says .
" everything is perception .
how do the other actors perceive the reality and the problems .
what do the others think that i am thinking and what is their reaction to my way of thinking about a problem .
i think this is the positive aspect of these kind of activities . "
while chrobog and weidenfeld argue that private gatherings like the ones in davos and munich have a place in the political calendar , they both feel that with many new venues springing up all the time , the conference circuit has gotten very crowded and events have become too big and similar in nature .
the biggest danger for the conferences however , stems not from the meetings themselves , but from the expectations of concrete outcomes .
people and the media should n't exaggerate the meaning of those conferences and expect concrete results . " it 's more or less a market place of politics to exchange perceptions " , says weidenfeld .
" it is a certain form of a vanity fair with a great deficit on strategic thinking and real problem solving . "
no problem solving " i think they have a certain importance , but they will not change the world " , says juergen chrobog who currently heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt .
" they never helped me to solve a problem , to be very frank . "
but , he adds , some of the people he met at conferences did actually help him to solve problems later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicholas sarkozy did n't mince words last year in munich asked about how he personally benefitted from these conferences , werner weidenfeld tells an anecdote about last year 's security conference in munich involving french president nicolas sarkozy .
the president had just delivered a very tough speech that stood out from the previous soft addresses given by other leaders .
" then there was a coffee break and i observed that none of the other top politicians from america , from germany or elsewhere talked to president sarkozy .
he stood alone in the corner , nobody talked to him , because his speech had been too tough in their mind .
then i myself went to him and talked to him and he was so grateful that he almost tried to kiss me .
so i learned first hand that sarkozy does n't only have friends in international politics . "

" here we have a new form of bank robbery , " swiss lawmaker pirmin bischof told germany 's deutschlandfunk radio .
" before , you had to go to the bank and get hold of the money with a weapon .
today you can do it electronically by stealing data . ” but schaeuble has said that the government would be legally justified in buying the stolen data .

the junior coalition partners , the free democratic party , have been condemned in particular as " unfit to govern . " the new german government under chancellor angela merkel could hardly have feared worse reviews on its first 100 days in office .
not a single major newspaper could muster a kind assessment , and some have been merciless .
squabbling , indecisive , and naïve fairly sums up the opinion of most political commentators , and they also agree on who to blame : the free democratic party led by foreign minister and vice chancellor guido westerwelle , the party regarded as the big winners of last september 's election .
" with an election result of more than 14 percent , the fdp suddenly had big hopes to fulfil , " says the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" and they are not up to it yet . "
the successful election campaign seemed to promise that the fdp would establish itself outside its traditional voter base .
but it is " squandering its opportunity permanently , " the paper says .
as for merkel 's christian democratic union , they are desperate " not to be seen as the neo-liberal spectre that the opposition made them out to be before the election . "
the sueddeutsche zeitung uses a botanical metaphor to illustrate its thoughts on the new government .
the national paper likens the constantly squabbling leaders of merkel 's allies - westerwelle and christian social union leader horst seehofer - to the mimosa , a prickly , sensitive plant that closes rapidly when touched or shaken .
" angela merkel is in charge of a mimosa coalition , " the paper concludes .
" we 've seen the husk .
it 's time for the fruit . "
several papers have noted that the last government , a coalition of the center-right cdu and the center-left social democratic party , seemed to function much better , despite being considered at the time as an unworkable marriage of convenience .
as munich tabloid abendzeitung says , " many think back to it with nostalgia . "
the combination of cdu and fdp only seems to work at a state level , the paper argues .
the cologne-based koelnische rundschau also compares this coalition unfavourably to its predecessors , particularly as the cdu and the fdp went into the last election as declared allies .
" the spd / green alliance was unprepared in 1998 , and the cdu and the spd could not bring themselves to trust each other in 2005 , " the paper says , " but the cdu and the fdp do not give the impression that they want to work together . "
" what do the cdu and fdp want ? " the paper asks .
but perhaps the bluntest assessment came from the berliner zeitung , and was aimed specifically at westerwelle 's party : " they ca n't do it .
they are unfit to govern .
angela merkel has brought an unpredictable , chaotic bunch into the cabinet .

the alliance 's head said he will now push defense ministers for more trainers . nato defense ministers on wednesday began two day of talks in istanbul that will touch on restructuring the alliance , troop levels in kosovo and the ongoing united nations-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in afghanistan .
while many of the involved countries have provided more combat troops , fulfilling a target set by isaf 's commander , us general stanley mcchrystal , it does n't mean there wo n't be calls for more .
" allies and partners have made significant contributions , but it is n't yet sufficient , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen told a news briefing on monday .
he said more contributions may be needed , especially in the area of police and military training .
" this training mission is of utmost importance to accomplish the strategy we all agree on , " he said .
" the more we invest in this transition now , the sooner the day when the afghans can take responsibility themselves . "
thousands more needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has already begun shifting its focus in afghanistan to police training according to rasmussen , nato needs 21 more army training teams and more than 100 police training teams if they are to get afghan forces up to the levels currently required .
each police training team consists of 20 to 30 trainers .
officials say the police training is difficult .
like more than half of afghans , many police recruits can not read and must spend months in the classroom learning to read well enough to understand drivers licenses and identity papers before they begin their eight-week police course .
the european union has promised to send 400 police trainers .
but european police must volunteer to be sent to afghanistan , and only about 240 have done so - apparently due to safety concerns .
troop reductions in kosovo on thursday night the defense ministers are set to discuss spending and streamlining nato 's structures .
the talks on afghanistan are scheduled for friday morning , with mcchrystal to attend along with the non-nato members taking part in isaf , outgoing un special envoy in kabul kai eide and eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton .
also on the agenda for friday is kosovo .
on monday it was decided to reduce troops there to 10,200 , and the ministers are set to confirm those numbers will drop even further , to 5,700 , by the end of the year if the region remains calm. hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the junior coalition partners , the free democratic party , have been condemned in particular as " unfit to govern . " the new german government under chancellor angela merkel could hardly have feared worse reviews on its first 100 days in office .
not a single major newspaper could muster a kind assessment , and some have been merciless .
squabbling , indecisive , and naïve fairly sums up the opinion of most political commentators , and they also agree on who to blame : the free democratic party led by foreign minister and vice chancellor guido westerwelle , the party regarded as the big winners of last september 's election .
" with an election result of more than 14 percent , the fdp suddenly had big hopes to fulfil , " says the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" and they are not up to it yet . "
the successful election campaign seemed to promise that the fdp would establish itself outside its traditional voter base .
but it is " squandering its opportunity permanently , " the paper says .
as for merkel 's christian democratic union , they are desperate " not to be seen as the neo-liberal spectre that the opposition made them out to be before the election . "
the sueddeutsche zeitung uses a botanical metaphor to illustrate its thoughts on the new government .
the national paper likens the constantly squabbling leaders of merkel 's allies - westerwelle and christian social union leader horst seehofer - to the mimosa , a prickly , sensitive plant that closes rapidly when touched or shaken .
" angela merkel is in charge of a mimosa coalition , " the paper concludes .
" we 've seen the husk .
it 's time for the fruit . "
several papers have noted that the last government , a coalition of the center-right cdu and the center-left social democratic party , seemed to function much better , despite being considered at the time as an unworkable marriage of convenience .
as munich tabloid abendzeitung says , " many think back to it with nostalgia . "
the combination of cdu and fdp only seems to work at a state level , the paper argues .
the cologne-based koelnische rundschau also compares this coalition unfavourably to its predecessors , particularly as the cdu and the fdp went into the last election as declared allies .
" the spd / green alliance was unprepared in 1998 , and the cdu and the spd could not bring themselves to trust each other in 2005 , " the paper says , " but the cdu and the fdp do not give the impression that they want to work together . "
" what do the cdu and fdp want ? " the paper asks .
but perhaps the bluntest assessment came from the berliner zeitung , and was aimed specifically at westerwelle 's party : " they ca n't do it .
they are unfit to govern .
angela merkel has brought an unpredictable , chaotic bunch into the cabinet .
angela merkel is governing with people who are in political puberty .
if they do n't grow up soon , we have another 1,360 days of hysterics and wrong decisions to look forward to . " bk / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

squabbling , indecisive , and naïve fairly sums up the opinion of most political commentators , and they also agree on who to blame : the free democratic party led by foreign minister and vice chancellor guido westerwelle , the party regarded as the big winners of last september 's election .
" with an election result of more than 14 percent , the fdp suddenly had big hopes to fulfil , " says the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" and they are not up to it yet . "
the successful election campaign seemed to promise that the fdp would establish itself outside its traditional voter base .
but it is " squandering its opportunity permanently , " the paper says .
as for merkel 's christian democratic union , they are desperate " not to be seen as the neo-liberal spectre that the opposition made them out to be before the election . "
the sueddeutsche zeitung uses a botanical metaphor to illustrate its thoughts on the new government .
the national paper likens the constantly squabbling leaders of merkel 's allies - westerwelle and christian social union leader horst seehofer - to the mimosa , a prickly , sensitive plant that closes rapidly when touched or shaken .
" angela merkel is in charge of a mimosa coalition , " the paper concludes .
" we 've seen the husk .
it 's time for the fruit . "
several papers have noted that the last government , a coalition of the center-right cdu and the center-left social democratic party , seemed to function much better , despite being considered at the time as an unworkable marriage of convenience .
as munich tabloid abendzeitung says , " many think back to it with nostalgia . "
the combination of cdu and fdp only seems to work at a state level , the paper argues .
the cologne-based koelnische rundschau also compares this coalition unfavourably to its predecessors , particularly as the cdu and the fdp went into the last election as declared allies .
" the spd / green alliance was unprepared in 1998 , and the cdu and the spd could not bring themselves to trust each other in 2005 , " the paper says , " but the cdu and the fdp do not give the impression that they want to work together . "
" what do the cdu and fdp want ? " the paper asks .
but perhaps the bluntest assessment came from the berliner zeitung , and was aimed specifically at westerwelle 's party : " they ca n't do it .
they are unfit to govern .
angela merkel has brought an unpredictable , chaotic bunch into the cabinet .

the junior coalition partners , the free democratic party , have been condemned in particular as " unfit to govern . " the new german government under chancellor angela merkel could hardly have feared worse reviews on its first 100 days in office .
not a single major newspaper could muster a kind assessment , and some have been merciless .
squabbling , indecisive , and naïve fairly sums up the opinion of most political commentators , and they also agree on who to blame : the free democratic party led by foreign minister and vice chancellor guido westerwelle , the party regarded as the big winners of last september 's election .
" with an election result of more than 14 percent , the fdp suddenly had big hopes to fulfil , " says the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" and they are not up to it yet . "
the successful election campaign seemed to promise that the fdp would establish itself outside its traditional voter base .
but it is " squandering its opportunity permanently , " the paper says .
as for merkel 's christian democratic union , they are desperate " not to be seen as the neo-liberal spectre that the opposition made them out to be before the election . "
the sueddeutsche zeitung uses a botanical metaphor to illustrate its thoughts on the new government .
the national paper likens the constantly squabbling leaders of merkel 's allies - westerwelle and christian social union leader horst seehofer - to the mimosa , a prickly , sensitive plant that closes rapidly when touched or shaken .
" angela merkel is in charge of a mimosa coalition , " the paper concludes .
" we 've seen the husk .
it 's time for the fruit . "
several papers have noted that the last government , a coalition of the center-right cdu and the center-left social democratic party , seemed to function much better , despite being considered at the time as an unworkable marriage of convenience .
as munich tabloid abendzeitung says , " many think back to it with nostalgia . "
the combination of cdu and fdp only seems to work at a state level , the paper argues .
the cologne-based koelnische rundschau also compares this coalition unfavourably to its predecessors , particularly as the cdu and the fdp went into the last election as declared allies .
" the spd / green alliance was unprepared in 1998 , and the cdu and the spd could not bring themselves to trust each other in 2005 , " the paper says , " but the cdu and the fdp do not give the impression that they want to work together . "
" what do the cdu and fdp want ? " the paper asks .
but perhaps the bluntest assessment came from the berliner zeitung , and was aimed specifically at westerwelle 's party : " they ca n't do it .
they are unfit to govern .
angela merkel has brought an unpredictable , chaotic bunch into the cabinet .
angela merkel is governing with people who are in political puberty .
if they do n't grow up soon , we have another 1,360 days of hysterics and wrong decisions to look forward to . " bk / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the munich international security conference gets underway , we ask two experts just how important these meetings really are . it 's the same procedure every january .
the year is barely a few weeks old and a massive stream of business travelers from all over the world is already en route to europe .
the main destinations for thousands of political leaders and executives are davos and munich .
in the swiss mountains the world economic forum , as it regularly does , this year attracted more than 2000 delegates . munich 's security conference traditionally taking place this week usually attracts around 300 participants .
but that 's not all .
add to those long established venues this year 's new global zero summit with its focus on nuclear disarmament held in paris squeezed in the few remaining days between davos and munich and the dld conference on digital innovation in munich right before the world economic forum and you can appreciate why a good travel consultant is necessary for the many people participating in more than one conference .
while the meetings in davos and munich by now have a long history , they are criticized on a regular basis for what essentially are two contradictory reasons .
one is that at these private gatherings , high-profile figures make decisions behind close doors and thus effectively undermine the work of the legitimate international bodies .
and two , that these meetings are just hyped-up talking shops that have no real significance and therefore are basically superfluous . no threat to un " i would n't share this criticism , " says juergen chrobog , a former state secretary in the german foreign office and ambassador to the us .
" i think the conferences in munich or davos are not meant to solve problems , to lead to certain results . " werner weidenfeld , who served for twelve years as the german government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations and currently directs the munich based think tank center for applied policy research , agrees that conferences such as davos and munich do not undermine the work of united nations and other institutions designated to solving global problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private meetings are no threat to the work of the un , say experts both experts point out that these conferences in no way can or want to rival the formal decision making processes at un level or other official venues .
no politician would skip an important un meeting because of these private conferences .
major decisions , the experts argue , are prepared long before important global meetings and concluded at these meetings .
what about the claim then that these private meetings are essentially much ado about nothing ?
chrobog , who declares jokingly that he himself has not only attended many , but too many of these conferences and has limited his participation in recent years , nevertheless believes that this meetings do serve an important function .
" it 's simply for people to get together and have a free exchange of views and to allow them develop their own ideas , " he says .
" that 's very important .
people have to meet , they have to get together , they have to build networks . "
events like davos and munich are attractive because they make it easy to do exactly that participants can meet lots of people in a very short time .
nothing wrong with communication just because these conferences do n't produce results , does n't mean they are n't valuable , weidenfeld told deutsche welle and points to an important , but often neglected aspect of the nature of politics .
" you have to realize that politics is also about communication , " he says .
" everything is perception .
how do the other actors perceive the reality and the problems .
what do the others think that i am thinking and what is their reaction to my way of thinking about a problem .
i think this is the positive aspect of these kind of activities . "
while chrobog and weidenfeld argue that private gatherings like the ones in davos and munich have a place in the political calendar , they both feel that with many new venues springing up all the time , the conference circuit has gotten very crowded and events have become too big and similar in nature .
the biggest danger for the conferences however , stems not from the meetings themselves , but from the expectations of concrete outcomes .
people and the media should n't exaggerate the meaning of those conferences and expect concrete results . " it 's more or less a market place of politics to exchange perceptions " , says weidenfeld .
" it is a certain form of a vanity fair with a great deficit on strategic thinking and real problem solving . "
no problem solving " i think they have a certain importance , but they will not change the world " , says juergen chrobog who currently heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt .
" they never helped me to solve a problem , to be very frank . "
but , he adds , some of the people he met at conferences did actually help him to solve problems later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicholas sarkozy did n't mince words last year in munich asked about how he personally benefitted from these conferences , werner weidenfeld tells an anecdote about last year 's security conference in munich involving french president nicolas sarkozy .
the president had just delivered a very tough speech that stood out from the previous soft addresses given by other leaders .
" then there was a coffee break and i observed that none of the other top politicians from america , from germany or elsewhere talked to president sarkozy .
he stood alone in the corner , nobody talked to him , because his speech had been too tough in their mind .

as the munich international security conference gets underway , we ask two experts just how important these meetings really are . it 's the same procedure every january .
the year is barely a few weeks old and a massive stream of business travelers from all over the world is already en route to europe .
the main destinations for thousands of political leaders and executives are davos and munich .
in the swiss mountains the world economic forum , as it regularly does , this year attracted more than 2000 delegates . munich 's security conference traditionally taking place this week usually attracts around 300 participants .
but that 's not all .
add to those long established venues this year 's new global zero summit with its focus on nuclear disarmament held in paris squeezed in the few remaining days between davos and munich and the dld conference on digital innovation in munich right before the world economic forum and you can appreciate why a good travel consultant is necessary for the many people participating in more than one conference .
while the meetings in davos and munich by now have a long history , they are criticized on a regular basis for what essentially are two contradictory reasons .
one is that at these private gatherings , high-profile figures make decisions behind close doors and thus effectively undermine the work of the legitimate international bodies .
and two , that these meetings are just hyped-up talking shops that have no real significance and therefore are basically superfluous . no threat to un " i would n't share this criticism , " says juergen chrobog , a former state secretary in the german foreign office and ambassador to the us .
" i think the conferences in munich or davos are not meant to solve problems , to lead to certain results . " werner weidenfeld , who served for twelve years as the german government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations and currently directs the munich based think tank center for applied policy research , agrees that conferences such as davos and munich do not undermine the work of united nations and other institutions designated to solving global problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private meetings are no threat to the work of the un , say experts both experts point out that these conferences in no way can or want to rival the formal decision making processes at un level or other official venues .
no politician would skip an important un meeting because of these private conferences .
major decisions , the experts argue , are prepared long before important global meetings and concluded at these meetings .
what about the claim then that these private meetings are essentially much ado about nothing ?
chrobog , who declares jokingly that he himself has not only attended many , but too many of these conferences and has limited his participation in recent years , nevertheless believes that this meetings do serve an important function .
" it 's simply for people to get together and have a free exchange of views and to allow them develop their own ideas , " he says .
" that 's very important .
people have to meet , they have to get together , they have to build networks . "
events like davos and munich are attractive because they make it easy to do exactly that participants can meet lots of people in a very short time .
nothing wrong with communication just because these conferences do n't produce results , does n't mean they are n't valuable , weidenfeld told deutsche welle and points to an important , but often neglected aspect of the nature of politics .
" you have to realize that politics is also about communication , " he says .
" everything is perception .
how do the other actors perceive the reality and the problems .
what do the others think that i am thinking and what is their reaction to my way of thinking about a problem .
i think this is the positive aspect of these kind of activities . "
while chrobog and weidenfeld argue that private gatherings like the ones in davos and munich have a place in the political calendar , they both feel that with many new venues springing up all the time , the conference circuit has gotten very crowded and events have become too big and similar in nature .
the biggest danger for the conferences however , stems not from the meetings themselves , but from the expectations of concrete outcomes .
people and the media should n't exaggerate the meaning of those conferences and expect concrete results . " it 's more or less a market place of politics to exchange perceptions " , says weidenfeld .

he made this surprising statement shortly after being announced jury president of the 2010 berlinale .
but how could someone who so rarely sets foot in a movie theater end up in this position ?
and why does he pass on seeing so many movies ?
probably because he is very busy making them himself . at home in america werner herzog lives in los angeles , where he churns out one film after another .
but just a few years ago , no one would have expected him to ever get this far .
after all , his counterparts - german filmmakers wim wenders and volker schloendorff - gave up on their hollywood careers a long time ago and have since returned to their homeland . munich-born herzog , on the other hand , has taken a step forward in his career and now makes big-budget movies in the us , working with a-list stars like christian bale and nicolas cage .
herzog has never been a stranger to success , though ; he is credited with injecting new spirit into german cinema with his first films in the late 1960s . bildunterschrift : herzog 's " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " stars nicolas cage after that he relocated five times with his favorite actor , klaus kinski , in order to tackle daring film projects in places like south america .
his film " fitzcarraldo " has been made the subject of various books and documentaries , and his 1979 film " nosferatu the vampyre " has been hailed as one of the greatest achievements of new german cinema . following these cinematic conquests , herzog temporarily withdrew from the big screen , perhaps partly due to the death of klaus kinski .
over the next few years , he produced unconventional documentaries and staged operas . it was n't until just a few years ago that herzog claimed a real foothold in the us .
this is not a well-known fact in germany , though - maybe because some of herzog 's american-made films did not make it into german cinemas . " i never forgot about germany , " said herzog at one stage .
" but - i do n't know why - germany forgot about me . " he has repeatedly emphasized how close he still feels to his homeland : " i have left my country and live in los angeles today .
and i make films in antarctica , in south america , in the usa .
but despite this i have never abandoned my culture . " herzog 's americana based on true events , herzog 's 2007 film " rescue dawn " tells the story of a us soldier with a german background who is shot down and imprisoned in laos during the vietnam war .
then there are also his more recent american films - " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " and " my son , my son , what have ye done " - both of which premiered at the 2009 venice film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog 's favorite actor , klaus kinski , worked with him on several films whoever has had the chance to meet werner herzog at a film festival or to interview him , knows that this filmmaker is also a great entertainer .
he likes to surprise people , is keen to go against the grain , and does not like to be categorized . the audience at the 2010 berlinale festival should also be prepared for surprises when the awards are handed out on february 20 under werner herzog 's presiding eye . the berlinale runs from february 11-21 . author : jochen kuerten -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he 'll soon head to his native germany to serve as president of the jury for the berlinale - where he 'll watch far more films than he 's used to . herzog claims that he normally only watches two to three films per year .
he made this surprising statement shortly after being announced jury president of the 2010 berlinale .
but how could someone who so rarely sets foot in a movie theater end up in this position ?
and why does he pass on seeing so many movies ?
probably because he is very busy making them himself . at home in america werner herzog lives in los angeles , where he churns out one film after another .
but just a few years ago , no one would have expected him to ever get this far .
after all , his counterparts - german filmmakers wim wenders and volker schloendorff - gave up on their hollywood careers a long time ago and have since returned to their homeland . munich-born herzog , on the other hand , has taken a step forward in his career and now makes big-budget movies in the us , working with a-list stars like christian bale and nicolas cage .
herzog has never been a stranger to success , though ; he is credited with injecting new spirit into german cinema with his first films in the late 1960s . bildunterschrift : herzog 's " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " stars nicolas cage after that he relocated five times with his favorite actor , klaus kinski , in order to tackle daring film projects in places like south america .
his film " fitzcarraldo " has been made the subject of various books and documentaries , and his 1979 film " nosferatu the vampyre " has been hailed as one of the greatest achievements of new german cinema . following these cinematic conquests , herzog temporarily withdrew from the big screen , perhaps partly due to the death of klaus kinski .
over the next few years , he produced unconventional documentaries and staged operas . it was n't until just a few years ago that herzog claimed a real foothold in the us .
this is not a well-known fact in germany , though - maybe because some of herzog 's american-made films did not make it into german cinemas . " i never forgot about germany , " said herzog at one stage .
" but - i do n't know why - germany forgot about me . " he has repeatedly emphasized how close he still feels to his homeland : " i have left my country and live in los angeles today .
and i make films in antarctica , in south america , in the usa .
but despite this i have never abandoned my culture . " herzog 's americana based on true events , herzog 's 2007 film " rescue dawn " tells the story of a us soldier with a german background who is shot down and imprisoned in laos during the vietnam war .
then there are also his more recent american films - " bad lieutenant : port of call new orleans " and " my son , my son , what have ye done " - both of which premiered at the 2009 venice film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herzog 's favorite actor , klaus kinski , worked with him on several films whoever has had the chance to meet werner herzog at a film festival or to interview him , knows that this filmmaker is also a great entertainer .
he likes to surprise people , is keen to go against the grain , and does not like to be categorized . the audience at the 2010 berlinale festival should also be prepared for surprises when the awards are handed out on february 20 under werner herzog 's presiding eye . the berlinale runs from february 11-21 . author : jochen kuerten -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in december , the first connections between the capital kampala and the global broadband network went live , thanks to a submarine fiber-optic cable that links to broadband networks in india and europe .
since then , the east african nation has been in an e-frenzy as excited locals begin exploring all that the web has to offer , from downloading music to watching films online .
many ugandans are euphoric , but for some the new cable offers fresh disappointments : a lack of telephone cables means high speed internet will remain out of reach for most ugandans .
for those already hooked up , however , the 17,000-kilometer -lrb- 10,563 mile -rrb- long broadband cable – known as the seacom – is a boon .
grace natabaalo , a web designer who works for the online department of the ugandan newspaper monitor , is one of the seacom 's latest converts .
she realizes that uganda is no where near european speed , but compared the cable makes the internet lightning quick compared to how it used to be .
as if to demonstrate , she clicks on a video clip on her screen ; within seconds , the clip is downloaded .
“ back then , you would download something overnight , leave the computer on and find it downloaded in the morning , after twelve hours of downloading … you could never watch this ! ”
since gaining access to the higher speed internet , natabaalo 's newspaper relaunched its website , which now incorporates previously unheard-of features like picture galleries and a video section .
bildunterschrift : the seacom cable is slowly working its way through africa opening uganda to the world though the seacom cable was officially launched in east africa mid-2009 , broadband access has only begun to trickle through to uganda over the past few weeks .
the new connection allows a much faster data transfer of 200 kilobytes per second , allowing an increasing number of ugandans to take advantage of the features natabaalo and her colleagues have already discovered .
for constantine bitwayiki , the improved web access is cause for celebration .
bitwayiki , the ugandan president 's advisor on internet issues , has big ideas about ways the new technology could be harnessed to overhaul administrative procedures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed internet will give ugandan children access to the world bitwayiki believes that greater internet use in government and private firms could be used to improve efficiency and even tackle corruption .
high speed internet could also prove invaluable for ordinary ugandans when it comes to basic tasks like getting a driving permit , which for many involves traveling long distances to the capital .
“ i 'd just need to do some basic form-filling online , if i have to pay then i go to the nearest bank and i pay , if -lsb- a picture is needed -rsb- then i send a picture online , and then my driving permit is delivered . ”
ugandan minister for trade and industry kahinda otafire is equally optimistic .
he hopes the improved connections may also entice foreign investors into the country .
otafire 's vision for uganda is one of an outsourcing hub for the rest of the world .
“ the best english is spoken in east africa , and particularly in uganda , ” he said .
“ we 've got a lot of educated people ; we 've got a lot of trained manpower , so i do n't see why we do n't engage in outsourcing and getting in touch with the rest of the world . ”
infrastructure holds things back but not everyone is convinced .
so far , only government departments , the university of kampala and some major companies , like the newspaper monitor , are connected to broadband .
the rest of the country must make do with a far slower connection , and for most ugandans , internet cafés remain the only way to get online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait for the internet continues for many ugandans daniel biranda , planning director at the university of kampala 's computer sciences faculty , does not expect big changes in the near future .
“ you know , people are talking about the internet .
they are excited .
but they do n't know the technology . ”
in the early 1990s , biranda became the first ugandan to program a ugandan website .
today , he is looking for ways to connect villages outside the capital to the high-speed broad band cable and he says the key missing ingredient is the humble telephone cable .
“ in , say , stuttgart , every building -lsb- can have -rsb- internet , simply because there is a telephone line .
but the buildings we have in town , they have electricity , but they do n't have telephone lines . ”
because of that , the cost of connecting to the broadband network is expensive , and could easily outweigh the financial opportunities offered by a higher-speed connection , biranda said .
“ will that internet café generate something like the $ 3000 in a month -lsb- to cover the costs -rsb- ?
it ca n't . ”
there is a simple explanation for all of this .
in uganda , as in many developing countries , there has never been an extensive net of landline phones .
they simply skipped that step and went right to mobile phones .
and beyond the capital , little infrastructure exists already that could be used to easily set up internet connections .
this means that for the majority of ugandans , high speed internet access at home may not be a reality for years to come .

in december , the first connections between the capital kampala and the global broadband network went live , thanks to a submarine fiber-optic cable that links to broadband networks in india and europe .
since then , the east african nation has been in an e-frenzy as excited locals begin exploring all that the web has to offer , from downloading music to watching films online .
many ugandans are euphoric , but for some the new cable offers fresh disappointments : a lack of telephone cables means high speed internet will remain out of reach for most ugandans .
for those already hooked up , however , the 17,000-kilometer -lrb- 10,563 mile -rrb- long broadband cable – known as the seacom – is a boon .
grace natabaalo , a web designer who works for the online department of the ugandan newspaper monitor , is one of the seacom 's latest converts .
she realizes that uganda is no where near european speed , but compared the cable makes the internet lightning quick compared to how it used to be .
as if to demonstrate , she clicks on a video clip on her screen ; within seconds , the clip is downloaded .
“ back then , you would download something overnight , leave the computer on and find it downloaded in the morning , after twelve hours of downloading … you could never watch this ! ”
since gaining access to the higher speed internet , natabaalo 's newspaper relaunched its website , which now incorporates previously unheard-of features like picture galleries and a video section .
bildunterschrift : the seacom cable is slowly working its way through africa opening uganda to the world though the seacom cable was officially launched in east africa mid-2009 , broadband access has only begun to trickle through to uganda over the past few weeks .
the new connection allows a much faster data transfer of 200 kilobytes per second , allowing an increasing number of ugandans to take advantage of the features natabaalo and her colleagues have already discovered .
for constantine bitwayiki , the improved web access is cause for celebration .
bitwayiki , the ugandan president 's advisor on internet issues , has big ideas about ways the new technology could be harnessed to overhaul administrative procedures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high-speed internet will give ugandan children access to the world bitwayiki believes that greater internet use in government and private firms could be used to improve efficiency and even tackle corruption .
high speed internet could also prove invaluable for ordinary ugandans when it comes to basic tasks like getting a driving permit , which for many involves traveling long distances to the capital .
“ i 'd just need to do some basic form-filling online , if i have to pay then i go to the nearest bank and i pay , if -lsb- a picture is needed -rsb- then i send a picture online , and then my driving permit is delivered . ”
ugandan minister for trade and industry kahinda otafire is equally optimistic .
he hopes the improved connections may also entice foreign investors into the country .
otafire 's vision for uganda is one of an outsourcing hub for the rest of the world .
“ the best english is spoken in east africa , and particularly in uganda , ” he said .
“ we 've got a lot of educated people ; we 've got a lot of trained manpower , so i do n't see why we do n't engage in outsourcing and getting in touch with the rest of the world . ”
infrastructure holds things back but not everyone is convinced .
so far , only government departments , the university of kampala and some major companies , like the newspaper monitor , are connected to broadband .
the rest of the country must make do with a far slower connection , and for most ugandans , internet cafés remain the only way to get online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait for the internet continues for many ugandans daniel biranda , planning director at the university of kampala 's computer sciences faculty , does not expect big changes in the near future .
“ you know , people are talking about the internet .
they are excited .
but they do n't know the technology . ”
in the early 1990s , biranda became the first ugandan to program a ugandan website .
today , he is looking for ways to connect villages outside the capital to the high-speed broad band cable and he says the key missing ingredient is the humble telephone cable .
“ in , say , stuttgart , every building -lsb- can have -rsb- internet , simply because there is a telephone line .
but the buildings we have in town , they have electricity , but they do n't have telephone lines . ”
because of that , the cost of connecting to the broadband network is expensive , and could easily outweigh the financial opportunities offered by a higher-speed connection , biranda said .
“ will that internet café generate something like the $ 3000 in a month -lsb- to cover the costs -rsb- ?
it ca n't . ”
there is a simple explanation for all of this .
in uganda , as in many developing countries , there has never been an extensive net of landline phones .
they simply skipped that step and went right to mobile phones .
and beyond the capital , little infrastructure exists already that could be used to easily set up internet connections .
this means that for the majority of ugandans , high speed internet access at home may not be a reality for years to come .

"
a munich-based institute now wants to republish the nazi manifesto on racial purity and anti-semitism . a german history institute has announced it is preparing an annotated version of adolf hitler 's propaganda manifesto " mein kampf " for publication in germany .
edith raim , a historian with the munich-based institute of contemporary history , which is behind the project , said an annotated version of hitler 's memoir would serve to inform current and future generations of the evils of the dictator 's racist ideology .
" we want to obstruct new publications -lsb- of " mein kampf " -rsb- by the radical far-right once the copyright of the book runs out , " said raim .
a new edition of " mein kampf " can only be published after 2015 , when the copyright held by the bavarian state government expires , 70 years after hitler 's death .
" mein kampf , " or " my struggle " as it translates into english , contains hitler 's views on racial purity and vitriol against jews and communists .
raim said that publishing the book could help dispel the fear and reverence many feel towards it .
she said she did not believe the new publication would be used by neo-nazis to stir racism and hatred towards foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear neo-nazis will use the new book as a bible " this book will be published with scholarly annotation and will have a very limited run , " she said .

staunch opposition german authorities still consider " mein kampf " to be dangerous .
it has not been allowed to be reprinted here since the end of world war ii .
some academics argue that the book does n't provide any answers to questions about how the nazi regime gained power , as it primarily contains hitler 's own personal views .
in a statement on thursday , the state government of bavaria , which holds the copyright , said it had not given the institute permission to print the book and would seek to ban the publication in court .
" furthermore , following the expiration of the copyright in 2015 , the spreading of national-socialist ideas in germany will remain forbidden and punishable under the criminal code , " the statement added .
the institute of contemporary history has pointed out that copies of the original " mein kampf " can easily be bought outside of germany and that it would be wrong to leave the local market to foreign publishing houses once the copyright expires. uh / dfm / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

negotiations are n't set to resume until after the world cup in june . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- has said the fate of national team coach joachim loew will not be decided until after the upcoming world cup in south africa in june .
what looked like it would be a simple contract extension has turned into a power struggle , with loew reportedly asking for a signing-on fee equivalent to a year 's salary .
" basically , both sides are still interested in working together but we were unable to reach agreement on important aspects of a deal , " explained dfb president theo zwanziger after a specially convened board meeting thursday at the organization 's headquarters in frankfurt .
loew 's current contract expires after the next world cup , where germany has been pooled with australia , serbia and ghana .

the alliance 's head said he will now push defense ministers for more trainers . nato defense ministers on wednesday began two day of talks in istanbul that will touch on restructuring the alliance , troop levels in kosovo and the ongoing united nations-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in afghanistan .
while many of the involved countries have provided more combat troops , fulfilling a target set by isaf 's commander , us general stanley mcchrystal , it does n't mean there wo n't be calls for more .
" allies and partners have made significant contributions , but it is n't yet sufficient , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen told a news briefing on monday .
he said more contributions may be needed , especially in the area of police and military training .
" this training mission is of utmost importance to accomplish the strategy we all agree on , " he said .
" the more we invest in this transition now , the sooner the day when the afghans can take responsibility themselves . "
thousands more needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has already begun shifting its focus in afghanistan to police training according to rasmussen , nato needs 21 more army training teams and more than 100 police training teams if they are to get afghan forces up to the levels currently required .
each police training team consists of 20 to 30 trainers .
officials say the police training is difficult .
like more than half of afghans , many police recruits can not read and must spend months in the classroom learning to read well enough to understand drivers licenses and identity papers before they begin their eight-week police course .
the european union has promised to send 400 police trainers .
but european police must volunteer to be sent to afghanistan , and only about 240 have done so - apparently due to safety concerns .
troop reductions in kosovo on thursday night the defense ministers are set to discuss spending and streamlining nato 's structures .
the talks on afghanistan are scheduled for friday morning , with mcchrystal to attend along with the non-nato members taking part in isaf , outgoing un special envoy in kabul kai eide and eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton .
also on the agenda for friday is kosovo .
on monday it was decided to reduce troops there to 10,200 , and the ministers are set to confirm those numbers will drop even further , to 5,700 , by the end of the year if the region remains calm. hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 04.02.2010 press review : 100 days - a coalition in political puberty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel rules a coalition with two prickly junior partners germany 's newspapers have given a scathing assessment of the first 100 days of the new government .
the junior coalition partners , the free democratic party , have been condemned in particular as " unfit to govern . " the new german government under chancellor angela merkel could hardly have feared worse reviews on its first 100 days in office .
not a single major newspaper could muster a kind assessment , and some have been merciless .
squabbling , indecisive , and naïve fairly sums up the opinion of most political commentators , and they also agree on who to blame : the free democratic party led by foreign minister and vice chancellor guido westerwelle , the party regarded as the big winners of last september 's election .
" with an election result of more than 14 percent , the fdp suddenly had big hopes to fulfil , " says the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" and they are not up to it yet . "
the successful election campaign seemed to promise that the fdp would establish itself outside its traditional voter base .
but it is " squandering its opportunity permanently , " the paper says .
as for merkel 's christian democratic union , they are desperate " not to be seen as the neo-liberal spectre that the opposition made them out to be before the election . "
the sueddeutsche zeitung uses a botanical metaphor to illustrate its thoughts on the new government .
the national paper likens the constantly squabbling leaders of merkel 's allies - westerwelle and christian social union leader horst seehofer - to the mimosa , a prickly , sensitive plant that closes rapidly when touched or shaken .
" angela merkel is in charge of a mimosa coalition , " the paper concludes .
" we 've seen the husk .
it 's time for the fruit . "
several papers have noted that the last government , a coalition of the center-right cdu and the center-left social democratic party , seemed to function much better , despite being considered at the time as an unworkable marriage of convenience .
as munich tabloid abendzeitung says , " many think back to it with nostalgia . "
the combination of cdu and fdp only seems to work at a state level , the paper argues .
the cologne-based koelnische rundschau also compares this coalition unfavourably to its predecessors , particularly as the cdu and the fdp went into the last election as declared allies .
" the spd / green alliance was unprepared in 1998 , and the cdu and the spd could not bring themselves to trust each other in 2005 , " the paper says , " but the cdu and the fdp do not give the impression that they want to work together . "
" what do the cdu and fdp want ? " the paper asks .
but perhaps the bluntest assessment came from the berliner zeitung , and was aimed specifically at westerwelle 's party : " they ca n't do it .
they are unfit to govern .
angela merkel has brought an unpredictable , chaotic bunch into the cabinet .
angela merkel is governing with people who are in political puberty .
if they do n't grow up soon , we have another 1,360 days of hysterics and wrong decisions to look forward to . " bk / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the alliance 's head said he will now push defense ministers for more trainers . nato defense ministers on wednesday began two day of talks in istanbul that will touch on restructuring the alliance , troop levels in kosovo and the ongoing united nations-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in afghanistan .
while many of the involved countries have provided more combat troops , fulfilling a target set by isaf 's commander , us general stanley mcchrystal , it does n't mean there wo n't be calls for more .
" allies and partners have made significant contributions , but it is n't yet sufficient , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen told a news briefing on monday .
he said more contributions may be needed , especially in the area of police and military training .
" this training mission is of utmost importance to accomplish the strategy we all agree on , " he said .
" the more we invest in this transition now , the sooner the day when the afghans can take responsibility themselves . "
thousands more needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has already begun shifting its focus in afghanistan to police training according to rasmussen , nato needs 21 more army training teams and more than 100 police training teams if they are to get afghan forces up to the levels currently required .
each police training team consists of 20 to 30 trainers .
officials say the police training is difficult .
like more than half of afghans , many police recruits can not read and must spend months in the classroom learning to read well enough to understand drivers licenses and identity papers before they begin their eight-week police course .
the european union has promised to send 400 police trainers .
but european police must volunteer to be sent to afghanistan , and only about 240 have done so - apparently due to safety concerns .
troop reductions in kosovo on thursday night the defense ministers are set to discuss spending and streamlining nato 's structures .
the talks on afghanistan are scheduled for friday morning , with mcchrystal to attend along with the non-nato members taking part in isaf , outgoing un special envoy in kabul kai eide and eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton .
also on the agenda for friday is kosovo .
on monday it was decided to reduce troops there to 10,200 , and the ministers are set to confirm those numbers will drop even further , to 5,700 , by the end of the year if the region remains calm. hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the junior coalition partners , the free democratic party , have been condemned in particular as " unfit to govern . " the new german government under chancellor angela merkel could hardly have feared worse reviews on its first 100 days in office .
not a single major newspaper could muster a kind assessment , and some have been merciless .
squabbling , indecisive , and naïve fairly sums up the opinion of most political commentators , and they also agree on who to blame : the free democratic party led by foreign minister and vice chancellor guido westerwelle , the party regarded as the big winners of last september 's election .
" with an election result of more than 14 percent , the fdp suddenly had big hopes to fulfil , " says the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" and they are not up to it yet . "
the successful election campaign seemed to promise that the fdp would establish itself outside its traditional voter base .
but it is " squandering its opportunity permanently , " the paper says .
as for merkel 's christian democratic union , they are desperate " not to be seen as the neo-liberal spectre that the opposition made them out to be before the election . "
the sueddeutsche zeitung uses a botanical metaphor to illustrate its thoughts on the new government .
the national paper likens the constantly squabbling leaders of merkel 's allies - westerwelle and christian social union leader horst seehofer - to the mimosa , a prickly , sensitive plant that closes rapidly when touched or shaken .
" angela merkel is in charge of a mimosa coalition , " the paper concludes .
" we 've seen the husk .
it 's time for the fruit . "
several papers have noted that the last government , a coalition of the center-right cdu and the center-left social democratic party , seemed to function much better , despite being considered at the time as an unworkable marriage of convenience .
as munich tabloid abendzeitung says , " many think back to it with nostalgia . "
the combination of cdu and fdp only seems to work at a state level , the paper argues .
the cologne-based koelnische rundschau also compares this coalition unfavourably to its predecessors , particularly as the cdu and the fdp went into the last election as declared allies .
" the spd / green alliance was unprepared in 1998 , and the cdu and the spd could not bring themselves to trust each other in 2005 , " the paper says , " but the cdu and the fdp do not give the impression that they want to work together . "
" what do the cdu and fdp want ? " the paper asks .
but perhaps the bluntest assessment came from the berliner zeitung , and was aimed specifically at westerwelle 's party : " they ca n't do it .
they are unfit to govern .
angela merkel has brought an unpredictable , chaotic bunch into the cabinet .

"
a munich-based institute now wants to republish the nazi manifesto on racial purity and anti-semitism . a german history institute has announced it is preparing an annotated version of adolf hitler 's propaganda manifesto " mein kampf " for publication in germany .
edith raim , a historian with the munich-based institute of contemporary history , which is behind the project , said an annotated version of hitler 's memoir would serve to inform current and future generations of the evils of the dictator 's racist ideology .
" we want to obstruct new publications -lsb- of " mein kampf " -rsb- by the radical far-right once the copyright of the book runs out , " said raim .
a new edition of " mein kampf " can only be published after 2015 , when the copyright held by the bavarian state government expires , 70 years after hitler 's death .
" mein kampf , " or " my struggle " as it translates into english , contains hitler 's views on racial purity and vitriol against jews and communists .
raim said that publishing the book could help dispel the fear and reverence many feel towards it .
she said she did not believe the new publication would be used by neo-nazis to stir racism and hatred towards foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear neo-nazis will use the new book as a bible " this book will be published with scholarly annotation and will have a very limited run , " she said .
" after all , it 'll be so expensive that i can not imagine that any neo-nazi will ever buy it . "
staunch opposition german authorities still consider " mein kampf " to be dangerous .
it has not been allowed to be reprinted here since the end of world war ii .
some academics argue that the book does n't provide any answers to questions about how the nazi regime gained power , as it primarily contains hitler 's own personal views .
in a statement on thursday , the state government of bavaria , which holds the copyright , said it had not given the institute permission to print the book and would seek to ban the publication in court .
" furthermore , following the expiration of the copyright in 2015 , the spreading of national-socialist ideas in germany will remain forbidden and punishable under the criminal code , " the statement added .
the institute of contemporary history has pointed out that copies of the original " mein kampf " can easily be bought outside of germany and that it would be wrong to leave the local market to foreign publishing houses once the copyright expires. uh / dfm / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
