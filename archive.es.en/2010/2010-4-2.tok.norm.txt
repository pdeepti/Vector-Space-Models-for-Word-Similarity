his huge country is very thinly populated .
however , this does not mean it does n't have a number of serious environmental problems . mongolia hopes to benefit from german know-how when it comes to dealing with climate change , the country 's environment minister gansukh luimed told deutsche welle . " we are currently developing our climate change adaptation strategy .
germany has a long tradition and experience in forest management .
and it has already developed climate models for the next 100 years . " we are sharing experience in these fields .
there has also been research done in germany and we hope to learn some things that we can implement in mongolia . " considerable environmental problems gansukh pointed out that mongolia faced considerable problems related to climate change despite the fact that it is a landlocked country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overgrazing has become a serious problem " the average elevation in mongolia is around 1,500 meters above sea level , " he explained .
" and due to our geographical conditions , mongolia is one of the countries which are very strongly impacted by the global climate change . " " this can be illustrated by one figure : the global average temperature rise has been of 0.74 degrees centigrade , whereas in mongolia temperatures have risen by 2.1 degrees in the past 70 years , three times the global average .
this causes serious problems such as water shortage , the drying up of rivers and springs , as well as drought and increasing desertification , which also leads to biodiversity loss . " 70 percent of mongolia affected by desertification the minister stated that as much as 70 percent of mongolia 's territory was affected by desertification .
but climate change is not the only problem .
many mongolians depend on sheep and other animals for their livelihood and overgrazing has become a serious problem . " we are exploring the possibility of exporting our products from animal husbandry .
and if we can do that , then we will also be able to invest in decreasing the quantity but improving the quality of animals , increasing their productivity .
of course , quite an amount of investment is needed to do this which is why it will take time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mongolians rely heavily on animals for their livelihood and the harsh winters are often difficult to overcome dealing with air and water pollution will also take time , as basic infrastructure is missing even in the capital , ulan bator , where large areas are not connected to sewage systems . mining is another huge ecological challenge another ecological challenge facing the country is caused by mining .
the industry is already very important in mongolia but it is likely to grow dramatically over the coming years as there are huge reserves of minerals such as coal , copper , gold and uranium . there have been reports that illegal gold miners , so-called " ninjas " , have been polluting the environment with mercury . gansukh agreed that this was a concern : " in the past 20 years , during the transition period from a planned to a market economy , there were many instances of small-scale gold mining , which were not always environmentally friendly .
we will not tolerate that anymore .
we have a new law that does not allow small-scale gold mining which damages the environment .

it admitted using cash and gifts to secure global contracts . lawyers representing the giant german car manufacturer , daimler , and three of its subsidiaries , appeared before a us judge in washington dc thursday and agreed to pay fines totalling some 136 million euros -lrb- $ 185 million -rrb- to settle bribery charges .
the us justice department and the securities and exchange commission had accused the makers of the famous mercedes-benz car range of systematically using large cash payments and extravagent gifts to secure lucrative contracts around the globe .
daimler 's german and russian units each agreed to plead guilty to two counts of violating us anti-bribery laws .
charges relate to 22 different countries the car giant and biggest manufacturer of trucks worldwide was accused of giving some 41 million euros in bribes related to more than 200 transactions in 22 countries between 1998 and 2008 .
the deals earned the company 1.4 billion euros in revenue and at least 69 billion euros in allegedly illegal profits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us case may damage the mercedes image the systematic kickbacks were made in spite of a 1999 decision by the company 's board to adopt an integrity code and abide by an international anti-bribery agreement , which had been ratified by the german government .
the us court deal came after positive reports from prosecutors that daimler and two of its russian subsidiaries had fully cooperated with the investigation .
prosecutors said that daimler had regularly presented its findings to the court , fired 45 employees implicated in the bribery and reformed its practices .
deal closes case by paying the substantial fines , daimler will avoid any further criminal prosecution , but the company will remain subject to a two-year deferred prosecution agreement and oversight by an independent monitor .
although the fines are significant , the 136 million euro deal is far less that the 736 million euro -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- penalty inposed on another global germany company , siemens , by us courts in 2008. td / ap / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his huge country is very thinly populated .
however , this does not mean it does n't have a number of serious environmental problems . mongolia hopes to benefit from german know-how when it comes to dealing with climate change , the country 's environment minister gansukh luimed told deutsche welle . " we are currently developing our climate change adaptation strategy .
germany has a long tradition and experience in forest management .
and it has already developed climate models for the next 100 years . " we are sharing experience in these fields .
there has also been research done in germany and we hope to learn some things that we can implement in mongolia . " considerable environmental problems gansukh pointed out that mongolia faced considerable problems related to climate change despite the fact that it is a landlocked country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overgrazing has become a serious problem " the average elevation in mongolia is around 1,500 meters above sea level , " he explained .
" and due to our geographical conditions , mongolia is one of the countries which are very strongly impacted by the global climate change . " " this can be illustrated by one figure : the global average temperature rise has been of 0.74 degrees centigrade , whereas in mongolia temperatures have risen by 2.1 degrees in the past 70 years , three times the global average .
this causes serious problems such as water shortage , the drying up of rivers and springs , as well as drought and increasing desertification , which also leads to biodiversity loss . " 70 percent of mongolia affected by desertification the minister stated that as much as 70 percent of mongolia 's territory was affected by desertification .
but climate change is not the only problem .
many mongolians depend on sheep and other animals for their livelihood and overgrazing has become a serious problem . " we are exploring the possibility of exporting our products from animal husbandry .
and if we can do that , then we will also be able to invest in decreasing the quantity but improving the quality of animals , increasing their productivity .
of course , quite an amount of investment is needed to do this which is why it will take time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mongolians rely heavily on animals for their livelihood and the harsh winters are often difficult to overcome dealing with air and water pollution will also take time , as basic infrastructure is missing even in the capital , ulan bator , where large areas are not connected to sewage systems . mining is another huge ecological challenge another ecological challenge facing the country is caused by mining .
the industry is already very important in mongolia but it is likely to grow dramatically over the coming years as there are huge reserves of minerals such as coal , copper , gold and uranium . there have been reports that illegal gold miners , so-called " ninjas " , have been polluting the environment with mercury . gansukh agreed that this was a concern : " in the past 20 years , during the transition period from a planned to a market economy , there were many instances of small-scale gold mining , which were not always environmentally friendly .
we will not tolerate that anymore .
we have a new law that does not allow small-scale gold mining which damages the environment . " instead , the government plans to develop big mine projects in southern mongolia in collaboration with foreign investors . author : thomas baerthlein editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 02.04.2010 helmut kohl , chancellor of germany 's reunification , turns 80 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating german unity on october 3 , 1990 is what helmut kohl is ' most proud of ' helmut kohl is considered the architect of german reunification and a driving force behind european integration .
yet after 16 years in power his reputation was tainted by links to slush funds and party donations . there 's little doubt that helmut kohl will go down in history as the chancellor of german reunification .
on november 10 , 1989 - after the night the berlin wall fell , the then west german chancellor spoke from the balcony of the city hall - giving his vision of a future of european unity .
" this is about unity , about justice and freedom , " he said , quoting the opening line of the west german national anthem .
" long live a free german fatherland , long live a free and united europe . "
calling for a free and united germany was a provocation to many back then who did not want a large and powerful germany to dominate the map of europe ever again .
the fall of the berlin wall raised concerns in neighboring countries .
france 's francois mitterand was hesitant , britain 's margaret thatcher fully against reunification .
the man behind german reunification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1990 kohl repeatedly traveled to moscow to win gorbachev 's support but in the end it came down to convincing soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to agree to reunification - and helmut kohl did the trick .
less than one year after the iron curtain in berlin started to disintegrate , germany celebrated its reunification on october 3 , 1990 .
" after the events in 1989 , germany needed the trust and the confidence of the people around her that she would go all right into the future and not become the great behemoth again that she was once feared for , " political analyst thomas kielinger told deutsche welle .
" and in order to achieve that , kohl used that unique ability of his to be close to the people and to the main players , to get across his genuine belief that germany is here for the good and she will be deeply enmeshed in europe and there 's nothing to fear about her . "
helmut kohl seized the opportunity that history gave him .
but his ambitions went further than germany .
he saw his country as an integral element of a united europe .
with the 1992 maastricht treaty , he and francois mitterand mapped out the future of the eu and laid the groundwork for the euro , the bloc 's single currency .
bildunterschrift : soviet leader gorbachev , us president bush and germany 's kohl were the three heads of state behind german reunification .
in november 2009 they met again to celebrate 20 years of the fall of the wall the pull of power kohl 's other lifelong ambition was to gain power .
born in 1930 , he entered professional politics at the age of 29 in his home state of rhineland-palatinate .
kohl quickly rose through the ranks of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- until , in 1973 , he became the leader of the party - but that was n't enough .
" i want to be chancellor ; i want to win the elections and become chancellor , " he said , leaving no room for doubt about his ambitions .
he first stood in an election for chancellor in 1976 but lost against social democrat helmut schmidt . in 1982 the schmidt government collapsed after a failed vote of confidence and kohl stepped in .
he formed a new coalition with the liberal free democrats and became chancellor .
his policy was one of more freedom for the individual and less intervention by the state .
" we are convinced that the free initiative and achievements of the individual are better for everyone than state control , " he said .
" we trust people to take their future into their own hands . "
after initial success , however , kohl 's policies failed to deal with growing unemployment .
his popularity dropped and his chances of surviving the 80s in a position of power were considered slim .
" but then came the caesura : the collapse of the post-war world order and the fall of the wall , " said thomas kielinger .
" and helmut kohl went with glory , he seized the moment and pushed aside all the doubters - and there were many in germany who did n't quite think the country could cope with this moment and i think this is the view and the abiding image that people and historians have about him . "
slush funds and allegations of corruption it was thanks to the drive for reunification that kohl won the elections in 1990 .
but as much as he had worked for a united germany , he drastically underestimated the costs that would follow .
the financial burden seemed too much to deal with and unemployment continued to climb dramatically .
in 1998 kohl was defeated at the polls by social democrat gerhard schroeder , and also stepped down as the leader of the german conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's standing in germany suffered significantly after the slush funds scandal it was then that his star seemed to hit rock bottom .
kohl found himself embroiled in one of the worst slush fund scandals of post-war german politics .
it emerged that he had fed party coffers with over 2 million marks -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.3 million -rrb- in secret donations .
kohl refused to name any of the secret party donors , which threw the christian democrats into a state of severe crisis .
in the subsequent fallout kohl even had to resign from his post as honorary chairman of the party in 2000 .
it was angela merkel , the current german chancellor , a protege of kohl 's , who then took over at the helm of the cdu .
in 2001 kohl lost his wife hannelore who committed suicide after suffering for years from photodermatitis , a severe form of sensitivity to light .
kohl married maike richter in 2005 .
at the age of 80 he is no longer physically able to attend any elaborate birthday celebrations and will spend the day at home in private .
an official reception is scheduled for may 5 , with around 1,000 guests expected in his hometown of ludwigshafen .

yet after 16 years in power his reputation was tainted by links to slush funds and party donations . there 's little doubt that helmut kohl will go down in history as the chancellor of german reunification .
on november 10 , 1989 - after the night the berlin wall fell , the then west german chancellor spoke from the balcony of the city hall - giving his vision of a future of european unity .
" this is about unity , about justice and freedom , " he said , quoting the opening line of the west german national anthem .
" long live a free german fatherland , long live a free and united europe . "
calling for a free and united germany was a provocation to many back then who did not want a large and powerful germany to dominate the map of europe ever again .
the fall of the berlin wall raised concerns in neighboring countries .
france 's francois mitterand was hesitant , britain 's margaret thatcher fully against reunification .
the man behind german reunification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1990 kohl repeatedly traveled to moscow to win gorbachev 's support but in the end it came down to convincing soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to agree to reunification - and helmut kohl did the trick .
less than one year after the iron curtain in berlin started to disintegrate , germany celebrated its reunification on october 3 , 1990 .
" after the events in 1989 , germany needed the trust and the confidence of the people around her that she would go all right into the future and not become the great behemoth again that she was once feared for , " political analyst thomas kielinger told deutsche welle .
" and in order to achieve that , kohl used that unique ability of his to be close to the people and to the main players , to get across his genuine belief that germany is here for the good and she will be deeply enmeshed in europe and there 's nothing to fear about her . "
helmut kohl seized the opportunity that history gave him .
but his ambitions went further than germany .
he saw his country as an integral element of a united europe .
with the 1992 maastricht treaty , he and francois mitterand mapped out the future of the eu and laid the groundwork for the euro , the bloc 's single currency .
bildunterschrift : soviet leader gorbachev , us president bush and germany 's kohl were the three heads of state behind german reunification .
in november 2009 they met again to celebrate 20 years of the fall of the wall the pull of power kohl 's other lifelong ambition was to gain power .
born in 1930 , he entered professional politics at the age of 29 in his home state of rhineland-palatinate .
kohl quickly rose through the ranks of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- until , in 1973 , he became the leader of the party - but that was n't enough .
" i want to be chancellor ; i want to win the elections and become chancellor , " he said , leaving no room for doubt about his ambitions .
he first stood in an election for chancellor in 1976 but lost against social democrat helmut schmidt . in 1982 the schmidt government collapsed after a failed vote of confidence and kohl stepped in .
he formed a new coalition with the liberal free democrats and became chancellor .
his policy was one of more freedom for the individual and less intervention by the state .
" we are convinced that the free initiative and achievements of the individual are better for everyone than state control , " he said .
" we trust people to take their future into their own hands . "
after initial success , however , kohl 's policies failed to deal with growing unemployment .
his popularity dropped and his chances of surviving the 80s in a position of power were considered slim .
" but then came the caesura : the collapse of the post-war world order and the fall of the wall , " said thomas kielinger .
" and helmut kohl went with glory , he seized the moment and pushed aside all the doubters - and there were many in germany who did n't quite think the country could cope with this moment and i think this is the view and the abiding image that people and historians have about him . "
slush funds and allegations of corruption it was thanks to the drive for reunification that kohl won the elections in 1990 .
but as much as he had worked for a united germany , he drastically underestimated the costs that would follow .
the financial burden seemed too much to deal with and unemployment continued to climb dramatically .
in 1998 kohl was defeated at the polls by social democrat gerhard schroeder , and also stepped down as the leader of the german conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's standing in germany suffered significantly after the slush funds scandal it was then that his star seemed to hit rock bottom .
kohl found himself embroiled in one of the worst slush fund scandals of post-war german politics .
it emerged that he had fed party coffers with over 2 million marks -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.3 million -rrb- in secret donations .
kohl refused to name any of the secret party donors , which threw the christian democrats into a state of severe crisis .
in the subsequent fallout kohl even had to resign from his post as honorary chairman of the party in 2000 .
it was angela merkel , the current german chancellor , a protege of kohl 's , who then took over at the helm of the cdu .
in 2001 kohl lost his wife hannelore who committed suicide after suffering for years from photodermatitis , a severe form of sensitivity to light .
kohl married maike richter in 2005 .
at the age of 80 he is no longer physically able to attend any elaborate birthday celebrations and will spend the day at home in private .
an official reception is scheduled for may 5 , with around 1,000 guests expected in his hometown of ludwigshafen .

it says diabetes is " one of the world ’ s most important causes of expenditure , mortality , disability and lost economic growth " . many experts say it will be one of the most serious pandemics of the 21st century .
professor rüdiger landgraf of germany 's diabetes foundation says asian countries will bear the brunt .
" it is increasing rapidly and is expected to rise by up to 60 percent within the next 20 years . " 10 percent of asian americans have type ii diabetes the most frequent kind of diabetes is type ii , which used to be associated mainly with old age , but is affecting more and more young people . " about 10 percent of asian americans are affected by type ii diabetes , " explains qing li , a research scientist at the stanford university school of medicine .
" that is a very big number .
they have high diabetes rates compared with caucasians , suggesting a strong role of genetics in the development of diabetes .
the complex interaction between genetics and the lifestyle leads to the increase of diabetes in asian people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if we exercised more , we would eat less and be less at risk of developing disease , say experts this is also the case in asia itself , where " in recent years the chinese economy has developed very fast and people can have more western-style food like mcdonalds , kentucky fried chicken etc , " says qing li . " they have adapted to western-style food , " landgraf agrees .
" they have adopted western eating and drinking habits .
coca cola is considered a national drink by many in the usa and now in the rest of the world too .
people tend to like things that are sweet . " he says high-sugar beverages and other extremely calorie-dense foods play a large role .
the intake of too many calories over time warps the body ’ s production and use of insulin – one of the reasons the risk of getting type ii increases with age . lack of exercise increases risk of diabetes but there is another major factor , says landgraf , and this is that people are getting a lot less exercise .
" they are using cars more and more , which means that they are moving around a lot less while their calorie intake is staying the same or is even higher than before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obesity is increasing across asia " these are the best conditions – especially if there is a genetic factor – for developing some kind of metabolic malfunction and eventually diabetes .
if we were to get more exercise , then we would probably eat less .
eating has a lot to do with frustration , boredom , loneliness and other things .
it is n't that we are hungry , but that we are looking for a replacement for other things that are missing in society today . " the new study also warns that there is an even higher number of pre-diabetics than diabetics .
moreover , the un has found that in some countries up to 90 percent of people with diabetes do not receive treatment . author : sarah berning editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in november 2009 they met again to celebrate 20 years of the fall of the wall the pull of power kohl 's other lifelong ambition was to gain power .
born in 1930 , he entered professional politics at the age of 29 in his home state of rhineland-palatinate .
kohl quickly rose through the ranks of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- until , in 1973 , he became the leader of the party - but that was n't enough .
" i want to be chancellor ; i want to win the elections and become chancellor , " he said , leaving no room for doubt about his ambitions .
he first stood in an election for chancellor in 1976 but lost against social democrat helmut schmidt . in 1982 the schmidt government collapsed after a failed vote of confidence and kohl stepped in .
he formed a new coalition with the liberal free democrats and became chancellor .
his policy was one of more freedom for the individual and less intervention by the state .
" we are convinced that the free initiative and achievements of the individual are better for everyone than state control , " he said .
" we trust people to take their future into their own hands . "
after initial success , however , kohl 's policies failed to deal with growing unemployment .
his popularity dropped and his chances of surviving the 80s in a position of power were considered slim .
" but then came the caesura : the collapse of the post-war world order and the fall of the wall , " said thomas kielinger .
" and helmut kohl went with glory , he seized the moment and pushed aside all the doubters - and there were many in germany who did n't quite think the country could cope with this moment and i think this is the view and the abiding image that people and historians have about him . "
slush funds and allegations of corruption it was thanks to the drive for reunification that kohl won the elections in 1990 .
but as much as he had worked for a united germany , he drastically underestimated the costs that would follow .
the financial burden seemed too much to deal with and unemployment continued to climb dramatically .
in 1998 kohl was defeated at the polls by social democrat gerhard schroeder , and also stepped down as the leader of the german conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's standing in germany suffered significantly after the slush funds scandal it was then that his star seemed to hit rock bottom .
kohl found himself embroiled in one of the worst slush fund scandals of post-war german politics .
it emerged that he had fed party coffers with over 2 million marks -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.3 million -rrb- in secret donations .
kohl refused to name any of the secret party donors , which threw the christian democrats into a state of severe crisis .
in the subsequent fallout kohl even had to resign from his post as honorary chairman of the party in 2000 .
it was angela merkel , the current german chancellor , a protege of kohl 's , who then took over at the helm of the cdu .
in 2001 kohl lost his wife hannelore who committed suicide after suffering for years from photodermatitis , a severe form of sensitivity to light .
kohl married maike richter in 2005 .
at the age of 80 he is no longer physically able to attend any elaborate birthday celebrations and will spend the day at home in private .
an official reception is scheduled for may 5 , with around 1,000 guests expected in his hometown of ludwigshafen .

" it is increasing rapidly and is expected to rise by up to 60 percent within the next 20 years . " 10 percent of asian americans have type ii diabetes the most frequent kind of diabetes is type ii , which used to be associated mainly with old age , but is affecting more and more young people . " about 10 percent of asian americans are affected by type ii diabetes , " explains qing li , a research scientist at the stanford university school of medicine .

the intake of too many calories over time warps the body ’ s production and use of insulin – one of the reasons the risk of getting type ii increases with age . lack of exercise increases risk of diabetes but there is another major factor , says landgraf , and this is that people are getting a lot less exercise .
" they are using cars more and more , which means that they are moving around a lot less while their calorie intake is staying the same or is even higher than before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obesity is increasing across asia " these are the best conditions – especially if there is a genetic factor – for developing some kind of metabolic malfunction and eventually diabetes .

eating has a lot to do with frustration , boredom , loneliness and other things .
it is n't that we are hungry , but that we are looking for a replacement for other things that are missing in society today . " the new study also warns that there is an even higher number of pre-diabetics than diabetics .

" we are currently developing our climate change adaptation strategy .
germany has a long tradition and experience in forest management .
and it has already developed climate models for the next 100 years . " we are sharing experience in these fields .
there has also been research done in germany and we hope to learn some things that we can implement in mongolia . " considerable environmental problems gansukh pointed out that mongolia faced considerable problems related to climate change despite the fact that it is a landlocked country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overgrazing has become a serious problem " the average elevation in mongolia is around 1,500 meters above sea level , " he explained .
" and due to our geographical conditions , mongolia is one of the countries which are very strongly impacted by the global climate change . " " this can be illustrated by one figure : the global average temperature rise has been of 0.74 degrees centigrade , whereas in mongolia temperatures have risen by 2.1 degrees in the past 70 years , three times the global average .
this causes serious problems such as water shortage , the drying up of rivers and springs , as well as drought and increasing desertification , which also leads to biodiversity loss .

we will not tolerate that anymore .
we have a new law that does not allow small-scale gold mining which damages the environment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : oberammergau sets up the stage once-a-decade passion play starts in oberammergau this year 's oberammergau passion play casts jesus in new light bavarian village prepares itself for 500,000 theater fans in oberammergau , all the town 's a stage germany -pipe- 02.04.2010 oberammergau gears up for passion play season großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bavarian villagers perform a passion play every 10 years the oberammergau passion play emerged from a 17th century vow that if god spared villagers from the bubonic plague , they would reenact the passion every 10 years .
now the event rakes in millions of euros each decade . spring is in the air in the village of oberammergau in southern germany .
a few stores selling hand-carved figures of jesus christ and other souvenirs are open , trying to attract tourists with bavarian folk music .
it 's a charming scene – for now at least .
but come mid-may and the village will be inundated with visitors .
that 's when the village famously stages its passion play , the dramatic presentation of the passion of christ – the trial , suffering and death of christ .
it 's a tradition that traces its roots back to 1634 , when the residents of oberammergau vowed that if god spared their community from the bubonic plague ravaging the region at the time , they would perform a passion play every 10 years .
" we have about 5,000 residents here .
but we get that many visitors every day when the passion play is on , ” annie hutter from the local tourist office explained .
“ many of the guests often have to find accommodation in neighboring towns like murnau , or even on the other side of the austrian border , " hutter added , highlighting the popularity of the event .
the big draw is the cast of roughly 2,000 amateur actors – all born and bred in oberammergau – who will recreate the final five days in the life of jesus christ over a period of six hours .
they will perform the play more than 100 times before the finale on october 3 .
bildunterschrift : the passion play draws audiences from all over the world passion pays arno nunn is the mayor of oberammergau .
he 's not allowed to play a role in the play because he was not born in the village .
but he certainly shares the villagers ' excitement .
" on the one hand there 's the historic vow .
that 's something the community really cares about , ” nunn said .
“ but there 's no denying there are major commercial interests at work as well . "
" in 2000 , the passion play generated revenues of 25 million euros .
we hope this year 's play will do just as well , " he added .
the passion play is normally a sell-out event .
so most visitors book holiday packages that combine guaranteed tickets to the play with accommodation and meals .
prices range between 200 and 800 euros . but ticketing organizer werner hirrlinger says budget travellers may still be able to find a last-minute bargain this year .
" for decades oberammergau was fortunate that its performances of the passion play were booked out completely one year in advance , ” hirrlinger said .
“ but that 's not the case this year .
about five percent of tickets have been returned . "
" we 're still quite satisfied with the sale , although it 's clear we 're in a different situation compared to 10 years ago . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frederik mayet , who plays jesus , visited the us on a publicity tour as the fallout from the global economic crisis continues , overseas visitors are thinking twice about how they spend their hard-earned cash .
and it seems many american visitors – traditionally a major contingent at oberammergau – are staying away .
that 's despite a targeted and robust marketing campaign .
" the lead actors travelled to america for a publicity tour .
our jesus introduced himself to the media , " hutter pointed out .
" i think he was quite well received . "
downturn fallout but local businesses are finding that the passion play is not the perpetual money-spinner they once thought it was .
the economic downturn has been compounded by director christian stueckl 's decision to part with tradition and stage half the play in the evening .
stueckl said the darkness would create a better atmosphere for some of the scenes .
but the move has outraged restaurant owners .
that 's when visitors belong at the dinner table , they say , not the theatre .
bildunterschrift : hotels across the region fill up quickly during the tourist season still , frank seyfarth , manager of the village 's sonnenhof hotel in , says the biggest threat to the passion play business is not the start or finish time , but rather the times we live in .
" the generational change is difficult to measure , but a high percentage of youngsters nowadays do n't even know what the passion is , ” seyfarth said .
“ people in america are more familiar with it , but even there it 's changing .
a lot of young people just are n't interested . "
lessons from the past oberammergau has a reputation for living it up in the immediate years that follow a passion play .
recent decades have seen the community buy snow machines and build luxurious sporting facilities .
however , mayor arno nunn says the time has come for the village to tighten its belt and think carefully about expenditures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor nunn wants the village to be judicious in its use of this year 's profits " that 's the real challenge - the blessing and the curse of the passion ! ” he said .
" the extra income has enabled us to invest a lot in facilities for both residents and tourists , ” nunn added .
“ but these investments have to be maintained and that 's where we 've been pushing the envelope .
we 've accumulated a mountain of debt . ”
he says this year in particular the village must use revenues from the upcoming season to pay off some of its debt and create reserves for the future .
oberammergau will have to make them last until the end of this decade , when the next season of the famed passion play begins .

it admitted using cash and gifts to secure global contracts . lawyers representing the giant german car manufacturer , daimler , and three of its subsidiaries , appeared before a us judge in washington dc thursday and agreed to pay fines totalling some 136 million euros -lrb- $ 185 million -rrb- to settle bribery charges .
the us justice department and the securities and exchange commission had accused the makers of the famous mercedes-benz car range of systematically using large cash payments and extravagent gifts to secure lucrative contracts around the globe .
daimler 's german and russian units each agreed to plead guilty to two counts of violating us anti-bribery laws .
charges relate to 22 different countries the car giant and biggest manufacturer of trucks worldwide was accused of giving some 41 million euros in bribes related to more than 200 transactions in 22 countries between 1998 and 2008 .
the deals earned the company 1.4 billion euros in revenue and at least 69 billion euros in allegedly illegal profits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us case may damage the mercedes image the systematic kickbacks were made in spite of a 1999 decision by the company 's board to adopt an integrity code and abide by an international anti-bribery agreement , which had been ratified by the german government .
the us court deal came after positive reports from prosecutors that daimler and two of its russian subsidiaries had fully cooperated with the investigation .
prosecutors said that daimler had regularly presented its findings to the court , fired 45 employees implicated in the bribery and reformed its practices .
deal closes case by paying the substantial fines , daimler will avoid any further criminal prosecution , but the company will remain subject to a two-year deferred prosecution agreement and oversight by an independent monitor .
although the fines are significant , the 136 million euro deal is far less that the 736 million euro -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- penalty inposed on another global germany company , siemens , by us courts in 2008. td / ap / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his huge country is very thinly populated .
however , this does not mean it does n't have a number of serious environmental problems . mongolia hopes to benefit from german know-how when it comes to dealing with climate change , the country 's environment minister gansukh luimed told deutsche welle . " we are currently developing our climate change adaptation strategy .
germany has a long tradition and experience in forest management .
and it has already developed climate models for the next 100 years . " we are sharing experience in these fields .
there has also been research done in germany and we hope to learn some things that we can implement in mongolia . " considerable environmental problems gansukh pointed out that mongolia faced considerable problems related to climate change despite the fact that it is a landlocked country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overgrazing has become a serious problem " the average elevation in mongolia is around 1,500 meters above sea level , " he explained .
" and due to our geographical conditions , mongolia is one of the countries which are very strongly impacted by the global climate change . " " this can be illustrated by one figure : the global average temperature rise has been of 0.74 degrees centigrade , whereas in mongolia temperatures have risen by 2.1 degrees in the past 70 years , three times the global average .
this causes serious problems such as water shortage , the drying up of rivers and springs , as well as drought and increasing desertification , which also leads to biodiversity loss . " 70 percent of mongolia affected by desertification the minister stated that as much as 70 percent of mongolia 's territory was affected by desertification .
but climate change is not the only problem .
many mongolians depend on sheep and other animals for their livelihood and overgrazing has become a serious problem . " we are exploring the possibility of exporting our products from animal husbandry .
and if we can do that , then we will also be able to invest in decreasing the quantity but improving the quality of animals , increasing their productivity .
of course , quite an amount of investment is needed to do this which is why it will take time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mongolians rely heavily on animals for their livelihood and the harsh winters are often difficult to overcome dealing with air and water pollution will also take time , as basic infrastructure is missing even in the capital , ulan bator , where large areas are not connected to sewage systems . mining is another huge ecological challenge another ecological challenge facing the country is caused by mining .
the industry is already very important in mongolia but it is likely to grow dramatically over the coming years as there are huge reserves of minerals such as coal , copper , gold and uranium . there have been reports that illegal gold miners , so-called " ninjas " , have been polluting the environment with mercury . gansukh agreed that this was a concern : " in the past 20 years , during the transition period from a planned to a market economy , there were many instances of small-scale gold mining , which were not always environmentally friendly .
we will not tolerate that anymore .
we have a new law that does not allow small-scale gold mining which damages the environment . " instead , the government plans to develop big mine projects in southern mongolia in collaboration with foreign investors . author : thomas baerthlein editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

across germany , the abuse scandal is shaping good friday services . the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , archbishop of freiburg robert zollitsch , released a statement on good friday acknowledging the failure of the catholic church to satisfactorily handle the sex abuse scandal . zollitsch admitted that , in the past , the church had done too little to help abuse victims , and said the church 's response was a reflection of contemporary social mores .
" today , it is clear to us : previously the social situation was different , and we allowed ourselves to be overcome - by disappointment over the painful failure of the perpetrators and mistaken concern over the reputation of the church , " said zollitsch in a written statement that his diocese released on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abuse scandal is dominating easter services " not enough help was given to the victims , " he added as he spoke of " wounds that may never be healed . "
scandal shapes good friday however , good friday could provide a new beginning for the church , said zollitsch .
many catholic dioceses are addressing the sex abuse scandal during easter services , with a prayer for the victims written by the bishop of trier , stephen ackermann .
in his own good friday sermon , ackermann addressed the psychological wounds of sexual abuse victims , referring to the healing of the wounds of jesus . search for forgiveness across europe earlier in the week , the archbishop of vienna , christoph schoenborn , expressed the church 's guilt in the scandal , incurred during years of silence and cover-ups .
bishops across austria and switzerland appealed to parishioners to come forward with their allegations and schoenborn thanked in particular the victims who had broken their silence .
" we confess our guilt to the many whom we have wronged as a church , and whom some of us have wronged very directly , " said schoenborn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have rejected schoenborn 's apologies however , church critics in austria have dismissed schoenborn 's apology as " insufficient . "
the activist platform , betroffene kirchlicher gewalt , or " victims of church violence , " said it would not accept " mere apologies and prayers for humility . "
in a separate display of solidarity with the victims of church abuse , the artist emmerich weissenberger crucified himself on the facade of vienna 's st. stephan 's cathedral on friday .
the artist was symbolically wearing a loin cloth and a crown of thorns - in this case barbed wire - while fastened to the church at a height of 20 meters .
meanwhile , the head of the catholic church , german-born pope benedict xvi has so far avoided addressing the growing criticism of the widespread abuse scandal .
a vatican spokesman had previously told the ap news agency that the pope viewed the crisis as a " test for both him and the church .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 02.04.2010 helmut kohl , chancellor of germany 's reunification , turns 80 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating german unity on october 3 , 1990 is what helmut kohl is ' most proud of ' helmut kohl is considered the architect of german reunification and a driving force behind european integration .
yet after 16 years in power his reputation was tainted by links to slush funds and party donations . there 's little doubt that helmut kohl will go down in history as the chancellor of german reunification .
on november 10 , 1989 - after the night the berlin wall fell , the then west german chancellor spoke from the balcony of the city hall - giving his vision of a future of european unity .
" this is about unity , about justice and freedom , " he said , quoting the opening line of the west german national anthem .
" long live a free german fatherland , long live a free and united europe . "
calling for a free and united germany was a provocation to many back then who did not want a large and powerful germany to dominate the map of europe ever again .
the fall of the berlin wall raised concerns in neighboring countries .
france 's francois mitterand was hesitant , britain 's margaret thatcher fully against reunification .
the man behind german reunification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1990 kohl repeatedly traveled to moscow to win gorbachev 's support but in the end it came down to convincing soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to agree to reunification - and helmut kohl did the trick .
less than one year after the iron curtain in berlin started to disintegrate , germany celebrated its reunification on october 3 , 1990 .
" after the events in 1989 , germany needed the trust and the confidence of the people around her that she would go all right into the future and not become the great behemoth again that she was once feared for , " political analyst thomas kielinger told deutsche welle .
" and in order to achieve that , kohl used that unique ability of his to be close to the people and to the main players , to get across his genuine belief that germany is here for the good and she will be deeply enmeshed in europe and there 's nothing to fear about her . "
helmut kohl seized the opportunity that history gave him .
but his ambitions went further than germany .
he saw his country as an integral element of a united europe .
with the 1992 maastricht treaty , he and francois mitterand mapped out the future of the eu and laid the groundwork for the euro , the bloc 's single currency .
bildunterschrift : soviet leader gorbachev , us president bush and germany 's kohl were the three heads of state behind german reunification .
in november 2009 they met again to celebrate 20 years of the fall of the wall the pull of power kohl 's other lifelong ambition was to gain power .
born in 1930 , he entered professional politics at the age of 29 in his home state of rhineland-palatinate .
kohl quickly rose through the ranks of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- until , in 1973 , he became the leader of the party - but that was n't enough .
" i want to be chancellor ; i want to win the elections and become chancellor , " he said , leaving no room for doubt about his ambitions .
he first stood in an election for chancellor in 1976 but lost against social democrat helmut schmidt . in 1982 the schmidt government collapsed after a failed vote of confidence and kohl stepped in .
he formed a new coalition with the liberal free democrats and became chancellor .
his policy was one of more freedom for the individual and less intervention by the state .
" we are convinced that the free initiative and achievements of the individual are better for everyone than state control , " he said .
" we trust people to take their future into their own hands . "
after initial success , however , kohl 's policies failed to deal with growing unemployment .

yet after 16 years in power his reputation was tainted by links to slush funds and party donations . there 's little doubt that helmut kohl will go down in history as the chancellor of german reunification .
on november 10 , 1989 - after the night the berlin wall fell , the then west german chancellor spoke from the balcony of the city hall - giving his vision of a future of european unity .
" this is about unity , about justice and freedom , " he said , quoting the opening line of the west german national anthem .
" long live a free german fatherland , long live a free and united europe . "
calling for a free and united germany was a provocation to many back then who did not want a large and powerful germany to dominate the map of europe ever again .
the fall of the berlin wall raised concerns in neighboring countries .
france 's francois mitterand was hesitant , britain 's margaret thatcher fully against reunification .
the man behind german reunification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1990 kohl repeatedly traveled to moscow to win gorbachev 's support but in the end it came down to convincing soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to agree to reunification - and helmut kohl did the trick .
less than one year after the iron curtain in berlin started to disintegrate , germany celebrated its reunification on october 3 , 1990 .
" after the events in 1989 , germany needed the trust and the confidence of the people around her that she would go all right into the future and not become the great behemoth again that she was once feared for , " political analyst thomas kielinger told deutsche welle .
" and in order to achieve that , kohl used that unique ability of his to be close to the people and to the main players , to get across his genuine belief that germany is here for the good and she will be deeply enmeshed in europe and there 's nothing to fear about her . "
helmut kohl seized the opportunity that history gave him .
but his ambitions went further than germany .
he saw his country as an integral element of a united europe .
with the 1992 maastricht treaty , he and francois mitterand mapped out the future of the eu and laid the groundwork for the euro , the bloc 's single currency .
bildunterschrift : soviet leader gorbachev , us president bush and germany 's kohl were the three heads of state behind german reunification .
in november 2009 they met again to celebrate 20 years of the fall of the wall the pull of power kohl 's other lifelong ambition was to gain power .
born in 1930 , he entered professional politics at the age of 29 in his home state of rhineland-palatinate .
kohl quickly rose through the ranks of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- until , in 1973 , he became the leader of the party - but that was n't enough .
" i want to be chancellor ; i want to win the elections and become chancellor , " he said , leaving no room for doubt about his ambitions .
he first stood in an election for chancellor in 1976 but lost against social democrat helmut schmidt . in 1982 the schmidt government collapsed after a failed vote of confidence and kohl stepped in .
he formed a new coalition with the liberal free democrats and became chancellor .
his policy was one of more freedom for the individual and less intervention by the state .
" we are convinced that the free initiative and achievements of the individual are better for everyone than state control , " he said .
" we trust people to take their future into their own hands . "
after initial success , however , kohl 's policies failed to deal with growing unemployment .
his popularity dropped and his chances of surviving the 80s in a position of power were considered slim .

yet after 16 years in power his reputation was tainted by links to slush funds and party donations . there 's little doubt that helmut kohl will go down in history as the chancellor of german reunification .
on november 10 , 1989 - after the night the berlin wall fell , the then west german chancellor spoke from the balcony of the city hall - giving his vision of a future of european unity .
" this is about unity , about justice and freedom , " he said , quoting the opening line of the west german national anthem .
" long live a free german fatherland , long live a free and united europe . "
calling for a free and united germany was a provocation to many back then who did not want a large and powerful germany to dominate the map of europe ever again .
the fall of the berlin wall raised concerns in neighboring countries .
france 's francois mitterand was hesitant , britain 's margaret thatcher fully against reunification .
the man behind german reunification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1990 kohl repeatedly traveled to moscow to win gorbachev 's support but in the end it came down to convincing soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to agree to reunification - and helmut kohl did the trick .
less than one year after the iron curtain in berlin started to disintegrate , germany celebrated its reunification on october 3 , 1990 .
" after the events in 1989 , germany needed the trust and the confidence of the people around her that she would go all right into the future and not become the great behemoth again that she was once feared for , " political analyst thomas kielinger told deutsche welle .
" and in order to achieve that , kohl used that unique ability of his to be close to the people and to the main players , to get across his genuine belief that germany is here for the good and she will be deeply enmeshed in europe and there 's nothing to fear about her . "
helmut kohl seized the opportunity that history gave him .
but his ambitions went further than germany .
he saw his country as an integral element of a united europe .
with the 1992 maastricht treaty , he and francois mitterand mapped out the future of the eu and laid the groundwork for the euro , the bloc 's single currency .
bildunterschrift : soviet leader gorbachev , us president bush and germany 's kohl were the three heads of state behind german reunification .
in november 2009 they met again to celebrate 20 years of the fall of the wall the pull of power kohl 's other lifelong ambition was to gain power .
born in 1930 , he entered professional politics at the age of 29 in his home state of rhineland-palatinate .
kohl quickly rose through the ranks of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- until , in 1973 , he became the leader of the party - but that was n't enough .
" i want to be chancellor ; i want to win the elections and become chancellor , " he said , leaving no room for doubt about his ambitions .
he first stood in an election for chancellor in 1976 but lost against social democrat helmut schmidt . in 1982 the schmidt government collapsed after a failed vote of confidence and kohl stepped in .
he formed a new coalition with the liberal free democrats and became chancellor .
his policy was one of more freedom for the individual and less intervention by the state .
" we are convinced that the free initiative and achievements of the individual are better for everyone than state control , " he said .
" we trust people to take their future into their own hands . "
after initial success , however , kohl 's policies failed to deal with growing unemployment .
his popularity dropped and his chances of surviving the 80s in a position of power were considered slim .
" but then came the caesura : the collapse of the post-war world order and the fall of the wall , " said thomas kielinger .
" and helmut kohl went with glory , he seized the moment and pushed aside all the doubters - and there were many in germany who did n't quite think the country could cope with this moment and i think this is the view and the abiding image that people and historians have about him . "
slush funds and allegations of corruption it was thanks to the drive for reunification that kohl won the elections in 1990 .
but as much as he had worked for a united germany , he drastically underestimated the costs that would follow .
the financial burden seemed too much to deal with and unemployment continued to climb dramatically .
in 1998 kohl was defeated at the polls by social democrat gerhard schroeder , and also stepped down as the leader of the german conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's standing in germany suffered significantly after the slush funds scandal it was then that his star seemed to hit rock bottom .
kohl found himself embroiled in one of the worst slush fund scandals of post-war german politics .
it emerged that he had fed party coffers with over 2 million marks -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.3 million -rrb- in secret donations .
kohl refused to name any of the secret party donors , which threw the christian democrats into a state of severe crisis .
in the subsequent fallout kohl even had to resign from his post as honorary chairman of the party in 2000 .
it was angela merkel , the current german chancellor , a protege of kohl 's , who then took over at the helm of the cdu .
in 2001 kohl lost his wife hannelore who committed suicide after suffering for years from photodermatitis , a severe form of sensitivity to light .
kohl married maike richter in 2005 .
at the age of 80 he is no longer physically able to attend any elaborate birthday celebrations and will spend the day at home in private .
an official reception is scheduled for may 5 , with around 1,000 guests expected in his hometown of ludwigshafen .

across germany , the abuse scandal is shaping good friday services . the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , archbishop of freiburg robert zollitsch , released a statement on good friday acknowledging the failure of the catholic church to satisfactorily handle the sex abuse scandal . zollitsch admitted that , in the past , the church had done too little to help abuse victims , and said the church 's response was a reflection of contemporary social mores .

across germany , the abuse scandal is shaping good friday services . the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , archbishop of freiburg robert zollitsch , released a statement on good friday acknowledging the failure of the catholic church to satisfactorily handle the sex abuse scandal . zollitsch admitted that , in the past , the church had done too little to help abuse victims , and said the church 's response was a reflection of contemporary social mores .
" today , it is clear to us : previously the social situation was different , and we allowed ourselves to be overcome - by disappointment over the painful failure of the perpetrators and mistaken concern over the reputation of the church , " said zollitsch in a written statement that his diocese released on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abuse scandal is dominating easter services " not enough help was given to the victims , " he added as he spoke of " wounds that may never be healed . "
scandal shapes good friday however , good friday could provide a new beginning for the church , said zollitsch .
many catholic dioceses are addressing the sex abuse scandal during easter services , with a prayer for the victims written by the bishop of trier , stephen ackermann .
in his own good friday sermon , ackermann addressed the psychological wounds of sexual abuse victims , referring to the healing of the wounds of jesus . search for forgiveness across europe earlier in the week , the archbishop of vienna , christoph schoenborn , expressed the church 's guilt in the scandal , incurred during years of silence and cover-ups .
bishops across austria and switzerland appealed to parishioners to come forward with their allegations and schoenborn thanked in particular the victims who had broken their silence .
" we confess our guilt to the many whom we have wronged as a church , and whom some of us have wronged very directly , " said schoenborn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have rejected schoenborn 's apologies however , church critics in austria have dismissed schoenborn 's apology as " insufficient . "
the activist platform , betroffene kirchlicher gewalt , or " victims of church violence , " said it would not accept " mere apologies and prayers for humility . "
in a separate display of solidarity with the victims of church abuse , the artist emmerich weissenberger crucified himself on the facade of vienna 's st. stephan 's cathedral on friday .
the artist was symbolically wearing a loin cloth and a crown of thorns - in this case barbed wire - while fastened to the church at a height of 20 meters .
meanwhile , the head of the catholic church , german-born pope benedict xvi has so far avoided addressing the growing criticism of the widespread abuse scandal .
a vatican spokesman had previously told the ap news agency that the pope viewed the crisis as a " test for both him and the church .

the us justice department and the securities and exchange commission had accused the makers of the famous mercedes-benz car range of systematically using large cash payments and extravagent gifts to secure lucrative contracts around the globe .
daimler 's german and russian units each agreed to plead guilty to two counts of violating us anti-bribery laws .
charges relate to 22 different countries the car giant and biggest manufacturer of trucks worldwide was accused of giving some 41 million euros in bribes related to more than 200 transactions in 22 countries between 1998 and 2008 .

it admitted using cash and gifts to secure global contracts . lawyers representing the giant german car manufacturer , daimler , and three of its subsidiaries , appeared before a us judge in washington dc thursday and agreed to pay fines totalling some 136 million euros -lrb- $ 185 million -rrb- to settle bribery charges .
the us justice department and the securities and exchange commission had accused the makers of the famous mercedes-benz car range of systematically using large cash payments and extravagent gifts to secure lucrative contracts around the globe .
daimler 's german and russian units each agreed to plead guilty to two counts of violating us anti-bribery laws .
charges relate to 22 different countries the car giant and biggest manufacturer of trucks worldwide was accused of giving some 41 million euros in bribes related to more than 200 transactions in 22 countries between 1998 and 2008 .
the deals earned the company 1.4 billion euros in revenue and at least 69 billion euros in allegedly illegal profits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us case may damage the mercedes image the systematic kickbacks were made in spite of a 1999 decision by the company 's board to adopt an integrity code and abide by an international anti-bribery agreement , which had been ratified by the german government .
the us court deal came after positive reports from prosecutors that daimler and two of its russian subsidiaries had fully cooperated with the investigation .
prosecutors said that daimler had regularly presented its findings to the court , fired 45 employees implicated in the bribery and reformed its practices .
deal closes case by paying the substantial fines , daimler will avoid any further criminal prosecution , but the company will remain subject to a two-year deferred prosecution agreement and oversight by an independent monitor .
although the fines are significant , the 136 million euro deal is far less that the 736 million euro -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- penalty inposed on another global germany company , siemens , by us courts in 2008. td / ap / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" and due to our geographical conditions , mongolia is one of the countries which are very strongly impacted by the global climate change .

his huge country is very thinly populated .
however , this does not mean it does n't have a number of serious environmental problems . mongolia hopes to benefit from german know-how when it comes to dealing with climate change , the country 's environment minister gansukh luimed told deutsche welle . " we are currently developing our climate change adaptation strategy .
germany has a long tradition and experience in forest management .
and it has already developed climate models for the next 100 years . " we are sharing experience in these fields .
there has also been research done in germany and we hope to learn some things that we can implement in mongolia . " considerable environmental problems gansukh pointed out that mongolia faced considerable problems related to climate change despite the fact that it is a landlocked country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overgrazing has become a serious problem " the average elevation in mongolia is around 1,500 meters above sea level , " he explained .
" and due to our geographical conditions , mongolia is one of the countries which are very strongly impacted by the global climate change . " " this can be illustrated by one figure : the global average temperature rise has been of 0.74 degrees centigrade , whereas in mongolia temperatures have risen by 2.1 degrees in the past 70 years , three times the global average .
this causes serious problems such as water shortage , the drying up of rivers and springs , as well as drought and increasing desertification , which also leads to biodiversity loss . " 70 percent of mongolia affected by desertification the minister stated that as much as 70 percent of mongolia 's territory was affected by desertification .
but climate change is not the only problem .
many mongolians depend on sheep and other animals for their livelihood and overgrazing has become a serious problem . " we are exploring the possibility of exporting our products from animal husbandry .
and if we can do that , then we will also be able to invest in decreasing the quantity but improving the quality of animals , increasing their productivity .
of course , quite an amount of investment is needed to do this which is why it will take time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mongolians rely heavily on animals for their livelihood and the harsh winters are often difficult to overcome dealing with air and water pollution will also take time , as basic infrastructure is missing even in the capital , ulan bator , where large areas are not connected to sewage systems . mining is another huge ecological challenge another ecological challenge facing the country is caused by mining .
the industry is already very important in mongolia but it is likely to grow dramatically over the coming years as there are huge reserves of minerals such as coal , copper , gold and uranium . there have been reports that illegal gold miners , so-called " ninjas " , have been polluting the environment with mercury . gansukh agreed that this was a concern : " in the past 20 years , during the transition period from a planned to a market economy , there were many instances of small-scale gold mining , which were not always environmentally friendly .
we will not tolerate that anymore .
we have a new law that does not allow small-scale gold mining which damages the environment .

it says diabetes is " one of the world ’ s most important causes of expenditure , mortality , disability and lost economic growth " . many experts say it will be one of the most serious pandemics of the 21st century .
professor rüdiger landgraf of germany 's diabetes foundation says asian countries will bear the brunt .
" it is increasing rapidly and is expected to rise by up to 60 percent within the next 20 years . " 10 percent of asian americans have type ii diabetes the most frequent kind of diabetes is type ii , which used to be associated mainly with old age , but is affecting more and more young people . " about 10 percent of asian americans are affected by type ii diabetes , " explains qing li , a research scientist at the stanford university school of medicine .
" that is a very big number .
they have high diabetes rates compared with caucasians , suggesting a strong role of genetics in the development of diabetes .
the complex interaction between genetics and the lifestyle leads to the increase of diabetes in asian people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if we exercised more , we would eat less and be less at risk of developing disease , say experts this is also the case in asia itself , where " in recent years the chinese economy has developed very fast and people can have more western-style food like mcdonalds , kentucky fried chicken etc , " says qing li . " they have adapted to western-style food , " landgraf agrees .
" they have adopted western eating and drinking habits .
coca cola is considered a national drink by many in the usa and now in the rest of the world too .
people tend to like things that are sweet . " he says high-sugar beverages and other extremely calorie-dense foods play a large role .
the intake of too many calories over time warps the body ’ s production and use of insulin – one of the reasons the risk of getting type ii increases with age . lack of exercise increases risk of diabetes but there is another major factor , says landgraf , and this is that people are getting a lot less exercise .
" they are using cars more and more , which means that they are moving around a lot less while their calorie intake is staying the same or is even higher than before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obesity is increasing across asia " these are the best conditions – especially if there is a genetic factor – for developing some kind of metabolic malfunction and eventually diabetes .
if we were to get more exercise , then we would probably eat less .
eating has a lot to do with frustration , boredom , loneliness and other things .
it is n't that we are hungry , but that we are looking for a replacement for other things that are missing in society today . " the new study also warns that there is an even higher number of pre-diabetics than diabetics .
moreover , the un has found that in some countries up to 90 percent of people with diabetes do not receive treatment . author : sarah berning editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 02.04.2010 helmut kohl , chancellor of germany 's reunification , turns 80 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating german unity on october 3 , 1990 is what helmut kohl is ' most proud of ' helmut kohl is considered the architect of german reunification and a driving force behind european integration .
yet after 16 years in power his reputation was tainted by links to slush funds and party donations . there 's little doubt that helmut kohl will go down in history as the chancellor of german reunification .
on november 10 , 1989 - after the night the berlin wall fell , the then west german chancellor spoke from the balcony of the city hall - giving his vision of a future of european unity .
" this is about unity , about justice and freedom , " he said , quoting the opening line of the west german national anthem .
" long live a free german fatherland , long live a free and united europe . "
calling for a free and united germany was a provocation to many back then who did not want a large and powerful germany to dominate the map of europe ever again .
the fall of the berlin wall raised concerns in neighboring countries .
france 's francois mitterand was hesitant , britain 's margaret thatcher fully against reunification .
the man behind german reunification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1990 kohl repeatedly traveled to moscow to win gorbachev 's support but in the end it came down to convincing soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to agree to reunification - and helmut kohl did the trick .
less than one year after the iron curtain in berlin started to disintegrate , germany celebrated its reunification on october 3 , 1990 .
" after the events in 1989 , germany needed the trust and the confidence of the people around her that she would go all right into the future and not become the great behemoth again that she was once feared for , " political analyst thomas kielinger told deutsche welle .
" and in order to achieve that , kohl used that unique ability of his to be close to the people and to the main players , to get across his genuine belief that germany is here for the good and she will be deeply enmeshed in europe and there 's nothing to fear about her . "
helmut kohl seized the opportunity that history gave him .
but his ambitions went further than germany .
he saw his country as an integral element of a united europe .
with the 1992 maastricht treaty , he and francois mitterand mapped out the future of the eu and laid the groundwork for the euro , the bloc 's single currency .
bildunterschrift : soviet leader gorbachev , us president bush and germany 's kohl were the three heads of state behind german reunification .
in november 2009 they met again to celebrate 20 years of the fall of the wall the pull of power kohl 's other lifelong ambition was to gain power .
born in 1930 , he entered professional politics at the age of 29 in his home state of rhineland-palatinate .
kohl quickly rose through the ranks of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- until , in 1973 , he became the leader of the party - but that was n't enough .
" i want to be chancellor ; i want to win the elections and become chancellor , " he said , leaving no room for doubt about his ambitions .
he first stood in an election for chancellor in 1976 but lost against social democrat helmut schmidt . in 1982 the schmidt government collapsed after a failed vote of confidence and kohl stepped in .
he formed a new coalition with the liberal free democrats and became chancellor .
his policy was one of more freedom for the individual and less intervention by the state .
" we are convinced that the free initiative and achievements of the individual are better for everyone than state control , " he said .
" we trust people to take their future into their own hands . "
after initial success , however , kohl 's policies failed to deal with growing unemployment .
his popularity dropped and his chances of surviving the 80s in a position of power were considered slim .
" but then came the caesura : the collapse of the post-war world order and the fall of the wall , " said thomas kielinger .
" and helmut kohl went with glory , he seized the moment and pushed aside all the doubters - and there were many in germany who did n't quite think the country could cope with this moment and i think this is the view and the abiding image that people and historians have about him . "
slush funds and allegations of corruption it was thanks to the drive for reunification that kohl won the elections in 1990 .
but as much as he had worked for a united germany , he drastically underestimated the costs that would follow .
the financial burden seemed too much to deal with and unemployment continued to climb dramatically .
in 1998 kohl was defeated at the polls by social democrat gerhard schroeder , and also stepped down as the leader of the german conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's standing in germany suffered significantly after the slush funds scandal it was then that his star seemed to hit rock bottom .
kohl found himself embroiled in one of the worst slush fund scandals of post-war german politics .
it emerged that he had fed party coffers with over 2 million marks -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.3 million -rrb- in secret donations .
kohl refused to name any of the secret party donors , which threw the christian democrats into a state of severe crisis .
in the subsequent fallout kohl even had to resign from his post as honorary chairman of the party in 2000 .
it was angela merkel , the current german chancellor , a protege of kohl 's , who then took over at the helm of the cdu .
in 2001 kohl lost his wife hannelore who committed suicide after suffering for years from photodermatitis , a severe form of sensitivity to light .
kohl married maike richter in 2005 .
at the age of 80 he is no longer physically able to attend any elaborate birthday celebrations and will spend the day at home in private .
an official reception is scheduled for may 5 , with around 1,000 guests expected in his hometown of ludwigshafen .

it says diabetes is " one of the world ’ s most important causes of expenditure , mortality , disability and lost economic growth " . many experts say it will be one of the most serious pandemics of the 21st century .
professor rüdiger landgraf of germany 's diabetes foundation says asian countries will bear the brunt .
" it is increasing rapidly and is expected to rise by up to 60 percent within the next 20 years . " 10 percent of asian americans have type ii diabetes the most frequent kind of diabetes is type ii , which used to be associated mainly with old age , but is affecting more and more young people . " about 10 percent of asian americans are affected by type ii diabetes , " explains qing li , a research scientist at the stanford university school of medicine .
" that is a very big number .
they have high diabetes rates compared with caucasians , suggesting a strong role of genetics in the development of diabetes .
the complex interaction between genetics and the lifestyle leads to the increase of diabetes in asian people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if we exercised more , we would eat less and be less at risk of developing disease , say experts this is also the case in asia itself , where " in recent years the chinese economy has developed very fast and people can have more western-style food like mcdonalds , kentucky fried chicken etc , " says qing li . " they have adapted to western-style food , " landgraf agrees .
" they have adopted western eating and drinking habits .
coca cola is considered a national drink by many in the usa and now in the rest of the world too .
people tend to like things that are sweet . " he says high-sugar beverages and other extremely calorie-dense foods play a large role .
the intake of too many calories over time warps the body ’ s production and use of insulin – one of the reasons the risk of getting type ii increases with age . lack of exercise increases risk of diabetes but there is another major factor , says landgraf , and this is that people are getting a lot less exercise .
" they are using cars more and more , which means that they are moving around a lot less while their calorie intake is staying the same or is even higher than before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obesity is increasing across asia " these are the best conditions – especially if there is a genetic factor – for developing some kind of metabolic malfunction and eventually diabetes .
if we were to get more exercise , then we would probably eat less .
eating has a lot to do with frustration , boredom , loneliness and other things .
it is n't that we are hungry , but that we are looking for a replacement for other things that are missing in society today . " the new study also warns that there is an even higher number of pre-diabetics than diabetics .
moreover , the un has found that in some countries up to 90 percent of people with diabetes do not receive treatment . author : sarah berning editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

across germany , the abuse scandal is shaping good friday services . the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , archbishop of freiburg robert zollitsch , released a statement on good friday acknowledging the failure of the catholic church to satisfactorily handle the sex abuse scandal . zollitsch admitted that , in the past , the church had done too little to help abuse victims , and said the church 's response was a reflection of contemporary social mores .
" today , it is clear to us : previously the social situation was different , and we allowed ourselves to be overcome - by disappointment over the painful failure of the perpetrators and mistaken concern over the reputation of the church , " said zollitsch in a written statement that his diocese released on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abuse scandal is dominating easter services " not enough help was given to the victims , " he added as he spoke of " wounds that may never be healed . "
scandal shapes good friday however , good friday could provide a new beginning for the church , said zollitsch .
many catholic dioceses are addressing the sex abuse scandal during easter services , with a prayer for the victims written by the bishop of trier , stephen ackermann .
in his own good friday sermon , ackermann addressed the psychological wounds of sexual abuse victims , referring to the healing of the wounds of jesus . search for forgiveness across europe earlier in the week , the archbishop of vienna , christoph schoenborn , expressed the church 's guilt in the scandal , incurred during years of silence and cover-ups .
bishops across austria and switzerland appealed to parishioners to come forward with their allegations and schoenborn thanked in particular the victims who had broken their silence .
" we confess our guilt to the many whom we have wronged as a church , and whom some of us have wronged very directly , " said schoenborn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have rejected schoenborn 's apologies however , church critics in austria have dismissed schoenborn 's apology as " insufficient . "
the activist platform , betroffene kirchlicher gewalt , or " victims of church violence , " said it would not accept " mere apologies and prayers for humility . "
in a separate display of solidarity with the victims of church abuse , the artist emmerich weissenberger crucified himself on the facade of vienna 's st. stephan 's cathedral on friday .
the artist was symbolically wearing a loin cloth and a crown of thorns - in this case barbed wire - while fastened to the church at a height of 20 meters .
meanwhile , the head of the catholic church , german-born pope benedict xvi has so far avoided addressing the growing criticism of the widespread abuse scandal .
a vatican spokesman had previously told the ap news agency that the pope viewed the crisis as a " test for both him and the church .

" we confess our guilt to the many whom we have wronged as a church , and whom some of us have wronged very directly , " said schoenborn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have rejected schoenborn 's apologies however , church critics in austria have dismissed schoenborn 's apology as " insufficient . "

it admitted using cash and gifts to secure global contracts . lawyers representing the giant german car manufacturer , daimler , and three of its subsidiaries , appeared before a us judge in washington dc thursday and agreed to pay fines totalling some 136 million euros -lrb- $ 185 million -rrb- to settle bribery charges .
the us justice department and the securities and exchange commission had accused the makers of the famous mercedes-benz car range of systematically using large cash payments and extravagent gifts to secure lucrative contracts around the globe .
daimler 's german and russian units each agreed to plead guilty to two counts of violating us anti-bribery laws .
charges relate to 22 different countries the car giant and biggest manufacturer of trucks worldwide was accused of giving some 41 million euros in bribes related to more than 200 transactions in 22 countries between 1998 and 2008 .
the deals earned the company 1.4 billion euros in revenue and at least 69 billion euros in allegedly illegal profits .

the us court deal came after positive reports from prosecutors that daimler and two of its russian subsidiaries had fully cooperated with the investigation .

deal closes case by paying the substantial fines , daimler will avoid any further criminal prosecution , but the company will remain subject to a two-year deferred prosecution agreement and oversight by an independent monitor .

the intake of too many calories over time warps the body ’ s production and use of insulin – one of the reasons the risk of getting type ii increases with age . lack of exercise increases risk of diabetes but there is another major factor , says landgraf , and this is that people are getting a lot less exercise .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overgrazing has become a serious problem " the average elevation in mongolia is around 1,500 meters above sea level , " he explained .
" and due to our geographical conditions , mongolia is one of the countries which are very strongly impacted by the global climate change .

it says diabetes is " one of the world ’ s most important causes of expenditure , mortality , disability and lost economic growth " . many experts say it will be one of the most serious pandemics of the 21st century .
professor rüdiger landgraf of germany 's diabetes foundation says asian countries will bear the brunt .
" it is increasing rapidly and is expected to rise by up to 60 percent within the next 20 years . " 10 percent of asian americans have type ii diabetes the most frequent kind of diabetes is type ii , which used to be associated mainly with old age , but is affecting more and more young people . " about 10 percent of asian americans are affected by type ii diabetes , " explains qing li , a research scientist at the stanford university school of medicine .
" that is a very big number .
they have high diabetes rates compared with caucasians , suggesting a strong role of genetics in the development of diabetes .
the complex interaction between genetics and the lifestyle leads to the increase of diabetes in asian people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if we exercised more , we would eat less and be less at risk of developing disease , say experts this is also the case in asia itself , where " in recent years the chinese economy has developed very fast and people can have more western-style food like mcdonalds , kentucky fried chicken etc , " says qing li . " they have adapted to western-style food , " landgraf agrees .
" they have adopted western eating and drinking habits .
coca cola is considered a national drink by many in the usa and now in the rest of the world too .
people tend to like things that are sweet . " he says high-sugar beverages and other extremely calorie-dense foods play a large role .
the intake of too many calories over time warps the body ’ s production and use of insulin – one of the reasons the risk of getting type ii increases with age . lack of exercise increases risk of diabetes but there is another major factor , says landgraf , and this is that people are getting a lot less exercise .
" they are using cars more and more , which means that they are moving around a lot less while their calorie intake is staying the same or is even higher than before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obesity is increasing across asia " these are the best conditions – especially if there is a genetic factor – for developing some kind of metabolic malfunction and eventually diabetes .
if we were to get more exercise , then we would probably eat less .
eating has a lot to do with frustration , boredom , loneliness and other things .
it is n't that we are hungry , but that we are looking for a replacement for other things that are missing in society today . " the new study also warns that there is an even higher number of pre-diabetics than diabetics .
moreover , the un has found that in some countries up to 90 percent of people with diabetes do not receive treatment . author : sarah berning editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 02.04.2010 helmut kohl , chancellor of germany 's reunification , turns 80 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating german unity on october 3 , 1990 is what helmut kohl is ' most proud of ' helmut kohl is considered the architect of german reunification and a driving force behind european integration .
yet after 16 years in power his reputation was tainted by links to slush funds and party donations . there 's little doubt that helmut kohl will go down in history as the chancellor of german reunification .
on november 10 , 1989 - after the night the berlin wall fell , the then west german chancellor spoke from the balcony of the city hall - giving his vision of a future of european unity .
" this is about unity , about justice and freedom , " he said , quoting the opening line of the west german national anthem .
" long live a free german fatherland , long live a free and united europe . "
calling for a free and united germany was a provocation to many back then who did not want a large and powerful germany to dominate the map of europe ever again .
the fall of the berlin wall raised concerns in neighboring countries .
france 's francois mitterand was hesitant , britain 's margaret thatcher fully against reunification .
the man behind german reunification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1990 kohl repeatedly traveled to moscow to win gorbachev 's support but in the end it came down to convincing soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to agree to reunification - and helmut kohl did the trick .
less than one year after the iron curtain in berlin started to disintegrate , germany celebrated its reunification on october 3 , 1990 .
" after the events in 1989 , germany needed the trust and the confidence of the people around her that she would go all right into the future and not become the great behemoth again that she was once feared for , " political analyst thomas kielinger told deutsche welle .
" and in order to achieve that , kohl used that unique ability of his to be close to the people and to the main players , to get across his genuine belief that germany is here for the good and she will be deeply enmeshed in europe and there 's nothing to fear about her . "
helmut kohl seized the opportunity that history gave him .
but his ambitions went further than germany .
he saw his country as an integral element of a united europe .
with the 1992 maastricht treaty , he and francois mitterand mapped out the future of the eu and laid the groundwork for the euro , the bloc 's single currency .
bildunterschrift : soviet leader gorbachev , us president bush and germany 's kohl were the three heads of state behind german reunification .
in november 2009 they met again to celebrate 20 years of the fall of the wall the pull of power kohl 's other lifelong ambition was to gain power .
born in 1930 , he entered professional politics at the age of 29 in his home state of rhineland-palatinate .
kohl quickly rose through the ranks of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- until , in 1973 , he became the leader of the party - but that was n't enough .
" i want to be chancellor ; i want to win the elections and become chancellor , " he said , leaving no room for doubt about his ambitions .
he first stood in an election for chancellor in 1976 but lost against social democrat helmut schmidt . in 1982 the schmidt government collapsed after a failed vote of confidence and kohl stepped in .
he formed a new coalition with the liberal free democrats and became chancellor .
his policy was one of more freedom for the individual and less intervention by the state .
" we are convinced that the free initiative and achievements of the individual are better for everyone than state control , " he said .
" we trust people to take their future into their own hands . "
after initial success , however , kohl 's policies failed to deal with growing unemployment .
his popularity dropped and his chances of surviving the 80s in a position of power were considered slim .
" but then came the caesura : the collapse of the post-war world order and the fall of the wall , " said thomas kielinger .
" and helmut kohl went with glory , he seized the moment and pushed aside all the doubters - and there were many in germany who did n't quite think the country could cope with this moment and i think this is the view and the abiding image that people and historians have about him . "
slush funds and allegations of corruption it was thanks to the drive for reunification that kohl won the elections in 1990 .
but as much as he had worked for a united germany , he drastically underestimated the costs that would follow .
the financial burden seemed too much to deal with and unemployment continued to climb dramatically .
in 1998 kohl was defeated at the polls by social democrat gerhard schroeder , and also stepped down as the leader of the german conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's standing in germany suffered significantly after the slush funds scandal it was then that his star seemed to hit rock bottom .
kohl found himself embroiled in one of the worst slush fund scandals of post-war german politics .
it emerged that he had fed party coffers with over 2 million marks -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.3 million -rrb- in secret donations .
kohl refused to name any of the secret party donors , which threw the christian democrats into a state of severe crisis .
in the subsequent fallout kohl even had to resign from his post as honorary chairman of the party in 2000 .
it was angela merkel , the current german chancellor , a protege of kohl 's , who then took over at the helm of the cdu .
in 2001 kohl lost his wife hannelore who committed suicide after suffering for years from photodermatitis , a severe form of sensitivity to light .
kohl married maike richter in 2005 .
at the age of 80 he is no longer physically able to attend any elaborate birthday celebrations and will spend the day at home in private .
an official reception is scheduled for may 5 , with around 1,000 guests expected in his hometown of ludwigshafen .

" we confess our guilt to the many whom we have wronged as a church , and whom some of us have wronged very directly , " said schoenborn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have rejected schoenborn 's apologies however , church critics in austria have dismissed schoenborn 's apology as " insufficient . "
the activist platform , betroffene kirchlicher gewalt , or " victims of church violence , " said it would not accept " mere apologies and prayers for humility . "
in a separate display of solidarity with the victims of church abuse , the artist emmerich weissenberger crucified himself on the facade of vienna 's st. stephan 's cathedral on friday .
the artist was symbolically wearing a loin cloth and a crown of thorns - in this case barbed wire - while fastened to the church at a height of 20 meters .
meanwhile , the head of the catholic church , german-born pope benedict xvi has so far avoided addressing the growing criticism of the widespread abuse scandal .

yet after 16 years in power his reputation was tainted by links to slush funds and party donations . there 's little doubt that helmut kohl will go down in history as the chancellor of german reunification .
on november 10 , 1989 - after the night the berlin wall fell , the then west german chancellor spoke from the balcony of the city hall - giving his vision of a future of european unity .
" this is about unity , about justice and freedom , " he said , quoting the opening line of the west german national anthem .
" long live a free german fatherland , long live a free and united europe . "
calling for a free and united germany was a provocation to many back then who did not want a large and powerful germany to dominate the map of europe ever again .
the fall of the berlin wall raised concerns in neighboring countries .
france 's francois mitterand was hesitant , britain 's margaret thatcher fully against reunification .
the man behind german reunification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1990 kohl repeatedly traveled to moscow to win gorbachev 's support but in the end it came down to convincing soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to agree to reunification - and helmut kohl did the trick .
less than one year after the iron curtain in berlin started to disintegrate , germany celebrated its reunification on october 3 , 1990 .
" after the events in 1989 , germany needed the trust and the confidence of the people around her that she would go all right into the future and not become the great behemoth again that she was once feared for , " political analyst thomas kielinger told deutsche welle .
" and in order to achieve that , kohl used that unique ability of his to be close to the people and to the main players , to get across his genuine belief that germany is here for the good and she will be deeply enmeshed in europe and there 's nothing to fear about her . "
helmut kohl seized the opportunity that history gave him .
but his ambitions went further than germany .
he saw his country as an integral element of a united europe .
with the 1992 maastricht treaty , he and francois mitterand mapped out the future of the eu and laid the groundwork for the euro , the bloc 's single currency .
bildunterschrift : soviet leader gorbachev , us president bush and germany 's kohl were the three heads of state behind german reunification .
in november 2009 they met again to celebrate 20 years of the fall of the wall the pull of power kohl 's other lifelong ambition was to gain power .
born in 1930 , he entered professional politics at the age of 29 in his home state of rhineland-palatinate .
kohl quickly rose through the ranks of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- until , in 1973 , he became the leader of the party - but that was n't enough .
" i want to be chancellor ; i want to win the elections and become chancellor , " he said , leaving no room for doubt about his ambitions .
he first stood in an election for chancellor in 1976 but lost against social democrat helmut schmidt . in 1982 the schmidt government collapsed after a failed vote of confidence and kohl stepped in .
he formed a new coalition with the liberal free democrats and became chancellor .
his policy was one of more freedom for the individual and less intervention by the state .
" we are convinced that the free initiative and achievements of the individual are better for everyone than state control , " he said .
" we trust people to take their future into their own hands . "
after initial success , however , kohl 's policies failed to deal with growing unemployment .
his popularity dropped and his chances of surviving the 80s in a position of power were considered slim .
" but then came the caesura : the collapse of the post-war world order and the fall of the wall , " said thomas kielinger .
" and helmut kohl went with glory , he seized the moment and pushed aside all the doubters - and there were many in germany who did n't quite think the country could cope with this moment and i think this is the view and the abiding image that people and historians have about him . "
slush funds and allegations of corruption it was thanks to the drive for reunification that kohl won the elections in 1990 .
but as much as he had worked for a united germany , he drastically underestimated the costs that would follow .
the financial burden seemed too much to deal with and unemployment continued to climb dramatically .
in 1998 kohl was defeated at the polls by social democrat gerhard schroeder , and also stepped down as the leader of the german conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's standing in germany suffered significantly after the slush funds scandal it was then that his star seemed to hit rock bottom .
kohl found himself embroiled in one of the worst slush fund scandals of post-war german politics .
it emerged that he had fed party coffers with over 2 million marks -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.3 million -rrb- in secret donations .
kohl refused to name any of the secret party donors , which threw the christian democrats into a state of severe crisis .
in the subsequent fallout kohl even had to resign from his post as honorary chairman of the party in 2000 .
it was angela merkel , the current german chancellor , a protege of kohl 's , who then took over at the helm of the cdu .
in 2001 kohl lost his wife hannelore who committed suicide after suffering for years from photodermatitis , a severe form of sensitivity to light .
kohl married maike richter in 2005 .
at the age of 80 he is no longer physically able to attend any elaborate birthday celebrations and will spend the day at home in private .
an official reception is scheduled for may 5 , with around 1,000 guests expected in his hometown of ludwigshafen .

it emerged that he had fed party coffers with over 2 million marks -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.3 million -rrb- in secret donations .
kohl refused to name any of the secret party donors , which threw the christian democrats into a state of severe crisis .

kohl married maike richter in 2005 .
at the age of 80 he is no longer physically able to attend any elaborate birthday celebrations and will spend the day at home in private .

" we confess our guilt to the many whom we have wronged as a church , and whom some of us have wronged very directly , " said schoenborn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have rejected schoenborn 's apologies however , church critics in austria have dismissed schoenborn 's apology as " insufficient . "
the activist platform , betroffene kirchlicher gewalt , or " victims of church violence , " said it would not accept " mere apologies and prayers for humility . "
in a separate display of solidarity with the victims of church abuse , the artist emmerich weissenberger crucified himself on the facade of vienna 's st. stephan 's cathedral on friday .
the artist was symbolically wearing a loin cloth and a crown of thorns - in this case barbed wire - while fastened to the church at a height of 20 meters .
meanwhile , the head of the catholic church , german-born pope benedict xvi has so far avoided addressing the growing criticism of the widespread abuse scandal .
a vatican spokesman had previously told the ap news agency that the pope viewed the crisis as a " test for both him and the church .

yet after 16 years in power his reputation was tainted by links to slush funds and party donations . there 's little doubt that helmut kohl will go down in history as the chancellor of german reunification .
on november 10 , 1989 - after the night the berlin wall fell , the then west german chancellor spoke from the balcony of the city hall - giving his vision of a future of european unity .
" this is about unity , about justice and freedom , " he said , quoting the opening line of the west german national anthem .
" long live a free german fatherland , long live a free and united europe . "
calling for a free and united germany was a provocation to many back then who did not want a large and powerful germany to dominate the map of europe ever again .
the fall of the berlin wall raised concerns in neighboring countries .
france 's francois mitterand was hesitant , britain 's margaret thatcher fully against reunification .
the man behind german reunification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1990 kohl repeatedly traveled to moscow to win gorbachev 's support but in the end it came down to convincing soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to agree to reunification - and helmut kohl did the trick .
less than one year after the iron curtain in berlin started to disintegrate , germany celebrated its reunification on october 3 , 1990 .
" after the events in 1989 , germany needed the trust and the confidence of the people around her that she would go all right into the future and not become the great behemoth again that she was once feared for , " political analyst thomas kielinger told deutsche welle .
" and in order to achieve that , kohl used that unique ability of his to be close to the people and to the main players , to get across his genuine belief that germany is here for the good and she will be deeply enmeshed in europe and there 's nothing to fear about her . "
helmut kohl seized the opportunity that history gave him .
but his ambitions went further than germany .
he saw his country as an integral element of a united europe .
with the 1992 maastricht treaty , he and francois mitterand mapped out the future of the eu and laid the groundwork for the euro , the bloc 's single currency .
bildunterschrift : soviet leader gorbachev , us president bush and germany 's kohl were the three heads of state behind german reunification .
in november 2009 they met again to celebrate 20 years of the fall of the wall the pull of power kohl 's other lifelong ambition was to gain power .
born in 1930 , he entered professional politics at the age of 29 in his home state of rhineland-palatinate .
kohl quickly rose through the ranks of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- until , in 1973 , he became the leader of the party - but that was n't enough .
" i want to be chancellor ; i want to win the elections and become chancellor , " he said , leaving no room for doubt about his ambitions .
he first stood in an election for chancellor in 1976 but lost against social democrat helmut schmidt . in 1982 the schmidt government collapsed after a failed vote of confidence and kohl stepped in .
he formed a new coalition with the liberal free democrats and became chancellor .
his policy was one of more freedom for the individual and less intervention by the state .
" we are convinced that the free initiative and achievements of the individual are better for everyone than state control , " he said .
" we trust people to take their future into their own hands . "
after initial success , however , kohl 's policies failed to deal with growing unemployment .
his popularity dropped and his chances of surviving the 80s in a position of power were considered slim .
" but then came the caesura : the collapse of the post-war world order and the fall of the wall , " said thomas kielinger .
" and helmut kohl went with glory , he seized the moment and pushed aside all the doubters - and there were many in germany who did n't quite think the country could cope with this moment and i think this is the view and the abiding image that people and historians have about him . "
slush funds and allegations of corruption it was thanks to the drive for reunification that kohl won the elections in 1990 .
but as much as he had worked for a united germany , he drastically underestimated the costs that would follow .
the financial burden seemed too much to deal with and unemployment continued to climb dramatically .
in 1998 kohl was defeated at the polls by social democrat gerhard schroeder , and also stepped down as the leader of the german conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's standing in germany suffered significantly after the slush funds scandal it was then that his star seemed to hit rock bottom .
kohl found himself embroiled in one of the worst slush fund scandals of post-war german politics .
it emerged that he had fed party coffers with over 2 million marks -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.3 million -rrb- in secret donations .
kohl refused to name any of the secret party donors , which threw the christian democrats into a state of severe crisis .
in the subsequent fallout kohl even had to resign from his post as honorary chairman of the party in 2000 .
it was angela merkel , the current german chancellor , a protege of kohl 's , who then took over at the helm of the cdu .
in 2001 kohl lost his wife hannelore who committed suicide after suffering for years from photodermatitis , a severe form of sensitivity to light .
kohl married maike richter in 2005 .
at the age of 80 he is no longer physically able to attend any elaborate birthday celebrations and will spend the day at home in private .
an official reception is scheduled for may 5 , with around 1,000 guests expected in his hometown of ludwigshafen .

across germany , the abuse scandal is shaping good friday services . the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , archbishop of freiburg robert zollitsch , released a statement on good friday acknowledging the failure of the catholic church to satisfactorily handle the sex abuse scandal . zollitsch admitted that , in the past , the church had done too little to help abuse victims , and said the church 's response was a reflection of contemporary social mores .
" today , it is clear to us : previously the social situation was different , and we allowed ourselves to be overcome - by disappointment over the painful failure of the perpetrators and mistaken concern over the reputation of the church , " said zollitsch in a written statement that his diocese released on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abuse scandal is dominating easter services " not enough help was given to the victims , " he added as he spoke of " wounds that may never be healed . "
scandal shapes good friday however , good friday could provide a new beginning for the church , said zollitsch .
many catholic dioceses are addressing the sex abuse scandal during easter services , with a prayer for the victims written by the bishop of trier , stephen ackermann .
in his own good friday sermon , ackermann addressed the psychological wounds of sexual abuse victims , referring to the healing of the wounds of jesus . search for forgiveness across europe earlier in the week , the archbishop of vienna , christoph schoenborn , expressed the church 's guilt in the scandal , incurred during years of silence and cover-ups .
bishops across austria and switzerland appealed to parishioners to come forward with their allegations and schoenborn thanked in particular the victims who had broken their silence .
" we confess our guilt to the many whom we have wronged as a church , and whom some of us have wronged very directly , " said schoenborn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have rejected schoenborn 's apologies however , church critics in austria have dismissed schoenborn 's apology as " insufficient . "
the activist platform , betroffene kirchlicher gewalt , or " victims of church violence , " said it would not accept " mere apologies and prayers for humility . "
in a separate display of solidarity with the victims of church abuse , the artist emmerich weissenberger crucified himself on the facade of vienna 's st. stephan 's cathedral on friday .
the artist was symbolically wearing a loin cloth and a crown of thorns - in this case barbed wire - while fastened to the church at a height of 20 meters .
meanwhile , the head of the catholic church , german-born pope benedict xvi has so far avoided addressing the growing criticism of the widespread abuse scandal .
a vatican spokesman had previously told the ap news agency that the pope viewed the crisis as a " test for both him and the church .

it says diabetes is " one of the world ’ s most important causes of expenditure , mortality , disability and lost economic growth " . many experts say it will be one of the most serious pandemics of the 21st century .
professor rüdiger landgraf of germany 's diabetes foundation says asian countries will bear the brunt .
" it is increasing rapidly and is expected to rise by up to 60 percent within the next 20 years . " 10 percent of asian americans have type ii diabetes the most frequent kind of diabetes is type ii , which used to be associated mainly with old age , but is affecting more and more young people . " about 10 percent of asian americans are affected by type ii diabetes , " explains qing li , a research scientist at the stanford university school of medicine .
" that is a very big number .

coca cola is considered a national drink by many in the usa and now in the rest of the world too .

the intake of too many calories over time warps the body ’ s production and use of insulin – one of the reasons the risk of getting type ii increases with age . lack of exercise increases risk of diabetes but there is another major factor , says landgraf , and this is that people are getting a lot less exercise .
" they are using cars more and more , which means that they are moving around a lot less while their calorie intake is staying the same or is even higher than before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obesity is increasing across asia " these are the best conditions – especially if there is a genetic factor – for developing some kind of metabolic malfunction and eventually diabetes .

eating has a lot to do with frustration , boredom , loneliness and other things .

it admitted using cash and gifts to secure global contracts . lawyers representing the giant german car manufacturer , daimler , and three of its subsidiaries , appeared before a us judge in washington dc thursday and agreed to pay fines totalling some 136 million euros -lrb- $ 185 million -rrb- to settle bribery charges .
the us justice department and the securities and exchange commission had accused the makers of the famous mercedes-benz car range of systematically using large cash payments and extravagent gifts to secure lucrative contracts around the globe .
daimler 's german and russian units each agreed to plead guilty to two counts of violating us anti-bribery laws .
charges relate to 22 different countries the car giant and biggest manufacturer of trucks worldwide was accused of giving some 41 million euros in bribes related to more than 200 transactions in 22 countries between 1998 and 2008 .
the deals earned the company 1.4 billion euros in revenue and at least 69 billion euros in allegedly illegal profits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us case may damage the mercedes image the systematic kickbacks were made in spite of a 1999 decision by the company 's board to adopt an integrity code and abide by an international anti-bribery agreement , which had been ratified by the german government .
the us court deal came after positive reports from prosecutors that daimler and two of its russian subsidiaries had fully cooperated with the investigation .
prosecutors said that daimler had regularly presented its findings to the court , fired 45 employees implicated in the bribery and reformed its practices .
deal closes case by paying the substantial fines , daimler will avoid any further criminal prosecution , but the company will remain subject to a two-year deferred prosecution agreement and oversight by an independent monitor .
although the fines are significant , the 136 million euro deal is far less that the 736 million euro -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- penalty inposed on another global germany company , siemens , by us courts in 2008. td / ap / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 02.04.2010 helmut kohl , chancellor of germany 's reunification , turns 80 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating german unity on october 3 , 1990 is what helmut kohl is ' most proud of ' helmut kohl is considered the architect of german reunification and a driving force behind european integration .
yet after 16 years in power his reputation was tainted by links to slush funds and party donations . there 's little doubt that helmut kohl will go down in history as the chancellor of german reunification .
on november 10 , 1989 - after the night the berlin wall fell , the then west german chancellor spoke from the balcony of the city hall - giving his vision of a future of european unity .
" this is about unity , about justice and freedom , " he said , quoting the opening line of the west german national anthem .
" long live a free german fatherland , long live a free and united europe . "
calling for a free and united germany was a provocation to many back then who did not want a large and powerful germany to dominate the map of europe ever again .
the fall of the berlin wall raised concerns in neighboring countries .
france 's francois mitterand was hesitant , britain 's margaret thatcher fully against reunification .
the man behind german reunification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1990 kohl repeatedly traveled to moscow to win gorbachev 's support but in the end it came down to convincing soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to agree to reunification - and helmut kohl did the trick .
less than one year after the iron curtain in berlin started to disintegrate , germany celebrated its reunification on october 3 , 1990 .
" after the events in 1989 , germany needed the trust and the confidence of the people around her that she would go all right into the future and not become the great behemoth again that she was once feared for , " political analyst thomas kielinger told deutsche welle .
" and in order to achieve that , kohl used that unique ability of his to be close to the people and to the main players , to get across his genuine belief that germany is here for the good and she will be deeply enmeshed in europe and there 's nothing to fear about her . "
helmut kohl seized the opportunity that history gave him .
but his ambitions went further than germany .
he saw his country as an integral element of a united europe .
with the 1992 maastricht treaty , he and francois mitterand mapped out the future of the eu and laid the groundwork for the euro , the bloc 's single currency .
bildunterschrift : soviet leader gorbachev , us president bush and germany 's kohl were the three heads of state behind german reunification .
in november 2009 they met again to celebrate 20 years of the fall of the wall the pull of power kohl 's other lifelong ambition was to gain power .
born in 1930 , he entered professional politics at the age of 29 in his home state of rhineland-palatinate .
kohl quickly rose through the ranks of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- until , in 1973 , he became the leader of the party - but that was n't enough .
" i want to be chancellor ; i want to win the elections and become chancellor , " he said , leaving no room for doubt about his ambitions .
he first stood in an election for chancellor in 1976 but lost against social democrat helmut schmidt . in 1982 the schmidt government collapsed after a failed vote of confidence and kohl stepped in .
he formed a new coalition with the liberal free democrats and became chancellor .
his policy was one of more freedom for the individual and less intervention by the state .
" we are convinced that the free initiative and achievements of the individual are better for everyone than state control , " he said .
" we trust people to take their future into their own hands . "
after initial success , however , kohl 's policies failed to deal with growing unemployment .
his popularity dropped and his chances of surviving the 80s in a position of power were considered slim .
" but then came the caesura : the collapse of the post-war world order and the fall of the wall , " said thomas kielinger .
" and helmut kohl went with glory , he seized the moment and pushed aside all the doubters - and there were many in germany who did n't quite think the country could cope with this moment and i think this is the view and the abiding image that people and historians have about him . "
slush funds and allegations of corruption it was thanks to the drive for reunification that kohl won the elections in 1990 .
but as much as he had worked for a united germany , he drastically underestimated the costs that would follow .
the financial burden seemed too much to deal with and unemployment continued to climb dramatically .
in 1998 kohl was defeated at the polls by social democrat gerhard schroeder , and also stepped down as the leader of the german conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's standing in germany suffered significantly after the slush funds scandal it was then that his star seemed to hit rock bottom .
kohl found himself embroiled in one of the worst slush fund scandals of post-war german politics .
it emerged that he had fed party coffers with over 2 million marks -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.3 million -rrb- in secret donations .
kohl refused to name any of the secret party donors , which threw the christian democrats into a state of severe crisis .
in the subsequent fallout kohl even had to resign from his post as honorary chairman of the party in 2000 .
it was angela merkel , the current german chancellor , a protege of kohl 's , who then took over at the helm of the cdu .
in 2001 kohl lost his wife hannelore who committed suicide after suffering for years from photodermatitis , a severe form of sensitivity to light .
kohl married maike richter in 2005 .
at the age of 80 he is no longer physically able to attend any elaborate birthday celebrations and will spend the day at home in private .
an official reception is scheduled for may 5 , with around 1,000 guests expected in his hometown of ludwigshafen .

yet after 16 years in power his reputation was tainted by links to slush funds and party donations . there 's little doubt that helmut kohl will go down in history as the chancellor of german reunification .
on november 10 , 1989 - after the night the berlin wall fell , the then west german chancellor spoke from the balcony of the city hall - giving his vision of a future of european unity .
" this is about unity , about justice and freedom , " he said , quoting the opening line of the west german national anthem .
" long live a free german fatherland , long live a free and united europe . "
calling for a free and united germany was a provocation to many back then who did not want a large and powerful germany to dominate the map of europe ever again .
the fall of the berlin wall raised concerns in neighboring countries .
france 's francois mitterand was hesitant , britain 's margaret thatcher fully against reunification .
the man behind german reunification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1990 kohl repeatedly traveled to moscow to win gorbachev 's support but in the end it came down to convincing soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to agree to reunification - and helmut kohl did the trick .
less than one year after the iron curtain in berlin started to disintegrate , germany celebrated its reunification on october 3 , 1990 .
" after the events in 1989 , germany needed the trust and the confidence of the people around her that she would go all right into the future and not become the great behemoth again that she was once feared for , " political analyst thomas kielinger told deutsche welle .
" and in order to achieve that , kohl used that unique ability of his to be close to the people and to the main players , to get across his genuine belief that germany is here for the good and she will be deeply enmeshed in europe and there 's nothing to fear about her . "
helmut kohl seized the opportunity that history gave him .
but his ambitions went further than germany .
he saw his country as an integral element of a united europe .
with the 1992 maastricht treaty , he and francois mitterand mapped out the future of the eu and laid the groundwork for the euro , the bloc 's single currency .
bildunterschrift : soviet leader gorbachev , us president bush and germany 's kohl were the three heads of state behind german reunification .
in november 2009 they met again to celebrate 20 years of the fall of the wall the pull of power kohl 's other lifelong ambition was to gain power .
born in 1930 , he entered professional politics at the age of 29 in his home state of rhineland-palatinate .
kohl quickly rose through the ranks of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- until , in 1973 , he became the leader of the party - but that was n't enough .
" i want to be chancellor ; i want to win the elections and become chancellor , " he said , leaving no room for doubt about his ambitions .
he first stood in an election for chancellor in 1976 but lost against social democrat helmut schmidt . in 1982 the schmidt government collapsed after a failed vote of confidence and kohl stepped in .
he formed a new coalition with the liberal free democrats and became chancellor .
his policy was one of more freedom for the individual and less intervention by the state .
" we are convinced that the free initiative and achievements of the individual are better for everyone than state control , " he said .
" we trust people to take their future into their own hands . "
after initial success , however , kohl 's policies failed to deal with growing unemployment .
his popularity dropped and his chances of surviving the 80s in a position of power were considered slim .
" but then came the caesura : the collapse of the post-war world order and the fall of the wall , " said thomas kielinger .
" and helmut kohl went with glory , he seized the moment and pushed aside all the doubters - and there were many in germany who did n't quite think the country could cope with this moment and i think this is the view and the abiding image that people and historians have about him . "
slush funds and allegations of corruption it was thanks to the drive for reunification that kohl won the elections in 1990 .
but as much as he had worked for a united germany , he drastically underestimated the costs that would follow .
the financial burden seemed too much to deal with and unemployment continued to climb dramatically .
in 1998 kohl was defeated at the polls by social democrat gerhard schroeder , and also stepped down as the leader of the german conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's standing in germany suffered significantly after the slush funds scandal it was then that his star seemed to hit rock bottom .
kohl found himself embroiled in one of the worst slush fund scandals of post-war german politics .
it emerged that he had fed party coffers with over 2 million marks -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.3 million -rrb- in secret donations .
kohl refused to name any of the secret party donors , which threw the christian democrats into a state of severe crisis .
in the subsequent fallout kohl even had to resign from his post as honorary chairman of the party in 2000 .
it was angela merkel , the current german chancellor , a protege of kohl 's , who then took over at the helm of the cdu .
in 2001 kohl lost his wife hannelore who committed suicide after suffering for years from photodermatitis , a severe form of sensitivity to light .
kohl married maike richter in 2005 .
at the age of 80 he is no longer physically able to attend any elaborate birthday celebrations and will spend the day at home in private .
an official reception is scheduled for may 5 , with around 1,000 guests expected in his hometown of ludwigshafen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : oberammergau sets up the stage once-a-decade passion play starts in oberammergau this year 's oberammergau passion play casts jesus in new light bavarian village prepares itself for 500,000 theater fans in oberammergau , all the town 's a stage germany -pipe- 02.04.2010 oberammergau gears up for passion play season großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bavarian villagers perform a passion play every 10 years the oberammergau passion play emerged from a 17th century vow that if god spared villagers from the bubonic plague , they would reenact the passion every 10 years .
now the event rakes in millions of euros each decade . spring is in the air in the village of oberammergau in southern germany .
a few stores selling hand-carved figures of jesus christ and other souvenirs are open , trying to attract tourists with bavarian folk music .
it 's a charming scene – for now at least .
but come mid-may and the village will be inundated with visitors .
that 's when the village famously stages its passion play , the dramatic presentation of the passion of christ – the trial , suffering and death of christ .
it 's a tradition that traces its roots back to 1634 , when the residents of oberammergau vowed that if god spared their community from the bubonic plague ravaging the region at the time , they would perform a passion play every 10 years .
" we have about 5,000 residents here .
but we get that many visitors every day when the passion play is on , ” annie hutter from the local tourist office explained .
“ many of the guests often have to find accommodation in neighboring towns like murnau , or even on the other side of the austrian border , " hutter added , highlighting the popularity of the event .
the big draw is the cast of roughly 2,000 amateur actors – all born and bred in oberammergau – who will recreate the final five days in the life of jesus christ over a period of six hours .
they will perform the play more than 100 times before the finale on october 3 .
bildunterschrift : the passion play draws audiences from all over the world passion pays arno nunn is the mayor of oberammergau .
he 's not allowed to play a role in the play because he was not born in the village .
but he certainly shares the villagers ' excitement .
" on the one hand there 's the historic vow .
that 's something the community really cares about , ” nunn said .
“ but there 's no denying there are major commercial interests at work as well . "
" in 2000 , the passion play generated revenues of 25 million euros .
we hope this year 's play will do just as well , " he added .
the passion play is normally a sell-out event .
so most visitors book holiday packages that combine guaranteed tickets to the play with accommodation and meals .
prices range between 200 and 800 euros . but ticketing organizer werner hirrlinger says budget travellers may still be able to find a last-minute bargain this year .
" for decades oberammergau was fortunate that its performances of the passion play were booked out completely one year in advance , ” hirrlinger said .
“ but that 's not the case this year .
about five percent of tickets have been returned . "
" we 're still quite satisfied with the sale , although it 's clear we 're in a different situation compared to 10 years ago . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frederik mayet , who plays jesus , visited the us on a publicity tour as the fallout from the global economic crisis continues , overseas visitors are thinking twice about how they spend their hard-earned cash .
and it seems many american visitors – traditionally a major contingent at oberammergau – are staying away .
that 's despite a targeted and robust marketing campaign .
" the lead actors travelled to america for a publicity tour .
our jesus introduced himself to the media , " hutter pointed out .
" i think he was quite well received . "
downturn fallout but local businesses are finding that the passion play is not the perpetual money-spinner they once thought it was .
the economic downturn has been compounded by director christian stueckl 's decision to part with tradition and stage half the play in the evening .
stueckl said the darkness would create a better atmosphere for some of the scenes .
but the move has outraged restaurant owners .
that 's when visitors belong at the dinner table , they say , not the theatre .
bildunterschrift : hotels across the region fill up quickly during the tourist season still , frank seyfarth , manager of the village 's sonnenhof hotel in , says the biggest threat to the passion play business is not the start or finish time , but rather the times we live in .
" the generational change is difficult to measure , but a high percentage of youngsters nowadays do n't even know what the passion is , ” seyfarth said .
“ people in america are more familiar with it , but even there it 's changing .
a lot of young people just are n't interested . "
lessons from the past oberammergau has a reputation for living it up in the immediate years that follow a passion play .
recent decades have seen the community buy snow machines and build luxurious sporting facilities .
however , mayor arno nunn says the time has come for the village to tighten its belt and think carefully about expenditures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor nunn wants the village to be judicious in its use of this year 's profits " that 's the real challenge - the blessing and the curse of the passion ! ” he said .
" the extra income has enabled us to invest a lot in facilities for both residents and tourists , ” nunn added .
“ but these investments have to be maintained and that 's where we 've been pushing the envelope .
we 've accumulated a mountain of debt . ”
he says this year in particular the village must use revenues from the upcoming season to pay off some of its debt and create reserves for the future .
oberammergau will have to make them last until the end of this decade , when the next season of the famed passion play begins .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 02.04.2010 helmut kohl , chancellor of germany 's reunification , turns 80 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating german unity on october 3 , 1990 is what helmut kohl is ' most proud of ' helmut kohl is considered the architect of german reunification and a driving force behind european integration .
yet after 16 years in power his reputation was tainted by links to slush funds and party donations . there 's little doubt that helmut kohl will go down in history as the chancellor of german reunification .
on november 10 , 1989 - after the night the berlin wall fell , the then west german chancellor spoke from the balcony of the city hall - giving his vision of a future of european unity .
" this is about unity , about justice and freedom , " he said , quoting the opening line of the west german national anthem .
" long live a free german fatherland , long live a free and united europe . "
calling for a free and united germany was a provocation to many back then who did not want a large and powerful germany to dominate the map of europe ever again .
the fall of the berlin wall raised concerns in neighboring countries .
france 's francois mitterand was hesitant , britain 's margaret thatcher fully against reunification .
the man behind german reunification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1990 kohl repeatedly traveled to moscow to win gorbachev 's support but in the end it came down to convincing soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to agree to reunification - and helmut kohl did the trick .
less than one year after the iron curtain in berlin started to disintegrate , germany celebrated its reunification on october 3 , 1990 .
" after the events in 1989 , germany needed the trust and the confidence of the people around her that she would go all right into the future and not become the great behemoth again that she was once feared for , " political analyst thomas kielinger told deutsche welle .
" and in order to achieve that , kohl used that unique ability of his to be close to the people and to the main players , to get across his genuine belief that germany is here for the good and she will be deeply enmeshed in europe and there 's nothing to fear about her . "
helmut kohl seized the opportunity that history gave him .
but his ambitions went further than germany .
he saw his country as an integral element of a united europe .
with the 1992 maastricht treaty , he and francois mitterand mapped out the future of the eu and laid the groundwork for the euro , the bloc 's single currency .
bildunterschrift : soviet leader gorbachev , us president bush and germany 's kohl were the three heads of state behind german reunification .
in november 2009 they met again to celebrate 20 years of the fall of the wall the pull of power kohl 's other lifelong ambition was to gain power .
born in 1930 , he entered professional politics at the age of 29 in his home state of rhineland-palatinate .
kohl quickly rose through the ranks of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- until , in 1973 , he became the leader of the party - but that was n't enough .
" i want to be chancellor ; i want to win the elections and become chancellor , " he said , leaving no room for doubt about his ambitions .
he first stood in an election for chancellor in 1976 but lost against social democrat helmut schmidt . in 1982 the schmidt government collapsed after a failed vote of confidence and kohl stepped in .
he formed a new coalition with the liberal free democrats and became chancellor .
his policy was one of more freedom for the individual and less intervention by the state .
" we are convinced that the free initiative and achievements of the individual are better for everyone than state control , " he said .
" we trust people to take their future into their own hands . "
after initial success , however , kohl 's policies failed to deal with growing unemployment .
his popularity dropped and his chances of surviving the 80s in a position of power were considered slim .
" but then came the caesura : the collapse of the post-war world order and the fall of the wall , " said thomas kielinger .
" and helmut kohl went with glory , he seized the moment and pushed aside all the doubters - and there were many in germany who did n't quite think the country could cope with this moment and i think this is the view and the abiding image that people and historians have about him . "
slush funds and allegations of corruption it was thanks to the drive for reunification that kohl won the elections in 1990 .
but as much as he had worked for a united germany , he drastically underestimated the costs that would follow .
the financial burden seemed too much to deal with and unemployment continued to climb dramatically .
in 1998 kohl was defeated at the polls by social democrat gerhard schroeder , and also stepped down as the leader of the german conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's standing in germany suffered significantly after the slush funds scandal it was then that his star seemed to hit rock bottom .
kohl found himself embroiled in one of the worst slush fund scandals of post-war german politics .
it emerged that he had fed party coffers with over 2 million marks -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.3 million -rrb- in secret donations .
kohl refused to name any of the secret party donors , which threw the christian democrats into a state of severe crisis .
in the subsequent fallout kohl even had to resign from his post as honorary chairman of the party in 2000 .
it was angela merkel , the current german chancellor , a protege of kohl 's , who then took over at the helm of the cdu .
in 2001 kohl lost his wife hannelore who committed suicide after suffering for years from photodermatitis , a severe form of sensitivity to light .
kohl married maike richter in 2005 .
at the age of 80 he is no longer physically able to attend any elaborate birthday celebrations and will spend the day at home in private .
an official reception is scheduled for may 5 , with around 1,000 guests expected in his hometown of ludwigshafen .

it says diabetes is " one of the world ’ s most important causes of expenditure , mortality , disability and lost economic growth " . many experts say it will be one of the most serious pandemics of the 21st century .
professor rüdiger landgraf of germany 's diabetes foundation says asian countries will bear the brunt .
" it is increasing rapidly and is expected to rise by up to 60 percent within the next 20 years . " 10 percent of asian americans have type ii diabetes the most frequent kind of diabetes is type ii , which used to be associated mainly with old age , but is affecting more and more young people . " about 10 percent of asian americans are affected by type ii diabetes , " explains qing li , a research scientist at the stanford university school of medicine .
" that is a very big number .
they have high diabetes rates compared with caucasians , suggesting a strong role of genetics in the development of diabetes .
the complex interaction between genetics and the lifestyle leads to the increase of diabetes in asian people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if we exercised more , we would eat less and be less at risk of developing disease , say experts this is also the case in asia itself , where " in recent years the chinese economy has developed very fast and people can have more western-style food like mcdonalds , kentucky fried chicken etc , " says qing li . " they have adapted to western-style food , " landgraf agrees .
" they have adopted western eating and drinking habits .
coca cola is considered a national drink by many in the usa and now in the rest of the world too .
people tend to like things that are sweet . " he says high-sugar beverages and other extremely calorie-dense foods play a large role .
the intake of too many calories over time warps the body ’ s production and use of insulin – one of the reasons the risk of getting type ii increases with age . lack of exercise increases risk of diabetes but there is another major factor , says landgraf , and this is that people are getting a lot less exercise .
" they are using cars more and more , which means that they are moving around a lot less while their calorie intake is staying the same or is even higher than before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obesity is increasing across asia " these are the best conditions – especially if there is a genetic factor – for developing some kind of metabolic malfunction and eventually diabetes .
if we were to get more exercise , then we would probably eat less .
eating has a lot to do with frustration , boredom , loneliness and other things .
it is n't that we are hungry , but that we are looking for a replacement for other things that are missing in society today . " the new study also warns that there is an even higher number of pre-diabetics than diabetics .
moreover , the un has found that in some countries up to 90 percent of people with diabetes do not receive treatment . author : sarah berning editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" and due to our geographical conditions , mongolia is one of the countries which are very strongly impacted by the global climate change . " " this can be illustrated by one figure : the global average temperature rise has been of 0.74 degrees centigrade , whereas in mongolia temperatures have risen by 2.1 degrees in the past 70 years , three times the global average .
this causes serious problems such as water shortage , the drying up of rivers and springs , as well as drought and increasing desertification , which also leads to biodiversity loss .

we will not tolerate that anymore .
we have a new law that does not allow small-scale gold mining which damages the environment .

across germany , the abuse scandal is shaping good friday services . the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , archbishop of freiburg robert zollitsch , released a statement on good friday acknowledging the failure of the catholic church to satisfactorily handle the sex abuse scandal . zollitsch admitted that , in the past , the church had done too little to help abuse victims , and said the church 's response was a reflection of contemporary social mores .
" today , it is clear to us : previously the social situation was different , and we allowed ourselves to be overcome - by disappointment over the painful failure of the perpetrators and mistaken concern over the reputation of the church , " said zollitsch in a written statement that his diocese released on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abuse scandal is dominating easter services " not enough help was given to the victims , " he added as he spoke of " wounds that may never be healed .

bishops across austria and switzerland appealed to parishioners to come forward with their allegations and schoenborn thanked in particular the victims who had broken their silence .
" we confess our guilt to the many whom we have wronged as a church , and whom some of us have wronged very directly , " said schoenborn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have rejected schoenborn 's apologies however , church critics in austria have dismissed schoenborn 's apology as " insufficient . "

it admitted using cash and gifts to secure global contracts . lawyers representing the giant german car manufacturer , daimler , and three of its subsidiaries , appeared before a us judge in washington dc thursday and agreed to pay fines totalling some 136 million euros -lrb- $ 185 million -rrb- to settle bribery charges .
the us justice department and the securities and exchange commission had accused the makers of the famous mercedes-benz car range of systematically using large cash payments and extravagent gifts to secure lucrative contracts around the globe .
daimler 's german and russian units each agreed to plead guilty to two counts of violating us anti-bribery laws .
charges relate to 22 different countries the car giant and biggest manufacturer of trucks worldwide was accused of giving some 41 million euros in bribes related to more than 200 transactions in 22 countries between 1998 and 2008 .
the deals earned the company 1.4 billion euros in revenue and at least 69 billion euros in allegedly illegal profits .

the us court deal came after positive reports from prosecutors that daimler and two of its russian subsidiaries had fully cooperated with the investigation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 02.04.2010 diabetes has reached pandemic proportions in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western-style fast food is gaining popularity in china according to a recent study published in the new england journal of medicine , china has the largest number of diabetics worldwide , with over 92 million people , nearly 10 percent of adults , affected . the study , carried out by the " china national diabetes and metabolic disorders study group , " is a fresh wake-up call and a reminder that what was once considered a " western disease " now knows no borders . a 2006 un resolution on diabetes states that around 6 percent of the world ’ s adult population has the disease .
it says diabetes is " one of the world ’ s most important causes of expenditure , mortality , disability and lost economic growth " . many experts say it will be one of the most serious pandemics of the 21st century .
professor rüdiger landgraf of germany 's diabetes foundation says asian countries will bear the brunt .
" it is increasing rapidly and is expected to rise by up to 60 percent within the next 20 years . " 10 percent of asian americans have type ii diabetes the most frequent kind of diabetes is type ii , which used to be associated mainly with old age , but is affecting more and more young people . " about 10 percent of asian americans are affected by type ii diabetes , " explains qing li , a research scientist at the stanford university school of medicine .
" that is a very big number .
they have high diabetes rates compared with caucasians , suggesting a strong role of genetics in the development of diabetes .
the complex interaction between genetics and the lifestyle leads to the increase of diabetes in asian people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if we exercised more , we would eat less and be less at risk of developing disease , say experts this is also the case in asia itself , where " in recent years the chinese economy has developed very fast and people can have more western-style food like mcdonalds , kentucky fried chicken etc , " says qing li . " they have adapted to western-style food , " landgraf agrees .
" they have adopted western eating and drinking habits .
coca cola is considered a national drink by many in the usa and now in the rest of the world too .
people tend to like things that are sweet . " he says high-sugar beverages and other extremely calorie-dense foods play a large role .
the intake of too many calories over time warps the body ’ s production and use of insulin – one of the reasons the risk of getting type ii increases with age . lack of exercise increases risk of diabetes but there is another major factor , says landgraf , and this is that people are getting a lot less exercise .
" they are using cars more and more , which means that they are moving around a lot less while their calorie intake is staying the same or is even higher than before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obesity is increasing across asia " these are the best conditions – especially if there is a genetic factor – for developing some kind of metabolic malfunction and eventually diabetes .
if we were to get more exercise , then we would probably eat less .
eating has a lot to do with frustration , boredom , loneliness and other things .
it is n't that we are hungry , but that we are looking for a replacement for other things that are missing in society today . " the new study also warns that there is an even higher number of pre-diabetics than diabetics .
moreover , the un has found that in some countries up to 90 percent of people with diabetes do not receive treatment . author : sarah berning editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet after 16 years in power his reputation was tainted by links to slush funds and party donations . there 's little doubt that helmut kohl will go down in history as the chancellor of german reunification .
on november 10 , 1989 - after the night the berlin wall fell , the then west german chancellor spoke from the balcony of the city hall - giving his vision of a future of european unity .
" this is about unity , about justice and freedom , " he said , quoting the opening line of the west german national anthem .
" long live a free german fatherland , long live a free and united europe . "
calling for a free and united germany was a provocation to many back then who did not want a large and powerful germany to dominate the map of europe ever again .
the fall of the berlin wall raised concerns in neighboring countries .
france 's francois mitterand was hesitant , britain 's margaret thatcher fully against reunification .
the man behind german reunification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1990 kohl repeatedly traveled to moscow to win gorbachev 's support but in the end it came down to convincing soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to agree to reunification - and helmut kohl did the trick .
less than one year after the iron curtain in berlin started to disintegrate , germany celebrated its reunification on october 3 , 1990 .
" after the events in 1989 , germany needed the trust and the confidence of the people around her that she would go all right into the future and not become the great behemoth again that she was once feared for , " political analyst thomas kielinger told deutsche welle .
" and in order to achieve that , kohl used that unique ability of his to be close to the people and to the main players , to get across his genuine belief that germany is here for the good and she will be deeply enmeshed in europe and there 's nothing to fear about her . "
helmut kohl seized the opportunity that history gave him .
but his ambitions went further than germany .
he saw his country as an integral element of a united europe .
with the 1992 maastricht treaty , he and francois mitterand mapped out the future of the eu and laid the groundwork for the euro , the bloc 's single currency .
bildunterschrift : soviet leader gorbachev , us president bush and germany 's kohl were the three heads of state behind german reunification .
in november 2009 they met again to celebrate 20 years of the fall of the wall the pull of power kohl 's other lifelong ambition was to gain power .
born in 1930 , he entered professional politics at the age of 29 in his home state of rhineland-palatinate .
kohl quickly rose through the ranks of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- until , in 1973 , he became the leader of the party - but that was n't enough .
" i want to be chancellor ; i want to win the elections and become chancellor , " he said , leaving no room for doubt about his ambitions .
he first stood in an election for chancellor in 1976 but lost against social democrat helmut schmidt . in 1982 the schmidt government collapsed after a failed vote of confidence and kohl stepped in .
he formed a new coalition with the liberal free democrats and became chancellor .
his policy was one of more freedom for the individual and less intervention by the state .
" we are convinced that the free initiative and achievements of the individual are better for everyone than state control , " he said .
" we trust people to take their future into their own hands . "
after initial success , however , kohl 's policies failed to deal with growing unemployment .
his popularity dropped and his chances of surviving the 80s in a position of power were considered slim .
" but then came the caesura : the collapse of the post-war world order and the fall of the wall , " said thomas kielinger .
" and helmut kohl went with glory , he seized the moment and pushed aside all the doubters - and there were many in germany who did n't quite think the country could cope with this moment and i think this is the view and the abiding image that people and historians have about him . "
slush funds and allegations of corruption it was thanks to the drive for reunification that kohl won the elections in 1990 .
but as much as he had worked for a united germany , he drastically underestimated the costs that would follow .
the financial burden seemed too much to deal with and unemployment continued to climb dramatically .
in 1998 kohl was defeated at the polls by social democrat gerhard schroeder , and also stepped down as the leader of the german conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's standing in germany suffered significantly after the slush funds scandal it was then that his star seemed to hit rock bottom .
kohl found himself embroiled in one of the worst slush fund scandals of post-war german politics .
it emerged that he had fed party coffers with over 2 million marks -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.3 million -rrb- in secret donations .
kohl refused to name any of the secret party donors , which threw the christian democrats into a state of severe crisis .
in the subsequent fallout kohl even had to resign from his post as honorary chairman of the party in 2000 .
it was angela merkel , the current german chancellor , a protege of kohl 's , who then took over at the helm of the cdu .
in 2001 kohl lost his wife hannelore who committed suicide after suffering for years from photodermatitis , a severe form of sensitivity to light .
kohl married maike richter in 2005 .
at the age of 80 he is no longer physically able to attend any elaborate birthday celebrations and will spend the day at home in private .
an official reception is scheduled for may 5 , with around 1,000 guests expected in his hometown of ludwigshafen .

in november 2009 they met again to celebrate 20 years of the fall of the wall the pull of power kohl 's other lifelong ambition was to gain power .
born in 1930 , he entered professional politics at the age of 29 in his home state of rhineland-palatinate .
kohl quickly rose through the ranks of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- until , in 1973 , he became the leader of the party - but that was n't enough .
" i want to be chancellor ; i want to win the elections and become chancellor , " he said , leaving no room for doubt about his ambitions .
he first stood in an election for chancellor in 1976 but lost against social democrat helmut schmidt . in 1982 the schmidt government collapsed after a failed vote of confidence and kohl stepped in .
he formed a new coalition with the liberal free democrats and became chancellor .
his policy was one of more freedom for the individual and less intervention by the state .
" we are convinced that the free initiative and achievements of the individual are better for everyone than state control , " he said .
" we trust people to take their future into their own hands . "
after initial success , however , kohl 's policies failed to deal with growing unemployment .
his popularity dropped and his chances of surviving the 80s in a position of power were considered slim .
" but then came the caesura : the collapse of the post-war world order and the fall of the wall , " said thomas kielinger .
" and helmut kohl went with glory , he seized the moment and pushed aside all the doubters - and there were many in germany who did n't quite think the country could cope with this moment and i think this is the view and the abiding image that people and historians have about him . "

but as much as he had worked for a united germany , he drastically underestimated the costs that would follow .
the financial burden seemed too much to deal with and unemployment continued to climb dramatically .
in 1998 kohl was defeated at the polls by social democrat gerhard schroeder , and also stepped down as the leader of the german conservatives .

kohl found himself embroiled in one of the worst slush fund scandals of post-war german politics .
it emerged that he had fed party coffers with over 2 million marks -lrb- 1 million euros , $ 1.3 million -rrb- in secret donations .
kohl refused to name any of the secret party donors , which threw the christian democrats into a state of severe crisis .
in the subsequent fallout kohl even had to resign from his post as honorary chairman of the party in 2000 .
it was angela merkel , the current german chancellor , a protege of kohl 's , who then took over at the helm of the cdu .
in 2001 kohl lost his wife hannelore who committed suicide after suffering for years from photodermatitis , a severe form of sensitivity to light .
kohl married maike richter in 2005 .
at the age of 80 he is no longer physically able to attend any elaborate birthday celebrations and will spend the day at home in private .
an official reception is scheduled for may 5 , with around 1,000 guests expected in his hometown of ludwigshafen .

yet after 16 years in power his reputation was tainted by links to slush funds and party donations . there 's little doubt that helmut kohl will go down in history as the chancellor of german reunification .
on november 10 , 1989 - after the night the berlin wall fell , the then west german chancellor spoke from the balcony of the city hall - giving his vision of a future of european unity .
" this is about unity , about justice and freedom , " he said , quoting the opening line of the west german national anthem .
" long live a free german fatherland , long live a free and united europe . "
calling for a free and united germany was a provocation to many back then who did not want a large and powerful germany to dominate the map of europe ever again .

across germany , the abuse scandal is shaping good friday services . the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , archbishop of freiburg robert zollitsch , released a statement on good friday acknowledging the failure of the catholic church to satisfactorily handle the sex abuse scandal . zollitsch admitted that , in the past , the church had done too little to help abuse victims , and said the church 's response was a reflection of contemporary social mores .
" today , it is clear to us : previously the social situation was different , and we allowed ourselves to be overcome - by disappointment over the painful failure of the perpetrators and mistaken concern over the reputation of the church , " said zollitsch in a written statement that his diocese released on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the abuse scandal is dominating easter services " not enough help was given to the victims , " he added as he spoke of " wounds that may never be healed . "
scandal shapes good friday however , good friday could provide a new beginning for the church , said zollitsch .
many catholic dioceses are addressing the sex abuse scandal during easter services , with a prayer for the victims written by the bishop of trier , stephen ackermann .
in his own good friday sermon , ackermann addressed the psychological wounds of sexual abuse victims , referring to the healing of the wounds of jesus . search for forgiveness across europe earlier in the week , the archbishop of vienna , christoph schoenborn , expressed the church 's guilt in the scandal , incurred during years of silence and cover-ups .
bishops across austria and switzerland appealed to parishioners to come forward with their allegations and schoenborn thanked in particular the victims who had broken their silence .
" we confess our guilt to the many whom we have wronged as a church , and whom some of us have wronged very directly , " said schoenborn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have rejected schoenborn 's apologies however , church critics in austria have dismissed schoenborn 's apology as " insufficient . "
the activist platform , betroffene kirchlicher gewalt , or " victims of church violence , " said it would not accept " mere apologies and prayers for humility . "
in a separate display of solidarity with the victims of church abuse , the artist emmerich weissenberger crucified himself on the facade of vienna 's st. stephan 's cathedral on friday .
the artist was symbolically wearing a loin cloth and a crown of thorns - in this case barbed wire - while fastened to the church at a height of 20 meters .
meanwhile , the head of the catholic church , german-born pope benedict xvi has so far avoided addressing the growing criticism of the widespread abuse scandal .
a vatican spokesman had previously told the ap news agency that the pope viewed the crisis as a " test for both him and the church .
