an anarchist group has claimed responsibility . a group of italian anarchists claimed responsibility on thursday for two parcel bomb explosions at foreign embassies in rome , according to italian media reports .
two people were injured by two separate package bombs that exploded at the swiss and chilean embassies in rome earlier on thursday , prompting police to conduct checks at all the embassies in the italian capital .
the first incident occurred around midday at the swiss embassy , when a bomb exploded in the mailroom as an employee opened it .
reports said the 53-year-old man was taken to a hospital in central rome and risks the amputation of one or both of his hands , but that his life was not in danger .
three hours later an employee at the chilean embassy was lightly injured after opening the second package bomb .
anarchists claim responsibility the ansa news agency reported that a group calling itself the informal federation of anarchy -lrb- fai -rrb- had written a note claiming the blasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police were checking embassies across rome after the explosions " we have decided to make our voice heard with words and deeds .
let us destroy the system of domination .
long live the fai , " said the statement , found near the site of one of the bombings .
the fai is well known to italian authorities .
in 2010 , intelligence services referred to the group in a statement to parliament as italy 's " main national terrorist threat of an anarchist-insurrectionist type . "
police sweep rome 's embassies ansa reported thursday that police conducted sweeps at all the embassies in rome .
a suspicious package at the ukrainian embassy was first thought to be another bomb , but police later said it was a false alarm .
thursday 's bombs followed the discovery of a crude device designed like an explosive on an empty subway car in rome on tuesday . tests later showed that the device had no detonator and contained no explosives .
chilean foreign minister alfredo moreno condemned the blast in the chilean embassy , calling it " an act of terrorism " and " cowardly . "
he added that the bomb had been adressed to a cultural association , where it severely injured the hands , face and abdomen of cesar mella , a chilean citizen .
suspected connection to greece italy 's interior minister roberto maroni said on a television talk show that he thought a suspected connection to similar bombings in greece last month was the " right track . "
" greece , italy and spain have seen the presence of anarcho-insurrectionalist groups that are tightly linked , " he said .
" they are very violent . "
last month 14 package bombs were discovered at various embassies across athens and in transit to places abroad , including one sent to the chancellery in berlin .
the package , which arrived on a day when chancellor angela merkel was not in berlin , was identified as being suspicious during a routine check at the chancellery 's mail center .
the bomb did not go off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of 14 parcel bombs discovered last month was sent to the german chancellory greek police believed the attacks were connected to a left-wing militant organization , and arrested six people on suspicion of being connected to the group .
a greek police official said he had not yet received any request for help from italian police .
no likely connection to jihadist groups analysts said while the parcel bombings in greece and italy may have been similar , there were not necessarily any direct connections .
" given the similarities with the recent parcel bombs in greece following anti-austerity protests , this could be a copycat incident by domestic activists , " said samantha wolreich , a european risk analyst at the uk-based advisory firm ake .

chilean foreign minister alfredo moreno condemned the blast in the chilean embassy , calling it " an act of terrorism " and " cowardly . "
he added that the bomb had been adressed to a cultural association , where it severely injured the hands , face and abdomen of cesar mella , a chilean citizen .
suspected connection to greece italy 's interior minister roberto maroni said on a television talk show that he thought a suspected connection to similar bombings in greece last month was the " right track . "
" greece , italy and spain have seen the presence of anarcho-insurrectionalist groups that are tightly linked , " he said .
" they are very violent . "
last month 14 package bombs were discovered at various embassies across athens and in transit to places abroad , including one sent to the chancellery in berlin .
the package , which arrived on a day when chancellor angela merkel was not in berlin , was identified as being suspicious during a routine check at the chancellery 's mail center .
the bomb did not go off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of 14 parcel bombs discovered last month was sent to the german chancellory greek police believed the attacks were connected to a left-wing militant organization , and arrested six people on suspicion of being connected to the group .
a greek police official said he had not yet received any request for help from italian police .
no likely connection to jihadist groups analysts said while the parcel bombings in greece and italy may have been similar , there were not necessarily any direct connections .
" given the similarities with the recent parcel bombs in greece following anti-austerity protests , this could be a copycat incident by domestic activists , " said samantha wolreich , a european risk analyst at the uk-based advisory firm ake .

once taboo , the practice may now attract an eco-friendly clientele , saving the industry from tough chinese competition . for decades , the small industrial city of prato in tuscany has produced some of the finest wool textiles in the world - all the while hiding a dirty secret .
but now , hard hit by low-cost textiles produced in china , prato has dug the skeleton out of its closet and turned it into a powerful marketing weapon .
" the production of the reprocessed wool comes from scraps that come from the manufacturing of garments , " romeo balli explained to deutsche welle .
nowadays , with attention focused on eco-friendly manufacturing practices , this process is garnering attention for balli 's fabrics .
saving scraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recycling wool scraps conserves resources balli 's factory has carried the family name since it was founded by his grandfather in 1946 .
it was once part of a thriving textile industry in prato that produced high quality wool fabric .
back then , as today , most of the textiles were made from left-over wool scraps .
according to balli , this does n't mean a drop in quality , but does make manufacturing less expensive .
" we can find nice quality , divide it by color , quality , and it 's much easier and cheaper , " he said .
not only is the process cheaper , it 's also more environmentally friendly .
prato 's chamber of commerce is now trying to capitalize on this fact to give its industry a boost .
according to carlo longo , who heads the chamber of commerce , it 's ironic the recycled wool is now a selling point , given how for decades prato industries hid the fact .
" nobody was admitting that -lsb- we recycled scraps -rsb- .
we were trying to do it , but hiding it , " he said .
" now it 's become a reason to be proud , because we 're not depleting the world 's resources , so it 's a good thing . "
old product , new brand longo is part of an initiative geared toward reducing the carbon footprint of textile production , which certifies companies that use regenerated or recycled raw materials .
prato 's chamber of commerce has dubbed the regenerated wool " cardato , " hoping consumers will seek out the eco-friendly product .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wool manufacturers face steep competition from china " we have branded it and are launching it again , " longo said .
" there 's now a lot of attention to these kinds of products . "
it 's also economically advantageous .
with cheaply produced wool fabrics being exported from china , prato 's five billion-euro -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- export industry has lost half its business in the last decade .
textile producers like romeo balli say the reprocessed wool not only gives prato an eco-friendly advantage , but also provides cheaper and more stable prices .
according to balli , the difference in price between virgin and reprocessed wool can be between 30 and 40 percent .
those savings could ensure the survival of prato 's textile industry , especially at a time when balli believes chinese producers are stockpiling virgin wool - causing prices to shoot up around the world .

" the production of the reprocessed wool comes from scraps that come from the manufacturing of garments , " romeo balli explained to deutsche welle .
nowadays , with attention focused on eco-friendly manufacturing practices , this process is garnering attention for balli 's fabrics .
saving scraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recycling wool scraps conserves resources balli 's factory has carried the family name since it was founded by his grandfather in 1946 .
it was once part of a thriving textile industry in prato that produced high quality wool fabric .
back then , as today , most of the textiles were made from left-over wool scraps .
according to balli , this does n't mean a drop in quality , but does make manufacturing less expensive .
" we can find nice quality , divide it by color , quality , and it 's much easier and cheaper , " he said .
not only is the process cheaper , it 's also more environmentally friendly .
prato 's chamber of commerce is now trying to capitalize on this fact to give its industry a boost .
according to carlo longo , who heads the chamber of commerce , it 's ironic the recycled wool is now a selling point , given how for decades prato industries hid the fact .
" nobody was admitting that -lsb- we recycled scraps -rsb- .
we were trying to do it , but hiding it , " he said .
" now it 's become a reason to be proud , because we 're not depleting the world 's resources , so it 's a good thing . "
old product , new brand longo is part of an initiative geared toward reducing the carbon footprint of textile production , which certifies companies that use regenerated or recycled raw materials .
prato 's chamber of commerce has dubbed the regenerated wool " cardato , " hoping consumers will seek out the eco-friendly product .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wool manufacturers face steep competition from china " we have branded it and are launching it again , " longo said .
" there 's now a lot of attention to these kinds of products . "
it 's also economically advantageous .
with cheaply produced wool fabrics being exported from china , prato 's five billion-euro -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- export industry has lost half its business in the last decade .
textile producers like romeo balli say the reprocessed wool not only gives prato an eco-friendly advantage , but also provides cheaper and more stable prices .
according to balli , the difference in price between virgin and reprocessed wool can be between 30 and 40 percent .
those savings could ensure the survival of prato 's textile industry , especially at a time when balli believes chinese producers are stockpiling virgin wool - causing prices to shoot up around the world .

" solidarity , understanding and getting along with one another : we need this in our families , in our private lives and in society , " wulff said .
" this won ’ t happen on its own , we need to work at it . "
the president noted that christmas is a time when everyone seeks to spend time with those who are near and dear to them , while at the same time focusing on helping the less fortunate .
around 190 guests were present for the recording of the speech at bellevue palace , the official residence of the president , among them , schoolchildren , scouts , and police officers .
the president singled out those who do voluntary work - in its many forms - for particular praise .
while the state can help those in need through financial support , he said , it ca n't provide the necessary human touch .
" encouragement , a pat on the shoulder and reaching out a helping hand is important for humanity and needs people to do it , " he said .
" and by the way , people engaged in voluntary work in society live longer . " mutual respect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 years on , the desire for peace remains wulff also reaffirmed his commitment to germany ’ s multicultural society , describing germany as " free and diverse .

she says that political instability has made aid work in nepal more difficult . for almost two decades german ngo shanti nepal has been helping leprosy patients in nepal , one of the most ostracized and marginalized groups in society .
today , it 's one of the biggest private aid organizations in the caring for more than 1,000 people .
shanti runs a hospital , a kindergarten , a school , a poor people 's kitchen , as well as numerous textile , metal and paper workshops employing people with physical impediments .
while being able to work increases leprosy patients ' self-esteem , the sale of their handicrafts also helps fund the organization that otherwise relies on donations .
yet the current political problems in nepal , as well as a price hike for fuel and food in the past few months , is making aid work increasingly difficult . dw : what 's the situation like for an organization like shanti in nepal at the moment ?
would you say your work has become more difficult than ever ?
yes , because people are more desperate .
i think the general mood is that there is more hopelessness .
there was this idea that maybe things will change in the future , but it does n't look like it , because there is no stable political situation .
the price hike makes people very worried so there is a feeling of despair which makes it rather difficult to inspire people .
and yet , this is what i want to do !
dw : and how exactly do you deal with these challenges ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanti relies on its home-grown vegetables to feed the hungry i look at it with this idea ‘ how can i solve the problem ? ' . we used to have quite a big plot of land which was given to us by the temple authorities but then owners found out that they were entitled to this land .
so all of a sudden they said , ' no , you may not use this land for your agriculture anymore ' , and we needed it desperately for our poor people 's kitchen because we grew the vegetables there .
so rather than giving up , i decided we have a very big roof on which we can build a hot-house , and so we use this roof now to grow vegetables right on our own plot of land .
dw : how many people do you feed everyday ?
around 1,000 .
so we need lots and lots of vegetables because we do n't have the money to buy meat .
dw : how did you come to work with leprosy patients in nepal ?
leprosy , to my mind , is one of those terrible diseases where people are not only sick but they are also ostracized and i feel their soul is battered as much as their physical being .
also , my adopted son 's parents were suffering from leprosy so we decided this would be the target group .
but it has expanded and we of course take in anybody who is handicapped .
dw : shanti has a unique concept .
you 're not just feeding people or giving them a place to stay , you also want to restore their dignity .
how do you do that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : products by handicapped shanti craftsmen help fund shanti the secret is , i think , that everybody is creative and of course , when you suffer from leprosy , and you have no fingers and you have no toes , this restriction will give you the idea ' i ca n't do anything at all ' .
to discover what this particular person can do despite the handicap and to see the joy in the patient 's eyes that he himself decided ' i 'll do it with those colour combinations and it looks real neat ' , this gives them the feeling they are somebody and they can develop into something even better than what they were able to do before .
dw : the products of these creative workshops is sold to support the organization .
where are they sold ?
we send a lot of the products to germany to the different bazaars at schools and markets , and we also try to sell them in nepal .
yesterday we had a bazaar at a hotel in kathmandu .
we make for instance soft dolls , christmas decorations , we also produce wrapping paper , carpentry products , and dhaka weaving , which is a special traditional pattern .
dw : a lot of ingenuity went into the design of the new shanti complex , which is still under construction .
for example , you are installing an elevator designed specifically for shanti patients in the new hospital .
can you tell us about it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving a sense of joy to young people is an important part of the shanti projects the problem with nepal is that we presently have about 16 hours of power cuts each day .
on the other hand we desperately need an elevator because we have very heavy wheelchairs .
so young engineers from the university of fontys in venlo , in the netherlands , have created a lift that we can use manually .
the engineers have plans to come to nepal in spring and install it themselves .
we are all looking forward to this because it would give our patients who are on the third floor for instance the chance to have a more normal life again .
dw : the conditions you work under are challenging , so what keeps you going ?
gratitude .
gratitude for my own good health .
gratitude that i enjoy beauty which i would like to share .
and my incredible joy to meet people , especially children , and to give those children a chance .
maybe this is my own joy of life which i want to share .

she says that political instability has made aid work in nepal more difficult . for almost two decades german ngo shanti nepal has been helping leprosy patients in nepal , one of the most ostracized and marginalized groups in society .
today , it 's one of the biggest private aid organizations in the caring for more than 1,000 people .
shanti runs a hospital , a kindergarten , a school , a poor people 's kitchen , as well as numerous textile , metal and paper workshops employing people with physical impediments .
while being able to work increases leprosy patients ' self-esteem , the sale of their handicrafts also helps fund the organization that otherwise relies on donations .
yet the current political problems in nepal , as well as a price hike for fuel and food in the past few months , is making aid work increasingly difficult . dw : what 's the situation like for an organization like shanti in nepal at the moment ?
would you say your work has become more difficult than ever ?
yes , because people are more desperate .
i think the general mood is that there is more hopelessness .
there was this idea that maybe things will change in the future , but it does n't look like it , because there is no stable political situation .
the price hike makes people very worried so there is a feeling of despair which makes it rather difficult to inspire people .
and yet , this is what i want to do !
dw : and how exactly do you deal with these challenges ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanti relies on its home-grown vegetables to feed the hungry i look at it with this idea ‘ how can i solve the problem ? ' . we used to have quite a big plot of land which was given to us by the temple authorities but then owners found out that they were entitled to this land .
so all of a sudden they said , ' no , you may not use this land for your agriculture anymore ' , and we needed it desperately for our poor people 's kitchen because we grew the vegetables there .
so rather than giving up , i decided we have a very big roof on which we can build a hot-house , and so we use this roof now to grow vegetables right on our own plot of land .
dw : how many people do you feed everyday ?
around 1,000 .
so we need lots and lots of vegetables because we do n't have the money to buy meat .
dw : how did you come to work with leprosy patients in nepal ?
leprosy , to my mind , is one of those terrible diseases where people are not only sick but they are also ostracized and i feel their soul is battered as much as their physical being .
also , my adopted son 's parents were suffering from leprosy so we decided this would be the target group .
but it has expanded and we of course take in anybody who is handicapped .
dw : shanti has a unique concept .
you 're not just feeding people or giving them a place to stay , you also want to restore their dignity .
how do you do that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : products by handicapped shanti craftsmen help fund shanti the secret is , i think , that everybody is creative and of course , when you suffer from leprosy , and you have no fingers and you have no toes , this restriction will give you the idea ' i ca n't do anything at all ' .
to discover what this particular person can do despite the handicap and to see the joy in the patient 's eyes that he himself decided ' i 'll do it with those colour combinations and it looks real neat ' , this gives them the feeling they are somebody and they can develop into something even better than what they were able to do before .
dw : the products of these creative workshops is sold to support the organization .
where are they sold ?
we send a lot of the products to germany to the different bazaars at schools and markets , and we also try to sell them in nepal .
yesterday we had a bazaar at a hotel in kathmandu .
we make for instance soft dolls , christmas decorations , we also produce wrapping paper , carpentry products , and dhaka weaving , which is a special traditional pattern .
dw : a lot of ingenuity went into the design of the new shanti complex , which is still under construction .
for example , you are installing an elevator designed specifically for shanti patients in the new hospital .
can you tell us about it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving a sense of joy to young people is an important part of the shanti projects the problem with nepal is that we presently have about 16 hours of power cuts each day .
on the other hand we desperately need an elevator because we have very heavy wheelchairs .
so young engineers from the university of fontys in venlo , in the netherlands , have created a lift that we can use manually .
the engineers have plans to come to nepal in spring and install it themselves .
we are all looking forward to this because it would give our patients who are on the third floor for instance the chance to have a more normal life again .
dw : the conditions you work under are challenging , so what keeps you going ?

full ratification is not expected until mid-january after the body 's winter recess . russia 's lower house of parliament voted overwhelmingly to move forward a historic nuclear arms pact with the united states on friday , shortly before going on winter holiday .
the duma voted 350-58 in favor of the new strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- , which was passed by the us senate on wednesday after a lengthy political battle .
the treaty was expected to face far less of a fight in russia 's parliament , which is dominated by president dmitry medvedev 's united russia party .
medvedev and foreign minister sergei lavrov told lawmakers before the vote that the treaty would not undermine russian security , but that it " will bring russian-american relations to a qualitatively new level … and is welcomed by the entire global community . "
a rejection " would deal a serious blow to the reputation of russia . "
the agreement would slash the two sides ' nuclear arsenals to 1,550 deployed warheads per side .
the white house announced on thursday that medvedev had called us president barack obama to congratulate him on the treaty 's passing in the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidents obama and medvedev signed the start treaty back in april medvedev also said in an end-of-year interview on russian television that obama " fulfills his promises " and that he managed to secure the senate 's approval " in rather difficult circumstances . "
delay until january head lawmakers also hailed the agreement as a signal that relations between the former cold war enemies were headed in the right direction .
" there are times when our interests do not contradict each other , " said the upper chamber 's foreign affairs committee chairman mikhail margelov .
" this is precisely one of those times . "
the duma is expected to attach its own non-binding amendments to the pact , as the us senate did earlier this week to allay republican concerns with the agreement .
it expects to complete a second and final third reading after returning from recess on january 11 .
an approval by the upper chamber , the federation council , is also necessary for ratification .

dw-world.de ' the president just would n't accept no for an answer ' only days ago the signs were ominous that the us senate would reject the start arms reduction treaty , but as thomas e. mann tells dw , president barack obama stuck to his guns and has come away with an important victory .

full ratification is not expected until mid-january after the body 's winter recess . russia 's lower house of parliament voted overwhelmingly to move forward a historic nuclear arms pact with the united states on friday , shortly before going on winter holiday .
the duma voted 350-58 in favor of the new strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- , which was passed by the us senate on wednesday after a lengthy political battle .
the treaty was expected to face far less of a fight in russia 's parliament , which is dominated by president dmitry medvedev 's united russia party .
medvedev and foreign minister sergei lavrov told lawmakers before the vote that the treaty would not undermine russian security , but that it " will bring russian-american relations to a qualitatively new level … and is welcomed by the entire global community . "
a rejection " would deal a serious blow to the reputation of russia . "
the agreement would slash the two sides ' nuclear arsenals to 1,550 deployed warheads per side .
the white house announced on thursday that medvedev had called us president barack obama to congratulate him on the treaty 's passing in the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidents obama and medvedev signed the start treaty back in april medvedev also said in an end-of-year interview on russian television that obama " fulfills his promises " and that he managed to secure the senate 's approval " in rather difficult circumstances . "
delay until january head lawmakers also hailed the agreement as a signal that relations between the former cold war enemies were headed in the right direction .
" there are times when our interests do not contradict each other , " said the upper chamber 's foreign affairs committee chairman mikhail margelov .
" this is precisely one of those times . "
the duma is expected to attach its own non-binding amendments to the pact , as the us senate did earlier this week to allay republican concerns with the agreement .
it expects to complete a second and final third reading after returning from recess on january 11 .
an approval by the upper chamber , the federation council , is also necessary for ratification .

sales figures for the title into the holiday season show no signs of slowing down . thilo sarrazin 's contentious book with grim predictions for the future of germany is number one on the year 's non-fiction bestseller list , according to records published by der spiegel .
since the release of " germany is doing away with itself " in late august , author sarrazin has made headlines for claiming that the combination of germany 's low birth-rate and immigration and social welfare policies are leading the country toward " a nightmare . "
with chapter titles like " immigration and integration - expect more , offer less " and " demographics and population politics - more children from the intelligent before it 's too late , " the book was sure to spark conflict .
chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly condemned sarrazin .
in comments made shortly after the book 's publication , she said , " his word choice , his means of expression , the stereotyping of entire groups , the exclusion and hatefulness : it 's unacceptable .
and it is n't going to lead to any solutions . "
but neither public criticism nor the holiday season have put a damper on the book 's sales .
it remains at the top of der spiegel 's current weekly bestsellers , and a representative from the german publishers ' association told the magazine focus , " we are selling around 10,000 copies a day at the moment . "

although the controversial title has made sarrazin a millionaire , it has also led to a number of negative consequences for the former politician and banking official .
in early september , he complied with requests from officials including president christian wulff to step down from his position on the executive board of germany 's federal bank after initially refusing to withdraw voluntarily from his office .
" that was n't easy for me , " sarrazin said of the decision .
" i considered going head-to-head with the entire political class in germany , but no one can hold out in that situation for long . "
more recent editions of the book have also seen changes in some of the most incendiary passages of the book .

" that was n't easy for me , " sarrazin said of the decision .
" i considered going head-to-head with the entire political class in germany , but no one can hold out in that situation for long . "
more recent editions of the book have also seen changes in some of the most incendiary passages of the book .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 24.12.2010 holly jolly christmas for german retailers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have spent about 77 billion euro on gifts thanks to booming sales , this year 's holiday season is the most cheerful in years for german retailers .
if the trend of german shoppers continues , good business could continue after the holidays as well . a lot of german kids are going to think santa was especially generous this year when they open their christmas presents .
even the adults are likely to notice a few more presents under the tree as in 2009 .
according to the german retail association , germans have n't spent as much money on gifts during a holiday season since 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there may be a few more gifts under german trees for november and december , the association estimates total revenues of 77 billion euro -lrb- $ 101 billion -rrb- for the retail sector - 2.5 percent more than last year .
" people have n't let the chaotic winter ruin their shopping plans , " stefan genth , head of the trade union hde , told deutsche welle .
genth says that the economic crisis in germany was over surprisingly quickly .
germans saved money during the year in order to be able to afford something special for christmas , such as a nice watch or jewelry .
at the top of many christmas lists in snowy germany are winter sports items , such as sleds , skis , or ice skates .
warm winter clothes are also in high demand .
in many stores , supply of sleds and snow shovels is running low .
the demand for gloves is sometimes twice what retailers have in stock. ipads and inscriptions if a christmas wish is not snow-related , then there 's a good chance it has to do with staying inside and avoiding it .
electronic devices , including video and computer games are sought-after items as well .
in an interview with the french news agency afp , august-wilhelm scheer , head of the electronic branch 's bitkom association , said the electronic branch was " very satisfied " with their holiday business , and that it was " significantly better " than last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ipads are in high demand the high-tech gadget of the year is without a doubt the ipad .
it and other tablet-pcs have established themselves as a new class among laptop computers .
according to bitkom , around 450,000 tablet-pcs were sold in 2010 .
sales for online retailers are experiencing a boom like never before as well .
many germans want to give personalized gifts , but they do n't always have the time to take care of it themselves .
instead , they take care of a special gift with a few clicks of the mouse .
claudia helming is the head of dawanda , an online marketplace for handmade products that opened in 2006 in berlin .
she says customized jewelry , such as a silver necklace engraved with a name or a phrase , is quite popular .
dawanda gets about 30,000 orders per day - more than twice as many as last year .
trend continues past christmas while some germans go for the one-of-a-kind gifts , many others go completely generic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snow and cold kept people out of christmas markets recent studies indicate that every second present that will be opened on christmas eve is a gift certificate .
hde 's stefan genth says most of the gift certificates will be cashed in during the week between christmas and new year 's eve , making him optimistic that the booming retail business in germany will continue past the holidays .
he also expects that many people will carry out planned shopping sprees that had to be put off because of bad weather .
while the retail sector seems to have come through germany 's early winter quite well , the opposite is true for businesses operating at germany 's christmas markets .
the exceptionally cold weather and snowfall meant that many people opted to stay home instead of patronizing the stalls of the christmas market .
unlike holiday shopping sprees , a trip to the christmas market can not be pushed back a few weeks : after december 23 , the german christmas markets close up shop until next year .

if the trend of german shoppers continues , good business could continue after the holidays as well . a lot of german kids are going to think santa was especially generous this year when they open their christmas presents .
even the adults are likely to notice a few more presents under the tree as in 2009 .
according to the german retail association , germans have n't spent as much money on gifts during a holiday season since 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there may be a few more gifts under german trees for november and december , the association estimates total revenues of 77 billion euro -lrb- $ 101 billion -rrb- for the retail sector - 2.5 percent more than last year .
" people have n't let the chaotic winter ruin their shopping plans , " stefan genth , head of the trade union hde , told deutsche welle .
genth says that the economic crisis in germany was over surprisingly quickly .
germans saved money during the year in order to be able to afford something special for christmas , such as a nice watch or jewelry .
at the top of many christmas lists in snowy germany are winter sports items , such as sleds , skis , or ice skates .
warm winter clothes are also in high demand .
in many stores , supply of sleds and snow shovels is running low .
the demand for gloves is sometimes twice what retailers have in stock. ipads and inscriptions if a christmas wish is not snow-related , then there 's a good chance it has to do with staying inside and avoiding it .
electronic devices , including video and computer games are sought-after items as well .
in an interview with the french news agency afp , august-wilhelm scheer , head of the electronic branch 's bitkom association , said the electronic branch was " very satisfied " with their holiday business , and that it was " significantly better " than last year .

according to bitkom , around 450,000 tablet-pcs were sold in 2010 .
sales for online retailers are experiencing a boom like never before as well .
many germans want to give personalized gifts , but they do n't always have the time to take care of it themselves .
instead , they take care of a special gift with a few clicks of the mouse .
claudia helming is the head of dawanda , an online marketplace for handmade products that opened in 2006 in berlin .
she says customized jewelry , such as a silver necklace engraved with a name or a phrase , is quite popular .
dawanda gets about 30,000 orders per day - more than twice as many as last year .
trend continues past christmas while some germans go for the one-of-a-kind gifts , many others go completely generic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snow and cold kept people out of christmas markets recent studies indicate that every second present that will be opened on christmas eve is a gift certificate .
hde 's stefan genth says most of the gift certificates will be cashed in during the week between christmas and new year 's eve , making him optimistic that the booming retail business in germany will continue past the holidays .
he also expects that many people will carry out planned shopping sprees that had to be put off because of bad weather .
while the retail sector seems to have come through germany 's early winter quite well , the opposite is true for businesses operating at germany 's christmas markets .
the exceptionally cold weather and snowfall meant that many people opted to stay home instead of patronizing the stalls of the christmas market .
unlike holiday shopping sprees , a trip to the christmas market can not be pushed back a few weeks : after december 23 , the german christmas markets close up shop until next year .

the effect is a slump in retail sales and restaurant closures . the party is over for many in ireland , and this christmas retailers and restaurateurs have been bearing the brunt of cutbacks . irish people are spending less and staying in more , with a recent survey finding that almost 80 percent of firms did not pay for or effectively canceled the staff christmas party this year .
ireland 's holiday frugality has hit the restaurant sector badly , which is already struggling in the recession .
the restaurant association of ireland says it 's been a very tight christmas and 2011 is looking bleak .
" business has dropped by about 40 percent for the first two weeks of december and we do n't see any uptake at the moment , " said adrian cummins , ceo of the restaurant association .
" people are tightening their belts and they 're not spending on luxury items and goods and unfortunately the restaurant industry is part of that sector that has been hit by cutbacks . "
one restaurant per day statistics show one restaurant per day is closing in ireland , 80 percent of restaurants are running at a loss , and about 21,000 thousand jobs are at risk .

the effect is a slump in retail sales and restaurant closures . the party is over for many in ireland , and this christmas retailers and restaurateurs have been bearing the brunt of cutbacks . irish people are spending less and staying in more , with a recent survey finding that almost 80 percent of firms did not pay for or effectively canceled the staff christmas party this year .
ireland 's holiday frugality has hit the restaurant sector badly , which is already struggling in the recession .
the restaurant association of ireland says it 's been a very tight christmas and 2011 is looking bleak .
" business has dropped by about 40 percent for the first two weeks of december and we do n't see any uptake at the moment , " said adrian cummins , ceo of the restaurant association .
" people are tightening their belts and they 're not spending on luxury items and goods and unfortunately the restaurant industry is part of that sector that has been hit by cutbacks . "
one restaurant per day statistics show one restaurant per day is closing in ireland , 80 percent of restaurants are running at a loss , and about 21,000 thousand jobs are at risk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diners in restaurants keep an eye on the price cummins says christmas is a critical time of year for restaurants - making up almost a quarter of their annual income .
but he says people are choosing to stay at home and if they do go out , they 're dining in cheaper eateries .
" people may be not going for the high-end christmas lunch and people are looking at how much they spend when they actually go out for their christmas parties , " said cummins .
" ireland -lsb- is -rsb- a sociable nation .
we like to go out and eat out and drink as well but -lsb- spending in restaurants -rsb- is considerably down . "
deals not decadence for retailers the story is n't much better .
sales have slumped an average of 20 percent .
shoppers on the streets of dublin city centre say they 've been cutting back on food and presents or shopping online .
" we 'd go a bit further for the grandchildren , " says one woman in dublin , " we 're not doing that this year .
we 're more or less looking for sale stuff because we do n't what ahead of us basically " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are taking their euros north there 's been a rise in cross-border shopping with more people heading to northern ireland to take advantage of cheaper prices there , as well .
the latest study by aa ireland says 1 in 20 motorists will head north over the festive season .
torlach denihan , the director of retail ireland , says stores in the republic of ireland are working to battle the cross-border competition .
" currently cross-border shopping is not a significant issue , " he said .
" it was an enormous issue for the retail sector 12 or 18 months ago , but at the moment it does n't really figure .
the reason for that is retailers have cut their prices in ireland and they 're in a better place to compete with the counterparts in the north . "

" solidarity , understanding and getting along with one another : we need this in our families , in our private lives and in society , " wulff said .
" this won ’ t happen on its own , we need to work at it . "
the president noted that christmas is a time when everyone seeks to spend time with those who are near and dear to them , while at the same time focusing on helping the less fortunate .
around 190 guests were present for the recording of the speech at bellevue palace , the official residence of the president , among them , schoolchildren , scouts , and police officers .
the president singled out those who do voluntary work - in its many forms - for particular praise .
while the state can help those in need through financial support , he said , it ca n't provide the necessary human touch .
" encouragement , a pat on the shoulder and reaching out a helping hand is important for humanity and needs people to do it , " he said .
" and by the way , people engaged in voluntary work in society live longer . " mutual respect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 years on , the desire for peace remains wulff also reaffirmed his commitment to germany ’ s multicultural society , describing germany as " free and diverse . "
the president highlighted the many differences between citizens , in terms of religion , education , and their hopes and dreams .
" in order for such a diverse society to continue to thrive in the long term , we need one thing above all , respect , " he said .
" respect for those who are different while at the same time recognizing them for their achievements . "
germany as a role model the president noted that germany is well respected in the world for its peaceful and tolerant society , and its reliability when dealing with other nations , both great and small .
and he said germany was prepared to take on greater responsibilities beyond its borders , including within europe .
at the same time , though , germany he said , expected the same from its partners .
" we trust in a united europe and the influence that europe can have , " he said .
the president then used his speech to thank not only the many german soldiers , policemen and aid workers who are serving abroad , but also their families , who are unable to see their loved ones at this special time of year .
before extending christmas wishes to all germans , the president alluded to the christmas story , saying that the desire for peace on earth expressed at bethlehem more than 2,000 years ago remained a constant , even today .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.12.2010 rise of electric cars prompt ' smart ' electrical grids in portugal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nissan leaf will launch in portugal in january portugal ’ s long-term target of 750,000 electric cars fits with its smart energy plans .
already , the country has 40 percent of its energy coming from renewable sources . the launch in portugal in january of nissan 's leaf marks the start of the rollout in europe of what the company says is the first 100 percent electric car aimed at a mass market .
nissan targeted portugal - where it will also soon be assembling batteries for the leaf - after that country 's government agreed to setting up a national network of charging points .
in fact , the network is to be compatible with any make of electric car , and is part of still more ambitious long-term plans for a genuinely " smart grid " that could help portugal make fuller use of its fast-expanding renewable energy capacity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government wants to expand its network of charging stations in early december , amid ultra-modern architecture at the former site of the expo 98 world fair in lisbon , members of the portuguese public got the chance to test drive the leaf .
portuguese consumers are curious about electric cars comments ranged from the polite to the enthusiastic , with the lack of engine noise the most obvious characteristic of what at first glance looks like a regular five-seater family run-around .
but the very lack of engine noise creates some new " problems . "
" for instance , the headlamps have a specific design to avoid air going to the mirrors , " said antónio joaquim , the communications director of nissan iberia portugal .
" the exterior mirrors on a normal car produce a lot of noise with the wind .
but on this car , which does n't make any noise from the engine , all the very small noises that on other cars are not perceptible are - let 's say , uncomfortable . "
the more obvious matter of charging the car seems straightforward : a small panel on the bonnet opens to reveal something rather similar to an ordinary electric plug .
" if you want to charge when you are parking inside a garage in your own house or in a shopping centre , it 's better to have it on the bonnet , " joaquim added .
" it 's a completely different usage from a combustion engine .
you just charge the car during your daily life . "
charging stations are scarce for now , but are expected to increase there are two charging options : a partial quick charge , for example when you are on the motorway and do not want to stop for long , or a cheaper slow charge of up to eight hours .
prospective buyers in lisbon seemed to take the limitations of electric cars on board .
" it 's a nice car , and a good prospect for someone like me who has an urban life , and drives about 30 or 40 kilometres to work and back , " said one man , who declined to give his name .
the innovative design of the leaf 's lithium batteries means that you can drive the car for longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotor 's editor thinks that the european car of the year jury missed out on the prius but even a fully-charged leaf has a more limited range than a car with a full fuel tank .
so the fact that it recently was named european car of the year - the first completely electric vehicle to do so - raised some eyebrows .
antónio pereira , editor of portuguese car magazine automotor , told deutsche welle he suspected the competition 's jury may have been anxious not to miss a trick , having previously failed to garland the first version of the toyota prius , which later became a hit .
the nissan leaf is , he said , an interesting experiment , and portugal a suitably small testing ground , but with some problems .
" recharging stations are still few -lsb- in number -rsb- and mainly in the big cities , " he said .
" and in portugal we mainly live in apartments .
so either you have a parking space in your building or you have to recharge at night in the public recharging station .
that 's complicated because there wo n't be one for each . "
portugal pushing for dynmaic energy flow in its ' smart grid ' still , the spread of on-street charging points in portugal is the reason the leaf is getting its european launch in the country .
the government-led mobi.e consortium is installing 1,300 chargers around the country , compatible with all makes of car .
in addition , the state is offering a 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- subsidy for buyers of electric cars - bringing the leaf 's price down to 30,000 euro - and a road-tax exemption .
portugal 's ambitious declared long-term target of 750,000 electric vehicles on its roads also fits with plans to expand its renewable energy output , going some way to addressing sceptics ' argument that electric cars ' environmental impact depends on where their power comes from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government is subsidizing the purchase price of electric cars " we have defined as a target to be the first country to have a nationwide and comprehensive infrastructure for vehicles and to work to give the necessary framework and incentives so that we can massively introduce the electric vehicle , " luís reis of mobi.e explained at a trade fair earlier this year .
" this is important not only in terms of the sustainability of mobility but also in terms of the strategy that we have for energy . "
portuguese society has high reliance on renewable sources portugal - for decades heavily reliant on imported oil for its energy needs - now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables , and rising .
and officials overseeing the development of the electric grid envision a future in which drivers will actually be able to profit from helping ensure that same energy is used efficiently , when electric cars have full internet capability .
" you drive it home in the evening , plug -lsb- it in to -rsb- both internet and power , and the car starts receiving signals of electricity spot prices , " antónio vidigal , a director of privatised utility edp , one of the mobi.e partners , told a conference on climate change earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables " at night the price is low ; the car will charge overnight , " vidigal went on .
" next day you come to office , plug again into both plugs .
peak time energy will be expensive and the car may sell energy back to the network . "
as in many countries , hydro-electric dams in portugal already store excess energy from wind farms ; this is used to pump water uphill , to be used to generate power when demand is high .
now the groundwork is being laid for a smart grid that could see cars playing a similar role .
as the first step in what is to be a nationwide programme , edp in 2010 made évora in the alentejo , a city with a population of some 50,000 , the first " inovcity " in the future national " inovgrid . "
" consumers have access almost to real-time information as to their energy consumption , so they 'll be able to manage that better , " explained miguel andrade , a director of edp distribuição , the group 's distribution unit .
" from the company 's side obviously we hope to have operational efficiencies from this .
we hope to integrate more renewables , more micro-generation and eventually in the medium to long-term also the electric vehicle into the grid .
" i think we 're genuinely witnessing a revolution in the way we manage distribution networks . "
nissan investing in portugal but if it 's early days for integrating cars into this vision , what of today 's models ?
the leaf on show in lisbon can not , slot into a smart grid .
but , he said , the model is easily adapted .
" we are implementing the electric vehicles now , so we have to be cost efficient otherwise people would not buy them , " said antónio joaquim , nissan portugal communications director .
" that is why the cars do n't have this and the grid does n't have this capabilities .
" but from the utility 's point of view the technology is already known , from the car industry the technology is already known , so i do n't think that is a very difficult thing to implement later on .
it 's a question of software . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal has already begun rolling out electrical charging stations the leaf itself can already communicate with the charging point : identifying itself and its charging specifications and needs , as well as its owner - who will after all be paying for the power as part of the electricity bill sent to his home .
some environmentalists see models such as the leaf as primarily a public relations exercise for manufacturers that still devote most of their investment to conventional models .
nissan 's own projections for electric cars do not go beyond 10 percent of total sales .
but given that the company is building factories in japan , the us and the uk dedicated to making the leaf - and which it would be difficult and expensive to convert to make other cars - the company is perhaps not the prime target for such accusations .
" everybody in the automotive business is trying to do their own ' greenwash ' , promising ' green ' products - and most are less polluting than before , but not that green , " said antónio pereira , editor of automotor .
" i think nissan is probably taking a lot of risks with the electric car but it 's not doing greenwash - not at all . "

if the trend of german shoppers continues , good business could continue after the holidays as well . a lot of german kids are going to think santa was especially generous this year when they open their christmas presents .
even the adults are likely to notice a few more presents under the tree as in 2009 .
according to the german retail association , germans have n't spent as much money on gifts during a holiday season since 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there may be a few more gifts under german trees for november and december , the association estimates total revenues of 77 billion euro -lrb- $ 101 billion -rrb- for the retail sector - 2.5 percent more than last year .
" people have n't let the chaotic winter ruin their shopping plans , " stefan genth , head of the trade union hde , told deutsche welle .
genth says that the economic crisis in germany was over surprisingly quickly .
germans saved money during the year in order to be able to afford something special for christmas , such as a nice watch or jewelry .
at the top of many christmas lists in snowy germany are winter sports items , such as sleds , skis , or ice skates .
warm winter clothes are also in high demand .
in many stores , supply of sleds and snow shovels is running low .
the demand for gloves is sometimes twice what retailers have in stock. ipads and inscriptions if a christmas wish is not snow-related , then there 's a good chance it has to do with staying inside and avoiding it .
electronic devices , including video and computer games are sought-after items as well .
in an interview with the french news agency afp , august-wilhelm scheer , head of the electronic branch 's bitkom association , said the electronic branch was " very satisfied " with their holiday business , and that it was " significantly better " than last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ipads are in high demand the high-tech gadget of the year is without a doubt the ipad .
it and other tablet-pcs have established themselves as a new class among laptop computers .
according to bitkom , around 450,000 tablet-pcs were sold in 2010 .
sales for online retailers are experiencing a boom like never before as well .
many germans want to give personalized gifts , but they do n't always have the time to take care of it themselves .
instead , they take care of a special gift with a few clicks of the mouse .
claudia helming is the head of dawanda , an online marketplace for handmade products that opened in 2006 in berlin .
she says customized jewelry , such as a silver necklace engraved with a name or a phrase , is quite popular .
dawanda gets about 30,000 orders per day - more than twice as many as last year .
trend continues past christmas while some germans go for the one-of-a-kind gifts , many others go completely generic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snow and cold kept people out of christmas markets recent studies indicate that every second present that will be opened on christmas eve is a gift certificate .
hde 's stefan genth says most of the gift certificates will be cashed in during the week between christmas and new year 's eve , making him optimistic that the booming retail business in germany will continue past the holidays .
he also expects that many people will carry out planned shopping sprees that had to be put off because of bad weather .
while the retail sector seems to have come through germany 's early winter quite well , the opposite is true for businesses operating at germany 's christmas markets .
the exceptionally cold weather and snowfall meant that many people opted to stay home instead of patronizing the stalls of the christmas market .
unlike holiday shopping sprees , a trip to the christmas market can not be pushed back a few weeks : after december 23 , the german christmas markets close up shop until next year .

once taboo , the practice may now attract an eco-friendly clientele , saving the industry from tough chinese competition . for decades , the small industrial city of prato in tuscany has produced some of the finest wool textiles in the world - all the while hiding a dirty secret .
but now , hard hit by low-cost textiles produced in china , prato has dug the skeleton out of its closet and turned it into a powerful marketing weapon .
" the production of the reprocessed wool comes from scraps that come from the manufacturing of garments , " romeo balli explained to deutsche welle .
nowadays , with attention focused on eco-friendly manufacturing practices , this process is garnering attention for balli 's fabrics .
saving scraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recycling wool scraps conserves resources balli 's factory has carried the family name since it was founded by his grandfather in 1946 .
it was once part of a thriving textile industry in prato that produced high quality wool fabric .
back then , as today , most of the textiles were made from left-over wool scraps .
according to balli , this does n't mean a drop in quality , but does make manufacturing less expensive .
" we can find nice quality , divide it by color , quality , and it 's much easier and cheaper , " he said .
not only is the process cheaper , it 's also more environmentally friendly .
prato 's chamber of commerce is now trying to capitalize on this fact to give its industry a boost .
according to carlo longo , who heads the chamber of commerce , it 's ironic the recycled wool is now a selling point , given how for decades prato industries hid the fact .
" nobody was admitting that -lsb- we recycled scraps -rsb- .
we were trying to do it , but hiding it , " he said .
" now it 's become a reason to be proud , because we 're not depleting the world 's resources , so it 's a good thing . "
old product , new brand longo is part of an initiative geared toward reducing the carbon footprint of textile production , which certifies companies that use regenerated or recycled raw materials .
prato 's chamber of commerce has dubbed the regenerated wool " cardato , " hoping consumers will seek out the eco-friendly product .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wool manufacturers face steep competition from china " we have branded it and are launching it again , " longo said .
" there 's now a lot of attention to these kinds of products . "
it 's also economically advantageous .
with cheaply produced wool fabrics being exported from china , prato 's five billion-euro -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- export industry has lost half its business in the last decade .
textile producers like romeo balli say the reprocessed wool not only gives prato an eco-friendly advantage , but also provides cheaper and more stable prices .
according to balli , the difference in price between virgin and reprocessed wool can be between 30 and 40 percent .
those savings could ensure the survival of prato 's textile industry , especially at a time when balli believes chinese producers are stockpiling virgin wool - causing prices to shoot up around the world .

" you drive it home in the evening , plug -lsb- it in to -rsb- both internet and power , and the car starts receiving signals of electricity spot prices , " antónio vidigal , a director of privatised utility edp , one of the mobi.e partners , told a conference on climate change earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables " at night the price is low ; the car will charge overnight , " vidigal went on .
" next day you come to office , plug again into both plugs .
peak time energy will be expensive and the car may sell energy back to the network . "
as in many countries , hydro-electric dams in portugal already store excess energy from wind farms ; this is used to pump water uphill , to be used to generate power when demand is high .
now the groundwork is being laid for a smart grid that could see cars playing a similar role .
as the first step in what is to be a nationwide programme , edp in 2010 made évora in the alentejo , a city with a population of some 50,000 , the first " inovcity " in the future national " inovgrid . "
" consumers have access almost to real-time information as to their energy consumption , so they 'll be able to manage that better , " explained miguel andrade , a director of edp distribuição , the group 's distribution unit .
" from the company 's side obviously we hope to have operational efficiencies from this .
we hope to integrate more renewables , more micro-generation and eventually in the medium to long-term also the electric vehicle into the grid .
" i think we 're genuinely witnessing a revolution in the way we manage distribution networks . "
nissan investing in portugal but if it 's early days for integrating cars into this vision , what of today 's models ?
the leaf on show in lisbon can not , slot into a smart grid .
but , he said , the model is easily adapted .
" we are implementing the electric vehicles now , so we have to be cost efficient otherwise people would not buy them , " said antónio joaquim , nissan portugal communications director .
" that is why the cars do n't have this and the grid does n't have this capabilities .
" but from the utility 's point of view the technology is already known , from the car industry the technology is already known , so i do n't think that is a very difficult thing to implement later on .
it 's a question of software . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal has already begun rolling out electrical charging stations the leaf itself can already communicate with the charging point : identifying itself and its charging specifications and needs , as well as its owner - who will after all be paying for the power as part of the electricity bill sent to his home .
some environmentalists see models such as the leaf as primarily a public relations exercise for manufacturers that still devote most of their investment to conventional models .
nissan 's own projections for electric cars do not go beyond 10 percent of total sales .
but given that the company is building factories in japan , the us and the uk dedicated to making the leaf - and which it would be difficult and expensive to convert to make other cars - the company is perhaps not the prime target for such accusations .
" everybody in the automotive business is trying to do their own ' greenwash ' , promising ' green ' products - and most are less polluting than before , but not that green , " said antónio pereira , editor of automotor .
" i think nissan is probably taking a lot of risks with the electric car but it 's not doing greenwash - not at all . "

full ratification is not expected until mid-january after the body 's winter recess . russia 's lower house of parliament voted overwhelmingly to move forward a historic nuclear arms pact with the united states on friday , shortly before going on winter holiday .
the duma voted 350-58 in favor of the new strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- , which was passed by the us senate on wednesday after a lengthy political battle .
the treaty was expected to face far less of a fight in russia 's parliament , which is dominated by president dmitry medvedev 's united russia party .
medvedev and foreign minister sergei lavrov told lawmakers before the vote that the treaty would not undermine russian security , but that it " will bring russian-american relations to a qualitatively new level … and is welcomed by the entire global community . "
a rejection " would deal a serious blow to the reputation of russia . "
the agreement would slash the two sides ' nuclear arsenals to 1,550 deployed warheads per side .
the white house announced on thursday that medvedev had called us president barack obama to congratulate him on the treaty 's passing in the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidents obama and medvedev signed the start treaty back in april medvedev also said in an end-of-year interview on russian television that obama " fulfills his promises " and that he managed to secure the senate 's approval " in rather difficult circumstances . "
delay until january head lawmakers also hailed the agreement as a signal that relations between the former cold war enemies were headed in the right direction .
" there are times when our interests do not contradict each other , " said the upper chamber 's foreign affairs committee chairman mikhail margelov .
" this is precisely one of those times . "
the duma is expected to attach its own non-binding amendments to the pact , as the us senate did earlier this week to allay republican concerns with the agreement .
it expects to complete a second and final third reading after returning from recess on january 11 .
an approval by the upper chamber , the federation council , is also necessary for ratification .

" solidarity , understanding and getting along with one another : we need this in our families , in our private lives and in society , " wulff said .
" this won ’ t happen on its own , we need to work at it . "
the president noted that christmas is a time when everyone seeks to spend time with those who are near and dear to them , while at the same time focusing on helping the less fortunate .
around 190 guests were present for the recording of the speech at bellevue palace , the official residence of the president , among them , schoolchildren , scouts , and police officers .
the president singled out those who do voluntary work - in its many forms - for particular praise .
while the state can help those in need through financial support , he said , it ca n't provide the necessary human touch .
" encouragement , a pat on the shoulder and reaching out a helping hand is important for humanity and needs people to do it , " he said .
" and by the way , people engaged in voluntary work in society live longer . " mutual respect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 years on , the desire for peace remains wulff also reaffirmed his commitment to germany ’ s multicultural society , describing germany as " free and diverse . "
the president highlighted the many differences between citizens , in terms of religion , education , and their hopes and dreams .
" in order for such a diverse society to continue to thrive in the long term , we need one thing above all , respect , " he said .
" respect for those who are different while at the same time recognizing them for their achievements . "
germany as a role model the president noted that germany is well respected in the world for its peaceful and tolerant society , and its reliability when dealing with other nations , both great and small .
and he said germany was prepared to take on greater responsibilities beyond its borders , including within europe .
at the same time , though , germany he said , expected the same from its partners .
" we trust in a united europe and the influence that europe can have , " he said .
the president then used his speech to thank not only the many german soldiers , policemen and aid workers who are serving abroad , but also their families , who are unable to see their loved ones at this special time of year .
before extending christmas wishes to all germans , the president alluded to the christmas story , saying that the desire for peace on earth expressed at bethlehem more than 2,000 years ago remained a constant , even today .

once taboo , the practice may now attract an eco-friendly clientele , saving the industry from tough chinese competition . for decades , the small industrial city of prato in tuscany has produced some of the finest wool textiles in the world - all the while hiding a dirty secret .
but now , hard hit by low-cost textiles produced in china , prato has dug the skeleton out of its closet and turned it into a powerful marketing weapon .
" the production of the reprocessed wool comes from scraps that come from the manufacturing of garments , " romeo balli explained to deutsche welle .
nowadays , with attention focused on eco-friendly manufacturing practices , this process is garnering attention for balli 's fabrics .
saving scraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recycling wool scraps conserves resources balli 's factory has carried the family name since it was founded by his grandfather in 1946 .
it was once part of a thriving textile industry in prato that produced high quality wool fabric .
back then , as today , most of the textiles were made from left-over wool scraps .
according to balli , this does n't mean a drop in quality , but does make manufacturing less expensive .
" we can find nice quality , divide it by color , quality , and it 's much easier and cheaper , " he said .
not only is the process cheaper , it 's also more environmentally friendly .
prato 's chamber of commerce is now trying to capitalize on this fact to give its industry a boost .
according to carlo longo , who heads the chamber of commerce , it 's ironic the recycled wool is now a selling point , given how for decades prato industries hid the fact .
" nobody was admitting that -lsb- we recycled scraps -rsb- .
we were trying to do it , but hiding it , " he said .
" now it 's become a reason to be proud , because we 're not depleting the world 's resources , so it 's a good thing . "
old product , new brand longo is part of an initiative geared toward reducing the carbon footprint of textile production , which certifies companies that use regenerated or recycled raw materials .
prato 's chamber of commerce has dubbed the regenerated wool " cardato , " hoping consumers will seek out the eco-friendly product .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wool manufacturers face steep competition from china " we have branded it and are launching it again , " longo said .
" there 's now a lot of attention to these kinds of products . "
it 's also economically advantageous .
with cheaply produced wool fabrics being exported from china , prato 's five billion-euro -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- export industry has lost half its business in the last decade .
textile producers like romeo balli say the reprocessed wool not only gives prato an eco-friendly advantage , but also provides cheaper and more stable prices .
according to balli , the difference in price between virgin and reprocessed wool can be between 30 and 40 percent .
those savings could ensure the survival of prato 's textile industry , especially at a time when balli believes chinese producers are stockpiling virgin wool - causing prices to shoot up around the world .

if the trend of german shoppers continues , good business could continue after the holidays as well . a lot of german kids are going to think santa was especially generous this year when they open their christmas presents .
even the adults are likely to notice a few more presents under the tree as in 2009 .
according to the german retail association , germans have n't spent as much money on gifts during a holiday season since 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there may be a few more gifts under german trees for november and december , the association estimates total revenues of 77 billion euro -lrb- $ 101 billion -rrb- for the retail sector - 2.5 percent more than last year .
" people have n't let the chaotic winter ruin their shopping plans , " stefan genth , head of the trade union hde , told deutsche welle .
genth says that the economic crisis in germany was over surprisingly quickly .
germans saved money during the year in order to be able to afford something special for christmas , such as a nice watch or jewelry .
at the top of many christmas lists in snowy germany are winter sports items , such as sleds , skis , or ice skates .
warm winter clothes are also in high demand .
in many stores , supply of sleds and snow shovels is running low .
the demand for gloves is sometimes twice what retailers have in stock. ipads and inscriptions if a christmas wish is not snow-related , then there 's a good chance it has to do with staying inside and avoiding it .
electronic devices , including video and computer games are sought-after items as well .
in an interview with the french news agency afp , august-wilhelm scheer , head of the electronic branch 's bitkom association , said the electronic branch was " very satisfied " with their holiday business , and that it was " significantly better " than last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ipads are in high demand the high-tech gadget of the year is without a doubt the ipad .
it and other tablet-pcs have established themselves as a new class among laptop computers .
according to bitkom , around 450,000 tablet-pcs were sold in 2010 .
sales for online retailers are experiencing a boom like never before as well .
many germans want to give personalized gifts , but they do n't always have the time to take care of it themselves .
instead , they take care of a special gift with a few clicks of the mouse .
claudia helming is the head of dawanda , an online marketplace for handmade products that opened in 2006 in berlin .
she says customized jewelry , such as a silver necklace engraved with a name or a phrase , is quite popular .
dawanda gets about 30,000 orders per day - more than twice as many as last year .
trend continues past christmas while some germans go for the one-of-a-kind gifts , many others go completely generic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snow and cold kept people out of christmas markets recent studies indicate that every second present that will be opened on christmas eve is a gift certificate .
hde 's stefan genth says most of the gift certificates will be cashed in during the week between christmas and new year 's eve , making him optimistic that the booming retail business in germany will continue past the holidays .
he also expects that many people will carry out planned shopping sprees that had to be put off because of bad weather .
while the retail sector seems to have come through germany 's early winter quite well , the opposite is true for businesses operating at germany 's christmas markets .
the exceptionally cold weather and snowfall meant that many people opted to stay home instead of patronizing the stalls of the christmas market .
unlike holiday shopping sprees , a trip to the christmas market can not be pushed back a few weeks : after december 23 , the german christmas markets close up shop until next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.12.2010 rise of electric cars prompt ' smart ' electrical grids in portugal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nissan leaf will launch in portugal in january portugal ’ s long-term target of 750,000 electric cars fits with its smart energy plans .
already , the country has 40 percent of its energy coming from renewable sources . the launch in portugal in january of nissan 's leaf marks the start of the rollout in europe of what the company says is the first 100 percent electric car aimed at a mass market .
nissan targeted portugal - where it will also soon be assembling batteries for the leaf - after that country 's government agreed to setting up a national network of charging points .
in fact , the network is to be compatible with any make of electric car , and is part of still more ambitious long-term plans for a genuinely " smart grid " that could help portugal make fuller use of its fast-expanding renewable energy capacity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government wants to expand its network of charging stations in early december , amid ultra-modern architecture at the former site of the expo 98 world fair in lisbon , members of the portuguese public got the chance to test drive the leaf .
portuguese consumers are curious about electric cars comments ranged from the polite to the enthusiastic , with the lack of engine noise the most obvious characteristic of what at first glance looks like a regular five-seater family run-around .
but the very lack of engine noise creates some new " problems . "
" for instance , the headlamps have a specific design to avoid air going to the mirrors , " said antónio joaquim , the communications director of nissan iberia portugal .
" the exterior mirrors on a normal car produce a lot of noise with the wind .
but on this car , which does n't make any noise from the engine , all the very small noises that on other cars are not perceptible are - let 's say , uncomfortable . "
the more obvious matter of charging the car seems straightforward : a small panel on the bonnet opens to reveal something rather similar to an ordinary electric plug .
" if you want to charge when you are parking inside a garage in your own house or in a shopping centre , it 's better to have it on the bonnet , " joaquim added .
" it 's a completely different usage from a combustion engine .
you just charge the car during your daily life . "
charging stations are scarce for now , but are expected to increase there are two charging options : a partial quick charge , for example when you are on the motorway and do not want to stop for long , or a cheaper slow charge of up to eight hours .
prospective buyers in lisbon seemed to take the limitations of electric cars on board .
" it 's a nice car , and a good prospect for someone like me who has an urban life , and drives about 30 or 40 kilometres to work and back , " said one man , who declined to give his name .
the innovative design of the leaf 's lithium batteries means that you can drive the car for longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotor 's editor thinks that the european car of the year jury missed out on the prius but even a fully-charged leaf has a more limited range than a car with a full fuel tank .
so the fact that it recently was named european car of the year - the first completely electric vehicle to do so - raised some eyebrows .
antónio pereira , editor of portuguese car magazine automotor , told deutsche welle he suspected the competition 's jury may have been anxious not to miss a trick , having previously failed to garland the first version of the toyota prius , which later became a hit .
the nissan leaf is , he said , an interesting experiment , and portugal a suitably small testing ground , but with some problems .
" recharging stations are still few -lsb- in number -rsb- and mainly in the big cities , " he said .
" and in portugal we mainly live in apartments .
so either you have a parking space in your building or you have to recharge at night in the public recharging station .
that 's complicated because there wo n't be one for each . "
portugal pushing for dynmaic energy flow in its ' smart grid ' still , the spread of on-street charging points in portugal is the reason the leaf is getting its european launch in the country .
the government-led mobi.e consortium is installing 1,300 chargers around the country , compatible with all makes of car .
in addition , the state is offering a 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- subsidy for buyers of electric cars - bringing the leaf 's price down to 30,000 euro - and a road-tax exemption .
portugal 's ambitious declared long-term target of 750,000 electric vehicles on its roads also fits with plans to expand its renewable energy output , going some way to addressing sceptics ' argument that electric cars ' environmental impact depends on where their power comes from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government is subsidizing the purchase price of electric cars " we have defined as a target to be the first country to have a nationwide and comprehensive infrastructure for vehicles and to work to give the necessary framework and incentives so that we can massively introduce the electric vehicle , " luís reis of mobi.e explained at a trade fair earlier this year .
" this is important not only in terms of the sustainability of mobility but also in terms of the strategy that we have for energy . "
portuguese society has high reliance on renewable sources portugal - for decades heavily reliant on imported oil for its energy needs - now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables , and rising .
and officials overseeing the development of the electric grid envision a future in which drivers will actually be able to profit from helping ensure that same energy is used efficiently , when electric cars have full internet capability .
" you drive it home in the evening , plug -lsb- it in to -rsb- both internet and power , and the car starts receiving signals of electricity spot prices , " antónio vidigal , a director of privatised utility edp , one of the mobi.e partners , told a conference on climate change earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables " at night the price is low ; the car will charge overnight , " vidigal went on .
" next day you come to office , plug again into both plugs .
peak time energy will be expensive and the car may sell energy back to the network . "
as in many countries , hydro-electric dams in portugal already store excess energy from wind farms ; this is used to pump water uphill , to be used to generate power when demand is high .
now the groundwork is being laid for a smart grid that could see cars playing a similar role .
as the first step in what is to be a nationwide programme , edp in 2010 made évora in the alentejo , a city with a population of some 50,000 , the first " inovcity " in the future national " inovgrid . "
" consumers have access almost to real-time information as to their energy consumption , so they 'll be able to manage that better , " explained miguel andrade , a director of edp distribuição , the group 's distribution unit .
" from the company 's side obviously we hope to have operational efficiencies from this .
we hope to integrate more renewables , more micro-generation and eventually in the medium to long-term also the electric vehicle into the grid .
" i think we 're genuinely witnessing a revolution in the way we manage distribution networks . "
nissan investing in portugal but if it 's early days for integrating cars into this vision , what of today 's models ?
the leaf on show in lisbon can not , slot into a smart grid .
but , he said , the model is easily adapted .
" we are implementing the electric vehicles now , so we have to be cost efficient otherwise people would not buy them , " said antónio joaquim , nissan portugal communications director .
" that is why the cars do n't have this and the grid does n't have this capabilities .
" but from the utility 's point of view the technology is already known , from the car industry the technology is already known , so i do n't think that is a very difficult thing to implement later on .
it 's a question of software . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal has already begun rolling out electrical charging stations the leaf itself can already communicate with the charging point : identifying itself and its charging specifications and needs , as well as its owner - who will after all be paying for the power as part of the electricity bill sent to his home .
some environmentalists see models such as the leaf as primarily a public relations exercise for manufacturers that still devote most of their investment to conventional models .
nissan 's own projections for electric cars do not go beyond 10 percent of total sales .
but given that the company is building factories in japan , the us and the uk dedicated to making the leaf - and which it would be difficult and expensive to convert to make other cars - the company is perhaps not the prime target for such accusations .
" everybody in the automotive business is trying to do their own ' greenwash ' , promising ' green ' products - and most are less polluting than before , but not that green , " said antónio pereira , editor of automotor .

" solidarity , understanding and getting along with one another : we need this in our families , in our private lives and in society , " wulff said .
" this won ’ t happen on its own , we need to work at it . "
the president noted that christmas is a time when everyone seeks to spend time with those who are near and dear to them , while at the same time focusing on helping the less fortunate .
around 190 guests were present for the recording of the speech at bellevue palace , the official residence of the president , among them , schoolchildren , scouts , and police officers .
the president singled out those who do voluntary work - in its many forms - for particular praise .
while the state can help those in need through financial support , he said , it ca n't provide the necessary human touch .
" encouragement , a pat on the shoulder and reaching out a helping hand is important for humanity and needs people to do it , " he said .
" and by the way , people engaged in voluntary work in society live longer . " mutual respect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 years on , the desire for peace remains wulff also reaffirmed his commitment to germany ’ s multicultural society , describing germany as " free and diverse . "
the president highlighted the many differences between citizens , in terms of religion , education , and their hopes and dreams .
" in order for such a diverse society to continue to thrive in the long term , we need one thing above all , respect , " he said .
" respect for those who are different while at the same time recognizing them for their achievements . "
germany as a role model the president noted that germany is well respected in the world for its peaceful and tolerant society , and its reliability when dealing with other nations , both great and small .
and he said germany was prepared to take on greater responsibilities beyond its borders , including within europe .
at the same time , though , germany he said , expected the same from its partners .
" we trust in a united europe and the influence that europe can have , " he said .
the president then used his speech to thank not only the many german soldiers , policemen and aid workers who are serving abroad , but also their families , who are unable to see their loved ones at this special time of year .
before extending christmas wishes to all germans , the president alluded to the christmas story , saying that the desire for peace on earth expressed at bethlehem more than 2,000 years ago remained a constant , even today .

he is currently a senior adviser for international affairs at the united states institute of peace and a principal in the rice hadley group . deutsche welle : let 's look back at us and european foreign and security policy this year and take a tally of some major issues .
in afghanistan 2010 was the deadliest year for the international troops with more than 700 soldiers killed , most of them american .
has president obama 's surge strategy failed ?
stephen hadley : there 's been an initial assessment which has not been released publicly in all its detail .
but i think the administration 's assessment , and i think it 's right , is that the strategy of the united states and other allies including most europeans who are with us on the ground in afghanistan is making progress .
it 's slower than we would like , it 's fragile and reversible , but there has been progress .
and i think one of the good things about 2010 is that there has been a coming together of europeans and americans about the importance of afghanistan and about how to pursue our strategy .
president obama has said the us would begin to pull troops out of afghanistan in 2011 , the british have said they may do the same and germany has announced its plans to start withdrawing troops next year as well .
when the three biggest troop contributors start pulling back , can the war in afghanistan still be won ?
yes , because the lede here is not that the troops are pulling back , the lede is that the united states and its allies believe that they will be able to begin to transfer security responsibility to the afghans .
remember , americans and europeans have for several years now been training and helping the afghans to build an army and police that can take increasing security responsibility .
and afghan forces are operating with american and nato and other european forces in afghanistan now , so what the president said was that in 2011 we could begin the process of transferring security responsibility to afghan units and as that occurred it would allow some units of american and european origin to begin to withdraw .
but president obama has been clear , and particularly secretary gates has been clear that that handover of security responsibility to afghanistan and any withdrawal of american forces will be condition-based .
that is to say it will have to reflect progress and security on the ground and will be done in a way that does not jeopardize the progress we have achieved or future progress .
another intractable international issue for the us and the eu is how to deal with iran 's nuclear program .
despite a united position by europeans and americans and tough new sanctions that were put in place in 2010 with the help of russia and china , there does n't seem to be a change of tehran 's stance .
is the west simply running out of options on iran ? i think the administration and our european allies have done a better job than i would have anticipated in getting the russians and the chinese to go along with very tough sanctions .
as you point out , regrettably , it has not resulted in a change of iranian policy on the nuclear issue .
and this is obviously a source of concern for all of us , because the worry is that if the region begins to conclude that the international community is not going to be able to prevent iran from having through its enrichment program a clear path to a nuclear weapon that is going to result in an emboldened iran , it is going to result in weakened arab states and it is going to result in arab states trying to develop their own nuclear programs which is a proliferation risk that will make the middle east less stable not more stable .
2010 was the year in which the obama administration like many before tried and failed to make progress on the peace process between israelis and palestinians because it could n't convince the israeli government to extend a settlement stop even for just a few months .
was the us foolish even to try again or has the us completely lost its leverage with both parties , but especially with the israeli government ?
i think the administration has said as much that the effort that began really soon after administration took power in january 2009 to get a construction freeze in the settlement areas did not work as the administration has intended .
what they had hoped to do was to send a strong message to the world that the administration was going to be even-handed between the israelis and palestinians .
that this message would be greeted in the arab world with steps to reach out toward israel and to begin rebuilding diplomatic relations between israel and the arab world and it simply did not work .
and rather than facilitating negotiations and progress on the negotiating table it became a barrier to negotiations .
it was a tactic , i think the administration would say , that did not work .
so they are trying to restart the process to have these proximity talks to try to turn the focus from settlement construction to what the focus should have been really from the beginning which is the terms of peace .
we can only hope that there will be some success in this effort .
but i think what is really good news for the prospects for peace is what is happening in the west bank .
that president abbas and prime minister salam fayad are building the institutions of a palestinian state even while under occupation .
they are now training security forces that are increasingly taking responsibility for security and are going after terrorists .
the israeli military is recognizing the effectiveness of these forces and cooperating with them .
the palestinians are building political institutions , economic activity and growth has returned to the west bank and there is peace , there is calm , that is to say .
there are no incidents of violence either in the west bank or in israel .
so in some sense while the negotiations seem to have foundered , the underpinnings of an ultimate peace , that is to say the institutions of a democratic palestinian state that is not supporting terror , but is maintaining peace and security for both palestinians and israelis , that process has gone forward .
and i think that is a bright spot and an essential element for an ultimate peace and a two-state solution in the middle east .
many us presidents engaged in foreign policy have a doctrine named after them that spells out their vision or version of america 's engagement with the world .
obama has now passed the half-time mark of his first term .
is there something that could be called an obama doctrine and if so how would you describe and compare it to other presidential doctrines like the so-called bush doctrine ?
i think the obama administration is still a work in progress on foreign policy .
i think they would say as much .
i think they want to be known as an administration that has engaged our adversaries .
i think that policy has had some mixed success i think with respect to north korea and chavez in venezuela and in iran .
and they have certainly been very firm on north korea about the prerequisites to resuming the six-party talks .
i think one of the things that has surprised a lot of people is while i think the administration has had a positive tone in how it has spoken to the arab world and how it has spoken to europe , i think there is a lot more continuity in the policies between president obama and president bush than a lot of people expected .
and that 's not unusual .
in the united states , while we have presidential elections that are waged and fought based often on differences in foreign policy , when new administrations come in and see the problems that the prior administration has faced there is a high degree of continuity in policies between administrations .
and i think you see it in terms of the iraq policy , afghanistan policy and policies dealing with the terrorist threat .
so i think there have been some positive changes in tone .
some have succeeded , some have not .
but i think there has also been a high degree and a useful degree of continuity with the policies of its predecessor administrations .
if you had to give a grade to the obama administration for its foreign policy for this year or for the past two years what grade would that be ?
i think any foreign policy in the first two years generally gets an incomplete .
that is to say , the first year they are figuring out what their policies should be .
the second year they begin to roll out those policies in a more serious way , but it takes another year or two to know whether they are working .
so i think almost any administration in the second year gets an incomplete .
let 's switch to transatlantic affairs : one year ago with lady ashton and herman van rompuy , two relatively obscure politicians were chosen as the eu 's first new president and foreign minister .
the us has long complained about the lack of a common european stance on many international issues .
does washington now finally know which numbers to call in europe ? i think there is a feeling that the economic crisis that we have been through has put a lot of strain on the european project .
so i think most americans think that because of the challenge presented by the economic crisis there is a certain amount of introspection going on within europe about where it is going in terms of its political and economic integration .
i think that is very understandable .
the economic crisis has been a real blow to the entire world and it 's going to take some time to work it through . so i think most americans would say there has been a little bit of a pause in the european project of political and economic integration .
that has been a project that the united states has supported for 50 years , both republican and democratic administrations , and one that we want to succeed .
but understandably there is some soul searching going on in the europeans and we need to let our european allies work these issues through .
barack obama has been described as the first us president who is not an atlanticist naturally inclined toward europe , but rather toward asia .
this and the often quoted rise of asia has led some europeans to worry about the nature and future of the transatlantic relationship .
how healthy is the transatlantic relationship today and how important will it be in the future ? i have been in washington for over 40 years and sort of every 10 years somebody comes up and declares the end of the transatlantic relationship .
and so far all those predictions have been premature .
i think this is really the oldest affiliation for the united states this strong relationship with europe .
i think it continues to remain strong and will remain strong from administration to administration .
that said , the rise of asia and major new world powers in asia such as china and india is getting a lot of attention in the united states .
and it is getting a lot of attention in europe .
germany 's economic recovery is heavily driven by exports to asia , so it is not surprising that both in europe and in the united states there is a lot of discussion about asia and ties toward asia .
that is to say , how can meet the rise of new great powers in asia and how can we turn the rise of those great powers and the economic growth and the economic engine that asia is right now literally pulling the world out of recession , how can we turn that so that it is an opportunity for greater peace and prosperity for the world as a whole .
i think that 's the task in asia and it is something that europeans and americans should be working on together .

he is currently a senior adviser for international affairs at the united states institute of peace and a principal in the rice hadley group . deutsche welle : let 's look back at us and european foreign and security policy this year and take a tally of some major issues .
in afghanistan 2010 was the deadliest year for the international troops with more than 700 soldiers killed , most of them american .
has president obama 's surge strategy failed ?
stephen hadley : there 's been an initial assessment which has not been released publicly in all its detail .
but i think the administration 's assessment , and i think it 's right , is that the strategy of the united states and other allies including most europeans who are with us on the ground in afghanistan is making progress .
it 's slower than we would like , it 's fragile and reversible , but there has been progress .
and i think one of the good things about 2010 is that there has been a coming together of europeans and americans about the importance of afghanistan and about how to pursue our strategy .
president obama has said the us would begin to pull troops out of afghanistan in 2011 , the british have said they may do the same and germany has announced its plans to start withdrawing troops next year as well .
when the three biggest troop contributors start pulling back , can the war in afghanistan still be won ?
yes , because the lede here is not that the troops are pulling back , the lede is that the united states and its allies believe that they will be able to begin to transfer security responsibility to the afghans .
remember , americans and europeans have for several years now been training and helping the afghans to build an army and police that can take increasing security responsibility .
and afghan forces are operating with american and nato and other european forces in afghanistan now , so what the president said was that in 2011 we could begin the process of transferring security responsibility to afghan units and as that occurred it would allow some units of american and european origin to begin to withdraw .
but president obama has been clear , and particularly secretary gates has been clear that that handover of security responsibility to afghanistan and any withdrawal of american forces will be condition-based .
that is to say it will have to reflect progress and security on the ground and will be done in a way that does not jeopardize the progress we have achieved or future progress .
another intractable international issue for the us and the eu is how to deal with iran 's nuclear program .
despite a united position by europeans and americans and tough new sanctions that were put in place in 2010 with the help of russia and china , there does n't seem to be a change of tehran 's stance .
is the west simply running out of options on iran ? i think the administration and our european allies have done a better job than i would have anticipated in getting the russians and the chinese to go along with very tough sanctions .
as you point out , regrettably , it has not resulted in a change of iranian policy on the nuclear issue .
and this is obviously a source of concern for all of us , because the worry is that if the region begins to conclude that the international community is not going to be able to prevent iran from having through its enrichment program a clear path to a nuclear weapon that is going to result in an emboldened iran , it is going to result in weakened arab states and it is going to result in arab states trying to develop their own nuclear programs which is a proliferation risk that will make the middle east less stable not more stable .
2010 was the year in which the obama administration like many before tried and failed to make progress on the peace process between israelis and palestinians because it could n't convince the israeli government to extend a settlement stop even for just a few months .
was the us foolish even to try again or has the us completely lost its leverage with both parties , but especially with the israeli government ?
i think the administration has said as much that the effort that began really soon after administration took power in january 2009 to get a construction freeze in the settlement areas did not work as the administration has intended .
what they had hoped to do was to send a strong message to the world that the administration was going to be even-handed between the israelis and palestinians .
that this message would be greeted in the arab world with steps to reach out toward israel and to begin rebuilding diplomatic relations between israel and the arab world and it simply did not work .
and rather than facilitating negotiations and progress on the negotiating table it became a barrier to negotiations .
it was a tactic , i think the administration would say , that did not work .
so they are trying to restart the process to have these proximity talks to try to turn the focus from settlement construction to what the focus should have been really from the beginning which is the terms of peace .
we can only hope that there will be some success in this effort .
but i think what is really good news for the prospects for peace is what is happening in the west bank .
that president abbas and prime minister salam fayad are building the institutions of a palestinian state even while under occupation .
they are now training security forces that are increasingly taking responsibility for security and are going after terrorists .
the israeli military is recognizing the effectiveness of these forces and cooperating with them .
the palestinians are building political institutions , economic activity and growth has returned to the west bank and there is peace , there is calm , that is to say .
there are no incidents of violence either in the west bank or in israel .
so in some sense while the negotiations seem to have foundered , the underpinnings of an ultimate peace , that is to say the institutions of a democratic palestinian state that is not supporting terror , but is maintaining peace and security for both palestinians and israelis , that process has gone forward .
and i think that is a bright spot and an essential element for an ultimate peace and a two-state solution in the middle east .
many us presidents engaged in foreign policy have a doctrine named after them that spells out their vision or version of america 's engagement with the world .
obama has now passed the half-time mark of his first term .
is there something that could be called an obama doctrine and if so how would you describe and compare it to other presidential doctrines like the so-called bush doctrine ?
i think the obama administration is still a work in progress on foreign policy .
i think they would say as much .
i think they want to be known as an administration that has engaged our adversaries .
i think that policy has had some mixed success i think with respect to north korea and chavez in venezuela and in iran .
and they have certainly been very firm on north korea about the prerequisites to resuming the six-party talks .
i think one of the things that has surprised a lot of people is while i think the administration has had a positive tone in how it has spoken to the arab world and how it has spoken to europe , i think there is a lot more continuity in the policies between president obama and president bush than a lot of people expected .
and that 's not unusual .
in the united states , while we have presidential elections that are waged and fought based often on differences in foreign policy , when new administrations come in and see the problems that the prior administration has faced there is a high degree of continuity in policies between administrations .
and i think you see it in terms of the iraq policy , afghanistan policy and policies dealing with the terrorist threat .
so i think there have been some positive changes in tone .
some have succeeded , some have not .
but i think there has also been a high degree and a useful degree of continuity with the policies of its predecessor administrations .
if you had to give a grade to the obama administration for its foreign policy for this year or for the past two years what grade would that be ?
i think any foreign policy in the first two years generally gets an incomplete .
that is to say , the first year they are figuring out what their policies should be .
the second year they begin to roll out those policies in a more serious way , but it takes another year or two to know whether they are working .
so i think almost any administration in the second year gets an incomplete .
let 's switch to transatlantic affairs : one year ago with lady ashton and herman van rompuy , two relatively obscure politicians were chosen as the eu 's first new president and foreign minister .
the us has long complained about the lack of a common european stance on many international issues .
does washington now finally know which numbers to call in europe ? i think there is a feeling that the economic crisis that we have been through has put a lot of strain on the european project .
so i think most americans think that because of the challenge presented by the economic crisis there is a certain amount of introspection going on within europe about where it is going in terms of its political and economic integration .
i think that is very understandable .
the economic crisis has been a real blow to the entire world and it 's going to take some time to work it through . so i think most americans would say there has been a little bit of a pause in the european project of political and economic integration .
that has been a project that the united states has supported for 50 years , both republican and democratic administrations , and one that we want to succeed .
but understandably there is some soul searching going on in the europeans and we need to let our european allies work these issues through .
barack obama has been described as the first us president who is not an atlanticist naturally inclined toward europe , but rather toward asia .
this and the often quoted rise of asia has led some europeans to worry about the nature and future of the transatlantic relationship .
how healthy is the transatlantic relationship today and how important will it be in the future ? i have been in washington for over 40 years and sort of every 10 years somebody comes up and declares the end of the transatlantic relationship .
and so far all those predictions have been premature .
i think this is really the oldest affiliation for the united states this strong relationship with europe .
i think it continues to remain strong and will remain strong from administration to administration .
that said , the rise of asia and major new world powers in asia such as china and india is getting a lot of attention in the united states .
and it is getting a lot of attention in europe .
germany 's economic recovery is heavily driven by exports to asia , so it is not surprising that both in europe and in the united states there is a lot of discussion about asia and ties toward asia .
that is to say , how can meet the rise of new great powers in asia and how can we turn the rise of those great powers and the economic growth and the economic engine that asia is right now literally pulling the world out of recession , how can we turn that so that it is an opportunity for greater peace and prosperity for the world as a whole .
i think that 's the task in asia and it is something that europeans and americans should be working on together .

if the trend of german shoppers continues , good business could continue after the holidays as well . a lot of german kids are going to think santa was especially generous this year when they open their christmas presents .
even the adults are likely to notice a few more presents under the tree as in 2009 .
according to the german retail association , germans have n't spent as much money on gifts during a holiday season since 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there may be a few more gifts under german trees for november and december , the association estimates total revenues of 77 billion euro -lrb- $ 101 billion -rrb- for the retail sector - 2.5 percent more than last year .
" people have n't let the chaotic winter ruin their shopping plans , " stefan genth , head of the trade union hde , told deutsche welle .
genth says that the economic crisis in germany was over surprisingly quickly .
germans saved money during the year in order to be able to afford something special for christmas , such as a nice watch or jewelry .
at the top of many christmas lists in snowy germany are winter sports items , such as sleds , skis , or ice skates .
warm winter clothes are also in high demand .
in many stores , supply of sleds and snow shovels is running low .
the demand for gloves is sometimes twice what retailers have in stock. ipads and inscriptions if a christmas wish is not snow-related , then there 's a good chance it has to do with staying inside and avoiding it .
electronic devices , including video and computer games are sought-after items as well .
in an interview with the french news agency afp , august-wilhelm scheer , head of the electronic branch 's bitkom association , said the electronic branch was " very satisfied " with their holiday business , and that it was " significantly better " than last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ipads are in high demand the high-tech gadget of the year is without a doubt the ipad .
it and other tablet-pcs have established themselves as a new class among laptop computers .
according to bitkom , around 450,000 tablet-pcs were sold in 2010 .
sales for online retailers are experiencing a boom like never before as well .
many germans want to give personalized gifts , but they do n't always have the time to take care of it themselves .
instead , they take care of a special gift with a few clicks of the mouse .
claudia helming is the head of dawanda , an online marketplace for handmade products that opened in 2006 in berlin .
she says customized jewelry , such as a silver necklace engraved with a name or a phrase , is quite popular .
dawanda gets about 30,000 orders per day - more than twice as many as last year .
trend continues past christmas while some germans go for the one-of-a-kind gifts , many others go completely generic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snow and cold kept people out of christmas markets recent studies indicate that every second present that will be opened on christmas eve is a gift certificate .
hde 's stefan genth says most of the gift certificates will be cashed in during the week between christmas and new year 's eve , making him optimistic that the booming retail business in germany will continue past the holidays .
he also expects that many people will carry out planned shopping sprees that had to be put off because of bad weather .
while the retail sector seems to have come through germany 's early winter quite well , the opposite is true for businesses operating at germany 's christmas markets .
the exceptionally cold weather and snowfall meant that many people opted to stay home instead of patronizing the stalls of the christmas market .
unlike holiday shopping sprees , a trip to the christmas market can not be pushed back a few weeks : after december 23 , the german christmas markets close up shop until next year .

once taboo , the practice may now attract an eco-friendly clientele , saving the industry from tough chinese competition . for decades , the small industrial city of prato in tuscany has produced some of the finest wool textiles in the world - all the while hiding a dirty secret .
but now , hard hit by low-cost textiles produced in china , prato has dug the skeleton out of its closet and turned it into a powerful marketing weapon .
" the production of the reprocessed wool comes from scraps that come from the manufacturing of garments , " romeo balli explained to deutsche welle .
nowadays , with attention focused on eco-friendly manufacturing practices , this process is garnering attention for balli 's fabrics .
saving scraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recycling wool scraps conserves resources balli 's factory has carried the family name since it was founded by his grandfather in 1946 .
it was once part of a thriving textile industry in prato that produced high quality wool fabric .
back then , as today , most of the textiles were made from left-over wool scraps .
according to balli , this does n't mean a drop in quality , but does make manufacturing less expensive .
" we can find nice quality , divide it by color , quality , and it 's much easier and cheaper , " he said .
not only is the process cheaper , it 's also more environmentally friendly .
prato 's chamber of commerce is now trying to capitalize on this fact to give its industry a boost .
according to carlo longo , who heads the chamber of commerce , it 's ironic the recycled wool is now a selling point , given how for decades prato industries hid the fact .
" nobody was admitting that -lsb- we recycled scraps -rsb- .
we were trying to do it , but hiding it , " he said .
" now it 's become a reason to be proud , because we 're not depleting the world 's resources , so it 's a good thing . "
old product , new brand longo is part of an initiative geared toward reducing the carbon footprint of textile production , which certifies companies that use regenerated or recycled raw materials .
prato 's chamber of commerce has dubbed the regenerated wool " cardato , " hoping consumers will seek out the eco-friendly product .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wool manufacturers face steep competition from china " we have branded it and are launching it again , " longo said .
" there 's now a lot of attention to these kinds of products . "
it 's also economically advantageous .
with cheaply produced wool fabrics being exported from china , prato 's five billion-euro -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- export industry has lost half its business in the last decade .
textile producers like romeo balli say the reprocessed wool not only gives prato an eco-friendly advantage , but also provides cheaper and more stable prices .
according to balli , the difference in price between virgin and reprocessed wool can be between 30 and 40 percent .
those savings could ensure the survival of prato 's textile industry , especially at a time when balli believes chinese producers are stockpiling virgin wool - causing prices to shoot up around the world .

he is currently a senior adviser for international affairs at the united states institute of peace and a principal in the rice hadley group . deutsche welle : let 's look back at us and european foreign and security policy this year and take a tally of some major issues .
in afghanistan 2010 was the deadliest year for the international troops with more than 700 soldiers killed , most of them american .
has president obama 's surge strategy failed ?
stephen hadley : there 's been an initial assessment which has not been released publicly in all its detail .
but i think the administration 's assessment , and i think it 's right , is that the strategy of the united states and other allies including most europeans who are with us on the ground in afghanistan is making progress .
it 's slower than we would like , it 's fragile and reversible , but there has been progress .
and i think one of the good things about 2010 is that there has been a coming together of europeans and americans about the importance of afghanistan and about how to pursue our strategy .
president obama has said the us would begin to pull troops out of afghanistan in 2011 , the british have said they may do the same and germany has announced its plans to start withdrawing troops next year as well .
when the three biggest troop contributors start pulling back , can the war in afghanistan still be won ?
yes , because the lede here is not that the troops are pulling back , the lede is that the united states and its allies believe that they will be able to begin to transfer security responsibility to the afghans .
remember , americans and europeans have for several years now been training and helping the afghans to build an army and police that can take increasing security responsibility .
and afghan forces are operating with american and nato and other european forces in afghanistan now , so what the president said was that in 2011 we could begin the process of transferring security responsibility to afghan units and as that occurred it would allow some units of american and european origin to begin to withdraw .
but president obama has been clear , and particularly secretary gates has been clear that that handover of security responsibility to afghanistan and any withdrawal of american forces will be condition-based .
that is to say it will have to reflect progress and security on the ground and will be done in a way that does not jeopardize the progress we have achieved or future progress .
another intractable international issue for the us and the eu is how to deal with iran 's nuclear program .
despite a united position by europeans and americans and tough new sanctions that were put in place in 2010 with the help of russia and china , there does n't seem to be a change of tehran 's stance .
is the west simply running out of options on iran ? i think the administration and our european allies have done a better job than i would have anticipated in getting the russians and the chinese to go along with very tough sanctions .
as you point out , regrettably , it has not resulted in a change of iranian policy on the nuclear issue .
and this is obviously a source of concern for all of us , because the worry is that if the region begins to conclude that the international community is not going to be able to prevent iran from having through its enrichment program a clear path to a nuclear weapon that is going to result in an emboldened iran , it is going to result in weakened arab states and it is going to result in arab states trying to develop their own nuclear programs which is a proliferation risk that will make the middle east less stable not more stable .
2010 was the year in which the obama administration like many before tried and failed to make progress on the peace process between israelis and palestinians because it could n't convince the israeli government to extend a settlement stop even for just a few months .
was the us foolish even to try again or has the us completely lost its leverage with both parties , but especially with the israeli government ?
i think the administration has said as much that the effort that began really soon after administration took power in january 2009 to get a construction freeze in the settlement areas did not work as the administration has intended .
what they had hoped to do was to send a strong message to the world that the administration was going to be even-handed between the israelis and palestinians .
that this message would be greeted in the arab world with steps to reach out toward israel and to begin rebuilding diplomatic relations between israel and the arab world and it simply did not work .
and rather than facilitating negotiations and progress on the negotiating table it became a barrier to negotiations .
it was a tactic , i think the administration would say , that did not work .
so they are trying to restart the process to have these proximity talks to try to turn the focus from settlement construction to what the focus should have been really from the beginning which is the terms of peace .
we can only hope that there will be some success in this effort .
but i think what is really good news for the prospects for peace is what is happening in the west bank .
that president abbas and prime minister salam fayad are building the institutions of a palestinian state even while under occupation .
they are now training security forces that are increasingly taking responsibility for security and are going after terrorists .
the israeli military is recognizing the effectiveness of these forces and cooperating with them .
the palestinians are building political institutions , economic activity and growth has returned to the west bank and there is peace , there is calm , that is to say .
there are no incidents of violence either in the west bank or in israel .
so in some sense while the negotiations seem to have foundered , the underpinnings of an ultimate peace , that is to say the institutions of a democratic palestinian state that is not supporting terror , but is maintaining peace and security for both palestinians and israelis , that process has gone forward .
and i think that is a bright spot and an essential element for an ultimate peace and a two-state solution in the middle east .
many us presidents engaged in foreign policy have a doctrine named after them that spells out their vision or version of america 's engagement with the world .
obama has now passed the half-time mark of his first term .
is there something that could be called an obama doctrine and if so how would you describe and compare it to other presidential doctrines like the so-called bush doctrine ?
i think the obama administration is still a work in progress on foreign policy .
i think they would say as much .
i think they want to be known as an administration that has engaged our adversaries .
i think that policy has had some mixed success i think with respect to north korea and chavez in venezuela and in iran .
and they have certainly been very firm on north korea about the prerequisites to resuming the six-party talks .
i think one of the things that has surprised a lot of people is while i think the administration has had a positive tone in how it has spoken to the arab world and how it has spoken to europe , i think there is a lot more continuity in the policies between president obama and president bush than a lot of people expected .
and that 's not unusual .
in the united states , while we have presidential elections that are waged and fought based often on differences in foreign policy , when new administrations come in and see the problems that the prior administration has faced there is a high degree of continuity in policies between administrations .
and i think you see it in terms of the iraq policy , afghanistan policy and policies dealing with the terrorist threat .
so i think there have been some positive changes in tone .
some have succeeded , some have not .
but i think there has also been a high degree and a useful degree of continuity with the policies of its predecessor administrations .
if you had to give a grade to the obama administration for its foreign policy for this year or for the past two years what grade would that be ?
i think any foreign policy in the first two years generally gets an incomplete .
that is to say , the first year they are figuring out what their policies should be .
the second year they begin to roll out those policies in a more serious way , but it takes another year or two to know whether they are working .
so i think almost any administration in the second year gets an incomplete .
let 's switch to transatlantic affairs : one year ago with lady ashton and herman van rompuy , two relatively obscure politicians were chosen as the eu 's first new president and foreign minister .
the us has long complained about the lack of a common european stance on many international issues .
does washington now finally know which numbers to call in europe ? i think there is a feeling that the economic crisis that we have been through has put a lot of strain on the european project .
so i think most americans think that because of the challenge presented by the economic crisis there is a certain amount of introspection going on within europe about where it is going in terms of its political and economic integration .
i think that is very understandable .
the economic crisis has been a real blow to the entire world and it 's going to take some time to work it through . so i think most americans would say there has been a little bit of a pause in the european project of political and economic integration .
that has been a project that the united states has supported for 50 years , both republican and democratic administrations , and one that we want to succeed .
but understandably there is some soul searching going on in the europeans and we need to let our european allies work these issues through .
barack obama has been described as the first us president who is not an atlanticist naturally inclined toward europe , but rather toward asia .
this and the often quoted rise of asia has led some europeans to worry about the nature and future of the transatlantic relationship .
how healthy is the transatlantic relationship today and how important will it be in the future ? i have been in washington for over 40 years and sort of every 10 years somebody comes up and declares the end of the transatlantic relationship .
and so far all those predictions have been premature .
i think this is really the oldest affiliation for the united states this strong relationship with europe .
i think it continues to remain strong and will remain strong from administration to administration .
that said , the rise of asia and major new world powers in asia such as china and india is getting a lot of attention in the united states .
and it is getting a lot of attention in europe .
germany 's economic recovery is heavily driven by exports to asia , so it is not surprising that both in europe and in the united states there is a lot of discussion about asia and ties toward asia .
that is to say , how can meet the rise of new great powers in asia and how can we turn the rise of those great powers and the economic growth and the economic engine that asia is right now literally pulling the world out of recession , how can we turn that so that it is an opportunity for greater peace and prosperity for the world as a whole .
i think that 's the task in asia and it is something that europeans and americans should be working on together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.12.2010 rise of electric cars prompt ' smart ' electrical grids in portugal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nissan leaf will launch in portugal in january portugal ’ s long-term target of 750,000 electric cars fits with its smart energy plans .
already , the country has 40 percent of its energy coming from renewable sources . the launch in portugal in january of nissan 's leaf marks the start of the rollout in europe of what the company says is the first 100 percent electric car aimed at a mass market .
nissan targeted portugal - where it will also soon be assembling batteries for the leaf - after that country 's government agreed to setting up a national network of charging points .
in fact , the network is to be compatible with any make of electric car , and is part of still more ambitious long-term plans for a genuinely " smart grid " that could help portugal make fuller use of its fast-expanding renewable energy capacity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government wants to expand its network of charging stations in early december , amid ultra-modern architecture at the former site of the expo 98 world fair in lisbon , members of the portuguese public got the chance to test drive the leaf .
portuguese consumers are curious about electric cars comments ranged from the polite to the enthusiastic , with the lack of engine noise the most obvious characteristic of what at first glance looks like a regular five-seater family run-around .
but the very lack of engine noise creates some new " problems . "
" for instance , the headlamps have a specific design to avoid air going to the mirrors , " said antónio joaquim , the communications director of nissan iberia portugal .
" the exterior mirrors on a normal car produce a lot of noise with the wind .
but on this car , which does n't make any noise from the engine , all the very small noises that on other cars are not perceptible are - let 's say , uncomfortable . "
the more obvious matter of charging the car seems straightforward : a small panel on the bonnet opens to reveal something rather similar to an ordinary electric plug .
" if you want to charge when you are parking inside a garage in your own house or in a shopping centre , it 's better to have it on the bonnet , " joaquim added .
" it 's a completely different usage from a combustion engine .
you just charge the car during your daily life . "
charging stations are scarce for now , but are expected to increase there are two charging options : a partial quick charge , for example when you are on the motorway and do not want to stop for long , or a cheaper slow charge of up to eight hours .
prospective buyers in lisbon seemed to take the limitations of electric cars on board .
" it 's a nice car , and a good prospect for someone like me who has an urban life , and drives about 30 or 40 kilometres to work and back , " said one man , who declined to give his name .
the innovative design of the leaf 's lithium batteries means that you can drive the car for longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotor 's editor thinks that the european car of the year jury missed out on the prius but even a fully-charged leaf has a more limited range than a car with a full fuel tank .
so the fact that it recently was named european car of the year - the first completely electric vehicle to do so - raised some eyebrows .
antónio pereira , editor of portuguese car magazine automotor , told deutsche welle he suspected the competition 's jury may have been anxious not to miss a trick , having previously failed to garland the first version of the toyota prius , which later became a hit .
the nissan leaf is , he said , an interesting experiment , and portugal a suitably small testing ground , but with some problems .
" recharging stations are still few -lsb- in number -rsb- and mainly in the big cities , " he said .
" and in portugal we mainly live in apartments .
so either you have a parking space in your building or you have to recharge at night in the public recharging station .
that 's complicated because there wo n't be one for each . "
portugal pushing for dynmaic energy flow in its ' smart grid ' still , the spread of on-street charging points in portugal is the reason the leaf is getting its european launch in the country .
the government-led mobi.e consortium is installing 1,300 chargers around the country , compatible with all makes of car .
in addition , the state is offering a 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- subsidy for buyers of electric cars - bringing the leaf 's price down to 30,000 euro - and a road-tax exemption .
portugal 's ambitious declared long-term target of 750,000 electric vehicles on its roads also fits with plans to expand its renewable energy output , going some way to addressing sceptics ' argument that electric cars ' environmental impact depends on where their power comes from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government is subsidizing the purchase price of electric cars " we have defined as a target to be the first country to have a nationwide and comprehensive infrastructure for vehicles and to work to give the necessary framework and incentives so that we can massively introduce the electric vehicle , " luís reis of mobi.e explained at a trade fair earlier this year .
" this is important not only in terms of the sustainability of mobility but also in terms of the strategy that we have for energy . "
portuguese society has high reliance on renewable sources portugal - for decades heavily reliant on imported oil for its energy needs - now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables , and rising .
and officials overseeing the development of the electric grid envision a future in which drivers will actually be able to profit from helping ensure that same energy is used efficiently , when electric cars have full internet capability .
" you drive it home in the evening , plug -lsb- it in to -rsb- both internet and power , and the car starts receiving signals of electricity spot prices , " antónio vidigal , a director of privatised utility edp , one of the mobi.e partners , told a conference on climate change earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables " at night the price is low ; the car will charge overnight , " vidigal went on .
" next day you come to office , plug again into both plugs .
peak time energy will be expensive and the car may sell energy back to the network . "
as in many countries , hydro-electric dams in portugal already store excess energy from wind farms ; this is used to pump water uphill , to be used to generate power when demand is high .
now the groundwork is being laid for a smart grid that could see cars playing a similar role .
as the first step in what is to be a nationwide programme , edp in 2010 made évora in the alentejo , a city with a population of some 50,000 , the first " inovcity " in the future national " inovgrid . "
" consumers have access almost to real-time information as to their energy consumption , so they 'll be able to manage that better , " explained miguel andrade , a director of edp distribuição , the group 's distribution unit .
" from the company 's side obviously we hope to have operational efficiencies from this .
we hope to integrate more renewables , more micro-generation and eventually in the medium to long-term also the electric vehicle into the grid .
" i think we 're genuinely witnessing a revolution in the way we manage distribution networks . "
nissan investing in portugal but if it 's early days for integrating cars into this vision , what of today 's models ?
the leaf on show in lisbon can not , slot into a smart grid .
but , he said , the model is easily adapted .
" we are implementing the electric vehicles now , so we have to be cost efficient otherwise people would not buy them , " said antónio joaquim , nissan portugal communications director .
" that is why the cars do n't have this and the grid does n't have this capabilities .
" but from the utility 's point of view the technology is already known , from the car industry the technology is already known , so i do n't think that is a very difficult thing to implement later on .
it 's a question of software . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal has already begun rolling out electrical charging stations the leaf itself can already communicate with the charging point : identifying itself and its charging specifications and needs , as well as its owner - who will after all be paying for the power as part of the electricity bill sent to his home .
some environmentalists see models such as the leaf as primarily a public relations exercise for manufacturers that still devote most of their investment to conventional models .
nissan 's own projections for electric cars do not go beyond 10 percent of total sales .
but given that the company is building factories in japan , the us and the uk dedicated to making the leaf - and which it would be difficult and expensive to convert to make other cars - the company is perhaps not the prime target for such accusations .
" everybody in the automotive business is trying to do their own ' greenwash ' , promising ' green ' products - and most are less polluting than before , but not that green , " said antónio pereira , editor of automotor .
" i think nissan is probably taking a lot of risks with the electric car but it 's not doing greenwash - not at all . "

an anarchist group has claimed responsibility . a group of italian anarchists claimed responsibility on thursday for two parcel bomb explosions at foreign embassies in rome , according to italian media reports .
two people were injured by two separate package bombs that exploded at the swiss and chilean embassies in rome earlier on thursday , prompting police to conduct checks at all the embassies in the italian capital .
the first incident occurred around midday at the swiss embassy , when a bomb exploded in the mailroom as an employee opened it .
reports said the 53-year-old man was taken to a hospital in central rome and risks the amputation of one or both of his hands , but that his life was not in danger .
three hours later an employee at the chilean embassy was lightly injured after opening the second package bomb .
anarchists claim responsibility the ansa news agency reported that a group calling itself the informal federation of anarchy -lrb- fai -rrb- had written a note claiming the blasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police were checking embassies across rome after the explosions " we have decided to make our voice heard with words and deeds .
let us destroy the system of domination .
long live the fai , " said the statement , found near the site of one of the bombings .
the fai is well known to italian authorities .
in 2010 , intelligence services referred to the group in a statement to parliament as italy 's " main national terrorist threat of an anarchist-insurrectionist type . "
police sweep rome 's embassies ansa reported thursday that police conducted sweeps at all the embassies in rome .
a suspicious package at the ukrainian embassy was first thought to be another bomb , but police later said it was a false alarm .
thursday 's bombs followed the discovery of a crude device designed like an explosive on an empty subway car in rome on tuesday . tests later showed that the device had no detonator and contained no explosives .
chilean foreign minister alfredo moreno condemned the blast in the chilean embassy , calling it " an act of terrorism " and " cowardly . "
he added that the bomb had been adressed to a cultural association , where it severely injured the hands , face and abdomen of cesar mella , a chilean citizen .
suspected connection to greece italy 's interior minister roberto maroni said on a television talk show that he thought a suspected connection to similar bombings in greece last month was the " right track . "
" greece , italy and spain have seen the presence of anarcho-insurrectionalist groups that are tightly linked , " he said .
" they are very violent . "
last month 14 package bombs were discovered at various embassies across athens and in transit to places abroad , including one sent to the chancellery in berlin .
the package , which arrived on a day when chancellor angela merkel was not in berlin , was identified as being suspicious during a routine check at the chancellery 's mail center .
the bomb did not go off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of 14 parcel bombs discovered last month was sent to the german chancellory greek police believed the attacks were connected to a left-wing militant organization , and arrested six people on suspicion of being connected to the group .
a greek police official said he had not yet received any request for help from italian police .
no likely connection to jihadist groups analysts said while the parcel bombings in greece and italy may have been similar , there were not necessarily any direct connections .
" given the similarities with the recent parcel bombs in greece following anti-austerity protests , this could be a copycat incident by domestic activists , " said samantha wolreich , a european risk analyst at the uk-based advisory firm ake .

an anarchist group has claimed responsibility . a group of italian anarchists claimed responsibility on thursday for two parcel bomb explosions at foreign embassies in rome , according to italian media reports .
two people were injured by two separate package bombs that exploded at the swiss and chilean embassies in rome earlier on thursday , prompting police to conduct checks at all the embassies in the italian capital .
the first incident occurred around midday at the swiss embassy , when a bomb exploded in the mailroom as an employee opened it .
reports said the 53-year-old man was taken to a hospital in central rome and risks the amputation of one or both of his hands , but that his life was not in danger .
three hours later an employee at the chilean embassy was lightly injured after opening the second package bomb .
anarchists claim responsibility the ansa news agency reported that a group calling itself the informal federation of anarchy -lrb- fai -rrb- had written a note claiming the blasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police were checking embassies across rome after the explosions " we have decided to make our voice heard with words and deeds .
let us destroy the system of domination .
long live the fai , " said the statement , found near the site of one of the bombings .
the fai is well known to italian authorities .
in 2010 , intelligence services referred to the group in a statement to parliament as italy 's " main national terrorist threat of an anarchist-insurrectionist type . "
police sweep rome 's embassies ansa reported thursday that police conducted sweeps at all the embassies in rome .
a suspicious package at the ukrainian embassy was first thought to be another bomb , but police later said it was a false alarm .
thursday 's bombs followed the discovery of a crude device designed like an explosive on an empty subway car in rome on tuesday . tests later showed that the device had no detonator and contained no explosives .
chilean foreign minister alfredo moreno condemned the blast in the chilean embassy , calling it " an act of terrorism " and " cowardly . "
he added that the bomb had been adressed to a cultural association , where it severely injured the hands , face and abdomen of cesar mella , a chilean citizen .
suspected connection to greece italy 's interior minister roberto maroni said on a television talk show that he thought a suspected connection to similar bombings in greece last month was the " right track . "
" greece , italy and spain have seen the presence of anarcho-insurrectionalist groups that are tightly linked , " he said .
" they are very violent . "
last month 14 package bombs were discovered at various embassies across athens and in transit to places abroad , including one sent to the chancellery in berlin .
the package , which arrived on a day when chancellor angela merkel was not in berlin , was identified as being suspicious during a routine check at the chancellery 's mail center .
the bomb did not go off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of 14 parcel bombs discovered last month was sent to the german chancellory greek police believed the attacks were connected to a left-wing militant organization , and arrested six people on suspicion of being connected to the group .
a greek police official said he had not yet received any request for help from italian police .
no likely connection to jihadist groups analysts said while the parcel bombings in greece and italy may have been similar , there were not necessarily any direct connections .
" given the similarities with the recent parcel bombs in greece following anti-austerity protests , this could be a copycat incident by domestic activists , " said samantha wolreich , a european risk analyst at the uk-based advisory firm ake .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.12.2010 rise of electric cars prompt ' smart ' electrical grids in portugal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nissan leaf will launch in portugal in january portugal ’ s long-term target of 750,000 electric cars fits with its smart energy plans .
already , the country has 40 percent of its energy coming from renewable sources . the launch in portugal in january of nissan 's leaf marks the start of the rollout in europe of what the company says is the first 100 percent electric car aimed at a mass market .
nissan targeted portugal - where it will also soon be assembling batteries for the leaf - after that country 's government agreed to setting up a national network of charging points .
in fact , the network is to be compatible with any make of electric car , and is part of still more ambitious long-term plans for a genuinely " smart grid " that could help portugal make fuller use of its fast-expanding renewable energy capacity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government wants to expand its network of charging stations in early december , amid ultra-modern architecture at the former site of the expo 98 world fair in lisbon , members of the portuguese public got the chance to test drive the leaf .
portuguese consumers are curious about electric cars comments ranged from the polite to the enthusiastic , with the lack of engine noise the most obvious characteristic of what at first glance looks like a regular five-seater family run-around .
but the very lack of engine noise creates some new " problems . "
" for instance , the headlamps have a specific design to avoid air going to the mirrors , " said antónio joaquim , the communications director of nissan iberia portugal .
" the exterior mirrors on a normal car produce a lot of noise with the wind .
but on this car , which does n't make any noise from the engine , all the very small noises that on other cars are not perceptible are - let 's say , uncomfortable . "
the more obvious matter of charging the car seems straightforward : a small panel on the bonnet opens to reveal something rather similar to an ordinary electric plug .
" if you want to charge when you are parking inside a garage in your own house or in a shopping centre , it 's better to have it on the bonnet , " joaquim added .
" it 's a completely different usage from a combustion engine .
you just charge the car during your daily life . "
charging stations are scarce for now , but are expected to increase there are two charging options : a partial quick charge , for example when you are on the motorway and do not want to stop for long , or a cheaper slow charge of up to eight hours .
prospective buyers in lisbon seemed to take the limitations of electric cars on board .
" it 's a nice car , and a good prospect for someone like me who has an urban life , and drives about 30 or 40 kilometres to work and back , " said one man , who declined to give his name .
the innovative design of the leaf 's lithium batteries means that you can drive the car for longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotor 's editor thinks that the european car of the year jury missed out on the prius but even a fully-charged leaf has a more limited range than a car with a full fuel tank .
so the fact that it recently was named european car of the year - the first completely electric vehicle to do so - raised some eyebrows .
antónio pereira , editor of portuguese car magazine automotor , told deutsche welle he suspected the competition 's jury may have been anxious not to miss a trick , having previously failed to garland the first version of the toyota prius , which later became a hit .
the nissan leaf is , he said , an interesting experiment , and portugal a suitably small testing ground , but with some problems .
" recharging stations are still few -lsb- in number -rsb- and mainly in the big cities , " he said .
" and in portugal we mainly live in apartments .
so either you have a parking space in your building or you have to recharge at night in the public recharging station .
that 's complicated because there wo n't be one for each . "
portugal pushing for dynmaic energy flow in its ' smart grid ' still , the spread of on-street charging points in portugal is the reason the leaf is getting its european launch in the country .
the government-led mobi.e consortium is installing 1,300 chargers around the country , compatible with all makes of car .
in addition , the state is offering a 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- subsidy for buyers of electric cars - bringing the leaf 's price down to 30,000 euro - and a road-tax exemption .
portugal 's ambitious declared long-term target of 750,000 electric vehicles on its roads also fits with plans to expand its renewable energy output , going some way to addressing sceptics ' argument that electric cars ' environmental impact depends on where their power comes from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government is subsidizing the purchase price of electric cars " we have defined as a target to be the first country to have a nationwide and comprehensive infrastructure for vehicles and to work to give the necessary framework and incentives so that we can massively introduce the electric vehicle , " luís reis of mobi.e explained at a trade fair earlier this year .
" this is important not only in terms of the sustainability of mobility but also in terms of the strategy that we have for energy . "
portuguese society has high reliance on renewable sources portugal - for decades heavily reliant on imported oil for its energy needs - now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables , and rising .
and officials overseeing the development of the electric grid envision a future in which drivers will actually be able to profit from helping ensure that same energy is used efficiently , when electric cars have full internet capability .
" you drive it home in the evening , plug -lsb- it in to -rsb- both internet and power , and the car starts receiving signals of electricity spot prices , " antónio vidigal , a director of privatised utility edp , one of the mobi.e partners , told a conference on climate change earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables " at night the price is low ; the car will charge overnight , " vidigal went on .
" next day you come to office , plug again into both plugs .
peak time energy will be expensive and the car may sell energy back to the network . "
as in many countries , hydro-electric dams in portugal already store excess energy from wind farms ; this is used to pump water uphill , to be used to generate power when demand is high .
now the groundwork is being laid for a smart grid that could see cars playing a similar role .
as the first step in what is to be a nationwide programme , edp in 2010 made évora in the alentejo , a city with a population of some 50,000 , the first " inovcity " in the future national " inovgrid . "
" consumers have access almost to real-time information as to their energy consumption , so they 'll be able to manage that better , " explained miguel andrade , a director of edp distribuição , the group 's distribution unit .
" from the company 's side obviously we hope to have operational efficiencies from this .
we hope to integrate more renewables , more micro-generation and eventually in the medium to long-term also the electric vehicle into the grid .
" i think we 're genuinely witnessing a revolution in the way we manage distribution networks . "
nissan investing in portugal but if it 's early days for integrating cars into this vision , what of today 's models ?
the leaf on show in lisbon can not , slot into a smart grid .
but , he said , the model is easily adapted .
" we are implementing the electric vehicles now , so we have to be cost efficient otherwise people would not buy them , " said antónio joaquim , nissan portugal communications director .
" that is why the cars do n't have this and the grid does n't have this capabilities .
" but from the utility 's point of view the technology is already known , from the car industry the technology is already known , so i do n't think that is a very difficult thing to implement later on .
it 's a question of software . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal has already begun rolling out electrical charging stations the leaf itself can already communicate with the charging point : identifying itself and its charging specifications and needs , as well as its owner - who will after all be paying for the power as part of the electricity bill sent to his home .
some environmentalists see models such as the leaf as primarily a public relations exercise for manufacturers that still devote most of their investment to conventional models .
nissan 's own projections for electric cars do not go beyond 10 percent of total sales .
but given that the company is building factories in japan , the us and the uk dedicated to making the leaf - and which it would be difficult and expensive to convert to make other cars - the company is perhaps not the prime target for such accusations .
" everybody in the automotive business is trying to do their own ' greenwash ' , promising ' green ' products - and most are less polluting than before , but not that green , " said antónio pereira , editor of automotor .
" i think nissan is probably taking a lot of risks with the electric car but it 's not doing greenwash - not at all . "

if the trend of german shoppers continues , good business could continue after the holidays as well . a lot of german kids are going to think santa was especially generous this year when they open their christmas presents .
even the adults are likely to notice a few more presents under the tree as in 2009 .
according to the german retail association , germans have n't spent as much money on gifts during a holiday season since 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there may be a few more gifts under german trees for november and december , the association estimates total revenues of 77 billion euro -lrb- $ 101 billion -rrb- for the retail sector - 2.5 percent more than last year .
" people have n't let the chaotic winter ruin their shopping plans , " stefan genth , head of the trade union hde , told deutsche welle .
genth says that the economic crisis in germany was over surprisingly quickly .
germans saved money during the year in order to be able to afford something special for christmas , such as a nice watch or jewelry .
at the top of many christmas lists in snowy germany are winter sports items , such as sleds , skis , or ice skates .
warm winter clothes are also in high demand .
in many stores , supply of sleds and snow shovels is running low .
the demand for gloves is sometimes twice what retailers have in stock. ipads and inscriptions if a christmas wish is not snow-related , then there 's a good chance it has to do with staying inside and avoiding it .
electronic devices , including video and computer games are sought-after items as well .
in an interview with the french news agency afp , august-wilhelm scheer , head of the electronic branch 's bitkom association , said the electronic branch was " very satisfied " with their holiday business , and that it was " significantly better " than last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ipads are in high demand the high-tech gadget of the year is without a doubt the ipad .
it and other tablet-pcs have established themselves as a new class among laptop computers .
according to bitkom , around 450,000 tablet-pcs were sold in 2010 .
sales for online retailers are experiencing a boom like never before as well .
many germans want to give personalized gifts , but they do n't always have the time to take care of it themselves .
instead , they take care of a special gift with a few clicks of the mouse .
claudia helming is the head of dawanda , an online marketplace for handmade products that opened in 2006 in berlin .
she says customized jewelry , such as a silver necklace engraved with a name or a phrase , is quite popular .
dawanda gets about 30,000 orders per day - more than twice as many as last year .
trend continues past christmas while some germans go for the one-of-a-kind gifts , many others go completely generic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snow and cold kept people out of christmas markets recent studies indicate that every second present that will be opened on christmas eve is a gift certificate .
hde 's stefan genth says most of the gift certificates will be cashed in during the week between christmas and new year 's eve , making him optimistic that the booming retail business in germany will continue past the holidays .
he also expects that many people will carry out planned shopping sprees that had to be put off because of bad weather .
while the retail sector seems to have come through germany 's early winter quite well , the opposite is true for businesses operating at germany 's christmas markets .
the exceptionally cold weather and snowfall meant that many people opted to stay home instead of patronizing the stalls of the christmas market .
unlike holiday shopping sprees , a trip to the christmas market can not be pushed back a few weeks : after december 23 , the german christmas markets close up shop until next year .

according to the german retail association , germans have n't spent as much money on gifts during a holiday season since 2005 .

" people have n't let the chaotic winter ruin their shopping plans , " stefan genth , head of the trade union hde , told deutsche welle .
genth says that the economic crisis in germany was over surprisingly quickly .
germans saved money during the year in order to be able to afford something special for christmas , such as a nice watch or jewelry .

the effect is a slump in retail sales and restaurant closures . the party is over for many in ireland , and this christmas retailers and restaurateurs have been bearing the brunt of cutbacks . irish people are spending less and staying in more , with a recent survey finding that almost 80 percent of firms did not pay for or effectively canceled the staff christmas party this year .
ireland 's holiday frugality has hit the restaurant sector badly , which is already struggling in the recession .
the restaurant association of ireland says it 's been a very tight christmas and 2011 is looking bleak .
" business has dropped by about 40 percent for the first two weeks of december and we do n't see any uptake at the moment , " said adrian cummins , ceo of the restaurant association .
" people are tightening their belts and they 're not spending on luxury items and goods and unfortunately the restaurant industry is part of that sector that has been hit by cutbacks . "
one restaurant per day statistics show one restaurant per day is closing in ireland , 80 percent of restaurants are running at a loss , and about 21,000 thousand jobs are at risk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diners in restaurants keep an eye on the price cummins says christmas is a critical time of year for restaurants - making up almost a quarter of their annual income .
but he says people are choosing to stay at home and if they do go out , they 're dining in cheaper eateries .
" people may be not going for the high-end christmas lunch and people are looking at how much they spend when they actually go out for their christmas parties , " said cummins .
" ireland -lsb- is -rsb- a sociable nation .
we like to go out and eat out and drink as well but -lsb- spending in restaurants -rsb- is considerably down . "
deals not decadence for retailers the story is n't much better .
sales have slumped an average of 20 percent .
shoppers on the streets of dublin city centre say they 've been cutting back on food and presents or shopping online .
" we 'd go a bit further for the grandchildren , " says one woman in dublin , " we 're not doing that this year .
we 're more or less looking for sale stuff because we do n't what ahead of us basically " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are taking their euros north there 's been a rise in cross-border shopping with more people heading to northern ireland to take advantage of cheaper prices there , as well .
the latest study by aa ireland says 1 in 20 motorists will head north over the festive season .
torlach denihan , the director of retail ireland , says stores in the republic of ireland are working to battle the cross-border competition .
" currently cross-border shopping is not a significant issue , " he said .
" it was an enormous issue for the retail sector 12 or 18 months ago , but at the moment it does n't really figure .
the reason for that is retailers have cut their prices in ireland and they 're in a better place to compete with the counterparts in the north . "
keeping business , keeping jobs a survey by ebay has found over 50 percent of irish consumers will shop online over the christmas and new year period as families try and make their euros stretch further .
this is already impacting shops which are trying to survive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many business have been forced to close up shop denihan estimates that 47,000 people have so far lost their jobs in the retail sector since the recession hit ireland " in a country like ireland with a population of 4.4 million and a workforce of just over 2 million , 47,000 jobs is very significant , " he said .
" there are people who 've lost jobs in every part of ireland .
in every community , retail employment has been hit . "
a looming general election and the implementation of stringent budgetary measures in the new year will no doubt have an impact on the spending habits of the irish people .
but the real challenge facing the retail and restaurant sector will be staying open and staying in business .

sales figures for the title into the holiday season show no signs of slowing down . thilo sarrazin 's contentious book with grim predictions for the future of germany is number one on the year 's non-fiction bestseller list , according to records published by der spiegel .
since the release of " germany is doing away with itself " in late august , author sarrazin has made headlines for claiming that the combination of germany 's low birth-rate and immigration and social welfare policies are leading the country toward " a nightmare . "
with chapter titles like " immigration and integration - expect more , offer less " and " demographics and population politics - more children from the intelligent before it 's too late , " the book was sure to spark conflict .
chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly condemned sarrazin .
in comments made shortly after the book 's publication , she said , " his word choice , his means of expression , the stereotyping of entire groups , the exclusion and hatefulness : it 's unacceptable .
and it is n't going to lead to any solutions . "
but neither public criticism nor the holiday season have put a damper on the book 's sales .
it remains at the top of der spiegel 's current weekly bestsellers , and a representative from the german publishers ' association told the magazine focus , " we are selling around 10,000 copies a day at the moment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's criticism has been directed especially at muslims and jews notoriety and fallout the book 's soaring numbers bring its total sales to around 1.3 million copies .
although the controversial title has made sarrazin a millionaire , it has also led to a number of negative consequences for the former politician and banking official .
in early september , he complied with requests from officials including president christian wulff to step down from his position on the executive board of germany 's federal bank after initially refusing to withdraw voluntarily from his office .

sales figures for the title into the holiday season show no signs of slowing down . thilo sarrazin 's contentious book with grim predictions for the future of germany is number one on the year 's non-fiction bestseller list , according to records published by der spiegel .
since the release of " germany is doing away with itself " in late august , author sarrazin has made headlines for claiming that the combination of germany 's low birth-rate and immigration and social welfare policies are leading the country toward " a nightmare . "
with chapter titles like " immigration and integration - expect more , offer less " and " demographics and population politics - more children from the intelligent before it 's too late , " the book was sure to spark conflict .
chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly condemned sarrazin .
in comments made shortly after the book 's publication , she said , " his word choice , his means of expression , the stereotyping of entire groups , the exclusion and hatefulness : it 's unacceptable .
and it is n't going to lead to any solutions . "
but neither public criticism nor the holiday season have put a damper on the book 's sales .
it remains at the top of der spiegel 's current weekly bestsellers , and a representative from the german publishers ' association told the magazine focus , " we are selling around 10,000 copies a day at the moment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's criticism has been directed especially at muslims and jews notoriety and fallout the book 's soaring numbers bring its total sales to around 1.3 million copies .
although the controversial title has made sarrazin a millionaire , it has also led to a number of negative consequences for the former politician and banking official .
in early september , he complied with requests from officials including president christian wulff to step down from his position on the executive board of germany 's federal bank after initially refusing to withdraw voluntarily from his office .
" that was n't easy for me , " sarrazin said of the decision .
" i considered going head-to-head with the entire political class in germany , but no one can hold out in that situation for long . "
more recent editions of the book have also seen changes in some of the most incendiary passages of the book .

accreditation has been withdrawn from the country 's previous ambassador , alcide djedje , who was appointed by incumbent president laurent gbagbo .

ouattara was initially declared the winner by the country 's electoral commission and has been recognized as the rightful president in the international community .
the west african economic union -lrb- ecowas -rrb- announced on thursday that its central bank was blocking funds to gbagbo , and access would only be given to ouattara 's " legitimate government . "
leaders from ecowas are meeting on friday for emergency talks on ivory coast .

but when it comes to christmas , some old habits are reluctant to die . many years ago , back in the days when berlin was new to me and latte macchiato had yet to be imported to prenzlauer berg 's kastanienallee , i remember christmas being a quiet and even gentle affair .
seasons greetings were not splashed across the fronts of thousands of garish cards , nor were they blasted from brass bands at shoppers too busy hunting down their must-haves of the year to stop and lend an ear .
christmas trees were rarely seen in advance of the first advent and their decorations consisted almost entirely of straw stars on skinny red string .
that same year , i received a parcel from england containing presents wrapped in stylish paper .

and there are plenty who would say just that .
the other side of christmas but i 'd argue that such a complaint is too black and white .

we arrived in plenty of time , only to find that there was no room .
the place was even more packed than that sprawling bookstore a little way down the road .
we tried st. hedwig 's cathedral , but could n't get in there either .
the irony of being turned away on christmas eve was not lost on us , but we did what others have clearly done before us and kept on looking .
and in our case we did n't need a bed for the night , just somewhere to stand for the duration of the service .
we tramped on to two other churches before we found a corner in the marienkirche into which we could settle .

her freedom once again raised hopes for reforms in myanmar , also known as burma .
the country has been under military rule since 1962 .
ever since her release , aung san suu kyi has been very active , giving media interviews and meeting with members of her national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- , amid regional calls for her to play a greater role to bridge the gap between the military and the pro-democracy opposition .
only a first step while most people welcomed aung san suu kyi ’ s release , some activists , such as soe aung of the forum for democracy in burma , say it was just a partial step towards reforms and a dialogue .
" you may call it progress on that front , " soe aung told deutsche welle .
" but do not forget about the remaining 2,200 political prisoners .
there is no progress at all in their situation .
releasing aung san suu kyi is not enough .
the military regime has to respond to the calls of aung san suu kyi for a dialogue as soon as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military regime held elections for the first time in twenty years in 2010 the elections in november , widely considered by the international community as fraudulent , are expected now to be followed by the formation of a civilian government , which will include a president , and the appointment of regional administrators .
debbie stothardt , the spokesperson for the rights group alternative asean network , is very cautious .
" 2011 is going to be more uncertain than 2010 .
we have aung san suu kyi freed but we are not sure for how long , and there are increasing restrictions on people having access to her or media covering her statements and activities .
we have also seen more foreigners blacklisted and deported from burma since aung san suu kyi ’ s release . "
minorities form alliance keunsai , who uses only one name , is the director of the shan herald news agency , which focuses on issues related to myanmar 's shan ethnic minority group .
he says the junta has a delicate balancing act ahead .

her freedom once again raised hopes for reforms in myanmar , also known as burma .
the country has been under military rule since 1962 .
ever since her release , aung san suu kyi has been very active , giving media interviews and meeting with members of her national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- , amid regional calls for her to play a greater role to bridge the gap between the military and the pro-democracy opposition .
only a first step while most people welcomed aung san suu kyi ’ s release , some activists , such as soe aung of the forum for democracy in burma , say it was just a partial step towards reforms and a dialogue .
" you may call it progress on that front , " soe aung told deutsche welle .
" but do not forget about the remaining 2,200 political prisoners .
there is no progress at all in their situation .
releasing aung san suu kyi is not enough .
the military regime has to respond to the calls of aung san suu kyi for a dialogue as soon as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military regime held elections for the first time in twenty years in 2010 the elections in november , widely considered by the international community as fraudulent , are expected now to be followed by the formation of a civilian government , which will include a president , and the appointment of regional administrators .
debbie stothardt , the spokesperson for the rights group alternative asean network , is very cautious .
" 2011 is going to be more uncertain than 2010 .
we have aung san suu kyi freed but we are not sure for how long , and there are increasing restrictions on people having access to her or media covering her statements and activities .
we have also seen more foreigners blacklisted and deported from burma since aung san suu kyi ’ s release . "

after her death , her pakistan people 's party won the elections , and her widowed husband asif ali zardari eventually became the president of pakistan .
however , more than two years after the ppp came into power , there has n't been much progress on benazir bhutto 's murder case , which is still shrouded in mystery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president zardari and premier gilani of the ppp have been in power for more than two years " wider parameters " veteran politician and ppp senator taj haider refutes the allegations that the government has not done much to uncover bhutto 's murderers .
" it was a very big controversy that resulted in benazir 's murder .
we want to be on the right track , and we want to conduct the investigation on scientific lines .
in the first place we involved the united nations so that the wider parameters of the conspiracy behind her murder would be determined .
within those parameters , the un has pointed to certain directions , and now we are proceeding in that direction , " haider told deutsche welle .
the recent arrest of two ex-police officials of the rawalpindi police , saud aziz and khurram shehzad , who were responsible for the security of bhutto , is being hailed by the government as a great success .
according to the public prosecutor chaudhry zulfiqar , the two ex-cops have disclosed the names of four or five high-ranking army officials belonging to pakistan 's spy agency , the inter-services intelligence -lrb- isi -rrb- , with whom they claim to have contact .
but political analysts doubt whether the government could do anything against the omnipotent isi .
" the civilian government is completely powerless when it comes to the army and the isi , as we have seen so many times before .
there is a huge cover-up , there is a lot that does n't meet the eye , " said journalist kamran shafi of pakistan 's leading english daily dawn in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of bhutto burn a police vehicle and a bus after bhutto 's murder the isi ' connection ' taj haider maintains the government is capable of bringing the culprits to justice irrespective of their institutional links .
he does not blame the isi as an institution .
" there are intelligence agencies within intelligence agencies , and there are parallel intelligence agencies as well .
some retired isi officers have made their own setups , and through these setups they are still propagating the same ideology of religious extremism that resulted in benazir bhutto 's death . "
a united nations commission , set up to investigate bhutto 's murder on the request of the ppp government , revealed in its detailed report earlier this year that the security arrangements for bhutto were seriously inadequate , and that some security agencies tried to hinder the initial investigations .
although the government considers the un report to be an extremely important document , critics believe the government has not yet implemented the commission 's recommendations .
musharraf 's ' questionnaire ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pervez musharraf was the president at the time of bhutto 's murder another aspect of the case is the role of former military ruler pervez musharraf .
the government is under immense pressure to bring musharraf back to pakistan from england , where he is living in self-imposed exile .
but kamran shafi does not see that happen any time soon .
" all we know so far is that the government has sent him a questionnaire .
this is the second time we are hearing that .
musharraf said he never received such a questionnaire .
but the actual point is that he was the president and the military dictator at that time .
he may not be involved personally in ordering the assassination , but certainly the responsibility rests on his shoulders , " said shafi .
the government has planned several functions to commemorate the third death anniversary of its ' martyred ' leader on december 27 .
but this might not be enough to satisfy the party workers as well as the government 's critics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer affairs -pipe- 24.12.2010 economists flag indebted underclass problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debt problems are increasing amongst german consumers private debt is becoming a problem that some germans can not escape .
a recent study shows that women and young people under 30 are sliding particularly quickly into the red . about 6.5 million germans are currently struggling with debt – that 's almost 10 percent of the adult population .
this year alone saw 290,000 new debtors join their ranks with average liabilities of 35,000 euros .
as a result , the number of private insolvencies in germany is expected to rise 11 percent this year .
it 's the first time since 2007 that the number of people falling into debt has risen , according to a study by creditreform , a business information service specializing in risk and debt analysis .
" the increase in over-indebtedness is a delayed reaction to the economic crisis , " michael bretz , creditreform 's head of the economic research , told deutsche welle .
one of the most worrying trends is a rise in the number of young people with money problems .
the past year saw 54,000 teenagers develop debt problems - an increase of 38 percent on the previous year and the biggest increase among any age group .
bretz puts this down to excessive consumerism .
" young people want to consume more than older ones to compensate for their low status , " bretz said .
young people also do n't fully understand their finances .
according to a recent study by social research company forsa , almost one third of 16 year olds didn ’ t know that it would take longer to pay off a loan of 2000 euro at 50 euro per month as opposed to saving that amount .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bretz worries that ghettos are developing in germany inherited debt bretz believes that people learn financial habits from their parents and warns that a sort of " debt mentality " is being passed on from generation to generation - and that there is a certain part of german society that does n't seem able to manage its money .
" they see that their parents do n't work , how they live with debt status , with their income , and that it is possible , " bretz said .
" their children will inherit this status . "
about two million people in germany are expected to stay in debt for the rest of their lives , he added .
as the german economy picks up , consumers are buying large items on credit again .
as a result , bretz expects the number of people burdened with excessive debt will increase even further .
" we have seen an increase in consumer loans , " bretz said .
" i think people are more relaxed than in the crisis and so they spend more money , especially in these days before christmas . "
a greater variety of payment options , such as paying on store cards , credit cards , over the internet and zero percent finance offers , has increased debt levels in germany .
" most people who come to me have debts at credit institutions , like overdrafts and loans , " thomas kroeger , a debt advisor in engelskirchen told deutsche welle .
" 40 percent owe money to mail order companies and every fifth person has overdue mobile phone bills . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroeger worries that more teenagers are getting in the red divorce and debt women are especially prone to debt problems during separation and divorce because although they often have lower incomes than their partners , they can still be held liable for joint loans or contracts signed when they were together .
diana , an unemployed 26-year-old mother from western germany , racked up 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,970 -rrb- of debt to 14 different creditors after she split up with her boyfriend .
when diana moved into a new flat she bought most of the furniture on credit .
at the time she was earning good money as an office clerk and was able to pay back her installments comfortably .
but then she became unemployed .
" when you lose your job , your world is destroyed and you ask how can i pay for my rent , telephone , electricity and gas ? " she said .
in addition to her furniture , diana is still paying off her bank overdraft , joint mobile phone contracts , insurance , and mail order purchases .
" it 's really dangerous .
when you see zero percent offers on tv , it entices you to buy so much .
and you buy things that you simply do n't need , " she told deutsche welle .
when diana was unable to find a new job , she found herself living off so-called " harz iv " social security payments worth just 323 euros per month .
" at some point i lost track of things and did n't know what i should pay for first , " she said .
" i was getting nasty letters in the post , telling me if you do n't pay , then this and that will happen and the bailiff will come . "
bildunterschrift : many women develop debt problems following divorce or separation a casual attitude to debt diana went to see a debt advisor – a service that 's free of charge in germany if you 're unemployed .
he wrote to all of her creditors , who agreed to halve her debt and free her of interest payments .
she now pays a total of 10 euros per month , which is shared out between her creditors .
it 's a small amount , but one she should always be able to afford , even on the lowest level of benefits .
" if i could do it again , i would save up my money , rather than buy things on credit and take out loans , ” she said .
“ i only use a pay-as-you-go mobile phone now , " she added .
while diana 's debts are now manageable , her partner is almost 20,000 euros in the red and faces private insolvency proceedings .
that means for six years , any income exceeding his basic living expenses will be automatically forfeited to creditors .
after that his debts will be wiped – a chance for a fresh start .
the fact that diana 's partner has a low income means he only pays 40 euros per month to his creditors .
his six years of repayments will amount to just 2,880 euros - an amount diana finds astonishingly low given the size of the original debt .
" it 's laughable really .
it 's like an easy ' alternative way ' to deal with one 's debts .
at the end you can say , that was it , my debts are gone now " .
bretz warns that there 's a danger of people using private insolvency too casually – an easy solution to freeing oneself of debts after overindulging .
" there are more and more people who see this possibility and use it in a very rational way .
they see it as a solution to their debt problems , " bretz said .

a recent study shows that women and young people under 30 are sliding particularly quickly into the red . about 6.5 million germans are currently struggling with debt – that 's almost 10 percent of the adult population .
this year alone saw 290,000 new debtors join their ranks with average liabilities of 35,000 euros .
as a result , the number of private insolvencies in germany is expected to rise 11 percent this year .
it 's the first time since 2007 that the number of people falling into debt has risen , according to a study by creditreform , a business information service specializing in risk and debt analysis .
" the increase in over-indebtedness is a delayed reaction to the economic crisis , " michael bretz , creditreform 's head of the economic research , told deutsche welle .
one of the most worrying trends is a rise in the number of young people with money problems .
the past year saw 54,000 teenagers develop debt problems - an increase of 38 percent on the previous year and the biggest increase among any age group .
bretz puts this down to excessive consumerism .
" young people want to consume more than older ones to compensate for their low status , " bretz said .
young people also do n't fully understand their finances .
according to a recent study by social research company forsa , almost one third of 16 year olds didn ’ t know that it would take longer to pay off a loan of 2000 euro at 50 euro per month as opposed to saving that amount .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bretz worries that ghettos are developing in germany inherited debt bretz believes that people learn financial habits from their parents and warns that a sort of " debt mentality " is being passed on from generation to generation - and that there is a certain part of german society that does n't seem able to manage its money .
" they see that their parents do n't work , how they live with debt status , with their income , and that it is possible , " bretz said .
" their children will inherit this status . "
about two million people in germany are expected to stay in debt for the rest of their lives , he added .
as the german economy picks up , consumers are buying large items on credit again .
as a result , bretz expects the number of people burdened with excessive debt will increase even further .
" we have seen an increase in consumer loans , " bretz said .
" i think people are more relaxed than in the crisis and so they spend more money , especially in these days before christmas . "
a greater variety of payment options , such as paying on store cards , credit cards , over the internet and zero percent finance offers , has increased debt levels in germany .
" most people who come to me have debts at credit institutions , like overdrafts and loans , " thomas kroeger , a debt advisor in engelskirchen told deutsche welle .
" 40 percent owe money to mail order companies and every fifth person has overdue mobile phone bills . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroeger worries that more teenagers are getting in the red divorce and debt women are especially prone to debt problems during separation and divorce because although they often have lower incomes than their partners , they can still be held liable for joint loans or contracts signed when they were together .
diana , an unemployed 26-year-old mother from western germany , racked up 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,970 -rrb- of debt to 14 different creditors after she split up with her boyfriend .
when diana moved into a new flat she bought most of the furniture on credit .
at the time she was earning good money as an office clerk and was able to pay back her installments comfortably .
but then she became unemployed .
" when you lose your job , your world is destroyed and you ask how can i pay for my rent , telephone , electricity and gas ? " she said .
in addition to her furniture , diana is still paying off her bank overdraft , joint mobile phone contracts , insurance , and mail order purchases .

andsnes talked with dw about one program he selected , from which you can hear excerpts below . as pianist in residence with the berlin philharmonic orchestra this season , leif ove andsnes brings a devotion to chamber music that he has maintained alongside an international career as a soloist .
his most recent album of rachmaninov ’ s third and fourth piano concertos with antonio pappano and the london symphony orchestra quickly won widespread critical acclaim .
andsnes spoke to dw about the program he selected for the second concert of his residency in berlin and his upcoming plans .
click below to listen to andsnes and members of the berlin philharmonic live from a concert on december 12 , 2010 .
dw : together with marc-andre hamelin you have performed the four-hand version of stravinsky 's " rite of spring " in risor , brussels , london , new york , and now berlin .
what fascinates you about the piece ?
leif ove andsnes : the " rite of spring " has perhaps more appeal than any other piece of the 20th century .
its energy and rhythms excite people more than any other piece i know .
the harmonies and sheer tension are unbelievable .
it is so iconic that you ca n't imagine someone sitting down and writing it .
stravinsky said himself that he felt like a vessel - that the music just came from somewhere - and he wrote it down very quickly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian composers are in the spotlight this season for the berlin philharmonic why did you choose two of the other pieces in the program , stravinsky 's septet and alfred schnittke 's piano quintet ?
since the philharmonic has a focus on russian music this season , i paired them to show two very different sides of russian music .
the septet was written forty years after the " rite " and shows a giant leap in stravinsky 's language , with the end result very playful and theatrical .
the schnittke , on the other hand , seems born entirely out of an emotional state of grief and sorrow , colored by the death of his mother .
it sometimes sounds like music from the other side , from a different planet .
can you describe your passion for chamber music ?
for me it is the most natural form of music-making , just a few friends coming together to play .
why should it be considered a niche or elitist ?
it is as normal as a rock band gathering in a garage .
just give me a violinist and a cellist , and we can play a trio .
chamber music is also essential in a musician 's development because you have to listen to others and find your place within the landscape of a piece , whether you have the foreground or background .
it 's also a great way to get to know people and a lot of fun .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andsnes will perform with the berlin philharmonic into the summer of 2011 what new projects do you have coming up ?
one thing that will be very much in focus over the next four to five years is beethoven .
having just turned 40 , i feel i 've come to a point in my life where i have to play the greatest , most important music of all .
i will play and record his concertos .
i will also play his sonatas .
what will your personal highlights be as pianist in residence with the berlin philharmonic ?
i ’ m very excited to play brahms 's second piano concerto with bernhard haitink .
i 'll be working with him for the first time .
i ’ m also very much looking forward to a chamber music project in may with students in the orchestra ’ s academy .
we will perform two mozart works and the dvorak piano quintet , a fantastic piece that i played and fell in love with as a student .
what do you hope to get out of the residency with the philharmonic ?
it already feels like i have a base in berlin for this season , which is nice .
in this profession there is a lot of jumping around so you start to want to feel at home in a few places .
and it 's a tremendous experience to play with this fantastic orchestra . what do you like about being in berlin ?
one always has the feeling berlin is on the cutting edge of what 's happening creatively .
i know many freelance musicians who love the way of life here .
it 's absolutely one of the world 's great musical capitals with so many quality orchestras and opera .

seasons greetings were not splashed across the fronts of thousands of garish cards , nor were they blasted from brass bands at shoppers too busy hunting down their must-haves of the year to stop and lend an ear .
christmas trees were rarely seen in advance of the first advent and their decorations consisted almost entirely of straw stars on skinny red string .

the place was even more packed than that sprawling bookstore a little way down the road .
we tried st. hedwig 's cathedral , but could n't get in there either .

her freedom once again raised hopes for reforms in myanmar , also known as burma .
the country has been under military rule since 1962 .
ever since her release , aung san suu kyi has been very active , giving media interviews and meeting with members of her national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- , amid regional calls for her to play a greater role to bridge the gap between the military and the pro-democracy opposition .
only a first step while most people welcomed aung san suu kyi ’ s release , some activists , such as soe aung of the forum for democracy in burma , say it was just a partial step towards reforms and a dialogue .
" you may call it progress on that front , " soe aung told deutsche welle .
" but do not forget about the remaining 2,200 political prisoners .
there is no progress at all in their situation .
releasing aung san suu kyi is not enough .
the military regime has to respond to the calls of aung san suu kyi for a dialogue as soon as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military regime held elections for the first time in twenty years in 2010 the elections in november , widely considered by the international community as fraudulent , are expected now to be followed by the formation of a civilian government , which will include a president , and the appointment of regional administrators .
debbie stothardt , the spokesperson for the rights group alternative asean network , is very cautious .
" 2011 is going to be more uncertain than 2010 .
we have aung san suu kyi freed but we are not sure for how long , and there are increasing restrictions on people having access to her or media covering her statements and activities .
we have also seen more foreigners blacklisted and deported from burma since aung san suu kyi ’ s release . "
minorities form alliance keunsai , who uses only one name , is the director of the shan herald news agency , which focuses on issues related to myanmar 's shan ethnic minority group .
he says the junta has a delicate balancing act ahead .
" the junta is walking on tiptoes right now because it is anxious to show that the country has become a democracy .
so what will happen next depends on both sides : how much the opposition is ready to test the junta 's tolerance , and how much the junta is going to tolerate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi 's supporters celebrate outside her home after her release myanmar ’ s ethnic minorities have also been under pressure this year , with the junta trying to press the minority armed groups to join a border patrol force .
over the past decades , the military has reached several cease-fire agreements with these regional armies .
but brief clashes occurred in the state of karen during november ’ s election , forcing hundreds of karen to seek temporary shelter in thailand .
several of the armed groups have now moved to form a new military alliance .
but myanmar ’ s military has some 400,000 troops against the ethnic armies ’ more than 65,000 troops .
once again , myanmar ’ s disparate communities are now putting their faith in aung san suu kyi and hoping she will be able to negotiate a way to political reform .

andsnes talked with dw about one program he selected , from which you can hear excerpts below . as pianist in residence with the berlin philharmonic orchestra this season , leif ove andsnes brings a devotion to chamber music that he has maintained alongside an international career as a soloist .
his most recent album of rachmaninov ’ s third and fourth piano concertos with antonio pappano and the london symphony orchestra quickly won widespread critical acclaim .
andsnes spoke to dw about the program he selected for the second concert of his residency in berlin and his upcoming plans .
click below to listen to andsnes and members of the berlin philharmonic live from a concert on december 12 , 2010 .
dw : together with marc-andre hamelin you have performed the four-hand version of stravinsky 's " rite of spring " in risor , brussels , london , new york , and now berlin .
what fascinates you about the piece ?
leif ove andsnes : the " rite of spring " has perhaps more appeal than any other piece of the 20th century .
its energy and rhythms excite people more than any other piece i know .
the harmonies and sheer tension are unbelievable .
it is so iconic that you ca n't imagine someone sitting down and writing it .
stravinsky said himself that he felt like a vessel - that the music just came from somewhere - and he wrote it down very quickly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian composers are in the spotlight this season for the berlin philharmonic why did you choose two of the other pieces in the program , stravinsky 's septet and alfred schnittke 's piano quintet ?
since the philharmonic has a focus on russian music this season , i paired them to show two very different sides of russian music .
the septet was written forty years after the " rite " and shows a giant leap in stravinsky 's language , with the end result very playful and theatrical .
the schnittke , on the other hand , seems born entirely out of an emotional state of grief and sorrow , colored by the death of his mother .
it sometimes sounds like music from the other side , from a different planet .
can you describe your passion for chamber music ?
for me it is the most natural form of music-making , just a few friends coming together to play .
why should it be considered a niche or elitist ?
it is as normal as a rock band gathering in a garage .
just give me a violinist and a cellist , and we can play a trio .
chamber music is also essential in a musician 's development because you have to listen to others and find your place within the landscape of a piece , whether you have the foreground or background .
it 's also a great way to get to know people and a lot of fun .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andsnes will perform with the berlin philharmonic into the summer of 2011 what new projects do you have coming up ?
one thing that will be very much in focus over the next four to five years is beethoven .
having just turned 40 , i feel i 've come to a point in my life where i have to play the greatest , most important music of all .
i will play and record his concertos .
i will also play his sonatas .
what will your personal highlights be as pianist in residence with the berlin philharmonic ?
i ’ m very excited to play brahms 's second piano concerto with bernhard haitink .
i 'll be working with him for the first time .
i ’ m also very much looking forward to a chamber music project in may with students in the orchestra ’ s academy .
we will perform two mozart works and the dvorak piano quintet , a fantastic piece that i played and fell in love with as a student .
what do you hope to get out of the residency with the philharmonic ?
it already feels like i have a base in berlin for this season , which is nice .
in this profession there is a lot of jumping around so you start to want to feel at home in a few places .
and it 's a tremendous experience to play with this fantastic orchestra . what do you like about being in berlin ?

andsnes talked with dw about one program he selected , from which you can hear excerpts below . as pianist in residence with the berlin philharmonic orchestra this season , leif ove andsnes brings a devotion to chamber music that he has maintained alongside an international career as a soloist .
his most recent album of rachmaninov ’ s third and fourth piano concertos with antonio pappano and the london symphony orchestra quickly won widespread critical acclaim .
andsnes spoke to dw about the program he selected for the second concert of his residency in berlin and his upcoming plans .
click below to listen to andsnes and members of the berlin philharmonic live from a concert on december 12 , 2010 .
dw : together with marc-andre hamelin you have performed the four-hand version of stravinsky 's " rite of spring " in risor , brussels , london , new york , and now berlin .
what fascinates you about the piece ?
leif ove andsnes : the " rite of spring " has perhaps more appeal than any other piece of the 20th century .
its energy and rhythms excite people more than any other piece i know .
the harmonies and sheer tension are unbelievable .
it is so iconic that you ca n't imagine someone sitting down and writing it .
stravinsky said himself that he felt like a vessel - that the music just came from somewhere - and he wrote it down very quickly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian composers are in the spotlight this season for the berlin philharmonic why did you choose two of the other pieces in the program , stravinsky 's septet and alfred schnittke 's piano quintet ?
since the philharmonic has a focus on russian music this season , i paired them to show two very different sides of russian music .
the septet was written forty years after the " rite " and shows a giant leap in stravinsky 's language , with the end result very playful and theatrical .
the schnittke , on the other hand , seems born entirely out of an emotional state of grief and sorrow , colored by the death of his mother .
it sometimes sounds like music from the other side , from a different planet .
can you describe your passion for chamber music ?
for me it is the most natural form of music-making , just a few friends coming together to play .
why should it be considered a niche or elitist ?
it is as normal as a rock band gathering in a garage .
just give me a violinist and a cellist , and we can play a trio .
chamber music is also essential in a musician 's development because you have to listen to others and find your place within the landscape of a piece , whether you have the foreground or background .
it 's also a great way to get to know people and a lot of fun .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andsnes will perform with the berlin philharmonic into the summer of 2011 what new projects do you have coming up ?
one thing that will be very much in focus over the next four to five years is beethoven .
having just turned 40 , i feel i 've come to a point in my life where i have to play the greatest , most important music of all .

her freedom once again raised hopes for reforms in myanmar , also known as burma .
the country has been under military rule since 1962 .
ever since her release , aung san suu kyi has been very active , giving media interviews and meeting with members of her national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- , amid regional calls for her to play a greater role to bridge the gap between the military and the pro-democracy opposition .
only a first step while most people welcomed aung san suu kyi ’ s release , some activists , such as soe aung of the forum for democracy in burma , say it was just a partial step towards reforms and a dialogue .
" you may call it progress on that front , " soe aung told deutsche welle .
" but do not forget about the remaining 2,200 political prisoners .
there is no progress at all in their situation .
releasing aung san suu kyi is not enough .
the military regime has to respond to the calls of aung san suu kyi for a dialogue as soon as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military regime held elections for the first time in twenty years in 2010 the elections in november , widely considered by the international community as fraudulent , are expected now to be followed by the formation of a civilian government , which will include a president , and the appointment of regional administrators .
debbie stothardt , the spokesperson for the rights group alternative asean network , is very cautious .
" 2011 is going to be more uncertain than 2010 .
we have aung san suu kyi freed but we are not sure for how long , and there are increasing restrictions on people having access to her or media covering her statements and activities .
we have also seen more foreigners blacklisted and deported from burma since aung san suu kyi ’ s release . "
minorities form alliance keunsai , who uses only one name , is the director of the shan herald news agency , which focuses on issues related to myanmar 's shan ethnic minority group .
he says the junta has a delicate balancing act ahead .
" the junta is walking on tiptoes right now because it is anxious to show that the country has become a democracy .
so what will happen next depends on both sides : how much the opposition is ready to test the junta 's tolerance , and how much the junta is going to tolerate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi 's supporters celebrate outside her home after her release myanmar ’ s ethnic minorities have also been under pressure this year , with the junta trying to press the minority armed groups to join a border patrol force .
over the past decades , the military has reached several cease-fire agreements with these regional armies .
but brief clashes occurred in the state of karen during november ’ s election , forcing hundreds of karen to seek temporary shelter in thailand .
several of the armed groups have now moved to form a new military alliance .
but myanmar ’ s military has some 400,000 troops against the ethnic armies ’ more than 65,000 troops .
once again , myanmar ’ s disparate communities are now putting their faith in aung san suu kyi and hoping she will be able to negotiate a way to political reform .

after her death , her pakistan people 's party won the elections , and her widowed husband asif ali zardari eventually became the president of pakistan .
however , more than two years after the ppp came into power , there has n't been much progress on benazir bhutto 's murder case , which is still shrouded in mystery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president zardari and premier gilani of the ppp have been in power for more than two years " wider parameters " veteran politician and ppp senator taj haider refutes the allegations that the government has not done much to uncover bhutto 's murderers .
" it was a very big controversy that resulted in benazir 's murder .
we want to be on the right track , and we want to conduct the investigation on scientific lines .
in the first place we involved the united nations so that the wider parameters of the conspiracy behind her murder would be determined .
within those parameters , the un has pointed to certain directions , and now we are proceeding in that direction , " haider told deutsche welle .
the recent arrest of two ex-police officials of the rawalpindi police , saud aziz and khurram shehzad , who were responsible for the security of bhutto , is being hailed by the government as a great success .
according to the public prosecutor chaudhry zulfiqar , the two ex-cops have disclosed the names of four or five high-ranking army officials belonging to pakistan 's spy agency , the inter-services intelligence -lrb- isi -rrb- , with whom they claim to have contact .
but political analysts doubt whether the government could do anything against the omnipotent isi .
" the civilian government is completely powerless when it comes to the army and the isi , as we have seen so many times before .
there is a huge cover-up , there is a lot that does n't meet the eye , " said journalist kamran shafi of pakistan 's leading english daily dawn in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of bhutto burn a police vehicle and a bus after bhutto 's murder the isi ' connection ' taj haider maintains the government is capable of bringing the culprits to justice irrespective of their institutional links .
he does not blame the isi as an institution .
" there are intelligence agencies within intelligence agencies , and there are parallel intelligence agencies as well .
some retired isi officers have made their own setups , and through these setups they are still propagating the same ideology of religious extremism that resulted in benazir bhutto 's death . "
a united nations commission , set up to investigate bhutto 's murder on the request of the ppp government , revealed in its detailed report earlier this year that the security arrangements for bhutto were seriously inadequate , and that some security agencies tried to hinder the initial investigations .
although the government considers the un report to be an extremely important document , critics believe the government has not yet implemented the commission 's recommendations .
musharraf 's ' questionnaire ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pervez musharraf was the president at the time of bhutto 's murder another aspect of the case is the role of former military ruler pervez musharraf .
the government is under immense pressure to bring musharraf back to pakistan from england , where he is living in self-imposed exile .
but kamran shafi does not see that happen any time soon .
" all we know so far is that the government has sent him a questionnaire .
this is the second time we are hearing that .
musharraf said he never received such a questionnaire .
but the actual point is that he was the president and the military dictator at that time .
he may not be involved personally in ordering the assassination , but certainly the responsibility rests on his shoulders , " said shafi .
the government has planned several functions to commemorate the third death anniversary of its ' martyred ' leader on december 27 .
but this might not be enough to satisfy the party workers as well as the government 's critics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 24.12.2010 bhutto 's murder still a mystery after three years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutto was assassinated in rawalpindi three years ago during a public rally the murder mystery of pakistan 's former prime minister benazir bhutto has taken a new turn as recently arrested police officials have disclosed the names of the isi officials who could be connected to her assassination . pakistan 's former prime minister and leader of the country 's largest political party benazir bhutto was killed three years ago on december 27th , 2007 , in a suicide attack during an election rally in rawalpindi .
after her death , her pakistan people 's party won the elections , and her widowed husband asif ali zardari eventually became the president of pakistan .
however , more than two years after the ppp came into power , there has n't been much progress on benazir bhutto 's murder case , which is still shrouded in mystery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president zardari and premier gilani of the ppp have been in power for more than two years " wider parameters " veteran politician and ppp senator taj haider refutes the allegations that the government has not done much to uncover bhutto 's murderers .
" it was a very big controversy that resulted in benazir 's murder .
we want to be on the right track , and we want to conduct the investigation on scientific lines .
in the first place we involved the united nations so that the wider parameters of the conspiracy behind her murder would be determined .
within those parameters , the un has pointed to certain directions , and now we are proceeding in that direction , " haider told deutsche welle .
the recent arrest of two ex-police officials of the rawalpindi police , saud aziz and khurram shehzad , who were responsible for the security of bhutto , is being hailed by the government as a great success .
according to the public prosecutor chaudhry zulfiqar , the two ex-cops have disclosed the names of four or five high-ranking army officials belonging to pakistan 's spy agency , the inter-services intelligence -lrb- isi -rrb- , with whom they claim to have contact .
but political analysts doubt whether the government could do anything against the omnipotent isi .
" the civilian government is completely powerless when it comes to the army and the isi , as we have seen so many times before .
there is a huge cover-up , there is a lot that does n't meet the eye , " said journalist kamran shafi of pakistan 's leading english daily dawn in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of bhutto burn a police vehicle and a bus after bhutto 's murder the isi ' connection ' taj haider maintains the government is capable of bringing the culprits to justice irrespective of their institutional links .
he does not blame the isi as an institution .
" there are intelligence agencies within intelligence agencies , and there are parallel intelligence agencies as well .
some retired isi officers have made their own setups , and through these setups they are still propagating the same ideology of religious extremism that resulted in benazir bhutto 's death . "
a united nations commission , set up to investigate bhutto 's murder on the request of the ppp government , revealed in its detailed report earlier this year that the security arrangements for bhutto were seriously inadequate , and that some security agencies tried to hinder the initial investigations .
although the government considers the un report to be an extremely important document , critics believe the government has not yet implemented the commission 's recommendations .
musharraf 's ' questionnaire ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pervez musharraf was the president at the time of bhutto 's murder another aspect of the case is the role of former military ruler pervez musharraf .
the government is under immense pressure to bring musharraf back to pakistan from england , where he is living in self-imposed exile .
but kamran shafi does not see that happen any time soon .
" all we know so far is that the government has sent him a questionnaire .
this is the second time we are hearing that .
musharraf said he never received such a questionnaire .
but the actual point is that he was the president and the military dictator at that time .
he may not be involved personally in ordering the assassination , but certainly the responsibility rests on his shoulders , " said shafi .
the government has planned several functions to commemorate the third death anniversary of its ' martyred ' leader on december 27 .
but this might not be enough to satisfy the party workers as well as the government 's critics .

her freedom once again raised hopes for reforms in myanmar , also known as burma .
the country has been under military rule since 1962 .
ever since her release , aung san suu kyi has been very active , giving media interviews and meeting with members of her national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- , amid regional calls for her to play a greater role to bridge the gap between the military and the pro-democracy opposition .
only a first step while most people welcomed aung san suu kyi ’ s release , some activists , such as soe aung of the forum for democracy in burma , say it was just a partial step towards reforms and a dialogue .
" you may call it progress on that front , " soe aung told deutsche welle .
" but do not forget about the remaining 2,200 political prisoners .
there is no progress at all in their situation .
releasing aung san suu kyi is not enough .
the military regime has to respond to the calls of aung san suu kyi for a dialogue as soon as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military regime held elections for the first time in twenty years in 2010 the elections in november , widely considered by the international community as fraudulent , are expected now to be followed by the formation of a civilian government , which will include a president , and the appointment of regional administrators .
debbie stothardt , the spokesperson for the rights group alternative asean network , is very cautious .
" 2011 is going to be more uncertain than 2010 .
we have aung san suu kyi freed but we are not sure for how long , and there are increasing restrictions on people having access to her or media covering her statements and activities .
we have also seen more foreigners blacklisted and deported from burma since aung san suu kyi ’ s release . "
minorities form alliance keunsai , who uses only one name , is the director of the shan herald news agency , which focuses on issues related to myanmar 's shan ethnic minority group .
he says the junta has a delicate balancing act ahead .
" the junta is walking on tiptoes right now because it is anxious to show that the country has become a democracy .
so what will happen next depends on both sides : how much the opposition is ready to test the junta 's tolerance , and how much the junta is going to tolerate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi 's supporters celebrate outside her home after her release myanmar ’ s ethnic minorities have also been under pressure this year , with the junta trying to press the minority armed groups to join a border patrol force .
over the past decades , the military has reached several cease-fire agreements with these regional armies .
but brief clashes occurred in the state of karen during november ’ s election , forcing hundreds of karen to seek temporary shelter in thailand .
several of the armed groups have now moved to form a new military alliance .
but myanmar ’ s military has some 400,000 troops against the ethnic armies ’ more than 65,000 troops .
once again , myanmar ’ s disparate communities are now putting their faith in aung san suu kyi and hoping she will be able to negotiate a way to political reform .

but when it comes to christmas , some old habits are reluctant to die . many years ago , back in the days when berlin was new to me and latte macchiato had yet to be imported to prenzlauer berg 's kastanienallee , i remember christmas being a quiet and even gentle affair .
seasons greetings were not splashed across the fronts of thousands of garish cards , nor were they blasted from brass bands at shoppers too busy hunting down their must-haves of the year to stop and lend an ear .
christmas trees were rarely seen in advance of the first advent and their decorations consisted almost entirely of straw stars on skinny red string .
that same year , i received a parcel from england containing presents wrapped in stylish paper .
i recall a german friend who was with me at the time , studying the design and wondering why shop owners here could n't find a way to stock the same kind of thing .
fast forward fifteen years and he need ask no more .
it arrived at around the same time as the cards emblazoned with christmas wishes , often enough in english , and the multi-colored baubles which shine more brightly than any straw star could ever hope to .

when the shops closed last night , hundreds of people flocked to the one mega book store that stays open until midnight .
i splashed through the sludgy brown puddles at its threshold to see what all the fuss was about .
i was surprised to see berliners , who are ordinarily cautious spenders , behaving with such reckless purchasing abandon .
the scene , which i 'm sure was being repeated all over the city , would have been excellent fodder for anyone who holds that christmas in berlin has become a sacrilegious shopping fest .
and there are plenty who would say just that .
the other side of christmas but i 'd argue that such a complaint is too black and white .
it 's clearly true that glitz and gifts are gaining momentum at christmas time - which ca n't be a bad thing from an economic point of view - but shopping and tradition have never been mutually exclusive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner dom might be big , but come christmas eve , it can also be very full on christmas eve last year , someone in my family decided we ought to go to midnight mass at the berliner dom .

we arrived in plenty of time , only to find that there was no room .
the place was even more packed than that sprawling bookstore a little way down the road .
we tried st. hedwig 's cathedral , but could n't get in there either .
the irony of being turned away on christmas eve was not lost on us , but we did what others have clearly done before us and kept on looking .
and in our case we did n't need a bed for the night , just somewhere to stand for the duration of the service .
we tramped on to two other churches before we found a corner in the marienkirche into which we could settle .
looking back , it is hard to imagine that of all those people who turned out that night , none had walked the same streets in the preceding days in search of gifts for the people they hold dear .

already , the country has 40 percent of its energy coming from renewable sources . the launch in portugal in january of nissan 's leaf marks the start of the rollout in europe of what the company says is the first 100 percent electric car aimed at a mass market .
nissan targeted portugal - where it will also soon be assembling batteries for the leaf - after that country 's government agreed to setting up a national network of charging points .
in fact , the network is to be compatible with any make of electric car , and is part of still more ambitious long-term plans for a genuinely " smart grid " that could help portugal make fuller use of its fast-expanding renewable energy capacity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government wants to expand its network of charging stations in early december , amid ultra-modern architecture at the former site of the expo 98 world fair in lisbon , members of the portuguese public got the chance to test drive the leaf .
portuguese consumers are curious about electric cars comments ranged from the polite to the enthusiastic , with the lack of engine noise the most obvious characteristic of what at first glance looks like a regular five-seater family run-around .
but the very lack of engine noise creates some new " problems . "
" for instance , the headlamps have a specific design to avoid air going to the mirrors , " said antónio joaquim , the communications director of nissan iberia portugal .
" the exterior mirrors on a normal car produce a lot of noise with the wind .
but on this car , which does n't make any noise from the engine , all the very small noises that on other cars are not perceptible are - let 's say , uncomfortable . "
the more obvious matter of charging the car seems straightforward : a small panel on the bonnet opens to reveal something rather similar to an ordinary electric plug .
" if you want to charge when you are parking inside a garage in your own house or in a shopping centre , it 's better to have it on the bonnet , " joaquim added .
" it 's a completely different usage from a combustion engine .
you just charge the car during your daily life . "
charging stations are scarce for now , but are expected to increase there are two charging options : a partial quick charge , for example when you are on the motorway and do not want to stop for long , or a cheaper slow charge of up to eight hours .
prospective buyers in lisbon seemed to take the limitations of electric cars on board .
" it 's a nice car , and a good prospect for someone like me who has an urban life , and drives about 30 or 40 kilometres to work and back , " said one man , who declined to give his name .
the innovative design of the leaf 's lithium batteries means that you can drive the car for longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotor 's editor thinks that the european car of the year jury missed out on the prius but even a fully-charged leaf has a more limited range than a car with a full fuel tank .
so the fact that it recently was named european car of the year - the first completely electric vehicle to do so - raised some eyebrows .
antónio pereira , editor of portuguese car magazine automotor , told deutsche welle he suspected the competition 's jury may have been anxious not to miss a trick , having previously failed to garland the first version of the toyota prius , which later became a hit .
the nissan leaf is , he said , an interesting experiment , and portugal a suitably small testing ground , but with some problems .
" recharging stations are still few -lsb- in number -rsb- and mainly in the big cities , " he said .
" and in portugal we mainly live in apartments .
so either you have a parking space in your building or you have to recharge at night in the public recharging station .
that 's complicated because there wo n't be one for each . "
portugal pushing for dynmaic energy flow in its ' smart grid ' still , the spread of on-street charging points in portugal is the reason the leaf is getting its european launch in the country .
the government-led mobi.e consortium is installing 1,300 chargers around the country , compatible with all makes of car .
in addition , the state is offering a 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- subsidy for buyers of electric cars - bringing the leaf 's price down to 30,000 euro - and a road-tax exemption .
portugal 's ambitious declared long-term target of 750,000 electric vehicles on its roads also fits with plans to expand its renewable energy output , going some way to addressing sceptics ' argument that electric cars ' environmental impact depends on where their power comes from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government is subsidizing the purchase price of electric cars " we have defined as a target to be the first country to have a nationwide and comprehensive infrastructure for vehicles and to work to give the necessary framework and incentives so that we can massively introduce the electric vehicle , " luís reis of mobi.e explained at a trade fair earlier this year .
" this is important not only in terms of the sustainability of mobility but also in terms of the strategy that we have for energy . "
portuguese society has high reliance on renewable sources portugal - for decades heavily reliant on imported oil for its energy needs - now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables , and rising .
and officials overseeing the development of the electric grid envision a future in which drivers will actually be able to profit from helping ensure that same energy is used efficiently , when electric cars have full internet capability .
" you drive it home in the evening , plug -lsb- it in to -rsb- both internet and power , and the car starts receiving signals of electricity spot prices , " antónio vidigal , a director of privatised utility edp , one of the mobi.e partners , told a conference on climate change earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables " at night the price is low ; the car will charge overnight , " vidigal went on .
" next day you come to office , plug again into both plugs .
peak time energy will be expensive and the car may sell energy back to the network . "
as in many countries , hydro-electric dams in portugal already store excess energy from wind farms ; this is used to pump water uphill , to be used to generate power when demand is high .
now the groundwork is being laid for a smart grid that could see cars playing a similar role .
as the first step in what is to be a nationwide programme , edp in 2010 made évora in the alentejo , a city with a population of some 50,000 , the first " inovcity " in the future national " inovgrid . "
" consumers have access almost to real-time information as to their energy consumption , so they 'll be able to manage that better , " explained miguel andrade , a director of edp distribuição , the group 's distribution unit .
" from the company 's side obviously we hope to have operational efficiencies from this .
we hope to integrate more renewables , more micro-generation and eventually in the medium to long-term also the electric vehicle into the grid .
" i think we 're genuinely witnessing a revolution in the way we manage distribution networks . "
nissan investing in portugal but if it 's early days for integrating cars into this vision , what of today 's models ?
the leaf on show in lisbon can not , slot into a smart grid .
but , he said , the model is easily adapted .
" we are implementing the electric vehicles now , so we have to be cost efficient otherwise people would not buy them , " said antónio joaquim , nissan portugal communications director .
" that is why the cars do n't have this and the grid does n't have this capabilities .
" but from the utility 's point of view the technology is already known , from the car industry the technology is already known , so i do n't think that is a very difficult thing to implement later on .
it 's a question of software . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal has already begun rolling out electrical charging stations the leaf itself can already communicate with the charging point : identifying itself and its charging specifications and needs , as well as its owner - who will after all be paying for the power as part of the electricity bill sent to his home .
some environmentalists see models such as the leaf as primarily a public relations exercise for manufacturers that still devote most of their investment to conventional models .
nissan 's own projections for electric cars do not go beyond 10 percent of total sales .
but given that the company is building factories in japan , the us and the uk dedicated to making the leaf - and which it would be difficult and expensive to convert to make other cars - the company is perhaps not the prime target for such accusations .
" everybody in the automotive business is trying to do their own ' greenwash ' , promising ' green ' products - and most are less polluting than before , but not that green , " said antónio pereira , editor of automotor .
" i think nissan is probably taking a lot of risks with the electric car but it 's not doing greenwash - not at all . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.12.2010 italian fabric makers turn dirty secret into marketing weapon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town of prato has decided to air its dirty laundry wool producers in the city of prato have long used scraps to produce fabric more cheaply .
once taboo , the practice may now attract an eco-friendly clientele , saving the industry from tough chinese competition . for decades , the small industrial city of prato in tuscany has produced some of the finest wool textiles in the world - all the while hiding a dirty secret .
but now , hard hit by low-cost textiles produced in china , prato has dug the skeleton out of its closet and turned it into a powerful marketing weapon .
" the production of the reprocessed wool comes from scraps that come from the manufacturing of garments , " romeo balli explained to deutsche welle .
nowadays , with attention focused on eco-friendly manufacturing practices , this process is garnering attention for balli 's fabrics .
saving scraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recycling wool scraps conserves resources balli 's factory has carried the family name since it was founded by his grandfather in 1946 .
it was once part of a thriving textile industry in prato that produced high quality wool fabric .
back then , as today , most of the textiles were made from left-over wool scraps .
according to balli , this does n't mean a drop in quality , but does make manufacturing less expensive .
" we can find nice quality , divide it by color , quality , and it 's much easier and cheaper , " he said .
not only is the process cheaper , it 's also more environmentally friendly .
prato 's chamber of commerce is now trying to capitalize on this fact to give its industry a boost .
according to carlo longo , who heads the chamber of commerce , it 's ironic the recycled wool is now a selling point , given how for decades prato industries hid the fact .
" nobody was admitting that -lsb- we recycled scraps -rsb- .
we were trying to do it , but hiding it , " he said .
" now it 's become a reason to be proud , because we 're not depleting the world 's resources , so it 's a good thing . "
old product , new brand longo is part of an initiative geared toward reducing the carbon footprint of textile production , which certifies companies that use regenerated or recycled raw materials .
prato 's chamber of commerce has dubbed the regenerated wool " cardato , " hoping consumers will seek out the eco-friendly product .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wool manufacturers face steep competition from china " we have branded it and are launching it again , " longo said .
" there 's now a lot of attention to these kinds of products . "
it 's also economically advantageous .
with cheaply produced wool fabrics being exported from china , prato 's five billion-euro -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- export industry has lost half its business in the last decade .
textile producers like romeo balli say the reprocessed wool not only gives prato an eco-friendly advantage , but also provides cheaper and more stable prices .
according to balli , the difference in price between virgin and reprocessed wool can be between 30 and 40 percent .
those savings could ensure the survival of prato 's textile industry , especially at a time when balli believes chinese producers are stockpiling virgin wool - causing prices to shoot up around the world .

the un general assembly has recognized his rival alassane ouattara as the west african country ’ s new leader . the united nations general assembly recognized alassane ouattara as the legitimate president of ivory coast late thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer affairs -pipe- 24.12.2010 economists flag indebted underclass problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debt problems are increasing amongst german consumers private debt is becoming a problem that some germans can not escape .
a recent study shows that women and young people under 30 are sliding particularly quickly into the red . about 6.5 million germans are currently struggling with debt – that 's almost 10 percent of the adult population .
this year alone saw 290,000 new debtors join their ranks with average liabilities of 35,000 euros .
as a result , the number of private insolvencies in germany is expected to rise 11 percent this year .
it 's the first time since 2007 that the number of people falling into debt has risen , according to a study by creditreform , a business information service specializing in risk and debt analysis .
" the increase in over-indebtedness is a delayed reaction to the economic crisis , " michael bretz , creditreform 's head of the economic research , told deutsche welle .
one of the most worrying trends is a rise in the number of young people with money problems .
the past year saw 54,000 teenagers develop debt problems - an increase of 38 percent on the previous year and the biggest increase among any age group .
bretz puts this down to excessive consumerism .
" young people want to consume more than older ones to compensate for their low status , " bretz said .
young people also do n't fully understand their finances .
according to a recent study by social research company forsa , almost one third of 16 year olds didn ’ t know that it would take longer to pay off a loan of 2000 euro at 50 euro per month as opposed to saving that amount .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bretz worries that ghettos are developing in germany inherited debt bretz believes that people learn financial habits from their parents and warns that a sort of " debt mentality " is being passed on from generation to generation - and that there is a certain part of german society that does n't seem able to manage its money .
" they see that their parents do n't work , how they live with debt status , with their income , and that it is possible , " bretz said .
" their children will inherit this status . "
about two million people in germany are expected to stay in debt for the rest of their lives , he added .
as the german economy picks up , consumers are buying large items on credit again .
as a result , bretz expects the number of people burdened with excessive debt will increase even further .
" we have seen an increase in consumer loans , " bretz said .
" i think people are more relaxed than in the crisis and so they spend more money , especially in these days before christmas . "
a greater variety of payment options , such as paying on store cards , credit cards , over the internet and zero percent finance offers , has increased debt levels in germany .
" most people who come to me have debts at credit institutions , like overdrafts and loans , " thomas kroeger , a debt advisor in engelskirchen told deutsche welle .
" 40 percent owe money to mail order companies and every fifth person has overdue mobile phone bills . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroeger worries that more teenagers are getting in the red divorce and debt women are especially prone to debt problems during separation and divorce because although they often have lower incomes than their partners , they can still be held liable for joint loans or contracts signed when they were together .
diana , an unemployed 26-year-old mother from western germany , racked up 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,970 -rrb- of debt to 14 different creditors after she split up with her boyfriend .
when diana moved into a new flat she bought most of the furniture on credit .
at the time she was earning good money as an office clerk and was able to pay back her installments comfortably .
but then she became unemployed .
" when you lose your job , your world is destroyed and you ask how can i pay for my rent , telephone , electricity and gas ? " she said .
in addition to her furniture , diana is still paying off her bank overdraft , joint mobile phone contracts , insurance , and mail order purchases .
" it 's really dangerous .
when you see zero percent offers on tv , it entices you to buy so much .
and you buy things that you simply do n't need , " she told deutsche welle .
when diana was unable to find a new job , she found herself living off so-called " harz iv " social security payments worth just 323 euros per month .
" at some point i lost track of things and did n't know what i should pay for first , " she said .
" i was getting nasty letters in the post , telling me if you do n't pay , then this and that will happen and the bailiff will come . "
bildunterschrift : many women develop debt problems following divorce or separation a casual attitude to debt diana went to see a debt advisor – a service that 's free of charge in germany if you 're unemployed .
he wrote to all of her creditors , who agreed to halve her debt and free her of interest payments .
she now pays a total of 10 euros per month , which is shared out between her creditors .
it 's a small amount , but one she should always be able to afford , even on the lowest level of benefits .
" if i could do it again , i would save up my money , rather than buy things on credit and take out loans , ” she said .
“ i only use a pay-as-you-go mobile phone now , " she added .
while diana 's debts are now manageable , her partner is almost 20,000 euros in the red and faces private insolvency proceedings .
that means for six years , any income exceeding his basic living expenses will be automatically forfeited to creditors .
after that his debts will be wiped – a chance for a fresh start .
the fact that diana 's partner has a low income means he only pays 40 euros per month to his creditors .
his six years of repayments will amount to just 2,880 euros - an amount diana finds astonishingly low given the size of the original debt .
" it 's laughable really .
it 's like an easy ' alternative way ' to deal with one 's debts .
at the end you can say , that was it , my debts are gone now " .
bretz warns that there 's a danger of people using private insolvency too casually – an easy solution to freeing oneself of debts after overindulging .
" there are more and more people who see this possibility and use it in a very rational way .
they see it as a solution to their debt problems , " bretz said .

her freedom once again raised hopes for reforms in myanmar , also known as burma .
the country has been under military rule since 1962 .
ever since her release , aung san suu kyi has been very active , giving media interviews and meeting with members of her national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- , amid regional calls for her to play a greater role to bridge the gap between the military and the pro-democracy opposition .
only a first step while most people welcomed aung san suu kyi ’ s release , some activists , such as soe aung of the forum for democracy in burma , say it was just a partial step towards reforms and a dialogue .
" you may call it progress on that front , " soe aung told deutsche welle .
" but do not forget about the remaining 2,200 political prisoners .
there is no progress at all in their situation .
releasing aung san suu kyi is not enough .
the military regime has to respond to the calls of aung san suu kyi for a dialogue as soon as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military regime held elections for the first time in twenty years in 2010 the elections in november , widely considered by the international community as fraudulent , are expected now to be followed by the formation of a civilian government , which will include a president , and the appointment of regional administrators .
debbie stothardt , the spokesperson for the rights group alternative asean network , is very cautious .
" 2011 is going to be more uncertain than 2010 .
we have aung san suu kyi freed but we are not sure for how long , and there are increasing restrictions on people having access to her or media covering her statements and activities .
we have also seen more foreigners blacklisted and deported from burma since aung san suu kyi ’ s release . "
minorities form alliance keunsai , who uses only one name , is the director of the shan herald news agency , which focuses on issues related to myanmar 's shan ethnic minority group .
he says the junta has a delicate balancing act ahead .
" the junta is walking on tiptoes right now because it is anxious to show that the country has become a democracy .
so what will happen next depends on both sides : how much the opposition is ready to test the junta 's tolerance , and how much the junta is going to tolerate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi 's supporters celebrate outside her home after her release myanmar ’ s ethnic minorities have also been under pressure this year , with the junta trying to press the minority armed groups to join a border patrol force .
over the past decades , the military has reached several cease-fire agreements with these regional armies .
but brief clashes occurred in the state of karen during november ’ s election , forcing hundreds of karen to seek temporary shelter in thailand .
several of the armed groups have now moved to form a new military alliance .
but myanmar ’ s military has some 400,000 troops against the ethnic armies ’ more than 65,000 troops .
once again , myanmar ’ s disparate communities are now putting their faith in aung san suu kyi and hoping she will be able to negotiate a way to political reform .

an anarchist group has claimed responsibility . a group of italian anarchists claimed responsibility on thursday for two parcel bomb explosions at foreign embassies in rome , according to italian media reports .
two people were injured by two separate package bombs that exploded at the swiss and chilean embassies in rome earlier on thursday , prompting police to conduct checks at all the embassies in the italian capital .
the first incident occurred around midday at the swiss embassy , when a bomb exploded in the mailroom as an employee opened it .
reports said the 53-year-old man was taken to a hospital in central rome and risks the amputation of one or both of his hands , but that his life was not in danger .
three hours later an employee at the chilean embassy was lightly injured after opening the second package bomb .
anarchists claim responsibility the ansa news agency reported that a group calling itself the informal federation of anarchy -lrb- fai -rrb- had written a note claiming the blasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police were checking embassies across rome after the explosions " we have decided to make our voice heard with words and deeds .

the fai is well known to italian authorities .
in 2010 , intelligence services referred to the group in a statement to parliament as italy 's " main national terrorist threat of an anarchist-insurrectionist type . "
police sweep rome 's embassies ansa reported thursday that police conducted sweeps at all the embassies in rome .
a suspicious package at the ukrainian embassy was first thought to be another bomb , but police later said it was a false alarm .
thursday 's bombs followed the discovery of a crude device designed like an explosive on an empty subway car in rome on tuesday . tests later showed that the device had no detonator and contained no explosives .
chilean foreign minister alfredo moreno condemned the blast in the chilean embassy , calling it " an act of terrorism " and " cowardly . "
he added that the bomb had been adressed to a cultural association , where it severely injured the hands , face and abdomen of cesar mella , a chilean citizen .
suspected connection to greece italy 's interior minister roberto maroni said on a television talk show that he thought a suspected connection to similar bombings in greece last month was the " right track . "
" greece , italy and spain have seen the presence of anarcho-insurrectionalist groups that are tightly linked , " he said .
" they are very violent . "
last month 14 package bombs were discovered at various embassies across athens and in transit to places abroad , including one sent to the chancellery in berlin .
the package , which arrived on a day when chancellor angela merkel was not in berlin , was identified as being suspicious during a routine check at the chancellery 's mail center .
the bomb did not go off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of 14 parcel bombs discovered last month was sent to the german chancellory greek police believed the attacks were connected to a left-wing militant organization , and arrested six people on suspicion of being connected to the group .
a greek police official said he had not yet received any request for help from italian police .
no likely connection to jihadist groups analysts said while the parcel bombings in greece and italy may have been similar , there were not necessarily any direct connections .
" given the similarities with the recent parcel bombs in greece following anti-austerity protests , this could be a copycat incident by domestic activists , " said samantha wolreich , a european risk analyst at the uk-based advisory firm ake .

a greek police official said he had not yet received any request for help from italian police .
no likely connection to jihadist groups analysts said while the parcel bombings in greece and italy may have been similar , there were not necessarily any direct connections .
" given the similarities with the recent parcel bombs in greece following anti-austerity protests , this could be a copycat incident by domestic activists , " said samantha wolreich , a european risk analyst at the uk-based advisory firm ake .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de berlin -pipe- 24.12.2010 underneath the commercial glitter , berliners believe in christmas tradition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these past two decades , the festive season in berlin has been changing almost as rapidly as the capital itself .
but when it comes to christmas , some old habits are reluctant to die . many years ago , back in the days when berlin was new to me and latte macchiato had yet to be imported to prenzlauer berg 's kastanienallee , i remember christmas being a quiet and even gentle affair .
seasons greetings were not splashed across the fronts of thousands of garish cards , nor were they blasted from brass bands at shoppers too busy hunting down their must-haves of the year to stop and lend an ear .
christmas trees were rarely seen in advance of the first advent and their decorations consisted almost entirely of straw stars on skinny red string .
that same year , i received a parcel from england containing presents wrapped in stylish paper .
i recall a german friend who was with me at the time , studying the design and wondering why shop owners here could n't find a way to stock the same kind of thing .
fast forward fifteen years and he need ask no more .
it arrived at around the same time as the cards emblazoned with christmas wishes , often enough in english , and the multi-colored baubles which shine more brightly than any straw star could ever hope to .
shopping up a storm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas shopping en-masse and it is in precisely such paper that shoppers like the thousands i bumped into yesterday evening when i ventured out to friedrichstrasse -lrb- all in the name of research -rrb- will be using to wrap the gifts they had to tramp through icy temperatures and piles of snow to buy .
when the shops closed last night , hundreds of people flocked to the one mega book store that stays open until midnight .
i splashed through the sludgy brown puddles at its threshold to see what all the fuss was about .
i was surprised to see berliners , who are ordinarily cautious spenders , behaving with such reckless purchasing abandon .
the scene , which i 'm sure was being repeated all over the city , would have been excellent fodder for anyone who holds that christmas in berlin has become a sacrilegious shopping fest .
and there are plenty who would say just that .
the other side of christmas but i 'd argue that such a complaint is too black and white .
it 's clearly true that glitz and gifts are gaining momentum at christmas time - which ca n't be a bad thing from an economic point of view - but shopping and tradition have never been mutually exclusive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner dom might be big , but come christmas eve , it can also be very full on christmas eve last year , someone in my family decided we ought to go to midnight mass at the berliner dom .
i do n't go every year or very often at all for that matter , but it sounded like a nice idea , so off we trundled .
we arrived in plenty of time , only to find that there was no room .
the place was even more packed than that sprawling bookstore a little way down the road .
we tried st. hedwig 's cathedral , but could n't get in there either .
the irony of being turned away on christmas eve was not lost on us , but we did what others have clearly done before us and kept on looking .
and in our case we did n't need a bed for the night , just somewhere to stand for the duration of the service .
we tramped on to two other churches before we found a corner in the marienkirche into which we could settle .
looking back , it is hard to imagine that of all those people who turned out that night , none had walked the same streets in the preceding days in search of gifts for the people they hold dear .
i wo n't be in berlin this christmas or i might just be tempted -lrb- in the name of research -rrb- to go back and see if there are any faces i recognise from my recent expedition to friedrichstrasse .

sales figures for the title into the holiday season show no signs of slowing down . thilo sarrazin 's contentious book with grim predictions for the future of germany is number one on the year 's non-fiction bestseller list , according to records published by der spiegel .
since the release of " germany is doing away with itself " in late august , author sarrazin has made headlines for claiming that the combination of germany 's low birth-rate and immigration and social welfare policies are leading the country toward " a nightmare . "
with chapter titles like " immigration and integration - expect more , offer less " and " demographics and population politics - more children from the intelligent before it 's too late , " the book was sure to spark conflict .
chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly condemned sarrazin .
in comments made shortly after the book 's publication , she said , " his word choice , his means of expression , the stereotyping of entire groups , the exclusion and hatefulness : it 's unacceptable .
and it is n't going to lead to any solutions . "
but neither public criticism nor the holiday season have put a damper on the book 's sales .
it remains at the top of der spiegel 's current weekly bestsellers , and a representative from the german publishers ' association told the magazine focus , " we are selling around 10,000 copies a day at the moment . "

although the controversial title has made sarrazin a millionaire , it has also led to a number of negative consequences for the former politician and banking official .
in early september , he complied with requests from officials including president christian wulff to step down from his position on the executive board of germany 's federal bank after initially refusing to withdraw voluntarily from his office .
" that was n't easy for me , " sarrazin said of the decision .
" i considered going head-to-head with the entire political class in germany , but no one can hold out in that situation for long . "
more recent editions of the book have also seen changes in some of the most incendiary passages of the book .
a line about migrants from the middle east in which they were termed a " genetic minus " has been removed entirely , while modifiers were added to some other segments .

third place in nonfiction went to margot kaessmann for her book " in the middle of life , " dealing with major issues that face adults aged 40 to 50 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.12.2010 rise of electric cars prompt ' smart ' electrical grids in portugal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nissan leaf will launch in portugal in january portugal ’ s long-term target of 750,000 electric cars fits with its smart energy plans .
already , the country has 40 percent of its energy coming from renewable sources . the launch in portugal in january of nissan 's leaf marks the start of the rollout in europe of what the company says is the first 100 percent electric car aimed at a mass market .
nissan targeted portugal - where it will also soon be assembling batteries for the leaf - after that country 's government agreed to setting up a national network of charging points .
in fact , the network is to be compatible with any make of electric car , and is part of still more ambitious long-term plans for a genuinely " smart grid " that could help portugal make fuller use of its fast-expanding renewable energy capacity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government wants to expand its network of charging stations in early december , amid ultra-modern architecture at the former site of the expo 98 world fair in lisbon , members of the portuguese public got the chance to test drive the leaf .
portuguese consumers are curious about electric cars comments ranged from the polite to the enthusiastic , with the lack of engine noise the most obvious characteristic of what at first glance looks like a regular five-seater family run-around .
but the very lack of engine noise creates some new " problems . "
" for instance , the headlamps have a specific design to avoid air going to the mirrors , " said antónio joaquim , the communications director of nissan iberia portugal .
" the exterior mirrors on a normal car produce a lot of noise with the wind .
but on this car , which does n't make any noise from the engine , all the very small noises that on other cars are not perceptible are - let 's say , uncomfortable . "
the more obvious matter of charging the car seems straightforward : a small panel on the bonnet opens to reveal something rather similar to an ordinary electric plug .
" if you want to charge when you are parking inside a garage in your own house or in a shopping centre , it 's better to have it on the bonnet , " joaquim added .
" it 's a completely different usage from a combustion engine .
you just charge the car during your daily life . "
charging stations are scarce for now , but are expected to increase there are two charging options : a partial quick charge , for example when you are on the motorway and do not want to stop for long , or a cheaper slow charge of up to eight hours .
prospective buyers in lisbon seemed to take the limitations of electric cars on board .
" it 's a nice car , and a good prospect for someone like me who has an urban life , and drives about 30 or 40 kilometres to work and back , " said one man , who declined to give his name .
the innovative design of the leaf 's lithium batteries means that you can drive the car for longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotor 's editor thinks that the european car of the year jury missed out on the prius but even a fully-charged leaf has a more limited range than a car with a full fuel tank .
so the fact that it recently was named european car of the year - the first completely electric vehicle to do so - raised some eyebrows .

already , the country has 40 percent of its energy coming from renewable sources . the launch in portugal in january of nissan 's leaf marks the start of the rollout in europe of what the company says is the first 100 percent electric car aimed at a mass market .
nissan targeted portugal - where it will also soon be assembling batteries for the leaf - after that country 's government agreed to setting up a national network of charging points .
in fact , the network is to be compatible with any make of electric car , and is part of still more ambitious long-term plans for a genuinely " smart grid " that could help portugal make fuller use of its fast-expanding renewable energy capacity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government wants to expand its network of charging stations in early december , amid ultra-modern architecture at the former site of the expo 98 world fair in lisbon , members of the portuguese public got the chance to test drive the leaf .
portuguese consumers are curious about electric cars comments ranged from the polite to the enthusiastic , with the lack of engine noise the most obvious characteristic of what at first glance looks like a regular five-seater family run-around .
but the very lack of engine noise creates some new " problems . "
" for instance , the headlamps have a specific design to avoid air going to the mirrors , " said antónio joaquim , the communications director of nissan iberia portugal .
" the exterior mirrors on a normal car produce a lot of noise with the wind .
but on this car , which does n't make any noise from the engine , all the very small noises that on other cars are not perceptible are - let 's say , uncomfortable . "
the more obvious matter of charging the car seems straightforward : a small panel on the bonnet opens to reveal something rather similar to an ordinary electric plug .
" if you want to charge when you are parking inside a garage in your own house or in a shopping centre , it 's better to have it on the bonnet , " joaquim added .
" it 's a completely different usage from a combustion engine .
you just charge the car during your daily life . "
charging stations are scarce for now , but are expected to increase there are two charging options : a partial quick charge , for example when you are on the motorway and do not want to stop for long , or a cheaper slow charge of up to eight hours .
prospective buyers in lisbon seemed to take the limitations of electric cars on board .
" it 's a nice car , and a good prospect for someone like me who has an urban life , and drives about 30 or 40 kilometres to work and back , " said one man , who declined to give his name .
the innovative design of the leaf 's lithium batteries means that you can drive the car for longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotor 's editor thinks that the european car of the year jury missed out on the prius but even a fully-charged leaf has a more limited range than a car with a full fuel tank .
so the fact that it recently was named european car of the year - the first completely electric vehicle to do so - raised some eyebrows .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.12.2010 rise of electric cars prompt ' smart ' electrical grids in portugal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nissan leaf will launch in portugal in january portugal ’ s long-term target of 750,000 electric cars fits with its smart energy plans .
already , the country has 40 percent of its energy coming from renewable sources . the launch in portugal in january of nissan 's leaf marks the start of the rollout in europe of what the company says is the first 100 percent electric car aimed at a mass market .
nissan targeted portugal - where it will also soon be assembling batteries for the leaf - after that country 's government agreed to setting up a national network of charging points .
in fact , the network is to be compatible with any make of electric car , and is part of still more ambitious long-term plans for a genuinely " smart grid " that could help portugal make fuller use of its fast-expanding renewable energy capacity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government wants to expand its network of charging stations in early december , amid ultra-modern architecture at the former site of the expo 98 world fair in lisbon , members of the portuguese public got the chance to test drive the leaf .
portuguese consumers are curious about electric cars comments ranged from the polite to the enthusiastic , with the lack of engine noise the most obvious characteristic of what at first glance looks like a regular five-seater family run-around .
but the very lack of engine noise creates some new " problems . "
" for instance , the headlamps have a specific design to avoid air going to the mirrors , " said antónio joaquim , the communications director of nissan iberia portugal .
" the exterior mirrors on a normal car produce a lot of noise with the wind .
but on this car , which does n't make any noise from the engine , all the very small noises that on other cars are not perceptible are - let 's say , uncomfortable . "
the more obvious matter of charging the car seems straightforward : a small panel on the bonnet opens to reveal something rather similar to an ordinary electric plug .
" if you want to charge when you are parking inside a garage in your own house or in a shopping centre , it 's better to have it on the bonnet , " joaquim added .
" it 's a completely different usage from a combustion engine .
you just charge the car during your daily life . "
charging stations are scarce for now , but are expected to increase there are two charging options : a partial quick charge , for example when you are on the motorway and do not want to stop for long , or a cheaper slow charge of up to eight hours .
prospective buyers in lisbon seemed to take the limitations of electric cars on board .
" it 's a nice car , and a good prospect for someone like me who has an urban life , and drives about 30 or 40 kilometres to work and back , " said one man , who declined to give his name .
the innovative design of the leaf 's lithium batteries means that you can drive the car for longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotor 's editor thinks that the european car of the year jury missed out on the prius but even a fully-charged leaf has a more limited range than a car with a full fuel tank .
so the fact that it recently was named european car of the year - the first completely electric vehicle to do so - raised some eyebrows .
antónio pereira , editor of portuguese car magazine automotor , told deutsche welle he suspected the competition 's jury may have been anxious not to miss a trick , having previously failed to garland the first version of the toyota prius , which later became a hit .
the nissan leaf is , he said , an interesting experiment , and portugal a suitably small testing ground , but with some problems .
" recharging stations are still few -lsb- in number -rsb- and mainly in the big cities , " he said .
" and in portugal we mainly live in apartments .
so either you have a parking space in your building or you have to recharge at night in the public recharging station .
that 's complicated because there wo n't be one for each . "
portugal pushing for dynmaic energy flow in its ' smart grid ' still , the spread of on-street charging points in portugal is the reason the leaf is getting its european launch in the country .
the government-led mobi.e consortium is installing 1,300 chargers around the country , compatible with all makes of car .
in addition , the state is offering a 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- subsidy for buyers of electric cars - bringing the leaf 's price down to 30,000 euro - and a road-tax exemption .
portugal 's ambitious declared long-term target of 750,000 electric vehicles on its roads also fits with plans to expand its renewable energy output , going some way to addressing sceptics ' argument that electric cars ' environmental impact depends on where their power comes from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government is subsidizing the purchase price of electric cars " we have defined as a target to be the first country to have a nationwide and comprehensive infrastructure for vehicles and to work to give the necessary framework and incentives so that we can massively introduce the electric vehicle , " luís reis of mobi.e explained at a trade fair earlier this year .
" this is important not only in terms of the sustainability of mobility but also in terms of the strategy that we have for energy . "
portuguese society has high reliance on renewable sources portugal - for decades heavily reliant on imported oil for its energy needs - now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables , and rising .
and officials overseeing the development of the electric grid envision a future in which drivers will actually be able to profit from helping ensure that same energy is used efficiently , when electric cars have full internet capability .
" you drive it home in the evening , plug -lsb- it in to -rsb- both internet and power , and the car starts receiving signals of electricity spot prices , " antónio vidigal , a director of privatised utility edp , one of the mobi.e partners , told a conference on climate change earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables " at night the price is low ; the car will charge overnight , " vidigal went on .
" next day you come to office , plug again into both plugs .
peak time energy will be expensive and the car may sell energy back to the network . "
as in many countries , hydro-electric dams in portugal already store excess energy from wind farms ; this is used to pump water uphill , to be used to generate power when demand is high .
now the groundwork is being laid for a smart grid that could see cars playing a similar role .
as the first step in what is to be a nationwide programme , edp in 2010 made évora in the alentejo , a city with a population of some 50,000 , the first " inovcity " in the future national " inovgrid . "
" consumers have access almost to real-time information as to their energy consumption , so they 'll be able to manage that better , " explained miguel andrade , a director of edp distribuição , the group 's distribution unit .
" from the company 's side obviously we hope to have operational efficiencies from this .
we hope to integrate more renewables , more micro-generation and eventually in the medium to long-term also the electric vehicle into the grid .
" i think we 're genuinely witnessing a revolution in the way we manage distribution networks . "
nissan investing in portugal but if it 's early days for integrating cars into this vision , what of today 's models ?
the leaf on show in lisbon can not , slot into a smart grid .
but , he said , the model is easily adapted .
" we are implementing the electric vehicles now , so we have to be cost efficient otherwise people would not buy them , " said antónio joaquim , nissan portugal communications director .
" that is why the cars do n't have this and the grid does n't have this capabilities .
" but from the utility 's point of view the technology is already known , from the car industry the technology is already known , so i do n't think that is a very difficult thing to implement later on .
it 's a question of software . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal has already begun rolling out electrical charging stations the leaf itself can already communicate with the charging point : identifying itself and its charging specifications and needs , as well as its owner - who will after all be paying for the power as part of the electricity bill sent to his home .
some environmentalists see models such as the leaf as primarily a public relations exercise for manufacturers that still devote most of their investment to conventional models .
nissan 's own projections for electric cars do not go beyond 10 percent of total sales .
but given that the company is building factories in japan , the us and the uk dedicated to making the leaf - and which it would be difficult and expensive to convert to make other cars - the company is perhaps not the prime target for such accusations .
" everybody in the automotive business is trying to do their own ' greenwash ' , promising ' green ' products - and most are less polluting than before , but not that green , " said antónio pereira , editor of automotor .
" i think nissan is probably taking a lot of risks with the electric car but it 's not doing greenwash - not at all . "

sales figures for the title into the holiday season show no signs of slowing down . thilo sarrazin 's contentious book with grim predictions for the future of germany is number one on the year 's non-fiction bestseller list , according to records published by der spiegel .
since the release of " germany is doing away with itself " in late august , author sarrazin has made headlines for claiming that the combination of germany 's low birth-rate and immigration and social welfare policies are leading the country toward " a nightmare . "
with chapter titles like " immigration and integration - expect more , offer less " and " demographics and population politics - more children from the intelligent before it 's too late , " the book was sure to spark conflict .
chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly condemned sarrazin .
in comments made shortly after the book 's publication , she said , " his word choice , his means of expression , the stereotyping of entire groups , the exclusion and hatefulness : it 's unacceptable .
and it is n't going to lead to any solutions . "
but neither public criticism nor the holiday season have put a damper on the book 's sales .
it remains at the top of der spiegel 's current weekly bestsellers , and a representative from the german publishers ' association told the magazine focus , " we are selling around 10,000 copies a day at the moment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's criticism has been directed especially at muslims and jews notoriety and fallout the book 's soaring numbers bring its total sales to around 1.3 million copies .
although the controversial title has made sarrazin a millionaire , it has also led to a number of negative consequences for the former politician and banking official .
in early september , he complied with requests from officials including president christian wulff to step down from his position on the executive board of germany 's federal bank after initially refusing to withdraw voluntarily from his office .
" that was n't easy for me , " sarrazin said of the decision .
" i considered going head-to-head with the entire political class in germany , but no one can hold out in that situation for long . "
more recent editions of the book have also seen changes in some of the most incendiary passages of the book .
a line about migrants from the middle east in which they were termed a " genetic minus " has been removed entirely , while modifiers were added to some other segments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaessmann was forgiven by many for quickly owning up to her mistake in the public eye " germany is doing away with itself " rounds out a list of several 2010 bestsellers by public figures .
second place for the year went to a book called " the end of patience " by kirsten heisig , a juvenile criminal court judge from berlin who died earlier in 2010 .
the book relates facts , stories and proposals relating to youth offenders in germany .
third place in nonfiction went to margot kaessmann for her book " in the middle of life , " dealing with major issues that face adults aged 40 to 50 .
kaessmann was the first female elected to head the council of germany 's protestant churches but drew international media attention in 2010 after stepping down from the position following a drunk-driving incident .
on the fiction side , a novel titled " hummeldumm " earned the honor of being 2010 's bestseller .
the narrative by tommy jaud draws on the experiences of a travel group in namibia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 24.12.2010 us foreign policy marked by continuity , says former national security adviser großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us national security adviser stephen hadley in an interview with dw , stephen hadley speaks about the continuity between president obama and his predecessor bush that surprised many people and why he views the west bank as a bright spot in the middle east . stephen hadley served as national security adviser to president george w. bush from 2005 to 2009 and as deputy national security adviser from 2001 to 2005 .
he is currently a senior adviser for international affairs at the united states institute of peace and a principal in the rice hadley group . deutsche welle : let 's look back at us and european foreign and security policy this year and take a tally of some major issues .
in afghanistan 2010 was the deadliest year for the international troops with more than 700 soldiers killed , most of them american .
has president obama 's surge strategy failed ?
stephen hadley : there 's been an initial assessment which has not been released publicly in all its detail .
but i think the administration 's assessment , and i think it 's right , is that the strategy of the united states and other allies including most europeans who are with us on the ground in afghanistan is making progress .
it 's slower than we would like , it 's fragile and reversible , but there has been progress .
and i think one of the good things about 2010 is that there has been a coming together of europeans and americans about the importance of afghanistan and about how to pursue our strategy .
president obama has said the us would begin to pull troops out of afghanistan in 2011 , the british have said they may do the same and germany has announced its plans to start withdrawing troops next year as well .
when the three biggest troop contributors start pulling back , can the war in afghanistan still be won ?
yes , because the lede here is not that the troops are pulling back , the lede is that the united states and its allies believe that they will be able to begin to transfer security responsibility to the afghans .
remember , americans and europeans have for several years now been training and helping the afghans to build an army and police that can take increasing security responsibility .
and afghan forces are operating with american and nato and other european forces in afghanistan now , so what the president said was that in 2011 we could begin the process of transferring security responsibility to afghan units and as that occurred it would allow some units of american and european origin to begin to withdraw .
but president obama has been clear , and particularly secretary gates has been clear that that handover of security responsibility to afghanistan and any withdrawal of american forces will be condition-based .
that is to say it will have to reflect progress and security on the ground and will be done in a way that does not jeopardize the progress we have achieved or future progress .
another intractable international issue for the us and the eu is how to deal with iran 's nuclear program .
despite a united position by europeans and americans and tough new sanctions that were put in place in 2010 with the help of russia and china , there does n't seem to be a change of tehran 's stance .
is the west simply running out of options on iran ? i think the administration and our european allies have done a better job than i would have anticipated in getting the russians and the chinese to go along with very tough sanctions .
as you point out , regrettably , it has not resulted in a change of iranian policy on the nuclear issue .
and this is obviously a source of concern for all of us , because the worry is that if the region begins to conclude that the international community is not going to be able to prevent iran from having through its enrichment program a clear path to a nuclear weapon that is going to result in an emboldened iran , it is going to result in weakened arab states and it is going to result in arab states trying to develop their own nuclear programs which is a proliferation risk that will make the middle east less stable not more stable .
2010 was the year in which the obama administration like many before tried and failed to make progress on the peace process between israelis and palestinians because it could n't convince the israeli government to extend a settlement stop even for just a few months .
was the us foolish even to try again or has the us completely lost its leverage with both parties , but especially with the israeli government ?
i think the administration has said as much that the effort that began really soon after administration took power in january 2009 to get a construction freeze in the settlement areas did not work as the administration has intended .
what they had hoped to do was to send a strong message to the world that the administration was going to be even-handed between the israelis and palestinians .
that this message would be greeted in the arab world with steps to reach out toward israel and to begin rebuilding diplomatic relations between israel and the arab world and it simply did not work .
and rather than facilitating negotiations and progress on the negotiating table it became a barrier to negotiations .
it was a tactic , i think the administration would say , that did not work .
so they are trying to restart the process to have these proximity talks to try to turn the focus from settlement construction to what the focus should have been really from the beginning which is the terms of peace .
we can only hope that there will be some success in this effort .
but i think what is really good news for the prospects for peace is what is happening in the west bank .
that president abbas and prime minister salam fayad are building the institutions of a palestinian state even while under occupation .
they are now training security forces that are increasingly taking responsibility for security and are going after terrorists .
the israeli military is recognizing the effectiveness of these forces and cooperating with them .
the palestinians are building political institutions , economic activity and growth has returned to the west bank and there is peace , there is calm , that is to say .
there are no incidents of violence either in the west bank or in israel .
so in some sense while the negotiations seem to have foundered , the underpinnings of an ultimate peace , that is to say the institutions of a democratic palestinian state that is not supporting terror , but is maintaining peace and security for both palestinians and israelis , that process has gone forward .
and i think that is a bright spot and an essential element for an ultimate peace and a two-state solution in the middle east .
many us presidents engaged in foreign policy have a doctrine named after them that spells out their vision or version of america 's engagement with the world .
obama has now passed the half-time mark of his first term .
is there something that could be called an obama doctrine and if so how would you describe and compare it to other presidential doctrines like the so-called bush doctrine ?
i think the obama administration is still a work in progress on foreign policy .
i think they would say as much .
i think they want to be known as an administration that has engaged our adversaries .
i think that policy has had some mixed success i think with respect to north korea and chavez in venezuela and in iran .
and they have certainly been very firm on north korea about the prerequisites to resuming the six-party talks .
i think one of the things that has surprised a lot of people is while i think the administration has had a positive tone in how it has spoken to the arab world and how it has spoken to europe , i think there is a lot more continuity in the policies between president obama and president bush than a lot of people expected .
and that 's not unusual .
in the united states , while we have presidential elections that are waged and fought based often on differences in foreign policy , when new administrations come in and see the problems that the prior administration has faced there is a high degree of continuity in policies between administrations .
and i think you see it in terms of the iraq policy , afghanistan policy and policies dealing with the terrorist threat .
so i think there have been some positive changes in tone .
some have succeeded , some have not .
but i think there has also been a high degree and a useful degree of continuity with the policies of its predecessor administrations .
if you had to give a grade to the obama administration for its foreign policy for this year or for the past two years what grade would that be ?
i think any foreign policy in the first two years generally gets an incomplete .
that is to say , the first year they are figuring out what their policies should be .
the second year they begin to roll out those policies in a more serious way , but it takes another year or two to know whether they are working .
so i think almost any administration in the second year gets an incomplete .
let 's switch to transatlantic affairs : one year ago with lady ashton and herman van rompuy , two relatively obscure politicians were chosen as the eu 's first new president and foreign minister .
the us has long complained about the lack of a common european stance on many international issues .
does washington now finally know which numbers to call in europe ? i think there is a feeling that the economic crisis that we have been through has put a lot of strain on the european project .
so i think most americans think that because of the challenge presented by the economic crisis there is a certain amount of introspection going on within europe about where it is going in terms of its political and economic integration .
i think that is very understandable .
the economic crisis has been a real blow to the entire world and it 's going to take some time to work it through . so i think most americans would say there has been a little bit of a pause in the european project of political and economic integration .
that has been a project that the united states has supported for 50 years , both republican and democratic administrations , and one that we want to succeed .
but understandably there is some soul searching going on in the europeans and we need to let our european allies work these issues through .
barack obama has been described as the first us president who is not an atlanticist naturally inclined toward europe , but rather toward asia .
this and the often quoted rise of asia has led some europeans to worry about the nature and future of the transatlantic relationship .
how healthy is the transatlantic relationship today and how important will it be in the future ? i have been in washington for over 40 years and sort of every 10 years somebody comes up and declares the end of the transatlantic relationship .
and so far all those predictions have been premature .
i think this is really the oldest affiliation for the united states this strong relationship with europe .
i think it continues to remain strong and will remain strong from administration to administration .
that said , the rise of asia and major new world powers in asia such as china and india is getting a lot of attention in the united states .
and it is getting a lot of attention in europe .
germany 's economic recovery is heavily driven by exports to asia , so it is not surprising that both in europe and in the united states there is a lot of discussion about asia and ties toward asia .
that is to say , how can meet the rise of new great powers in asia and how can we turn the rise of those great powers and the economic growth and the economic engine that asia is right now literally pulling the world out of recession , how can we turn that so that it is an opportunity for greater peace and prosperity for the world as a whole .
i think that 's the task in asia and it is something that europeans and americans should be working on together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 24.12.2010 us foreign policy marked by continuity , says former national security adviser großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us national security adviser stephen hadley in an interview with dw , stephen hadley speaks about the continuity between president obama and his predecessor bush that surprised many people and why he views the west bank as a bright spot in the middle east . stephen hadley served as national security adviser to president george w. bush from 2005 to 2009 and as deputy national security adviser from 2001 to 2005 .
he is currently a senior adviser for international affairs at the united states institute of peace and a principal in the rice hadley group . deutsche welle : let 's look back at us and european foreign and security policy this year and take a tally of some major issues .
in afghanistan 2010 was the deadliest year for the international troops with more than 700 soldiers killed , most of them american .
has president obama 's surge strategy failed ?
stephen hadley : there 's been an initial assessment which has not been released publicly in all its detail .
but i think the administration 's assessment , and i think it 's right , is that the strategy of the united states and other allies including most europeans who are with us on the ground in afghanistan is making progress .
it 's slower than we would like , it 's fragile and reversible , but there has been progress .
and i think one of the good things about 2010 is that there has been a coming together of europeans and americans about the importance of afghanistan and about how to pursue our strategy .
president obama has said the us would begin to pull troops out of afghanistan in 2011 , the british have said they may do the same and germany has announced its plans to start withdrawing troops next year as well .
when the three biggest troop contributors start pulling back , can the war in afghanistan still be won ?
yes , because the lede here is not that the troops are pulling back , the lede is that the united states and its allies believe that they will be able to begin to transfer security responsibility to the afghans .
remember , americans and europeans have for several years now been training and helping the afghans to build an army and police that can take increasing security responsibility .
and afghan forces are operating with american and nato and other european forces in afghanistan now , so what the president said was that in 2011 we could begin the process of transferring security responsibility to afghan units and as that occurred it would allow some units of american and european origin to begin to withdraw .
but president obama has been clear , and particularly secretary gates has been clear that that handover of security responsibility to afghanistan and any withdrawal of american forces will be condition-based .
that is to say it will have to reflect progress and security on the ground and will be done in a way that does not jeopardize the progress we have achieved or future progress .
another intractable international issue for the us and the eu is how to deal with iran 's nuclear program .
despite a united position by europeans and americans and tough new sanctions that were put in place in 2010 with the help of russia and china , there does n't seem to be a change of tehran 's stance .
is the west simply running out of options on iran ? i think the administration and our european allies have done a better job than i would have anticipated in getting the russians and the chinese to go along with very tough sanctions .
as you point out , regrettably , it has not resulted in a change of iranian policy on the nuclear issue .
and this is obviously a source of concern for all of us , because the worry is that if the region begins to conclude that the international community is not going to be able to prevent iran from having through its enrichment program a clear path to a nuclear weapon that is going to result in an emboldened iran , it is going to result in weakened arab states and it is going to result in arab states trying to develop their own nuclear programs which is a proliferation risk that will make the middle east less stable not more stable .
2010 was the year in which the obama administration like many before tried and failed to make progress on the peace process between israelis and palestinians because it could n't convince the israeli government to extend a settlement stop even for just a few months .
was the us foolish even to try again or has the us completely lost its leverage with both parties , but especially with the israeli government ?
i think the administration has said as much that the effort that began really soon after administration took power in january 2009 to get a construction freeze in the settlement areas did not work as the administration has intended .
what they had hoped to do was to send a strong message to the world that the administration was going to be even-handed between the israelis and palestinians .
that this message would be greeted in the arab world with steps to reach out toward israel and to begin rebuilding diplomatic relations between israel and the arab world and it simply did not work .
and rather than facilitating negotiations and progress on the negotiating table it became a barrier to negotiations .
it was a tactic , i think the administration would say , that did not work .
so they are trying to restart the process to have these proximity talks to try to turn the focus from settlement construction to what the focus should have been really from the beginning which is the terms of peace .
we can only hope that there will be some success in this effort .
but i think what is really good news for the prospects for peace is what is happening in the west bank .
that president abbas and prime minister salam fayad are building the institutions of a palestinian state even while under occupation .
they are now training security forces that are increasingly taking responsibility for security and are going after terrorists .
the israeli military is recognizing the effectiveness of these forces and cooperating with them .
the palestinians are building political institutions , economic activity and growth has returned to the west bank and there is peace , there is calm , that is to say .
there are no incidents of violence either in the west bank or in israel .
so in some sense while the negotiations seem to have foundered , the underpinnings of an ultimate peace , that is to say the institutions of a democratic palestinian state that is not supporting terror , but is maintaining peace and security for both palestinians and israelis , that process has gone forward .
and i think that is a bright spot and an essential element for an ultimate peace and a two-state solution in the middle east .
many us presidents engaged in foreign policy have a doctrine named after them that spells out their vision or version of america 's engagement with the world .
obama has now passed the half-time mark of his first term .
is there something that could be called an obama doctrine and if so how would you describe and compare it to other presidential doctrines like the so-called bush doctrine ?
i think the obama administration is still a work in progress on foreign policy .
i think they would say as much .
i think they want to be known as an administration that has engaged our adversaries .
i think that policy has had some mixed success i think with respect to north korea and chavez in venezuela and in iran .
and they have certainly been very firm on north korea about the prerequisites to resuming the six-party talks .
i think one of the things that has surprised a lot of people is while i think the administration has had a positive tone in how it has spoken to the arab world and how it has spoken to europe , i think there is a lot more continuity in the policies between president obama and president bush than a lot of people expected .
and that 's not unusual .
in the united states , while we have presidential elections that are waged and fought based often on differences in foreign policy , when new administrations come in and see the problems that the prior administration has faced there is a high degree of continuity in policies between administrations .
and i think you see it in terms of the iraq policy , afghanistan policy and policies dealing with the terrorist threat .
so i think there have been some positive changes in tone .
some have succeeded , some have not .
but i think there has also been a high degree and a useful degree of continuity with the policies of its predecessor administrations .
if you had to give a grade to the obama administration for its foreign policy for this year or for the past two years what grade would that be ?
i think any foreign policy in the first two years generally gets an incomplete .
that is to say , the first year they are figuring out what their policies should be .
the second year they begin to roll out those policies in a more serious way , but it takes another year or two to know whether they are working .
so i think almost any administration in the second year gets an incomplete .
let 's switch to transatlantic affairs : one year ago with lady ashton and herman van rompuy , two relatively obscure politicians were chosen as the eu 's first new president and foreign minister .
the us has long complained about the lack of a common european stance on many international issues .
does washington now finally know which numbers to call in europe ? i think there is a feeling that the economic crisis that we have been through has put a lot of strain on the european project .
so i think most americans think that because of the challenge presented by the economic crisis there is a certain amount of introspection going on within europe about where it is going in terms of its political and economic integration .
i think that is very understandable .
the economic crisis has been a real blow to the entire world and it 's going to take some time to work it through . so i think most americans would say there has been a little bit of a pause in the european project of political and economic integration .
that has been a project that the united states has supported for 50 years , both republican and democratic administrations , and one that we want to succeed .
but understandably there is some soul searching going on in the europeans and we need to let our european allies work these issues through .
barack obama has been described as the first us president who is not an atlanticist naturally inclined toward europe , but rather toward asia .
this and the often quoted rise of asia has led some europeans to worry about the nature and future of the transatlantic relationship .
how healthy is the transatlantic relationship today and how important will it be in the future ? i have been in washington for over 40 years and sort of every 10 years somebody comes up and declares the end of the transatlantic relationship .
and so far all those predictions have been premature .
i think this is really the oldest affiliation for the united states this strong relationship with europe .
i think it continues to remain strong and will remain strong from administration to administration .
that said , the rise of asia and major new world powers in asia such as china and india is getting a lot of attention in the united states .
and it is getting a lot of attention in europe .
germany 's economic recovery is heavily driven by exports to asia , so it is not surprising that both in europe and in the united states there is a lot of discussion about asia and ties toward asia .
that is to say , how can meet the rise of new great powers in asia and how can we turn the rise of those great powers and the economic growth and the economic engine that asia is right now literally pulling the world out of recession , how can we turn that so that it is an opportunity for greater peace and prosperity for the world as a whole .
i think that 's the task in asia and it is something that europeans and americans should be working on together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de berlin -pipe- 24.12.2010 underneath the commercial glitter , berliners believe in christmas tradition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these past two decades , the festive season in berlin has been changing almost as rapidly as the capital itself .
but when it comes to christmas , some old habits are reluctant to die . many years ago , back in the days when berlin was new to me and latte macchiato had yet to be imported to prenzlauer berg 's kastanienallee , i remember christmas being a quiet and even gentle affair .
seasons greetings were not splashed across the fronts of thousands of garish cards , nor were they blasted from brass bands at shoppers too busy hunting down their must-haves of the year to stop and lend an ear .
christmas trees were rarely seen in advance of the first advent and their decorations consisted almost entirely of straw stars on skinny red string .
that same year , i received a parcel from england containing presents wrapped in stylish paper .
i recall a german friend who was with me at the time , studying the design and wondering why shop owners here could n't find a way to stock the same kind of thing .
fast forward fifteen years and he need ask no more .
it arrived at around the same time as the cards emblazoned with christmas wishes , often enough in english , and the multi-colored baubles which shine more brightly than any straw star could ever hope to .
shopping up a storm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas shopping en-masse and it is in precisely such paper that shoppers like the thousands i bumped into yesterday evening when i ventured out to friedrichstrasse -lrb- all in the name of research -rrb- will be using to wrap the gifts they had to tramp through icy temperatures and piles of snow to buy .
when the shops closed last night , hundreds of people flocked to the one mega book store that stays open until midnight .
i splashed through the sludgy brown puddles at its threshold to see what all the fuss was about .
i was surprised to see berliners , who are ordinarily cautious spenders , behaving with such reckless purchasing abandon .
the scene , which i 'm sure was being repeated all over the city , would have been excellent fodder for anyone who holds that christmas in berlin has become a sacrilegious shopping fest .
and there are plenty who would say just that .
the other side of christmas but i 'd argue that such a complaint is too black and white .
it 's clearly true that glitz and gifts are gaining momentum at christmas time - which ca n't be a bad thing from an economic point of view - but shopping and tradition have never been mutually exclusive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner dom might be big , but come christmas eve , it can also be very full on christmas eve last year , someone in my family decided we ought to go to midnight mass at the berliner dom .
i do n't go every year or very often at all for that matter , but it sounded like a nice idea , so off we trundled .
we arrived in plenty of time , only to find that there was no room .
the place was even more packed than that sprawling bookstore a little way down the road .
we tried st. hedwig 's cathedral , but could n't get in there either .
the irony of being turned away on christmas eve was not lost on us , but we did what others have clearly done before us and kept on looking .
and in our case we did n't need a bed for the night , just somewhere to stand for the duration of the service .
we tramped on to two other churches before we found a corner in the marienkirche into which we could settle .
looking back , it is hard to imagine that of all those people who turned out that night , none had walked the same streets in the preceding days in search of gifts for the people they hold dear .
i wo n't be in berlin this christmas or i might just be tempted -lrb- in the name of research -rrb- to go back and see if there are any faces i recognise from my recent expedition to friedrichstrasse .

the effect is a slump in retail sales and restaurant closures . the party is over for many in ireland , and this christmas retailers and restaurateurs have been bearing the brunt of cutbacks . irish people are spending less and staying in more , with a recent survey finding that almost 80 percent of firms did not pay for or effectively canceled the staff christmas party this year .
ireland 's holiday frugality has hit the restaurant sector badly , which is already struggling in the recession .
the restaurant association of ireland says it 's been a very tight christmas and 2011 is looking bleak .
" business has dropped by about 40 percent for the first two weeks of december and we do n't see any uptake at the moment , " said adrian cummins , ceo of the restaurant association .
" people are tightening their belts and they 're not spending on luxury items and goods and unfortunately the restaurant industry is part of that sector that has been hit by cutbacks . "
one restaurant per day statistics show one restaurant per day is closing in ireland , 80 percent of restaurants are running at a loss , and about 21,000 thousand jobs are at risk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diners in restaurants keep an eye on the price cummins says christmas is a critical time of year for restaurants - making up almost a quarter of their annual income .
but he says people are choosing to stay at home and if they do go out , they 're dining in cheaper eateries .
" people may be not going for the high-end christmas lunch and people are looking at how much they spend when they actually go out for their christmas parties , " said cummins .
" ireland -lsb- is -rsb- a sociable nation .
we like to go out and eat out and drink as well but -lsb- spending in restaurants -rsb- is considerably down . "
deals not decadence for retailers the story is n't much better .
sales have slumped an average of 20 percent .
shoppers on the streets of dublin city centre say they 've been cutting back on food and presents or shopping online .
" we 'd go a bit further for the grandchildren , " says one woman in dublin , " we 're not doing that this year .
we 're more or less looking for sale stuff because we do n't what ahead of us basically " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are taking their euros north there 's been a rise in cross-border shopping with more people heading to northern ireland to take advantage of cheaper prices there , as well .
the latest study by aa ireland says 1 in 20 motorists will head north over the festive season .
torlach denihan , the director of retail ireland , says stores in the republic of ireland are working to battle the cross-border competition .
" currently cross-border shopping is not a significant issue , " he said .
" it was an enormous issue for the retail sector 12 or 18 months ago , but at the moment it does n't really figure .
the reason for that is retailers have cut their prices in ireland and they 're in a better place to compete with the counterparts in the north . "
keeping business , keeping jobs a survey by ebay has found over 50 percent of irish consumers will shop online over the christmas and new year period as families try and make their euros stretch further .
this is already impacting shops which are trying to survive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many business have been forced to close up shop denihan estimates that 47,000 people have so far lost their jobs in the retail sector since the recession hit ireland " in a country like ireland with a population of 4.4 million and a workforce of just over 2 million , 47,000 jobs is very significant , " he said .
" there are people who 've lost jobs in every part of ireland .
in every community , retail employment has been hit . "
a looming general election and the implementation of stringent budgetary measures in the new year will no doubt have an impact on the spending habits of the irish people .
but the real challenge facing the retail and restaurant sector will be staying open and staying in business .

andsnes talked with dw about one program he selected , from which you can hear excerpts below . as pianist in residence with the berlin philharmonic orchestra this season , leif ove andsnes brings a devotion to chamber music that he has maintained alongside an international career as a soloist .
his most recent album of rachmaninov ’ s third and fourth piano concertos with antonio pappano and the london symphony orchestra quickly won widespread critical acclaim .
andsnes spoke to dw about the program he selected for the second concert of his residency in berlin and his upcoming plans .
click below to listen to andsnes and members of the berlin philharmonic live from a concert on december 12 , 2010 .
dw : together with marc-andre hamelin you have performed the four-hand version of stravinsky 's " rite of spring " in risor , brussels , london , new york , and now berlin .
what fascinates you about the piece ?
leif ove andsnes : the " rite of spring " has perhaps more appeal than any other piece of the 20th century .
its energy and rhythms excite people more than any other piece i know .
the harmonies and sheer tension are unbelievable .
it is so iconic that you ca n't imagine someone sitting down and writing it .
stravinsky said himself that he felt like a vessel - that the music just came from somewhere - and he wrote it down very quickly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian composers are in the spotlight this season for the berlin philharmonic why did you choose two of the other pieces in the program , stravinsky 's septet and alfred schnittke 's piano quintet ?
since the philharmonic has a focus on russian music this season , i paired them to show two very different sides of russian music .
the septet was written forty years after the " rite " and shows a giant leap in stravinsky 's language , with the end result very playful and theatrical .
the schnittke , on the other hand , seems born entirely out of an emotional state of grief and sorrow , colored by the death of his mother .
it sometimes sounds like music from the other side , from a different planet .
can you describe your passion for chamber music ?
for me it is the most natural form of music-making , just a few friends coming together to play .
why should it be considered a niche or elitist ?
it is as normal as a rock band gathering in a garage .
just give me a violinist and a cellist , and we can play a trio .
chamber music is also essential in a musician 's development because you have to listen to others and find your place within the landscape of a piece , whether you have the foreground or background .
it 's also a great way to get to know people and a lot of fun .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andsnes will perform with the berlin philharmonic into the summer of 2011 what new projects do you have coming up ?
one thing that will be very much in focus over the next four to five years is beethoven .
having just turned 40 , i feel i 've come to a point in my life where i have to play the greatest , most important music of all .
i will play and record his concertos .
i will also play his sonatas .
what will your personal highlights be as pianist in residence with the berlin philharmonic ?
i ’ m very excited to play brahms 's second piano concerto with bernhard haitink .
i 'll be working with him for the first time .
i ’ m also very much looking forward to a chamber music project in may with students in the orchestra ’ s academy .
we will perform two mozart works and the dvorak piano quintet , a fantastic piece that i played and fell in love with as a student .
what do you hope to get out of the residency with the philharmonic ?
it already feels like i have a base in berlin for this season , which is nice .
in this profession there is a lot of jumping around so you start to want to feel at home in a few places .
and it 's a tremendous experience to play with this fantastic orchestra . what do you like about being in berlin ?
one always has the feeling berlin is on the cutting edge of what 's happening creatively .
i know many freelance musicians who love the way of life here .
it 's absolutely one of the world 's great musical capitals with so many quality orchestras and opera .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer affairs -pipe- 24.12.2010 economists flag indebted underclass problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debt problems are increasing amongst german consumers private debt is becoming a problem that some germans can not escape .
a recent study shows that women and young people under 30 are sliding particularly quickly into the red . about 6.5 million germans are currently struggling with debt – that 's almost 10 percent of the adult population .
this year alone saw 290,000 new debtors join their ranks with average liabilities of 35,000 euros .
as a result , the number of private insolvencies in germany is expected to rise 11 percent this year .
it 's the first time since 2007 that the number of people falling into debt has risen , according to a study by creditreform , a business information service specializing in risk and debt analysis .
" the increase in over-indebtedness is a delayed reaction to the economic crisis , " michael bretz , creditreform 's head of the economic research , told deutsche welle .
one of the most worrying trends is a rise in the number of young people with money problems .
the past year saw 54,000 teenagers develop debt problems - an increase of 38 percent on the previous year and the biggest increase among any age group .
bretz puts this down to excessive consumerism .
" young people want to consume more than older ones to compensate for their low status , " bretz said .
young people also do n't fully understand their finances .
according to a recent study by social research company forsa , almost one third of 16 year olds didn ’ t know that it would take longer to pay off a loan of 2000 euro at 50 euro per month as opposed to saving that amount .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bretz worries that ghettos are developing in germany inherited debt bretz believes that people learn financial habits from their parents and warns that a sort of " debt mentality " is being passed on from generation to generation - and that there is a certain part of german society that does n't seem able to manage its money .
" they see that their parents do n't work , how they live with debt status , with their income , and that it is possible , " bretz said .
" their children will inherit this status . "
about two million people in germany are expected to stay in debt for the rest of their lives , he added .
as the german economy picks up , consumers are buying large items on credit again .
as a result , bretz expects the number of people burdened with excessive debt will increase even further .
" we have seen an increase in consumer loans , " bretz said .
" i think people are more relaxed than in the crisis and so they spend more money , especially in these days before christmas . "
a greater variety of payment options , such as paying on store cards , credit cards , over the internet and zero percent finance offers , has increased debt levels in germany .
" most people who come to me have debts at credit institutions , like overdrafts and loans , " thomas kroeger , a debt advisor in engelskirchen told deutsche welle .
" 40 percent owe money to mail order companies and every fifth person has overdue mobile phone bills . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroeger worries that more teenagers are getting in the red divorce and debt women are especially prone to debt problems during separation and divorce because although they often have lower incomes than their partners , they can still be held liable for joint loans or contracts signed when they were together .
diana , an unemployed 26-year-old mother from western germany , racked up 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,970 -rrb- of debt to 14 different creditors after she split up with her boyfriend .
when diana moved into a new flat she bought most of the furniture on credit .
at the time she was earning good money as an office clerk and was able to pay back her installments comfortably .
but then she became unemployed .
" when you lose your job , your world is destroyed and you ask how can i pay for my rent , telephone , electricity and gas ? " she said .
in addition to her furniture , diana is still paying off her bank overdraft , joint mobile phone contracts , insurance , and mail order purchases .
" it 's really dangerous .
when you see zero percent offers on tv , it entices you to buy so much .
and you buy things that you simply do n't need , " she told deutsche welle .
when diana was unable to find a new job , she found herself living off so-called " harz iv " social security payments worth just 323 euros per month .
" at some point i lost track of things and did n't know what i should pay for first , " she said .
" i was getting nasty letters in the post , telling me if you do n't pay , then this and that will happen and the bailiff will come . "
bildunterschrift : many women develop debt problems following divorce or separation a casual attitude to debt diana went to see a debt advisor – a service that 's free of charge in germany if you 're unemployed .
he wrote to all of her creditors , who agreed to halve her debt and free her of interest payments .
she now pays a total of 10 euros per month , which is shared out between her creditors .
it 's a small amount , but one she should always be able to afford , even on the lowest level of benefits .
" if i could do it again , i would save up my money , rather than buy things on credit and take out loans , ” she said .
“ i only use a pay-as-you-go mobile phone now , " she added .
while diana 's debts are now manageable , her partner is almost 20,000 euros in the red and faces private insolvency proceedings .
that means for six years , any income exceeding his basic living expenses will be automatically forfeited to creditors .
after that his debts will be wiped – a chance for a fresh start .
the fact that diana 's partner has a low income means he only pays 40 euros per month to his creditors .
his six years of repayments will amount to just 2,880 euros - an amount diana finds astonishingly low given the size of the original debt .
" it 's laughable really .
it 's like an easy ' alternative way ' to deal with one 's debts .
at the end you can say , that was it , my debts are gone now " .
bretz warns that there 's a danger of people using private insolvency too casually – an easy solution to freeing oneself of debts after overindulging .
" there are more and more people who see this possibility and use it in a very rational way .
they see it as a solution to their debt problems , " bretz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer affairs -pipe- 24.12.2010 economists flag indebted underclass problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debt problems are increasing amongst german consumers private debt is becoming a problem that some germans can not escape .
a recent study shows that women and young people under 30 are sliding particularly quickly into the red . about 6.5 million germans are currently struggling with debt – that 's almost 10 percent of the adult population .
this year alone saw 290,000 new debtors join their ranks with average liabilities of 35,000 euros .
as a result , the number of private insolvencies in germany is expected to rise 11 percent this year .
it 's the first time since 2007 that the number of people falling into debt has risen , according to a study by creditreform , a business information service specializing in risk and debt analysis .
" the increase in over-indebtedness is a delayed reaction to the economic crisis , " michael bretz , creditreform 's head of the economic research , told deutsche welle .
one of the most worrying trends is a rise in the number of young people with money problems .
the past year saw 54,000 teenagers develop debt problems - an increase of 38 percent on the previous year and the biggest increase among any age group .
bretz puts this down to excessive consumerism .
" young people want to consume more than older ones to compensate for their low status , " bretz said .
young people also do n't fully understand their finances .
according to a recent study by social research company forsa , almost one third of 16 year olds didn ’ t know that it would take longer to pay off a loan of 2000 euro at 50 euro per month as opposed to saving that amount .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bretz worries that ghettos are developing in germany inherited debt bretz believes that people learn financial habits from their parents and warns that a sort of " debt mentality " is being passed on from generation to generation - and that there is a certain part of german society that does n't seem able to manage its money .
" they see that their parents do n't work , how they live with debt status , with their income , and that it is possible , " bretz said .
" their children will inherit this status . "
about two million people in germany are expected to stay in debt for the rest of their lives , he added .
as the german economy picks up , consumers are buying large items on credit again .
as a result , bretz expects the number of people burdened with excessive debt will increase even further .
" we have seen an increase in consumer loans , " bretz said .
" i think people are more relaxed than in the crisis and so they spend more money , especially in these days before christmas . "
a greater variety of payment options , such as paying on store cards , credit cards , over the internet and zero percent finance offers , has increased debt levels in germany .
" most people who come to me have debts at credit institutions , like overdrafts and loans , " thomas kroeger , a debt advisor in engelskirchen told deutsche welle .
" 40 percent owe money to mail order companies and every fifth person has overdue mobile phone bills . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroeger worries that more teenagers are getting in the red divorce and debt women are especially prone to debt problems during separation and divorce because although they often have lower incomes than their partners , they can still be held liable for joint loans or contracts signed when they were together .
diana , an unemployed 26-year-old mother from western germany , racked up 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,970 -rrb- of debt to 14 different creditors after she split up with her boyfriend .
when diana moved into a new flat she bought most of the furniture on credit .
at the time she was earning good money as an office clerk and was able to pay back her installments comfortably .
but then she became unemployed .
" when you lose your job , your world is destroyed and you ask how can i pay for my rent , telephone , electricity and gas ? " she said .
in addition to her furniture , diana is still paying off her bank overdraft , joint mobile phone contracts , insurance , and mail order purchases .
" it 's really dangerous .
when you see zero percent offers on tv , it entices you to buy so much .
and you buy things that you simply do n't need , " she told deutsche welle .
when diana was unable to find a new job , she found herself living off so-called " harz iv " social security payments worth just 323 euros per month .
" at some point i lost track of things and did n't know what i should pay for first , " she said .
" i was getting nasty letters in the post , telling me if you do n't pay , then this and that will happen and the bailiff will come . "
bildunterschrift : many women develop debt problems following divorce or separation a casual attitude to debt diana went to see a debt advisor – a service that 's free of charge in germany if you 're unemployed .
he wrote to all of her creditors , who agreed to halve her debt and free her of interest payments .
she now pays a total of 10 euros per month , which is shared out between her creditors .
it 's a small amount , but one she should always be able to afford , even on the lowest level of benefits .
" if i could do it again , i would save up my money , rather than buy things on credit and take out loans , ” she said .
“ i only use a pay-as-you-go mobile phone now , " she added .
while diana 's debts are now manageable , her partner is almost 20,000 euros in the red and faces private insolvency proceedings .
that means for six years , any income exceeding his basic living expenses will be automatically forfeited to creditors .
after that his debts will be wiped – a chance for a fresh start .
the fact that diana 's partner has a low income means he only pays 40 euros per month to his creditors .
his six years of repayments will amount to just 2,880 euros - an amount diana finds astonishingly low given the size of the original debt .
" it 's laughable really .
it 's like an easy ' alternative way ' to deal with one 's debts .
at the end you can say , that was it , my debts are gone now " .
bretz warns that there 's a danger of people using private insolvency too casually – an easy solution to freeing oneself of debts after overindulging .
" there are more and more people who see this possibility and use it in a very rational way .
they see it as a solution to their debt problems , " bretz said .

andsnes talked with dw about one program he selected , from which you can hear excerpts below . as pianist in residence with the berlin philharmonic orchestra this season , leif ove andsnes brings a devotion to chamber music that he has maintained alongside an international career as a soloist .
his most recent album of rachmaninov ’ s third and fourth piano concertos with antonio pappano and the london symphony orchestra quickly won widespread critical acclaim .
andsnes spoke to dw about the program he selected for the second concert of his residency in berlin and his upcoming plans .
click below to listen to andsnes and members of the berlin philharmonic live from a concert on december 12 , 2010 .
dw : together with marc-andre hamelin you have performed the four-hand version of stravinsky 's " rite of spring " in risor , brussels , london , new york , and now berlin .
what fascinates you about the piece ?
leif ove andsnes : the " rite of spring " has perhaps more appeal than any other piece of the 20th century .
its energy and rhythms excite people more than any other piece i know .
the harmonies and sheer tension are unbelievable .
it is so iconic that you ca n't imagine someone sitting down and writing it .
stravinsky said himself that he felt like a vessel - that the music just came from somewhere - and he wrote it down very quickly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian composers are in the spotlight this season for the berlin philharmonic why did you choose two of the other pieces in the program , stravinsky 's septet and alfred schnittke 's piano quintet ?
since the philharmonic has a focus on russian music this season , i paired them to show two very different sides of russian music .
the septet was written forty years after the " rite " and shows a giant leap in stravinsky 's language , with the end result very playful and theatrical .
the schnittke , on the other hand , seems born entirely out of an emotional state of grief and sorrow , colored by the death of his mother .
it sometimes sounds like music from the other side , from a different planet .
can you describe your passion for chamber music ?
for me it is the most natural form of music-making , just a few friends coming together to play .
why should it be considered a niche or elitist ?
it is as normal as a rock band gathering in a garage .
just give me a violinist and a cellist , and we can play a trio .
chamber music is also essential in a musician 's development because you have to listen to others and find your place within the landscape of a piece , whether you have the foreground or background .
it 's also a great way to get to know people and a lot of fun .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andsnes will perform with the berlin philharmonic into the summer of 2011 what new projects do you have coming up ?
one thing that will be very much in focus over the next four to five years is beethoven .
having just turned 40 , i feel i 've come to a point in my life where i have to play the greatest , most important music of all .
i will play and record his concertos .
i will also play his sonatas .
what will your personal highlights be as pianist in residence with the berlin philharmonic ?
i ’ m very excited to play brahms 's second piano concerto with bernhard haitink .
i 'll be working with him for the first time .
i ’ m also very much looking forward to a chamber music project in may with students in the orchestra ’ s academy .
we will perform two mozart works and the dvorak piano quintet , a fantastic piece that i played and fell in love with as a student .
what do you hope to get out of the residency with the philharmonic ?
it already feels like i have a base in berlin for this season , which is nice .
in this profession there is a lot of jumping around so you start to want to feel at home in a few places .
and it 's a tremendous experience to play with this fantastic orchestra . what do you like about being in berlin ?
one always has the feeling berlin is on the cutting edge of what 's happening creatively .
i know many freelance musicians who love the way of life here .
it 's absolutely one of the world 's great musical capitals with so many quality orchestras and opera .

if the trend of german shoppers continues , good business could continue after the holidays as well . a lot of german kids are going to think santa was especially generous this year when they open their christmas presents .
even the adults are likely to notice a few more presents under the tree as in 2009 .
according to the german retail association , germans have n't spent as much money on gifts during a holiday season since 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there may be a few more gifts under german trees for november and december , the association estimates total revenues of 77 billion euro -lrb- $ 101 billion -rrb- for the retail sector - 2.5 percent more than last year .
" people have n't let the chaotic winter ruin their shopping plans , " stefan genth , head of the trade union hde , told deutsche welle .
genth says that the economic crisis in germany was over surprisingly quickly .
germans saved money during the year in order to be able to afford something special for christmas , such as a nice watch or jewelry .
at the top of many christmas lists in snowy germany are winter sports items , such as sleds , skis , or ice skates .
warm winter clothes are also in high demand .
in many stores , supply of sleds and snow shovels is running low .
the demand for gloves is sometimes twice what retailers have in stock. ipads and inscriptions if a christmas wish is not snow-related , then there 's a good chance it has to do with staying inside and avoiding it .
electronic devices , including video and computer games are sought-after items as well .
in an interview with the french news agency afp , august-wilhelm scheer , head of the electronic branch 's bitkom association , said the electronic branch was " very satisfied " with their holiday business , and that it was " significantly better " than last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ipads are in high demand the high-tech gadget of the year is without a doubt the ipad .
it and other tablet-pcs have established themselves as a new class among laptop computers .
according to bitkom , around 450,000 tablet-pcs were sold in 2010 .
sales for online retailers are experiencing a boom like never before as well .
many germans want to give personalized gifts , but they do n't always have the time to take care of it themselves .
instead , they take care of a special gift with a few clicks of the mouse .
claudia helming is the head of dawanda , an online marketplace for handmade products that opened in 2006 in berlin .
she says customized jewelry , such as a silver necklace engraved with a name or a phrase , is quite popular .
dawanda gets about 30,000 orders per day - more than twice as many as last year .
trend continues past christmas while some germans go for the one-of-a-kind gifts , many others go completely generic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snow and cold kept people out of christmas markets recent studies indicate that every second present that will be opened on christmas eve is a gift certificate .
hde 's stefan genth says most of the gift certificates will be cashed in during the week between christmas and new year 's eve , making him optimistic that the booming retail business in germany will continue past the holidays .
he also expects that many people will carry out planned shopping sprees that had to be put off because of bad weather .
while the retail sector seems to have come through germany 's early winter quite well , the opposite is true for businesses operating at germany 's christmas markets .
the exceptionally cold weather and snowfall meant that many people opted to stay home instead of patronizing the stalls of the christmas market .
unlike holiday shopping sprees , a trip to the christmas market can not be pushed back a few weeks : after december 23 , the german christmas markets close up shop until next year .

the effect is a slump in retail sales and restaurant closures . the party is over for many in ireland , and this christmas retailers and restaurateurs have been bearing the brunt of cutbacks . irish people are spending less and staying in more , with a recent survey finding that almost 80 percent of firms did not pay for or effectively canceled the staff christmas party this year .
ireland 's holiday frugality has hit the restaurant sector badly , which is already struggling in the recession .
the restaurant association of ireland says it 's been a very tight christmas and 2011 is looking bleak .
" business has dropped by about 40 percent for the first two weeks of december and we do n't see any uptake at the moment , " said adrian cummins , ceo of the restaurant association .
" people are tightening their belts and they 're not spending on luxury items and goods and unfortunately the restaurant industry is part of that sector that has been hit by cutbacks . "
one restaurant per day statistics show one restaurant per day is closing in ireland , 80 percent of restaurants are running at a loss , and about 21,000 thousand jobs are at risk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diners in restaurants keep an eye on the price cummins says christmas is a critical time of year for restaurants - making up almost a quarter of their annual income .
but he says people are choosing to stay at home and if they do go out , they 're dining in cheaper eateries .
" people may be not going for the high-end christmas lunch and people are looking at how much they spend when they actually go out for their christmas parties , " said cummins .
" ireland -lsb- is -rsb- a sociable nation .
we like to go out and eat out and drink as well but -lsb- spending in restaurants -rsb- is considerably down . "
deals not decadence for retailers the story is n't much better .
sales have slumped an average of 20 percent .
shoppers on the streets of dublin city centre say they 've been cutting back on food and presents or shopping online .
" we 'd go a bit further for the grandchildren , " says one woman in dublin , " we 're not doing that this year .
we 're more or less looking for sale stuff because we do n't what ahead of us basically " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are taking their euros north there 's been a rise in cross-border shopping with more people heading to northern ireland to take advantage of cheaper prices there , as well .
the latest study by aa ireland says 1 in 20 motorists will head north over the festive season .
torlach denihan , the director of retail ireland , says stores in the republic of ireland are working to battle the cross-border competition .
" currently cross-border shopping is not a significant issue , " he said .
" it was an enormous issue for the retail sector 12 or 18 months ago , but at the moment it does n't really figure .
the reason for that is retailers have cut their prices in ireland and they 're in a better place to compete with the counterparts in the north . "
keeping business , keeping jobs a survey by ebay has found over 50 percent of irish consumers will shop online over the christmas and new year period as families try and make their euros stretch further .
this is already impacting shops which are trying to survive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many business have been forced to close up shop denihan estimates that 47,000 people have so far lost their jobs in the retail sector since the recession hit ireland " in a country like ireland with a population of 4.4 million and a workforce of just over 2 million , 47,000 jobs is very significant , " he said .
" there are people who 've lost jobs in every part of ireland .
in every community , retail employment has been hit . "
a looming general election and the implementation of stringent budgetary measures in the new year will no doubt have an impact on the spending habits of the irish people .
but the real challenge facing the retail and restaurant sector will be staying open and staying in business .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.12.2010 rise of electric cars prompt ' smart ' electrical grids in portugal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nissan leaf will launch in portugal in january portugal ’ s long-term target of 750,000 electric cars fits with its smart energy plans .
already , the country has 40 percent of its energy coming from renewable sources . the launch in portugal in january of nissan 's leaf marks the start of the rollout in europe of what the company says is the first 100 percent electric car aimed at a mass market .
nissan targeted portugal - where it will also soon be assembling batteries for the leaf - after that country 's government agreed to setting up a national network of charging points .
in fact , the network is to be compatible with any make of electric car , and is part of still more ambitious long-term plans for a genuinely " smart grid " that could help portugal make fuller use of its fast-expanding renewable energy capacity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government wants to expand its network of charging stations in early december , amid ultra-modern architecture at the former site of the expo 98 world fair in lisbon , members of the portuguese public got the chance to test drive the leaf .
portuguese consumers are curious about electric cars comments ranged from the polite to the enthusiastic , with the lack of engine noise the most obvious characteristic of what at first glance looks like a regular five-seater family run-around .
but the very lack of engine noise creates some new " problems . "
" for instance , the headlamps have a specific design to avoid air going to the mirrors , " said antónio joaquim , the communications director of nissan iberia portugal .
" the exterior mirrors on a normal car produce a lot of noise with the wind .
but on this car , which does n't make any noise from the engine , all the very small noises that on other cars are not perceptible are - let 's say , uncomfortable . "
the more obvious matter of charging the car seems straightforward : a small panel on the bonnet opens to reveal something rather similar to an ordinary electric plug .
" if you want to charge when you are parking inside a garage in your own house or in a shopping centre , it 's better to have it on the bonnet , " joaquim added .
" it 's a completely different usage from a combustion engine .
you just charge the car during your daily life . "
charging stations are scarce for now , but are expected to increase there are two charging options : a partial quick charge , for example when you are on the motorway and do not want to stop for long , or a cheaper slow charge of up to eight hours .
prospective buyers in lisbon seemed to take the limitations of electric cars on board .
" it 's a nice car , and a good prospect for someone like me who has an urban life , and drives about 30 or 40 kilometres to work and back , " said one man , who declined to give his name .
the innovative design of the leaf 's lithium batteries means that you can drive the car for longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotor 's editor thinks that the european car of the year jury missed out on the prius but even a fully-charged leaf has a more limited range than a car with a full fuel tank .
so the fact that it recently was named european car of the year - the first completely electric vehicle to do so - raised some eyebrows .
antónio pereira , editor of portuguese car magazine automotor , told deutsche welle he suspected the competition 's jury may have been anxious not to miss a trick , having previously failed to garland the first version of the toyota prius , which later became a hit .
the nissan leaf is , he said , an interesting experiment , and portugal a suitably small testing ground , but with some problems .
" recharging stations are still few -lsb- in number -rsb- and mainly in the big cities , " he said .
" and in portugal we mainly live in apartments .
so either you have a parking space in your building or you have to recharge at night in the public recharging station .
that 's complicated because there wo n't be one for each . "
portugal pushing for dynmaic energy flow in its ' smart grid ' still , the spread of on-street charging points in portugal is the reason the leaf is getting its european launch in the country .
the government-led mobi.e consortium is installing 1,300 chargers around the country , compatible with all makes of car .
in addition , the state is offering a 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- subsidy for buyers of electric cars - bringing the leaf 's price down to 30,000 euro - and a road-tax exemption .
portugal 's ambitious declared long-term target of 750,000 electric vehicles on its roads also fits with plans to expand its renewable energy output , going some way to addressing sceptics ' argument that electric cars ' environmental impact depends on where their power comes from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government is subsidizing the purchase price of electric cars " we have defined as a target to be the first country to have a nationwide and comprehensive infrastructure for vehicles and to work to give the necessary framework and incentives so that we can massively introduce the electric vehicle , " luís reis of mobi.e explained at a trade fair earlier this year .
" this is important not only in terms of the sustainability of mobility but also in terms of the strategy that we have for energy . "
portuguese society has high reliance on renewable sources portugal - for decades heavily reliant on imported oil for its energy needs - now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables , and rising .
and officials overseeing the development of the electric grid envision a future in which drivers will actually be able to profit from helping ensure that same energy is used efficiently , when electric cars have full internet capability .
" you drive it home in the evening , plug -lsb- it in to -rsb- both internet and power , and the car starts receiving signals of electricity spot prices , " antónio vidigal , a director of privatised utility edp , one of the mobi.e partners , told a conference on climate change earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables " at night the price is low ; the car will charge overnight , " vidigal went on .
" next day you come to office , plug again into both plugs .
peak time energy will be expensive and the car may sell energy back to the network . "
as in many countries , hydro-electric dams in portugal already store excess energy from wind farms ; this is used to pump water uphill , to be used to generate power when demand is high .
now the groundwork is being laid for a smart grid that could see cars playing a similar role .
as the first step in what is to be a nationwide programme , edp in 2010 made évora in the alentejo , a city with a population of some 50,000 , the first " inovcity " in the future national " inovgrid . "
" consumers have access almost to real-time information as to their energy consumption , so they 'll be able to manage that better , " explained miguel andrade , a director of edp distribuição , the group 's distribution unit .
" from the company 's side obviously we hope to have operational efficiencies from this .
we hope to integrate more renewables , more micro-generation and eventually in the medium to long-term also the electric vehicle into the grid .
" i think we 're genuinely witnessing a revolution in the way we manage distribution networks . "
nissan investing in portugal but if it 's early days for integrating cars into this vision , what of today 's models ?
the leaf on show in lisbon can not , slot into a smart grid .
but , he said , the model is easily adapted .
" we are implementing the electric vehicles now , so we have to be cost efficient otherwise people would not buy them , " said antónio joaquim , nissan portugal communications director .
" that is why the cars do n't have this and the grid does n't have this capabilities .
" but from the utility 's point of view the technology is already known , from the car industry the technology is already known , so i do n't think that is a very difficult thing to implement later on .
it 's a question of software . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal has already begun rolling out electrical charging stations the leaf itself can already communicate with the charging point : identifying itself and its charging specifications and needs , as well as its owner - who will after all be paying for the power as part of the electricity bill sent to his home .
some environmentalists see models such as the leaf as primarily a public relations exercise for manufacturers that still devote most of their investment to conventional models .
nissan 's own projections for electric cars do not go beyond 10 percent of total sales .
but given that the company is building factories in japan , the us and the uk dedicated to making the leaf - and which it would be difficult and expensive to convert to make other cars - the company is perhaps not the prime target for such accusations .
" everybody in the automotive business is trying to do their own ' greenwash ' , promising ' green ' products - and most are less polluting than before , but not that green , " said antónio pereira , editor of automotor .
" i think nissan is probably taking a lot of risks with the electric car but it 's not doing greenwash - not at all . "

he is currently a senior adviser for international affairs at the united states institute of peace and a principal in the rice hadley group . deutsche welle : let 's look back at us and european foreign and security policy this year and take a tally of some major issues .
in afghanistan 2010 was the deadliest year for the international troops with more than 700 soldiers killed , most of them american .
has president obama 's surge strategy failed ?
stephen hadley : there 's been an initial assessment which has not been released publicly in all its detail .
but i think the administration 's assessment , and i think it 's right , is that the strategy of the united states and other allies including most europeans who are with us on the ground in afghanistan is making progress .
it 's slower than we would like , it 's fragile and reversible , but there has been progress .
and i think one of the good things about 2010 is that there has been a coming together of europeans and americans about the importance of afghanistan and about how to pursue our strategy .
president obama has said the us would begin to pull troops out of afghanistan in 2011 , the british have said they may do the same and germany has announced its plans to start withdrawing troops next year as well .
when the three biggest troop contributors start pulling back , can the war in afghanistan still be won ?
yes , because the lede here is not that the troops are pulling back , the lede is that the united states and its allies believe that they will be able to begin to transfer security responsibility to the afghans .
remember , americans and europeans have for several years now been training and helping the afghans to build an army and police that can take increasing security responsibility .
and afghan forces are operating with american and nato and other european forces in afghanistan now , so what the president said was that in 2011 we could begin the process of transferring security responsibility to afghan units and as that occurred it would allow some units of american and european origin to begin to withdraw .
but president obama has been clear , and particularly secretary gates has been clear that that handover of security responsibility to afghanistan and any withdrawal of american forces will be condition-based .
that is to say it will have to reflect progress and security on the ground and will be done in a way that does not jeopardize the progress we have achieved or future progress .
another intractable international issue for the us and the eu is how to deal with iran 's nuclear program .
despite a united position by europeans and americans and tough new sanctions that were put in place in 2010 with the help of russia and china , there does n't seem to be a change of tehran 's stance .
is the west simply running out of options on iran ? i think the administration and our european allies have done a better job than i would have anticipated in getting the russians and the chinese to go along with very tough sanctions .
as you point out , regrettably , it has not resulted in a change of iranian policy on the nuclear issue .
and this is obviously a source of concern for all of us , because the worry is that if the region begins to conclude that the international community is not going to be able to prevent iran from having through its enrichment program a clear path to a nuclear weapon that is going to result in an emboldened iran , it is going to result in weakened arab states and it is going to result in arab states trying to develop their own nuclear programs which is a proliferation risk that will make the middle east less stable not more stable .
2010 was the year in which the obama administration like many before tried and failed to make progress on the peace process between israelis and palestinians because it could n't convince the israeli government to extend a settlement stop even for just a few months .
was the us foolish even to try again or has the us completely lost its leverage with both parties , but especially with the israeli government ?
i think the administration has said as much that the effort that began really soon after administration took power in january 2009 to get a construction freeze in the settlement areas did not work as the administration has intended .
what they had hoped to do was to send a strong message to the world that the administration was going to be even-handed between the israelis and palestinians .
that this message would be greeted in the arab world with steps to reach out toward israel and to begin rebuilding diplomatic relations between israel and the arab world and it simply did not work .
and rather than facilitating negotiations and progress on the negotiating table it became a barrier to negotiations .
it was a tactic , i think the administration would say , that did not work .
so they are trying to restart the process to have these proximity talks to try to turn the focus from settlement construction to what the focus should have been really from the beginning which is the terms of peace .
we can only hope that there will be some success in this effort .
but i think what is really good news for the prospects for peace is what is happening in the west bank .
that president abbas and prime minister salam fayad are building the institutions of a palestinian state even while under occupation .
they are now training security forces that are increasingly taking responsibility for security and are going after terrorists .
the israeli military is recognizing the effectiveness of these forces and cooperating with them .
the palestinians are building political institutions , economic activity and growth has returned to the west bank and there is peace , there is calm , that is to say .
there are no incidents of violence either in the west bank or in israel .
so in some sense while the negotiations seem to have foundered , the underpinnings of an ultimate peace , that is to say the institutions of a democratic palestinian state that is not supporting terror , but is maintaining peace and security for both palestinians and israelis , that process has gone forward .
and i think that is a bright spot and an essential element for an ultimate peace and a two-state solution in the middle east .
many us presidents engaged in foreign policy have a doctrine named after them that spells out their vision or version of america 's engagement with the world .
obama has now passed the half-time mark of his first term .
is there something that could be called an obama doctrine and if so how would you describe and compare it to other presidential doctrines like the so-called bush doctrine ?
i think the obama administration is still a work in progress on foreign policy .
i think they would say as much .
i think they want to be known as an administration that has engaged our adversaries .
i think that policy has had some mixed success i think with respect to north korea and chavez in venezuela and in iran .
and they have certainly been very firm on north korea about the prerequisites to resuming the six-party talks .
i think one of the things that has surprised a lot of people is while i think the administration has had a positive tone in how it has spoken to the arab world and how it has spoken to europe , i think there is a lot more continuity in the policies between president obama and president bush than a lot of people expected .
and that 's not unusual .
in the united states , while we have presidential elections that are waged and fought based often on differences in foreign policy , when new administrations come in and see the problems that the prior administration has faced there is a high degree of continuity in policies between administrations .
and i think you see it in terms of the iraq policy , afghanistan policy and policies dealing with the terrorist threat .
so i think there have been some positive changes in tone .
some have succeeded , some have not .
but i think there has also been a high degree and a useful degree of continuity with the policies of its predecessor administrations .
if you had to give a grade to the obama administration for its foreign policy for this year or for the past two years what grade would that be ?
i think any foreign policy in the first two years generally gets an incomplete .
that is to say , the first year they are figuring out what their policies should be .
the second year they begin to roll out those policies in a more serious way , but it takes another year or two to know whether they are working .
so i think almost any administration in the second year gets an incomplete .
let 's switch to transatlantic affairs : one year ago with lady ashton and herman van rompuy , two relatively obscure politicians were chosen as the eu 's first new president and foreign minister .
the us has long complained about the lack of a common european stance on many international issues .
does washington now finally know which numbers to call in europe ? i think there is a feeling that the economic crisis that we have been through has put a lot of strain on the european project .
so i think most americans think that because of the challenge presented by the economic crisis there is a certain amount of introspection going on within europe about where it is going in terms of its political and economic integration .
i think that is very understandable .
the economic crisis has been a real blow to the entire world and it 's going to take some time to work it through . so i think most americans would say there has been a little bit of a pause in the european project of political and economic integration .
that has been a project that the united states has supported for 50 years , both republican and democratic administrations , and one that we want to succeed .
but understandably there is some soul searching going on in the europeans and we need to let our european allies work these issues through .
barack obama has been described as the first us president who is not an atlanticist naturally inclined toward europe , but rather toward asia .
this and the often quoted rise of asia has led some europeans to worry about the nature and future of the transatlantic relationship .
how healthy is the transatlantic relationship today and how important will it be in the future ? i have been in washington for over 40 years and sort of every 10 years somebody comes up and declares the end of the transatlantic relationship .
and so far all those predictions have been premature .
i think this is really the oldest affiliation for the united states this strong relationship with europe .
i think it continues to remain strong and will remain strong from administration to administration .
that said , the rise of asia and major new world powers in asia such as china and india is getting a lot of attention in the united states .
and it is getting a lot of attention in europe .
germany 's economic recovery is heavily driven by exports to asia , so it is not surprising that both in europe and in the united states there is a lot of discussion about asia and ties toward asia .
that is to say , how can meet the rise of new great powers in asia and how can we turn the rise of those great powers and the economic growth and the economic engine that asia is right now literally pulling the world out of recession , how can we turn that so that it is an opportunity for greater peace and prosperity for the world as a whole .
i think that 's the task in asia and it is something that europeans and americans should be working on together .

but when it comes to christmas , some old habits are reluctant to die . many years ago , back in the days when berlin was new to me and latte macchiato had yet to be imported to prenzlauer berg 's kastanienallee , i remember christmas being a quiet and even gentle affair .
seasons greetings were not splashed across the fronts of thousands of garish cards , nor were they blasted from brass bands at shoppers too busy hunting down their must-haves of the year to stop and lend an ear .
christmas trees were rarely seen in advance of the first advent and their decorations consisted almost entirely of straw stars on skinny red string .
that same year , i received a parcel from england containing presents wrapped in stylish paper .
i recall a german friend who was with me at the time , studying the design and wondering why shop owners here could n't find a way to stock the same kind of thing .
fast forward fifteen years and he need ask no more .
it arrived at around the same time as the cards emblazoned with christmas wishes , often enough in english , and the multi-colored baubles which shine more brightly than any straw star could ever hope to .

when the shops closed last night , hundreds of people flocked to the one mega book store that stays open until midnight .
i splashed through the sludgy brown puddles at its threshold to see what all the fuss was about .
i was surprised to see berliners , who are ordinarily cautious spenders , behaving with such reckless purchasing abandon .
the scene , which i 'm sure was being repeated all over the city , would have been excellent fodder for anyone who holds that christmas in berlin has become a sacrilegious shopping fest .
and there are plenty who would say just that .
the other side of christmas but i 'd argue that such a complaint is too black and white .
it 's clearly true that glitz and gifts are gaining momentum at christmas time - which ca n't be a bad thing from an economic point of view - but shopping and tradition have never been mutually exclusive .

we arrived in plenty of time , only to find that there was no room .
the place was even more packed than that sprawling bookstore a little way down the road .
we tried st. hedwig 's cathedral , but could n't get in there either .
the irony of being turned away on christmas eve was not lost on us , but we did what others have clearly done before us and kept on looking .
and in our case we did n't need a bed for the night , just somewhere to stand for the duration of the service .
we tramped on to two other churches before we found a corner in the marienkirche into which we could settle .
looking back , it is hard to imagine that of all those people who turned out that night , none had walked the same streets in the preceding days in search of gifts for the people they hold dear .

" solidarity , understanding and getting along with one another : we need this in our families , in our private lives and in society , " wulff said .
" this won ’ t happen on its own , we need to work at it . "
the president noted that christmas is a time when everyone seeks to spend time with those who are near and dear to them , while at the same time focusing on helping the less fortunate .
around 190 guests were present for the recording of the speech at bellevue palace , the official residence of the president , among them , schoolchildren , scouts , and police officers .
the president singled out those who do voluntary work - in its many forms - for particular praise .
while the state can help those in need through financial support , he said , it ca n't provide the necessary human touch .
" encouragement , a pat on the shoulder and reaching out a helping hand is important for humanity and needs people to do it , " he said .
" and by the way , people engaged in voluntary work in society live longer . " mutual respect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 years on , the desire for peace remains wulff also reaffirmed his commitment to germany ’ s multicultural society , describing germany as " free and diverse . "
the president highlighted the many differences between citizens , in terms of religion , education , and their hopes and dreams .
" in order for such a diverse society to continue to thrive in the long term , we need one thing above all , respect , " he said .
" respect for those who are different while at the same time recognizing them for their achievements . "
germany as a role model the president noted that germany is well respected in the world for its peaceful and tolerant society , and its reliability when dealing with other nations , both great and small .
and he said germany was prepared to take on greater responsibilities beyond its borders , including within europe .
at the same time , though , germany he said , expected the same from its partners .
" we trust in a united europe and the influence that europe can have , " he said .
the president then used his speech to thank not only the many german soldiers , policemen and aid workers who are serving abroad , but also their families , who are unable to see their loved ones at this special time of year .
before extending christmas wishes to all germans , the president alluded to the christmas story , saying that the desire for peace on earth expressed at bethlehem more than 2,000 years ago remained a constant , even today .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.12.2010 rise of electric cars prompt ' smart ' electrical grids in portugal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nissan leaf will launch in portugal in january portugal ’ s long-term target of 750,000 electric cars fits with its smart energy plans .
already , the country has 40 percent of its energy coming from renewable sources . the launch in portugal in january of nissan 's leaf marks the start of the rollout in europe of what the company says is the first 100 percent electric car aimed at a mass market .
nissan targeted portugal - where it will also soon be assembling batteries for the leaf - after that country 's government agreed to setting up a national network of charging points .
in fact , the network is to be compatible with any make of electric car , and is part of still more ambitious long-term plans for a genuinely " smart grid " that could help portugal make fuller use of its fast-expanding renewable energy capacity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government wants to expand its network of charging stations in early december , amid ultra-modern architecture at the former site of the expo 98 world fair in lisbon , members of the portuguese public got the chance to test drive the leaf .
portuguese consumers are curious about electric cars comments ranged from the polite to the enthusiastic , with the lack of engine noise the most obvious characteristic of what at first glance looks like a regular five-seater family run-around .
but the very lack of engine noise creates some new " problems . "
" for instance , the headlamps have a specific design to avoid air going to the mirrors , " said antónio joaquim , the communications director of nissan iberia portugal .
" the exterior mirrors on a normal car produce a lot of noise with the wind .
but on this car , which does n't make any noise from the engine , all the very small noises that on other cars are not perceptible are - let 's say , uncomfortable . "
the more obvious matter of charging the car seems straightforward : a small panel on the bonnet opens to reveal something rather similar to an ordinary electric plug .
" if you want to charge when you are parking inside a garage in your own house or in a shopping centre , it 's better to have it on the bonnet , " joaquim added .
" it 's a completely different usage from a combustion engine .
you just charge the car during your daily life . "
charging stations are scarce for now , but are expected to increase there are two charging options : a partial quick charge , for example when you are on the motorway and do not want to stop for long , or a cheaper slow charge of up to eight hours .
prospective buyers in lisbon seemed to take the limitations of electric cars on board .
" it 's a nice car , and a good prospect for someone like me who has an urban life , and drives about 30 or 40 kilometres to work and back , " said one man , who declined to give his name .
the innovative design of the leaf 's lithium batteries means that you can drive the car for longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotor 's editor thinks that the european car of the year jury missed out on the prius but even a fully-charged leaf has a more limited range than a car with a full fuel tank .
so the fact that it recently was named european car of the year - the first completely electric vehicle to do so - raised some eyebrows .
antónio pereira , editor of portuguese car magazine automotor , told deutsche welle he suspected the competition 's jury may have been anxious not to miss a trick , having previously failed to garland the first version of the toyota prius , which later became a hit .
the nissan leaf is , he said , an interesting experiment , and portugal a suitably small testing ground , but with some problems .
" recharging stations are still few -lsb- in number -rsb- and mainly in the big cities , " he said .
" and in portugal we mainly live in apartments .
so either you have a parking space in your building or you have to recharge at night in the public recharging station .
that 's complicated because there wo n't be one for each . "
portugal pushing for dynmaic energy flow in its ' smart grid ' still , the spread of on-street charging points in portugal is the reason the leaf is getting its european launch in the country .
the government-led mobi.e consortium is installing 1,300 chargers around the country , compatible with all makes of car .
in addition , the state is offering a 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- subsidy for buyers of electric cars - bringing the leaf 's price down to 30,000 euro - and a road-tax exemption .
portugal 's ambitious declared long-term target of 750,000 electric vehicles on its roads also fits with plans to expand its renewable energy output , going some way to addressing sceptics ' argument that electric cars ' environmental impact depends on where their power comes from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government is subsidizing the purchase price of electric cars " we have defined as a target to be the first country to have a nationwide and comprehensive infrastructure for vehicles and to work to give the necessary framework and incentives so that we can massively introduce the electric vehicle , " luís reis of mobi.e explained at a trade fair earlier this year .
" this is important not only in terms of the sustainability of mobility but also in terms of the strategy that we have for energy . "
portuguese society has high reliance on renewable sources portugal - for decades heavily reliant on imported oil for its energy needs - now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables , and rising .
and officials overseeing the development of the electric grid envision a future in which drivers will actually be able to profit from helping ensure that same energy is used efficiently , when electric cars have full internet capability .
" you drive it home in the evening , plug -lsb- it in to -rsb- both internet and power , and the car starts receiving signals of electricity spot prices , " antónio vidigal , a director of privatised utility edp , one of the mobi.e partners , told a conference on climate change earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables " at night the price is low ; the car will charge overnight , " vidigal went on .
" next day you come to office , plug again into both plugs .
peak time energy will be expensive and the car may sell energy back to the network . "
as in many countries , hydro-electric dams in portugal already store excess energy from wind farms ; this is used to pump water uphill , to be used to generate power when demand is high .
now the groundwork is being laid for a smart grid that could see cars playing a similar role .
as the first step in what is to be a nationwide programme , edp in 2010 made évora in the alentejo , a city with a population of some 50,000 , the first " inovcity " in the future national " inovgrid . "
" consumers have access almost to real-time information as to their energy consumption , so they 'll be able to manage that better , " explained miguel andrade , a director of edp distribuição , the group 's distribution unit .
" from the company 's side obviously we hope to have operational efficiencies from this .
we hope to integrate more renewables , more micro-generation and eventually in the medium to long-term also the electric vehicle into the grid .
" i think we 're genuinely witnessing a revolution in the way we manage distribution networks . "
nissan investing in portugal but if it 's early days for integrating cars into this vision , what of today 's models ?
the leaf on show in lisbon can not , slot into a smart grid .
but , he said , the model is easily adapted .
" we are implementing the electric vehicles now , so we have to be cost efficient otherwise people would not buy them , " said antónio joaquim , nissan portugal communications director .
" that is why the cars do n't have this and the grid does n't have this capabilities .
" but from the utility 's point of view the technology is already known , from the car industry the technology is already known , so i do n't think that is a very difficult thing to implement later on .
it 's a question of software . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal has already begun rolling out electrical charging stations the leaf itself can already communicate with the charging point : identifying itself and its charging specifications and needs , as well as its owner - who will after all be paying for the power as part of the electricity bill sent to his home .
some environmentalists see models such as the leaf as primarily a public relations exercise for manufacturers that still devote most of their investment to conventional models .
nissan 's own projections for electric cars do not go beyond 10 percent of total sales .
but given that the company is building factories in japan , the us and the uk dedicated to making the leaf - and which it would be difficult and expensive to convert to make other cars - the company is perhaps not the prime target for such accusations .
" everybody in the automotive business is trying to do their own ' greenwash ' , promising ' green ' products - and most are less polluting than before , but not that green , " said antónio pereira , editor of automotor .
" i think nissan is probably taking a lot of risks with the electric car but it 's not doing greenwash - not at all . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 24.12.2010 us foreign policy marked by continuity , says former national security adviser großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us national security adviser stephen hadley in an interview with dw , stephen hadley speaks about the continuity between president obama and his predecessor bush that surprised many people and why he views the west bank as a bright spot in the middle east . stephen hadley served as national security adviser to president george w. bush from 2005 to 2009 and as deputy national security adviser from 2001 to 2005 .
he is currently a senior adviser for international affairs at the united states institute of peace and a principal in the rice hadley group . deutsche welle : let 's look back at us and european foreign and security policy this year and take a tally of some major issues .
in afghanistan 2010 was the deadliest year for the international troops with more than 700 soldiers killed , most of them american .
has president obama 's surge strategy failed ?
stephen hadley : there 's been an initial assessment which has not been released publicly in all its detail .
but i think the administration 's assessment , and i think it 's right , is that the strategy of the united states and other allies including most europeans who are with us on the ground in afghanistan is making progress .
it 's slower than we would like , it 's fragile and reversible , but there has been progress .
and i think one of the good things about 2010 is that there has been a coming together of europeans and americans about the importance of afghanistan and about how to pursue our strategy .
president obama has said the us would begin to pull troops out of afghanistan in 2011 , the british have said they may do the same and germany has announced its plans to start withdrawing troops next year as well .
when the three biggest troop contributors start pulling back , can the war in afghanistan still be won ?
yes , because the lede here is not that the troops are pulling back , the lede is that the united states and its allies believe that they will be able to begin to transfer security responsibility to the afghans .
remember , americans and europeans have for several years now been training and helping the afghans to build an army and police that can take increasing security responsibility .
and afghan forces are operating with american and nato and other european forces in afghanistan now , so what the president said was that in 2011 we could begin the process of transferring security responsibility to afghan units and as that occurred it would allow some units of american and european origin to begin to withdraw .
but president obama has been clear , and particularly secretary gates has been clear that that handover of security responsibility to afghanistan and any withdrawal of american forces will be condition-based .
that is to say it will have to reflect progress and security on the ground and will be done in a way that does not jeopardize the progress we have achieved or future progress .
another intractable international issue for the us and the eu is how to deal with iran 's nuclear program .
despite a united position by europeans and americans and tough new sanctions that were put in place in 2010 with the help of russia and china , there does n't seem to be a change of tehran 's stance .
is the west simply running out of options on iran ? i think the administration and our european allies have done a better job than i would have anticipated in getting the russians and the chinese to go along with very tough sanctions .
as you point out , regrettably , it has not resulted in a change of iranian policy on the nuclear issue .
and this is obviously a source of concern for all of us , because the worry is that if the region begins to conclude that the international community is not going to be able to prevent iran from having through its enrichment program a clear path to a nuclear weapon that is going to result in an emboldened iran , it is going to result in weakened arab states and it is going to result in arab states trying to develop their own nuclear programs which is a proliferation risk that will make the middle east less stable not more stable .
2010 was the year in which the obama administration like many before tried and failed to make progress on the peace process between israelis and palestinians because it could n't convince the israeli government to extend a settlement stop even for just a few months .
was the us foolish even to try again or has the us completely lost its leverage with both parties , but especially with the israeli government ?
i think the administration has said as much that the effort that began really soon after administration took power in january 2009 to get a construction freeze in the settlement areas did not work as the administration has intended .
what they had hoped to do was to send a strong message to the world that the administration was going to be even-handed between the israelis and palestinians .
that this message would be greeted in the arab world with steps to reach out toward israel and to begin rebuilding diplomatic relations between israel and the arab world and it simply did not work .
and rather than facilitating negotiations and progress on the negotiating table it became a barrier to negotiations .
it was a tactic , i think the administration would say , that did not work .
so they are trying to restart the process to have these proximity talks to try to turn the focus from settlement construction to what the focus should have been really from the beginning which is the terms of peace .
we can only hope that there will be some success in this effort .
but i think what is really good news for the prospects for peace is what is happening in the west bank .
that president abbas and prime minister salam fayad are building the institutions of a palestinian state even while under occupation .
they are now training security forces that are increasingly taking responsibility for security and are going after terrorists .
the israeli military is recognizing the effectiveness of these forces and cooperating with them .
the palestinians are building political institutions , economic activity and growth has returned to the west bank and there is peace , there is calm , that is to say .
there are no incidents of violence either in the west bank or in israel .
so in some sense while the negotiations seem to have foundered , the underpinnings of an ultimate peace , that is to say the institutions of a democratic palestinian state that is not supporting terror , but is maintaining peace and security for both palestinians and israelis , that process has gone forward .
and i think that is a bright spot and an essential element for an ultimate peace and a two-state solution in the middle east .
many us presidents engaged in foreign policy have a doctrine named after them that spells out their vision or version of america 's engagement with the world .
obama has now passed the half-time mark of his first term .
is there something that could be called an obama doctrine and if so how would you describe and compare it to other presidential doctrines like the so-called bush doctrine ?
i think the obama administration is still a work in progress on foreign policy .
i think they would say as much .
i think they want to be known as an administration that has engaged our adversaries .
i think that policy has had some mixed success i think with respect to north korea and chavez in venezuela and in iran .
and they have certainly been very firm on north korea about the prerequisites to resuming the six-party talks .
i think one of the things that has surprised a lot of people is while i think the administration has had a positive tone in how it has spoken to the arab world and how it has spoken to europe , i think there is a lot more continuity in the policies between president obama and president bush than a lot of people expected .
and that 's not unusual .
in the united states , while we have presidential elections that are waged and fought based often on differences in foreign policy , when new administrations come in and see the problems that the prior administration has faced there is a high degree of continuity in policies between administrations .
and i think you see it in terms of the iraq policy , afghanistan policy and policies dealing with the terrorist threat .
so i think there have been some positive changes in tone .
some have succeeded , some have not .
but i think there has also been a high degree and a useful degree of continuity with the policies of its predecessor administrations .
if you had to give a grade to the obama administration for its foreign policy for this year or for the past two years what grade would that be ?
i think any foreign policy in the first two years generally gets an incomplete .
that is to say , the first year they are figuring out what their policies should be .
the second year they begin to roll out those policies in a more serious way , but it takes another year or two to know whether they are working .
so i think almost any administration in the second year gets an incomplete .
let 's switch to transatlantic affairs : one year ago with lady ashton and herman van rompuy , two relatively obscure politicians were chosen as the eu 's first new president and foreign minister .
the us has long complained about the lack of a common european stance on many international issues .
does washington now finally know which numbers to call in europe ? i think there is a feeling that the economic crisis that we have been through has put a lot of strain on the european project .
so i think most americans think that because of the challenge presented by the economic crisis there is a certain amount of introspection going on within europe about where it is going in terms of its political and economic integration .
i think that is very understandable .
the economic crisis has been a real blow to the entire world and it 's going to take some time to work it through . so i think most americans would say there has been a little bit of a pause in the european project of political and economic integration .
that has been a project that the united states has supported for 50 years , both republican and democratic administrations , and one that we want to succeed .
but understandably there is some soul searching going on in the europeans and we need to let our european allies work these issues through .
barack obama has been described as the first us president who is not an atlanticist naturally inclined toward europe , but rather toward asia .
this and the often quoted rise of asia has led some europeans to worry about the nature and future of the transatlantic relationship .
how healthy is the transatlantic relationship today and how important will it be in the future ? i have been in washington for over 40 years and sort of every 10 years somebody comes up and declares the end of the transatlantic relationship .
and so far all those predictions have been premature .
i think this is really the oldest affiliation for the united states this strong relationship with europe .
i think it continues to remain strong and will remain strong from administration to administration .
that said , the rise of asia and major new world powers in asia such as china and india is getting a lot of attention in the united states .
and it is getting a lot of attention in europe .
germany 's economic recovery is heavily driven by exports to asia , so it is not surprising that both in europe and in the united states there is a lot of discussion about asia and ties toward asia .
that is to say , how can meet the rise of new great powers in asia and how can we turn the rise of those great powers and the economic growth and the economic engine that asia is right now literally pulling the world out of recession , how can we turn that so that it is an opportunity for greater peace and prosperity for the world as a whole .
i think that 's the task in asia and it is something that europeans and americans should be working on together .

once taboo , the practice may now attract an eco-friendly clientele , saving the industry from tough chinese competition . for decades , the small industrial city of prato in tuscany has produced some of the finest wool textiles in the world - all the while hiding a dirty secret .
but now , hard hit by low-cost textiles produced in china , prato has dug the skeleton out of its closet and turned it into a powerful marketing weapon .
" the production of the reprocessed wool comes from scraps that come from the manufacturing of garments , " romeo balli explained to deutsche welle .
nowadays , with attention focused on eco-friendly manufacturing practices , this process is garnering attention for balli 's fabrics .
saving scraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recycling wool scraps conserves resources balli 's factory has carried the family name since it was founded by his grandfather in 1946 .
it was once part of a thriving textile industry in prato that produced high quality wool fabric .
back then , as today , most of the textiles were made from left-over wool scraps .
according to balli , this does n't mean a drop in quality , but does make manufacturing less expensive .
" we can find nice quality , divide it by color , quality , and it 's much easier and cheaper , " he said .
not only is the process cheaper , it 's also more environmentally friendly .
prato 's chamber of commerce is now trying to capitalize on this fact to give its industry a boost .
according to carlo longo , who heads the chamber of commerce , it 's ironic the recycled wool is now a selling point , given how for decades prato industries hid the fact .
" nobody was admitting that -lsb- we recycled scraps -rsb- .
we were trying to do it , but hiding it , " he said .
" now it 's become a reason to be proud , because we 're not depleting the world 's resources , so it 's a good thing . "
old product , new brand longo is part of an initiative geared toward reducing the carbon footprint of textile production , which certifies companies that use regenerated or recycled raw materials .
prato 's chamber of commerce has dubbed the regenerated wool " cardato , " hoping consumers will seek out the eco-friendly product .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wool manufacturers face steep competition from china " we have branded it and are launching it again , " longo said .
" there 's now a lot of attention to these kinds of products . "
it 's also economically advantageous .
with cheaply produced wool fabrics being exported from china , prato 's five billion-euro -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- export industry has lost half its business in the last decade .
textile producers like romeo balli say the reprocessed wool not only gives prato an eco-friendly advantage , but also provides cheaper and more stable prices .
according to balli , the difference in price between virgin and reprocessed wool can be between 30 and 40 percent .
those savings could ensure the survival of prato 's textile industry , especially at a time when balli believes chinese producers are stockpiling virgin wool - causing prices to shoot up around the world .

" solidarity , understanding and getting along with one another : we need this in our families , in our private lives and in society , " wulff said .
" this won ’ t happen on its own , we need to work at it . "
the president noted that christmas is a time when everyone seeks to spend time with those who are near and dear to them , while at the same time focusing on helping the less fortunate .
around 190 guests were present for the recording of the speech at bellevue palace , the official residence of the president , among them , schoolchildren , scouts , and police officers .
the president singled out those who do voluntary work - in its many forms - for particular praise .
while the state can help those in need through financial support , he said , it ca n't provide the necessary human touch .
" encouragement , a pat on the shoulder and reaching out a helping hand is important for humanity and needs people to do it , " he said .
" and by the way , people engaged in voluntary work in society live longer . " mutual respect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 years on , the desire for peace remains wulff also reaffirmed his commitment to germany ’ s multicultural society , describing germany as " free and diverse . "
the president highlighted the many differences between citizens , in terms of religion , education , and their hopes and dreams .
" in order for such a diverse society to continue to thrive in the long term , we need one thing above all , respect , " he said .
" respect for those who are different while at the same time recognizing them for their achievements . "
germany as a role model the president noted that germany is well respected in the world for its peaceful and tolerant society , and its reliability when dealing with other nations , both great and small .
and he said germany was prepared to take on greater responsibilities beyond its borders , including within europe .
at the same time , though , germany he said , expected the same from its partners .
" we trust in a united europe and the influence that europe can have , " he said .
the president then used his speech to thank not only the many german soldiers , policemen and aid workers who are serving abroad , but also their families , who are unable to see their loved ones at this special time of year .
before extending christmas wishes to all germans , the president alluded to the christmas story , saying that the desire for peace on earth expressed at bethlehem more than 2,000 years ago remained a constant , even today .

sales figures for the title into the holiday season show no signs of slowing down . thilo sarrazin 's contentious book with grim predictions for the future of germany is number one on the year 's non-fiction bestseller list , according to records published by der spiegel .
since the release of " germany is doing away with itself " in late august , author sarrazin has made headlines for claiming that the combination of germany 's low birth-rate and immigration and social welfare policies are leading the country toward " a nightmare . "
with chapter titles like " immigration and integration - expect more , offer less " and " demographics and population politics - more children from the intelligent before it 's too late , " the book was sure to spark conflict .
chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly condemned sarrazin .
in comments made shortly after the book 's publication , she said , " his word choice , his means of expression , the stereotyping of entire groups , the exclusion and hatefulness : it 's unacceptable .
and it is n't going to lead to any solutions . "

sales figures for the title into the holiday season show no signs of slowing down . thilo sarrazin 's contentious book with grim predictions for the future of germany is number one on the year 's non-fiction bestseller list , according to records published by der spiegel .
since the release of " germany is doing away with itself " in late august , author sarrazin has made headlines for claiming that the combination of germany 's low birth-rate and immigration and social welfare policies are leading the country toward " a nightmare . "
with chapter titles like " immigration and integration - expect more , offer less " and " demographics and population politics - more children from the intelligent before it 's too late , " the book was sure to spark conflict .
chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly condemned sarrazin .
in comments made shortly after the book 's publication , she said , " his word choice , his means of expression , the stereotyping of entire groups , the exclusion and hatefulness : it 's unacceptable .
and it is n't going to lead to any solutions . "
but neither public criticism nor the holiday season have put a damper on the book 's sales .
it remains at the top of der spiegel 's current weekly bestsellers , and a representative from the german publishers ' association told the magazine focus , " we are selling around 10,000 copies a day at the moment . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 24.12.2010 holly jolly christmas for german retailers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have spent about 77 billion euro on gifts thanks to booming sales , this year 's holiday season is the most cheerful in years for german retailers .
if the trend of german shoppers continues , good business could continue after the holidays as well . a lot of german kids are going to think santa was especially generous this year when they open their christmas presents .
even the adults are likely to notice a few more presents under the tree as in 2009 .
according to the german retail association , germans have n't spent as much money on gifts during a holiday season since 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there may be a few more gifts under german trees for november and december , the association estimates total revenues of 77 billion euro -lrb- $ 101 billion -rrb- for the retail sector - 2.5 percent more than last year .
" people have n't let the chaotic winter ruin their shopping plans , " stefan genth , head of the trade union hde , told deutsche welle .
genth says that the economic crisis in germany was over surprisingly quickly .
germans saved money during the year in order to be able to afford something special for christmas , such as a nice watch or jewelry .
at the top of many christmas lists in snowy germany are winter sports items , such as sleds , skis , or ice skates .
warm winter clothes are also in high demand .
in many stores , supply of sleds and snow shovels is running low .
the demand for gloves is sometimes twice what retailers have in stock. ipads and inscriptions if a christmas wish is not snow-related , then there 's a good chance it has to do with staying inside and avoiding it .
electronic devices , including video and computer games are sought-after items as well .
in an interview with the french news agency afp , august-wilhelm scheer , head of the electronic branch 's bitkom association , said the electronic branch was " very satisfied " with their holiday business , and that it was " significantly better " than last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ipads are in high demand the high-tech gadget of the year is without a doubt the ipad .
it and other tablet-pcs have established themselves as a new class among laptop computers .
according to bitkom , around 450,000 tablet-pcs were sold in 2010 .
sales for online retailers are experiencing a boom like never before as well .
many germans want to give personalized gifts , but they do n't always have the time to take care of it themselves .
instead , they take care of a special gift with a few clicks of the mouse .
claudia helming is the head of dawanda , an online marketplace for handmade products that opened in 2006 in berlin .
she says customized jewelry , such as a silver necklace engraved with a name or a phrase , is quite popular .
dawanda gets about 30,000 orders per day - more than twice as many as last year .
trend continues past christmas while some germans go for the one-of-a-kind gifts , many others go completely generic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snow and cold kept people out of christmas markets recent studies indicate that every second present that will be opened on christmas eve is a gift certificate .
hde 's stefan genth says most of the gift certificates will be cashed in during the week between christmas and new year 's eve , making him optimistic that the booming retail business in germany will continue past the holidays .
he also expects that many people will carry out planned shopping sprees that had to be put off because of bad weather .
while the retail sector seems to have come through germany 's early winter quite well , the opposite is true for businesses operating at germany 's christmas markets .
the exceptionally cold weather and snowfall meant that many people opted to stay home instead of patronizing the stalls of the christmas market .
unlike holiday shopping sprees , a trip to the christmas market can not be pushed back a few weeks : after december 23 , the german christmas markets close up shop until next year .

christmas trees were rarely seen in advance of the first advent and their decorations consisted almost entirely of straw stars on skinny red string .

and there are plenty who would say just that .

but when it comes to christmas , some old habits are reluctant to die . many years ago , back in the days when berlin was new to me and latte macchiato had yet to be imported to prenzlauer berg 's kastanienallee , i remember christmas being a quiet and even gentle affair .
seasons greetings were not splashed across the fronts of thousands of garish cards , nor were they blasted from brass bands at shoppers too busy hunting down their must-haves of the year to stop and lend an ear .
christmas trees were rarely seen in advance of the first advent and their decorations consisted almost entirely of straw stars on skinny red string .
that same year , i received a parcel from england containing presents wrapped in stylish paper .
i recall a german friend who was with me at the time , studying the design and wondering why shop owners here could n't find a way to stock the same kind of thing .
fast forward fifteen years and he need ask no more .
it arrived at around the same time as the cards emblazoned with christmas wishes , often enough in english , and the multi-colored baubles which shine more brightly than any straw star could ever hope to .
shopping up a storm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas shopping en-masse and it is in precisely such paper that shoppers like the thousands i bumped into yesterday evening when i ventured out to friedrichstrasse -lrb- all in the name of research -rrb- will be using to wrap the gifts they had to tramp through icy temperatures and piles of snow to buy .
when the shops closed last night , hundreds of people flocked to the one mega book store that stays open until midnight .
i splashed through the sludgy brown puddles at its threshold to see what all the fuss was about .
i was surprised to see berliners , who are ordinarily cautious spenders , behaving with such reckless purchasing abandon .
the scene , which i 'm sure was being repeated all over the city , would have been excellent fodder for anyone who holds that christmas in berlin has become a sacrilegious shopping fest .
and there are plenty who would say just that .
the other side of christmas but i 'd argue that such a complaint is too black and white .
it 's clearly true that glitz and gifts are gaining momentum at christmas time - which ca n't be a bad thing from an economic point of view - but shopping and tradition have never been mutually exclusive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner dom might be big , but come christmas eve , it can also be very full on christmas eve last year , someone in my family decided we ought to go to midnight mass at the berliner dom .
i do n't go every year or very often at all for that matter , but it sounded like a nice idea , so off we trundled .
we arrived in plenty of time , only to find that there was no room .
the place was even more packed than that sprawling bookstore a little way down the road .
we tried st. hedwig 's cathedral , but could n't get in there either .
the irony of being turned away on christmas eve was not lost on us , but we did what others have clearly done before us and kept on looking .
and in our case we did n't need a bed for the night , just somewhere to stand for the duration of the service .
we tramped on to two other churches before we found a corner in the marienkirche into which we could settle .
looking back , it is hard to imagine that of all those people who turned out that night , none had walked the same streets in the preceding days in search of gifts for the people they hold dear .
i wo n't be in berlin this christmas or i might just be tempted -lrb- in the name of research -rrb- to go back and see if there are any faces i recognise from my recent expedition to friedrichstrasse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 24.12.2010 myanmar faces uncertainty in 2011 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burmese people expect a lot from pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi the outlook for military-ruled myanmar in 2011 appears quite uncertain , despite the recent general elections and the release of democracy icon aung san suu kyi from house arrest . the release of nobel laureate aung san suu kyi from house arrest in november was much bigger news than the national elections , despite these being the first in 20 years .
her freedom once again raised hopes for reforms in myanmar , also known as burma .
the country has been under military rule since 1962 .
ever since her release , aung san suu kyi has been very active , giving media interviews and meeting with members of her national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- , amid regional calls for her to play a greater role to bridge the gap between the military and the pro-democracy opposition .
only a first step while most people welcomed aung san suu kyi ’ s release , some activists , such as soe aung of the forum for democracy in burma , say it was just a partial step towards reforms and a dialogue .
" you may call it progress on that front , " soe aung told deutsche welle .
" but do not forget about the remaining 2,200 political prisoners .
there is no progress at all in their situation .
releasing aung san suu kyi is not enough .
the military regime has to respond to the calls of aung san suu kyi for a dialogue as soon as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military regime held elections for the first time in twenty years in 2010 the elections in november , widely considered by the international community as fraudulent , are expected now to be followed by the formation of a civilian government , which will include a president , and the appointment of regional administrators .
debbie stothardt , the spokesperson for the rights group alternative asean network , is very cautious .
" 2011 is going to be more uncertain than 2010 .
we have aung san suu kyi freed but we are not sure for how long , and there are increasing restrictions on people having access to her or media covering her statements and activities .
we have also seen more foreigners blacklisted and deported from burma since aung san suu kyi ’ s release . "
minorities form alliance keunsai , who uses only one name , is the director of the shan herald news agency , which focuses on issues related to myanmar 's shan ethnic minority group .
he says the junta has a delicate balancing act ahead .
" the junta is walking on tiptoes right now because it is anxious to show that the country has become a democracy .
so what will happen next depends on both sides : how much the opposition is ready to test the junta 's tolerance , and how much the junta is going to tolerate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi 's supporters celebrate outside her home after her release myanmar ’ s ethnic minorities have also been under pressure this year , with the junta trying to press the minority armed groups to join a border patrol force .
over the past decades , the military has reached several cease-fire agreements with these regional armies .
but brief clashes occurred in the state of karen during november ’ s election , forcing hundreds of karen to seek temporary shelter in thailand .
several of the armed groups have now moved to form a new military alliance .
but myanmar ’ s military has some 400,000 troops against the ethnic armies ’ more than 65,000 troops .
once again , myanmar ’ s disparate communities are now putting their faith in aung san suu kyi and hoping she will be able to negotiate a way to political reform .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer affairs -pipe- 24.12.2010 economists flag indebted underclass problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debt problems are increasing amongst german consumers private debt is becoming a problem that some germans can not escape .
a recent study shows that women and young people under 30 are sliding particularly quickly into the red . about 6.5 million germans are currently struggling with debt – that 's almost 10 percent of the adult population .
this year alone saw 290,000 new debtors join their ranks with average liabilities of 35,000 euros .
as a result , the number of private insolvencies in germany is expected to rise 11 percent this year .
it 's the first time since 2007 that the number of people falling into debt has risen , according to a study by creditreform , a business information service specializing in risk and debt analysis .
" the increase in over-indebtedness is a delayed reaction to the economic crisis , " michael bretz , creditreform 's head of the economic research , told deutsche welle .
one of the most worrying trends is a rise in the number of young people with money problems .
the past year saw 54,000 teenagers develop debt problems - an increase of 38 percent on the previous year and the biggest increase among any age group .
bretz puts this down to excessive consumerism .
" young people want to consume more than older ones to compensate for their low status , " bretz said .
young people also do n't fully understand their finances .
according to a recent study by social research company forsa , almost one third of 16 year olds didn ’ t know that it would take longer to pay off a loan of 2000 euro at 50 euro per month as opposed to saving that amount .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bretz worries that ghettos are developing in germany inherited debt bretz believes that people learn financial habits from their parents and warns that a sort of " debt mentality " is being passed on from generation to generation - and that there is a certain part of german society that does n't seem able to manage its money .
" they see that their parents do n't work , how they live with debt status , with their income , and that it is possible , " bretz said .
" their children will inherit this status . "
about two million people in germany are expected to stay in debt for the rest of their lives , he added .
as the german economy picks up , consumers are buying large items on credit again .
as a result , bretz expects the number of people burdened with excessive debt will increase even further .
" we have seen an increase in consumer loans , " bretz said .
" i think people are more relaxed than in the crisis and so they spend more money , especially in these days before christmas . "
a greater variety of payment options , such as paying on store cards , credit cards , over the internet and zero percent finance offers , has increased debt levels in germany .
" most people who come to me have debts at credit institutions , like overdrafts and loans , " thomas kroeger , a debt advisor in engelskirchen told deutsche welle .
" 40 percent owe money to mail order companies and every fifth person has overdue mobile phone bills . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroeger worries that more teenagers are getting in the red divorce and debt women are especially prone to debt problems during separation and divorce because although they often have lower incomes than their partners , they can still be held liable for joint loans or contracts signed when they were together .
diana , an unemployed 26-year-old mother from western germany , racked up 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,970 -rrb- of debt to 14 different creditors after she split up with her boyfriend .
when diana moved into a new flat she bought most of the furniture on credit .
at the time she was earning good money as an office clerk and was able to pay back her installments comfortably .
but then she became unemployed .
" when you lose your job , your world is destroyed and you ask how can i pay for my rent , telephone , electricity and gas ? " she said .
in addition to her furniture , diana is still paying off her bank overdraft , joint mobile phone contracts , insurance , and mail order purchases .
" it 's really dangerous .
when you see zero percent offers on tv , it entices you to buy so much .
and you buy things that you simply do n't need , " she told deutsche welle .
when diana was unable to find a new job , she found herself living off so-called " harz iv " social security payments worth just 323 euros per month .
" at some point i lost track of things and did n't know what i should pay for first , " she said .
" i was getting nasty letters in the post , telling me if you do n't pay , then this and that will happen and the bailiff will come . "
bildunterschrift : many women develop debt problems following divorce or separation a casual attitude to debt diana went to see a debt advisor – a service that 's free of charge in germany if you 're unemployed .
he wrote to all of her creditors , who agreed to halve her debt and free her of interest payments .
she now pays a total of 10 euros per month , which is shared out between her creditors .
it 's a small amount , but one she should always be able to afford , even on the lowest level of benefits .
" if i could do it again , i would save up my money , rather than buy things on credit and take out loans , ” she said .
“ i only use a pay-as-you-go mobile phone now , " she added .
while diana 's debts are now manageable , her partner is almost 20,000 euros in the red and faces private insolvency proceedings .
that means for six years , any income exceeding his basic living expenses will be automatically forfeited to creditors .
after that his debts will be wiped – a chance for a fresh start .
the fact that diana 's partner has a low income means he only pays 40 euros per month to his creditors .
his six years of repayments will amount to just 2,880 euros - an amount diana finds astonishingly low given the size of the original debt .
" it 's laughable really .
it 's like an easy ' alternative way ' to deal with one 's debts .
at the end you can say , that was it , my debts are gone now " .
bretz warns that there 's a danger of people using private insolvency too casually – an easy solution to freeing oneself of debts after overindulging .
" there are more and more people who see this possibility and use it in a very rational way .
they see it as a solution to their debt problems , " bretz said .

a recent study shows that women and young people under 30 are sliding particularly quickly into the red . about 6.5 million germans are currently struggling with debt – that 's almost 10 percent of the adult population .
this year alone saw 290,000 new debtors join their ranks with average liabilities of 35,000 euros .
as a result , the number of private insolvencies in germany is expected to rise 11 percent this year .
it 's the first time since 2007 that the number of people falling into debt has risen , according to a study by creditreform , a business information service specializing in risk and debt analysis .
" the increase in over-indebtedness is a delayed reaction to the economic crisis , " michael bretz , creditreform 's head of the economic research , told deutsche welle .
one of the most worrying trends is a rise in the number of young people with money problems .
the past year saw 54,000 teenagers develop debt problems - an increase of 38 percent on the previous year and the biggest increase among any age group .
bretz puts this down to excessive consumerism .
" young people want to consume more than older ones to compensate for their low status , " bretz said .
young people also do n't fully understand their finances .
according to a recent study by social research company forsa , almost one third of 16 year olds didn ’ t know that it would take longer to pay off a loan of 2000 euro at 50 euro per month as opposed to saving that amount .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bretz worries that ghettos are developing in germany inherited debt bretz believes that people learn financial habits from their parents and warns that a sort of " debt mentality " is being passed on from generation to generation - and that there is a certain part of german society that does n't seem able to manage its money .
" they see that their parents do n't work , how they live with debt status , with their income , and that it is possible , " bretz said .
" their children will inherit this status . "
about two million people in germany are expected to stay in debt for the rest of their lives , he added .
as the german economy picks up , consumers are buying large items on credit again .
as a result , bretz expects the number of people burdened with excessive debt will increase even further .
" we have seen an increase in consumer loans , " bretz said .
" i think people are more relaxed than in the crisis and so they spend more money , especially in these days before christmas . "
a greater variety of payment options , such as paying on store cards , credit cards , over the internet and zero percent finance offers , has increased debt levels in germany .
" most people who come to me have debts at credit institutions , like overdrafts and loans , " thomas kroeger , a debt advisor in engelskirchen told deutsche welle .
" 40 percent owe money to mail order companies and every fifth person has overdue mobile phone bills . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroeger worries that more teenagers are getting in the red divorce and debt women are especially prone to debt problems during separation and divorce because although they often have lower incomes than their partners , they can still be held liable for joint loans or contracts signed when they were together .
diana , an unemployed 26-year-old mother from western germany , racked up 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,970 -rrb- of debt to 14 different creditors after she split up with her boyfriend .
when diana moved into a new flat she bought most of the furniture on credit .
at the time she was earning good money as an office clerk and was able to pay back her installments comfortably .
but then she became unemployed .
" when you lose your job , your world is destroyed and you ask how can i pay for my rent , telephone , electricity and gas ? " she said .
in addition to her furniture , diana is still paying off her bank overdraft , joint mobile phone contracts , insurance , and mail order purchases .
" it 's really dangerous .
when you see zero percent offers on tv , it entices you to buy so much .
and you buy things that you simply do n't need , " she told deutsche welle .
when diana was unable to find a new job , she found herself living off so-called " harz iv " social security payments worth just 323 euros per month .
" at some point i lost track of things and did n't know what i should pay for first , " she said .
" i was getting nasty letters in the post , telling me if you do n't pay , then this and that will happen and the bailiff will come . "
bildunterschrift : many women develop debt problems following divorce or separation a casual attitude to debt diana went to see a debt advisor – a service that 's free of charge in germany if you 're unemployed .
he wrote to all of her creditors , who agreed to halve her debt and free her of interest payments .
she now pays a total of 10 euros per month , which is shared out between her creditors .
it 's a small amount , but one she should always be able to afford , even on the lowest level of benefits .
" if i could do it again , i would save up my money , rather than buy things on credit and take out loans , ” she said .
“ i only use a pay-as-you-go mobile phone now , " she added .
while diana 's debts are now manageable , her partner is almost 20,000 euros in the red and faces private insolvency proceedings .
that means for six years , any income exceeding his basic living expenses will be automatically forfeited to creditors .
after that his debts will be wiped – a chance for a fresh start .
the fact that diana 's partner has a low income means he only pays 40 euros per month to his creditors .
his six years of repayments will amount to just 2,880 euros - an amount diana finds astonishingly low given the size of the original debt .
" it 's laughable really .
it 's like an easy ' alternative way ' to deal with one 's debts .
at the end you can say , that was it , my debts are gone now " .
bretz warns that there 's a danger of people using private insolvency too casually – an easy solution to freeing oneself of debts after overindulging .
" there are more and more people who see this possibility and use it in a very rational way .
they see it as a solution to their debt problems , " bretz said .

andsnes talked with dw about one program he selected , from which you can hear excerpts below . as pianist in residence with the berlin philharmonic orchestra this season , leif ove andsnes brings a devotion to chamber music that he has maintained alongside an international career as a soloist .
his most recent album of rachmaninov ’ s third and fourth piano concertos with antonio pappano and the london symphony orchestra quickly won widespread critical acclaim .
andsnes spoke to dw about the program he selected for the second concert of his residency in berlin and his upcoming plans .
click below to listen to andsnes and members of the berlin philharmonic live from a concert on december 12 , 2010 .
dw : together with marc-andre hamelin you have performed the four-hand version of stravinsky 's " rite of spring " in risor , brussels , london , new york , and now berlin .
what fascinates you about the piece ?
leif ove andsnes : the " rite of spring " has perhaps more appeal than any other piece of the 20th century .
its energy and rhythms excite people more than any other piece i know .
the harmonies and sheer tension are unbelievable .
it is so iconic that you ca n't imagine someone sitting down and writing it .
stravinsky said himself that he felt like a vessel - that the music just came from somewhere - and he wrote it down very quickly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian composers are in the spotlight this season for the berlin philharmonic why did you choose two of the other pieces in the program , stravinsky 's septet and alfred schnittke 's piano quintet ?
since the philharmonic has a focus on russian music this season , i paired them to show two very different sides of russian music .
the septet was written forty years after the " rite " and shows a giant leap in stravinsky 's language , with the end result very playful and theatrical .
the schnittke , on the other hand , seems born entirely out of an emotional state of grief and sorrow , colored by the death of his mother .
it sometimes sounds like music from the other side , from a different planet .
can you describe your passion for chamber music ?
for me it is the most natural form of music-making , just a few friends coming together to play .
why should it be considered a niche or elitist ?
it is as normal as a rock band gathering in a garage .
just give me a violinist and a cellist , and we can play a trio .
chamber music is also essential in a musician 's development because you have to listen to others and find your place within the landscape of a piece , whether you have the foreground or background .
it 's also a great way to get to know people and a lot of fun .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andsnes will perform with the berlin philharmonic into the summer of 2011 what new projects do you have coming up ?
one thing that will be very much in focus over the next four to five years is beethoven .
having just turned 40 , i feel i 've come to a point in my life where i have to play the greatest , most important music of all .
i will play and record his concertos .
i will also play his sonatas .
what will your personal highlights be as pianist in residence with the berlin philharmonic ?
i ’ m very excited to play brahms 's second piano concerto with bernhard haitink .
i 'll be working with him for the first time .
i ’ m also very much looking forward to a chamber music project in may with students in the orchestra ’ s academy .
we will perform two mozart works and the dvorak piano quintet , a fantastic piece that i played and fell in love with as a student .
what do you hope to get out of the residency with the philharmonic ?
it already feels like i have a base in berlin for this season , which is nice .
in this profession there is a lot of jumping around so you start to want to feel at home in a few places .
and it 's a tremendous experience to play with this fantastic orchestra . what do you like about being in berlin ?
one always has the feeling berlin is on the cutting edge of what 's happening creatively .
i know many freelance musicians who love the way of life here .
it 's absolutely one of the world 's great musical capitals with so many quality orchestras and opera .

her freedom once again raised hopes for reforms in myanmar , also known as burma .
the country has been under military rule since 1962 .
ever since her release , aung san suu kyi has been very active , giving media interviews and meeting with members of her national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- , amid regional calls for her to play a greater role to bridge the gap between the military and the pro-democracy opposition .
only a first step while most people welcomed aung san suu kyi ’ s release , some activists , such as soe aung of the forum for democracy in burma , say it was just a partial step towards reforms and a dialogue .
" you may call it progress on that front , " soe aung told deutsche welle .
" but do not forget about the remaining 2,200 political prisoners .
there is no progress at all in their situation .
releasing aung san suu kyi is not enough .
the military regime has to respond to the calls of aung san suu kyi for a dialogue as soon as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military regime held elections for the first time in twenty years in 2010 the elections in november , widely considered by the international community as fraudulent , are expected now to be followed by the formation of a civilian government , which will include a president , and the appointment of regional administrators .
debbie stothardt , the spokesperson for the rights group alternative asean network , is very cautious .
" 2011 is going to be more uncertain than 2010 .
we have aung san suu kyi freed but we are not sure for how long , and there are increasing restrictions on people having access to her or media covering her statements and activities .
we have also seen more foreigners blacklisted and deported from burma since aung san suu kyi ’ s release . "
minorities form alliance keunsai , who uses only one name , is the director of the shan herald news agency , which focuses on issues related to myanmar 's shan ethnic minority group .
he says the junta has a delicate balancing act ahead .
" the junta is walking on tiptoes right now because it is anxious to show that the country has become a democracy .
so what will happen next depends on both sides : how much the opposition is ready to test the junta 's tolerance , and how much the junta is going to tolerate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi 's supporters celebrate outside her home after her release myanmar ’ s ethnic minorities have also been under pressure this year , with the junta trying to press the minority armed groups to join a border patrol force .
over the past decades , the military has reached several cease-fire agreements with these regional armies .
but brief clashes occurred in the state of karen during november ’ s election , forcing hundreds of karen to seek temporary shelter in thailand .
several of the armed groups have now moved to form a new military alliance .
but myanmar ’ s military has some 400,000 troops against the ethnic armies ’ more than 65,000 troops .
once again , myanmar ’ s disparate communities are now putting their faith in aung san suu kyi and hoping she will be able to negotiate a way to political reform .

andsnes talked with dw about one program he selected , from which you can hear excerpts below . as pianist in residence with the berlin philharmonic orchestra this season , leif ove andsnes brings a devotion to chamber music that he has maintained alongside an international career as a soloist .
his most recent album of rachmaninov ’ s third and fourth piano concertos with antonio pappano and the london symphony orchestra quickly won widespread critical acclaim .
andsnes spoke to dw about the program he selected for the second concert of his residency in berlin and his upcoming plans .
click below to listen to andsnes and members of the berlin philharmonic live from a concert on december 12 , 2010 .
dw : together with marc-andre hamelin you have performed the four-hand version of stravinsky 's " rite of spring " in risor , brussels , london , new york , and now berlin .
what fascinates you about the piece ?
leif ove andsnes : the " rite of spring " has perhaps more appeal than any other piece of the 20th century .
its energy and rhythms excite people more than any other piece i know .
the harmonies and sheer tension are unbelievable .
it is so iconic that you ca n't imagine someone sitting down and writing it .
stravinsky said himself that he felt like a vessel - that the music just came from somewhere - and he wrote it down very quickly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian composers are in the spotlight this season for the berlin philharmonic why did you choose two of the other pieces in the program , stravinsky 's septet and alfred schnittke 's piano quintet ?
since the philharmonic has a focus on russian music this season , i paired them to show two very different sides of russian music .
the septet was written forty years after the " rite " and shows a giant leap in stravinsky 's language , with the end result very playful and theatrical .
the schnittke , on the other hand , seems born entirely out of an emotional state of grief and sorrow , colored by the death of his mother .
it sometimes sounds like music from the other side , from a different planet .
can you describe your passion for chamber music ?
for me it is the most natural form of music-making , just a few friends coming together to play .
why should it be considered a niche or elitist ?
it is as normal as a rock band gathering in a garage .
just give me a violinist and a cellist , and we can play a trio .
chamber music is also essential in a musician 's development because you have to listen to others and find your place within the landscape of a piece , whether you have the foreground or background .
it 's also a great way to get to know people and a lot of fun .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andsnes will perform with the berlin philharmonic into the summer of 2011 what new projects do you have coming up ?
one thing that will be very much in focus over the next four to five years is beethoven .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer affairs -pipe- 24.12.2010 economists flag indebted underclass problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debt problems are increasing amongst german consumers private debt is becoming a problem that some germans can not escape .
a recent study shows that women and young people under 30 are sliding particularly quickly into the red . about 6.5 million germans are currently struggling with debt – that 's almost 10 percent of the adult population .
this year alone saw 290,000 new debtors join their ranks with average liabilities of 35,000 euros .
as a result , the number of private insolvencies in germany is expected to rise 11 percent this year .
it 's the first time since 2007 that the number of people falling into debt has risen , according to a study by creditreform , a business information service specializing in risk and debt analysis .
" the increase in over-indebtedness is a delayed reaction to the economic crisis , " michael bretz , creditreform 's head of the economic research , told deutsche welle .
one of the most worrying trends is a rise in the number of young people with money problems .
the past year saw 54,000 teenagers develop debt problems - an increase of 38 percent on the previous year and the biggest increase among any age group .
bretz puts this down to excessive consumerism .
" young people want to consume more than older ones to compensate for their low status , " bretz said .
young people also do n't fully understand their finances .
according to a recent study by social research company forsa , almost one third of 16 year olds didn ’ t know that it would take longer to pay off a loan of 2000 euro at 50 euro per month as opposed to saving that amount .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bretz worries that ghettos are developing in germany inherited debt bretz believes that people learn financial habits from their parents and warns that a sort of " debt mentality " is being passed on from generation to generation - and that there is a certain part of german society that does n't seem able to manage its money .
" they see that their parents do n't work , how they live with debt status , with their income , and that it is possible , " bretz said .
" their children will inherit this status . "
about two million people in germany are expected to stay in debt for the rest of their lives , he added .
as the german economy picks up , consumers are buying large items on credit again .
as a result , bretz expects the number of people burdened with excessive debt will increase even further .
" we have seen an increase in consumer loans , " bretz said .
" i think people are more relaxed than in the crisis and so they spend more money , especially in these days before christmas . "
a greater variety of payment options , such as paying on store cards , credit cards , over the internet and zero percent finance offers , has increased debt levels in germany .
" most people who come to me have debts at credit institutions , like overdrafts and loans , " thomas kroeger , a debt advisor in engelskirchen told deutsche welle .
" 40 percent owe money to mail order companies and every fifth person has overdue mobile phone bills . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroeger worries that more teenagers are getting in the red divorce and debt women are especially prone to debt problems during separation and divorce because although they often have lower incomes than their partners , they can still be held liable for joint loans or contracts signed when they were together .
diana , an unemployed 26-year-old mother from western germany , racked up 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,970 -rrb- of debt to 14 different creditors after she split up with her boyfriend .
when diana moved into a new flat she bought most of the furniture on credit .
at the time she was earning good money as an office clerk and was able to pay back her installments comfortably .
but then she became unemployed .
" when you lose your job , your world is destroyed and you ask how can i pay for my rent , telephone , electricity and gas ? " she said .
in addition to her furniture , diana is still paying off her bank overdraft , joint mobile phone contracts , insurance , and mail order purchases .
" it 's really dangerous .
when you see zero percent offers on tv , it entices you to buy so much .
and you buy things that you simply do n't need , " she told deutsche welle .
when diana was unable to find a new job , she found herself living off so-called " harz iv " social security payments worth just 323 euros per month .
" at some point i lost track of things and did n't know what i should pay for first , " she said .
" i was getting nasty letters in the post , telling me if you do n't pay , then this and that will happen and the bailiff will come . "
bildunterschrift : many women develop debt problems following divorce or separation a casual attitude to debt diana went to see a debt advisor – a service that 's free of charge in germany if you 're unemployed .
he wrote to all of her creditors , who agreed to halve her debt and free her of interest payments .
she now pays a total of 10 euros per month , which is shared out between her creditors .
it 's a small amount , but one she should always be able to afford , even on the lowest level of benefits .
" if i could do it again , i would save up my money , rather than buy things on credit and take out loans , ” she said .
“ i only use a pay-as-you-go mobile phone now , " she added .
while diana 's debts are now manageable , her partner is almost 20,000 euros in the red and faces private insolvency proceedings .
that means for six years , any income exceeding his basic living expenses will be automatically forfeited to creditors .
after that his debts will be wiped – a chance for a fresh start .
the fact that diana 's partner has a low income means he only pays 40 euros per month to his creditors .
his six years of repayments will amount to just 2,880 euros - an amount diana finds astonishingly low given the size of the original debt .
" it 's laughable really .
it 's like an easy ' alternative way ' to deal with one 's debts .
at the end you can say , that was it , my debts are gone now " .
bretz warns that there 's a danger of people using private insolvency too casually – an easy solution to freeing oneself of debts after overindulging .
" there are more and more people who see this possibility and use it in a very rational way .
they see it as a solution to their debt problems , " bretz said .

andsnes talked with dw about one program he selected , from which you can hear excerpts below . as pianist in residence with the berlin philharmonic orchestra this season , leif ove andsnes brings a devotion to chamber music that he has maintained alongside an international career as a soloist .
his most recent album of rachmaninov ’ s third and fourth piano concertos with antonio pappano and the london symphony orchestra quickly won widespread critical acclaim .
andsnes spoke to dw about the program he selected for the second concert of his residency in berlin and his upcoming plans .
click below to listen to andsnes and members of the berlin philharmonic live from a concert on december 12 , 2010 .
dw : together with marc-andre hamelin you have performed the four-hand version of stravinsky 's " rite of spring " in risor , brussels , london , new york , and now berlin .
what fascinates you about the piece ?
leif ove andsnes : the " rite of spring " has perhaps more appeal than any other piece of the 20th century .
its energy and rhythms excite people more than any other piece i know .
the harmonies and sheer tension are unbelievable .
it is so iconic that you ca n't imagine someone sitting down and writing it .
stravinsky said himself that he felt like a vessel - that the music just came from somewhere - and he wrote it down very quickly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian composers are in the spotlight this season for the berlin philharmonic why did you choose two of the other pieces in the program , stravinsky 's septet and alfred schnittke 's piano quintet ?
since the philharmonic has a focus on russian music this season , i paired them to show two very different sides of russian music .
the septet was written forty years after the " rite " and shows a giant leap in stravinsky 's language , with the end result very playful and theatrical .
the schnittke , on the other hand , seems born entirely out of an emotional state of grief and sorrow , colored by the death of his mother .
it sometimes sounds like music from the other side , from a different planet .
can you describe your passion for chamber music ?
for me it is the most natural form of music-making , just a few friends coming together to play .
why should it be considered a niche or elitist ?
it is as normal as a rock band gathering in a garage .
just give me a violinist and a cellist , and we can play a trio .
chamber music is also essential in a musician 's development because you have to listen to others and find your place within the landscape of a piece , whether you have the foreground or background .
it 's also a great way to get to know people and a lot of fun .

he is currently a senior adviser for international affairs at the united states institute of peace and a principal in the rice hadley group . deutsche welle : let 's look back at us and european foreign and security policy this year and take a tally of some major issues .
in afghanistan 2010 was the deadliest year for the international troops with more than 700 soldiers killed , most of them american .
has president obama 's surge strategy failed ?
stephen hadley : there 's been an initial assessment which has not been released publicly in all its detail .
but i think the administration 's assessment , and i think it 's right , is that the strategy of the united states and other allies including most europeans who are with us on the ground in afghanistan is making progress .
it 's slower than we would like , it 's fragile and reversible , but there has been progress .
and i think one of the good things about 2010 is that there has been a coming together of europeans and americans about the importance of afghanistan and about how to pursue our strategy .
president obama has said the us would begin to pull troops out of afghanistan in 2011 , the british have said they may do the same and germany has announced its plans to start withdrawing troops next year as well .
when the three biggest troop contributors start pulling back , can the war in afghanistan still be won ?
yes , because the lede here is not that the troops are pulling back , the lede is that the united states and its allies believe that they will be able to begin to transfer security responsibility to the afghans .
remember , americans and europeans have for several years now been training and helping the afghans to build an army and police that can take increasing security responsibility .
and afghan forces are operating with american and nato and other european forces in afghanistan now , so what the president said was that in 2011 we could begin the process of transferring security responsibility to afghan units and as that occurred it would allow some units of american and european origin to begin to withdraw .
but president obama has been clear , and particularly secretary gates has been clear that that handover of security responsibility to afghanistan and any withdrawal of american forces will be condition-based .
that is to say it will have to reflect progress and security on the ground and will be done in a way that does not jeopardize the progress we have achieved or future progress .
another intractable international issue for the us and the eu is how to deal with iran 's nuclear program .
despite a united position by europeans and americans and tough new sanctions that were put in place in 2010 with the help of russia and china , there does n't seem to be a change of tehran 's stance .
is the west simply running out of options on iran ? i think the administration and our european allies have done a better job than i would have anticipated in getting the russians and the chinese to go along with very tough sanctions .
as you point out , regrettably , it has not resulted in a change of iranian policy on the nuclear issue .
and this is obviously a source of concern for all of us , because the worry is that if the region begins to conclude that the international community is not going to be able to prevent iran from having through its enrichment program a clear path to a nuclear weapon that is going to result in an emboldened iran , it is going to result in weakened arab states and it is going to result in arab states trying to develop their own nuclear programs which is a proliferation risk that will make the middle east less stable not more stable .
2010 was the year in which the obama administration like many before tried and failed to make progress on the peace process between israelis and palestinians because it could n't convince the israeli government to extend a settlement stop even for just a few months .
was the us foolish even to try again or has the us completely lost its leverage with both parties , but especially with the israeli government ?
i think the administration has said as much that the effort that began really soon after administration took power in january 2009 to get a construction freeze in the settlement areas did not work as the administration has intended .
what they had hoped to do was to send a strong message to the world that the administration was going to be even-handed between the israelis and palestinians .
that this message would be greeted in the arab world with steps to reach out toward israel and to begin rebuilding diplomatic relations between israel and the arab world and it simply did not work .
and rather than facilitating negotiations and progress on the negotiating table it became a barrier to negotiations .
it was a tactic , i think the administration would say , that did not work .
so they are trying to restart the process to have these proximity talks to try to turn the focus from settlement construction to what the focus should have been really from the beginning which is the terms of peace .
we can only hope that there will be some success in this effort .
but i think what is really good news for the prospects for peace is what is happening in the west bank .
that president abbas and prime minister salam fayad are building the institutions of a palestinian state even while under occupation .
they are now training security forces that are increasingly taking responsibility for security and are going after terrorists .
the israeli military is recognizing the effectiveness of these forces and cooperating with them .
the palestinians are building political institutions , economic activity and growth has returned to the west bank and there is peace , there is calm , that is to say .
there are no incidents of violence either in the west bank or in israel .
so in some sense while the negotiations seem to have foundered , the underpinnings of an ultimate peace , that is to say the institutions of a democratic palestinian state that is not supporting terror , but is maintaining peace and security for both palestinians and israelis , that process has gone forward .
and i think that is a bright spot and an essential element for an ultimate peace and a two-state solution in the middle east .
many us presidents engaged in foreign policy have a doctrine named after them that spells out their vision or version of america 's engagement with the world .
obama has now passed the half-time mark of his first term .
is there something that could be called an obama doctrine and if so how would you describe and compare it to other presidential doctrines like the so-called bush doctrine ?
i think the obama administration is still a work in progress on foreign policy .
i think they would say as much .
i think they want to be known as an administration that has engaged our adversaries .
i think that policy has had some mixed success i think with respect to north korea and chavez in venezuela and in iran .
and they have certainly been very firm on north korea about the prerequisites to resuming the six-party talks .
i think one of the things that has surprised a lot of people is while i think the administration has had a positive tone in how it has spoken to the arab world and how it has spoken to europe , i think there is a lot more continuity in the policies between president obama and president bush than a lot of people expected .
and that 's not unusual .
in the united states , while we have presidential elections that are waged and fought based often on differences in foreign policy , when new administrations come in and see the problems that the prior administration has faced there is a high degree of continuity in policies between administrations .
and i think you see it in terms of the iraq policy , afghanistan policy and policies dealing with the terrorist threat .
so i think there have been some positive changes in tone .
some have succeeded , some have not .
but i think there has also been a high degree and a useful degree of continuity with the policies of its predecessor administrations .
if you had to give a grade to the obama administration for its foreign policy for this year or for the past two years what grade would that be ?
i think any foreign policy in the first two years generally gets an incomplete .
that is to say , the first year they are figuring out what their policies should be .
the second year they begin to roll out those policies in a more serious way , but it takes another year or two to know whether they are working .
so i think almost any administration in the second year gets an incomplete .
let 's switch to transatlantic affairs : one year ago with lady ashton and herman van rompuy , two relatively obscure politicians were chosen as the eu 's first new president and foreign minister .
the us has long complained about the lack of a common european stance on many international issues .
does washington now finally know which numbers to call in europe ? i think there is a feeling that the economic crisis that we have been through has put a lot of strain on the european project .
so i think most americans think that because of the challenge presented by the economic crisis there is a certain amount of introspection going on within europe about where it is going in terms of its political and economic integration .
i think that is very understandable .
the economic crisis has been a real blow to the entire world and it 's going to take some time to work it through . so i think most americans would say there has been a little bit of a pause in the european project of political and economic integration .
that has been a project that the united states has supported for 50 years , both republican and democratic administrations , and one that we want to succeed .
but understandably there is some soul searching going on in the europeans and we need to let our european allies work these issues through .
barack obama has been described as the first us president who is not an atlanticist naturally inclined toward europe , but rather toward asia .
this and the often quoted rise of asia has led some europeans to worry about the nature and future of the transatlantic relationship .
how healthy is the transatlantic relationship today and how important will it be in the future ? i have been in washington for over 40 years and sort of every 10 years somebody comes up and declares the end of the transatlantic relationship .
and so far all those predictions have been premature .
i think this is really the oldest affiliation for the united states this strong relationship with europe .
i think it continues to remain strong and will remain strong from administration to administration .
that said , the rise of asia and major new world powers in asia such as china and india is getting a lot of attention in the united states .
and it is getting a lot of attention in europe .
germany 's economic recovery is heavily driven by exports to asia , so it is not surprising that both in europe and in the united states there is a lot of discussion about asia and ties toward asia .
that is to say , how can meet the rise of new great powers in asia and how can we turn the rise of those great powers and the economic growth and the economic engine that asia is right now literally pulling the world out of recession , how can we turn that so that it is an opportunity for greater peace and prosperity for the world as a whole .
i think that 's the task in asia and it is something that europeans and americans should be working on together .

obama has now passed the half-time mark of his first term .
is there something that could be called an obama doctrine and if so how would you describe and compare it to other presidential doctrines like the so-called bush doctrine ?
i think the obama administration is still a work in progress on foreign policy .
i think they would say as much .
i think they want to be known as an administration that has engaged our adversaries .
i think that policy has had some mixed success i think with respect to north korea and chavez in venezuela and in iran .
and they have certainly been very firm on north korea about the prerequisites to resuming the six-party talks .
i think one of the things that has surprised a lot of people is while i think the administration has had a positive tone in how it has spoken to the arab world and how it has spoken to europe , i think there is a lot more continuity in the policies between president obama and president bush than a lot of people expected .
and that 's not unusual .
in the united states , while we have presidential elections that are waged and fought based often on differences in foreign policy , when new administrations come in and see the problems that the prior administration has faced there is a high degree of continuity in policies between administrations .
and i think you see it in terms of the iraq policy , afghanistan policy and policies dealing with the terrorist threat .
so i think there have been some positive changes in tone .
some have succeeded , some have not .
but i think there has also been a high degree and a useful degree of continuity with the policies of its predecessor administrations .
if you had to give a grade to the obama administration for its foreign policy for this year or for the past two years what grade would that be ?
i think any foreign policy in the first two years generally gets an incomplete .
that is to say , the first year they are figuring out what their policies should be .
the second year they begin to roll out those policies in a more serious way , but it takes another year or two to know whether they are working .
so i think almost any administration in the second year gets an incomplete .
let 's switch to transatlantic affairs : one year ago with lady ashton and herman van rompuy , two relatively obscure politicians were chosen as the eu 's first new president and foreign minister .
the us has long complained about the lack of a common european stance on many international issues .
does washington now finally know which numbers to call in europe ? i think there is a feeling that the economic crisis that we have been through has put a lot of strain on the european project .
so i think most americans think that because of the challenge presented by the economic crisis there is a certain amount of introspection going on within europe about where it is going in terms of its political and economic integration .
i think that is very understandable .
the economic crisis has been a real blow to the entire world and it 's going to take some time to work it through . so i think most americans would say there has been a little bit of a pause in the european project of political and economic integration .
that has been a project that the united states has supported for 50 years , both republican and democratic administrations , and one that we want to succeed .
but understandably there is some soul searching going on in the europeans and we need to let our european allies work these issues through .
barack obama has been described as the first us president who is not an atlanticist naturally inclined toward europe , but rather toward asia .
this and the often quoted rise of asia has led some europeans to worry about the nature and future of the transatlantic relationship .
how healthy is the transatlantic relationship today and how important will it be in the future ? i have been in washington for over 40 years and sort of every 10 years somebody comes up and declares the end of the transatlantic relationship .
and so far all those predictions have been premature .
i think this is really the oldest affiliation for the united states this strong relationship with europe .
i think it continues to remain strong and will remain strong from administration to administration .
that said , the rise of asia and major new world powers in asia such as china and india is getting a lot of attention in the united states .
and it is getting a lot of attention in europe .
germany 's economic recovery is heavily driven by exports to asia , so it is not surprising that both in europe and in the united states there is a lot of discussion about asia and ties toward asia .
that is to say , how can meet the rise of new great powers in asia and how can we turn the rise of those great powers and the economic growth and the economic engine that asia is right now literally pulling the world out of recession , how can we turn that so that it is an opportunity for greater peace and prosperity for the world as a whole .
i think that 's the task in asia and it is something that europeans and americans should be working on together .

" solidarity , understanding and getting along with one another : we need this in our families , in our private lives and in society , " wulff said .
" this won ’ t happen on its own , we need to work at it . "
the president noted that christmas is a time when everyone seeks to spend time with those who are near and dear to them , while at the same time focusing on helping the less fortunate .
around 190 guests were present for the recording of the speech at bellevue palace , the official residence of the president , among them , schoolchildren , scouts , and police officers .
the president singled out those who do voluntary work - in its many forms - for particular praise .
while the state can help those in need through financial support , he said , it ca n't provide the necessary human touch .
" encouragement , a pat on the shoulder and reaching out a helping hand is important for humanity and needs people to do it , " he said .

once taboo , the practice may now attract an eco-friendly clientele , saving the industry from tough chinese competition . for decades , the small industrial city of prato in tuscany has produced some of the finest wool textiles in the world - all the while hiding a dirty secret .
but now , hard hit by low-cost textiles produced in china , prato has dug the skeleton out of its closet and turned it into a powerful marketing weapon .
" the production of the reprocessed wool comes from scraps that come from the manufacturing of garments , " romeo balli explained to deutsche welle .
nowadays , with attention focused on eco-friendly manufacturing practices , this process is garnering attention for balli 's fabrics .
saving scraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recycling wool scraps conserves resources balli 's factory has carried the family name since it was founded by his grandfather in 1946 .
it was once part of a thriving textile industry in prato that produced high quality wool fabric .
back then , as today , most of the textiles were made from left-over wool scraps .
according to balli , this does n't mean a drop in quality , but does make manufacturing less expensive .
" we can find nice quality , divide it by color , quality , and it 's much easier and cheaper , " he said .
not only is the process cheaper , it 's also more environmentally friendly .
prato 's chamber of commerce is now trying to capitalize on this fact to give its industry a boost .
according to carlo longo , who heads the chamber of commerce , it 's ironic the recycled wool is now a selling point , given how for decades prato industries hid the fact .
" nobody was admitting that -lsb- we recycled scraps -rsb- .
we were trying to do it , but hiding it , " he said .
" now it 's become a reason to be proud , because we 're not depleting the world 's resources , so it 's a good thing . "
old product , new brand longo is part of an initiative geared toward reducing the carbon footprint of textile production , which certifies companies that use regenerated or recycled raw materials .
prato 's chamber of commerce has dubbed the regenerated wool " cardato , " hoping consumers will seek out the eco-friendly product .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wool manufacturers face steep competition from china " we have branded it and are launching it again , " longo said .
" there 's now a lot of attention to these kinds of products . "
it 's also economically advantageous .
with cheaply produced wool fabrics being exported from china , prato 's five billion-euro -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- export industry has lost half its business in the last decade .
textile producers like romeo balli say the reprocessed wool not only gives prato an eco-friendly advantage , but also provides cheaper and more stable prices .
according to balli , the difference in price between virgin and reprocessed wool can be between 30 and 40 percent .
those savings could ensure the survival of prato 's textile industry , especially at a time when balli believes chinese producers are stockpiling virgin wool - causing prices to shoot up around the world .

full ratification is not expected until mid-january after the body 's winter recess . russia 's lower house of parliament voted overwhelmingly to move forward a historic nuclear arms pact with the united states on friday , shortly before going on winter holiday .
the duma voted 350-58 in favor of the new strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- , which was passed by the us senate on wednesday after a lengthy political battle .
the treaty was expected to face far less of a fight in russia 's parliament , which is dominated by president dmitry medvedev 's united russia party .
medvedev and foreign minister sergei lavrov told lawmakers before the vote that the treaty would not undermine russian security , but that it " will bring russian-american relations to a qualitatively new level … and is welcomed by the entire global community . "
a rejection " would deal a serious blow to the reputation of russia . "
the agreement would slash the two sides ' nuclear arsenals to 1,550 deployed warheads per side .
the white house announced on thursday that medvedev had called us president barack obama to congratulate him on the treaty 's passing in the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidents obama and medvedev signed the start treaty back in april medvedev also said in an end-of-year interview on russian television that obama " fulfills his promises " and that he managed to secure the senate 's approval " in rather difficult circumstances . "
delay until january head lawmakers also hailed the agreement as a signal that relations between the former cold war enemies were headed in the right direction .
" there are times when our interests do not contradict each other , " said the upper chamber 's foreign affairs committee chairman mikhail margelov .
" this is precisely one of those times . "
the duma is expected to attach its own non-binding amendments to the pact , as the us senate did earlier this week to allay republican concerns with the agreement .
it expects to complete a second and final third reading after returning from recess on january 11 .
an approval by the upper chamber , the federation council , is also necessary for ratification .

the effect is a slump in retail sales and restaurant closures . the party is over for many in ireland , and this christmas retailers and restaurateurs have been bearing the brunt of cutbacks . irish people are spending less and staying in more , with a recent survey finding that almost 80 percent of firms did not pay for or effectively canceled the staff christmas party this year .
ireland 's holiday frugality has hit the restaurant sector badly , which is already struggling in the recession .
the restaurant association of ireland says it 's been a very tight christmas and 2011 is looking bleak .
" business has dropped by about 40 percent for the first two weeks of december and we do n't see any uptake at the moment , " said adrian cummins , ceo of the restaurant association .
" people are tightening their belts and they 're not spending on luxury items and goods and unfortunately the restaurant industry is part of that sector that has been hit by cutbacks . "
one restaurant per day statistics show one restaurant per day is closing in ireland , 80 percent of restaurants are running at a loss , and about 21,000 thousand jobs are at risk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diners in restaurants keep an eye on the price cummins says christmas is a critical time of year for restaurants - making up almost a quarter of their annual income .
but he says people are choosing to stay at home and if they do go out , they 're dining in cheaper eateries .
" people may be not going for the high-end christmas lunch and people are looking at how much they spend when they actually go out for their christmas parties , " said cummins .
" ireland -lsb- is -rsb- a sociable nation .
we like to go out and eat out and drink as well but -lsb- spending in restaurants -rsb- is considerably down . "
deals not decadence for retailers the story is n't much better .
sales have slumped an average of 20 percent .
shoppers on the streets of dublin city centre say they 've been cutting back on food and presents or shopping online .
" we 'd go a bit further for the grandchildren , " says one woman in dublin , " we 're not doing that this year .
we 're more or less looking for sale stuff because we do n't what ahead of us basically " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are taking their euros north there 's been a rise in cross-border shopping with more people heading to northern ireland to take advantage of cheaper prices there , as well .
the latest study by aa ireland says 1 in 20 motorists will head north over the festive season .
torlach denihan , the director of retail ireland , says stores in the republic of ireland are working to battle the cross-border competition .
" currently cross-border shopping is not a significant issue , " he said .
" it was an enormous issue for the retail sector 12 or 18 months ago , but at the moment it does n't really figure .
the reason for that is retailers have cut their prices in ireland and they 're in a better place to compete with the counterparts in the north . "
keeping business , keeping jobs a survey by ebay has found over 50 percent of irish consumers will shop online over the christmas and new year period as families try and make their euros stretch further .
this is already impacting shops which are trying to survive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many business have been forced to close up shop denihan estimates that 47,000 people have so far lost their jobs in the retail sector since the recession hit ireland " in a country like ireland with a population of 4.4 million and a workforce of just over 2 million , 47,000 jobs is very significant , " he said .
" there are people who 've lost jobs in every part of ireland .
in every community , retail employment has been hit . "
a looming general election and the implementation of stringent budgetary measures in the new year will no doubt have an impact on the spending habits of the irish people .
but the real challenge facing the retail and restaurant sector will be staying open and staying in business .

the effect is a slump in retail sales and restaurant closures . the party is over for many in ireland , and this christmas retailers and restaurateurs have been bearing the brunt of cutbacks . irish people are spending less and staying in more , with a recent survey finding that almost 80 percent of firms did not pay for or effectively canceled the staff christmas party this year .
ireland 's holiday frugality has hit the restaurant sector badly , which is already struggling in the recession .
the restaurant association of ireland says it 's been a very tight christmas and 2011 is looking bleak .
" business has dropped by about 40 percent for the first two weeks of december and we do n't see any uptake at the moment , " said adrian cummins , ceo of the restaurant association .
" people are tightening their belts and they 're not spending on luxury items and goods and unfortunately the restaurant industry is part of that sector that has been hit by cutbacks . "
one restaurant per day statistics show one restaurant per day is closing in ireland , 80 percent of restaurants are running at a loss , and about 21,000 thousand jobs are at risk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diners in restaurants keep an eye on the price cummins says christmas is a critical time of year for restaurants - making up almost a quarter of their annual income .
but he says people are choosing to stay at home and if they do go out , they 're dining in cheaper eateries .
" people may be not going for the high-end christmas lunch and people are looking at how much they spend when they actually go out for their christmas parties , " said cummins .
" ireland -lsb- is -rsb- a sociable nation .
we like to go out and eat out and drink as well but -lsb- spending in restaurants -rsb- is considerably down . "
deals not decadence for retailers the story is n't much better .
sales have slumped an average of 20 percent .
shoppers on the streets of dublin city centre say they 've been cutting back on food and presents or shopping online .
" we 'd go a bit further for the grandchildren , " says one woman in dublin , " we 're not doing that this year .
we 're more or less looking for sale stuff because we do n't what ahead of us basically " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are taking their euros north there 's been a rise in cross-border shopping with more people heading to northern ireland to take advantage of cheaper prices there , as well .
the latest study by aa ireland says 1 in 20 motorists will head north over the festive season .
torlach denihan , the director of retail ireland , says stores in the republic of ireland are working to battle the cross-border competition .
" currently cross-border shopping is not a significant issue , " he said .
" it was an enormous issue for the retail sector 12 or 18 months ago , but at the moment it does n't really figure .
the reason for that is retailers have cut their prices in ireland and they 're in a better place to compete with the counterparts in the north . "
keeping business , keeping jobs a survey by ebay has found over 50 percent of irish consumers will shop online over the christmas and new year period as families try and make their euros stretch further .
this is already impacting shops which are trying to survive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many business have been forced to close up shop denihan estimates that 47,000 people have so far lost their jobs in the retail sector since the recession hit ireland " in a country like ireland with a population of 4.4 million and a workforce of just over 2 million , 47,000 jobs is very significant , " he said .
" there are people who 've lost jobs in every part of ireland .
in every community , retail employment has been hit . "
a looming general election and the implementation of stringent budgetary measures in the new year will no doubt have an impact on the spending habits of the irish people .
but the real challenge facing the retail and restaurant sector will be staying open and staying in business .

even the adults are likely to notice a few more presents under the tree as in 2009 .
according to the german retail association , germans have n't spent as much money on gifts during a holiday season since 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there may be a few more gifts under german trees for november and december , the association estimates total revenues of 77 billion euro -lrb- $ 101 billion -rrb- for the retail sector - 2.5 percent more than last year .
" people have n't let the chaotic winter ruin their shopping plans , " stefan genth , head of the trade union hde , told deutsche welle .
genth says that the economic crisis in germany was over surprisingly quickly .
germans saved money during the year in order to be able to afford something special for christmas , such as a nice watch or jewelry .
at the top of many christmas lists in snowy germany are winter sports items , such as sleds , skis , or ice skates .

he also expects that many people will carry out planned shopping sprees that had to be put off because of bad weather .
while the retail sector seems to have come through germany 's early winter quite well , the opposite is true for businesses operating at germany 's christmas markets .
the exceptionally cold weather and snowfall meant that many people opted to stay home instead of patronizing the stalls of the christmas market .

amending the law " would be characteristic of a country suffering from lack of self-confidence , and we are not that country , " he told private broadcaster hirtv .
" we are not frightened of a bit of criticism , or even a lot of criticism , coming from western europe or even beyond . "
the hungarian parliament , dominated by orban 's conservative fidesz party , approved the law on tuesday .
it gives the government the authority to impose fines of up to 730,000 euros -lrb- $ 957,000 -rrb- or completely shut down media outlets for distributing content it deems offensive or " not politically balanced . "
international outcry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law has also prompted protests from hungarians the organization for security and cooperation in europe said the law violated media standards and could endanger press independence and pluralism .
european union states also condemned the law , especially as hungary prepares to take over the bloc 's six-month rotating presidency on january 1 , the same day the law comes into effect .
" as a country that is about to take over the presidency of the eu , hungary will have a particular responsibility for the image of the whole union in the world , " said a spokesman for german chancellor angela merkel , during a berlin press conference on wednesday .
luxembourg foreign minister jean asselbron went further , questioning whether hungary was prepared to be the international face of the eu .
" the plans clearly violate the spirit and the letter of eu treaties , " asselborn said .
" it raises the question of whether such a country is worthy of leading the eu . "
but orban refused to budge , saying in the interview that he ascribed " very limited importance to these foreign views . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.12.2010 rise of electric cars prompt ' smart ' electrical grids in portugal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nissan leaf will launch in portugal in january portugal ’ s long-term target of 750,000 electric cars fits with its smart energy plans .
already , the country has 40 percent of its energy coming from renewable sources . the launch in portugal in january of nissan 's leaf marks the start of the rollout in europe of what the company says is the first 100 percent electric car aimed at a mass market .
nissan targeted portugal - where it will also soon be assembling batteries for the leaf - after that country 's government agreed to setting up a national network of charging points .
in fact , the network is to be compatible with any make of electric car , and is part of still more ambitious long-term plans for a genuinely " smart grid " that could help portugal make fuller use of its fast-expanding renewable energy capacity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government wants to expand its network of charging stations in early december , amid ultra-modern architecture at the former site of the expo 98 world fair in lisbon , members of the portuguese public got the chance to test drive the leaf .
portuguese consumers are curious about electric cars comments ranged from the polite to the enthusiastic , with the lack of engine noise the most obvious characteristic of what at first glance looks like a regular five-seater family run-around .
but the very lack of engine noise creates some new " problems . "
" for instance , the headlamps have a specific design to avoid air going to the mirrors , " said antónio joaquim , the communications director of nissan iberia portugal .
" the exterior mirrors on a normal car produce a lot of noise with the wind .
but on this car , which does n't make any noise from the engine , all the very small noises that on other cars are not perceptible are - let 's say , uncomfortable . "
the more obvious matter of charging the car seems straightforward : a small panel on the bonnet opens to reveal something rather similar to an ordinary electric plug .
" if you want to charge when you are parking inside a garage in your own house or in a shopping centre , it 's better to have it on the bonnet , " joaquim added .
" it 's a completely different usage from a combustion engine .
you just charge the car during your daily life . "
charging stations are scarce for now , but are expected to increase there are two charging options : a partial quick charge , for example when you are on the motorway and do not want to stop for long , or a cheaper slow charge of up to eight hours .
prospective buyers in lisbon seemed to take the limitations of electric cars on board .
" it 's a nice car , and a good prospect for someone like me who has an urban life , and drives about 30 or 40 kilometres to work and back , " said one man , who declined to give his name .
the innovative design of the leaf 's lithium batteries means that you can drive the car for longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotor 's editor thinks that the european car of the year jury missed out on the prius but even a fully-charged leaf has a more limited range than a car with a full fuel tank .
so the fact that it recently was named european car of the year - the first completely electric vehicle to do so - raised some eyebrows .
antónio pereira , editor of portuguese car magazine automotor , told deutsche welle he suspected the competition 's jury may have been anxious not to miss a trick , having previously failed to garland the first version of the toyota prius , which later became a hit .
the nissan leaf is , he said , an interesting experiment , and portugal a suitably small testing ground , but with some problems .
" recharging stations are still few -lsb- in number -rsb- and mainly in the big cities , " he said .
" and in portugal we mainly live in apartments .
so either you have a parking space in your building or you have to recharge at night in the public recharging station .
that 's complicated because there wo n't be one for each . "
portugal pushing for dynmaic energy flow in its ' smart grid ' still , the spread of on-street charging points in portugal is the reason the leaf is getting its european launch in the country .
the government-led mobi.e consortium is installing 1,300 chargers around the country , compatible with all makes of car .
in addition , the state is offering a 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- subsidy for buyers of electric cars - bringing the leaf 's price down to 30,000 euro - and a road-tax exemption .
portugal 's ambitious declared long-term target of 750,000 electric vehicles on its roads also fits with plans to expand its renewable energy output , going some way to addressing sceptics ' argument that electric cars ' environmental impact depends on where their power comes from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government is subsidizing the purchase price of electric cars " we have defined as a target to be the first country to have a nationwide and comprehensive infrastructure for vehicles and to work to give the necessary framework and incentives so that we can massively introduce the electric vehicle , " luís reis of mobi.e explained at a trade fair earlier this year .
" this is important not only in terms of the sustainability of mobility but also in terms of the strategy that we have for energy . "
portuguese society has high reliance on renewable sources portugal - for decades heavily reliant on imported oil for its energy needs - now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables , and rising .
and officials overseeing the development of the electric grid envision a future in which drivers will actually be able to profit from helping ensure that same energy is used efficiently , when electric cars have full internet capability .
" you drive it home in the evening , plug -lsb- it in to -rsb- both internet and power , and the car starts receiving signals of electricity spot prices , " antónio vidigal , a director of privatised utility edp , one of the mobi.e partners , told a conference on climate change earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables " at night the price is low ; the car will charge overnight , " vidigal went on .
" next day you come to office , plug again into both plugs .
peak time energy will be expensive and the car may sell energy back to the network . "
as in many countries , hydro-electric dams in portugal already store excess energy from wind farms ; this is used to pump water uphill , to be used to generate power when demand is high .
now the groundwork is being laid for a smart grid that could see cars playing a similar role .
as the first step in what is to be a nationwide programme , edp in 2010 made évora in the alentejo , a city with a population of some 50,000 , the first " inovcity " in the future national " inovgrid . "
" consumers have access almost to real-time information as to their energy consumption , so they 'll be able to manage that better , " explained miguel andrade , a director of edp distribuição , the group 's distribution unit .
" from the company 's side obviously we hope to have operational efficiencies from this .
we hope to integrate more renewables , more micro-generation and eventually in the medium to long-term also the electric vehicle into the grid .
" i think we 're genuinely witnessing a revolution in the way we manage distribution networks . "
nissan investing in portugal but if it 's early days for integrating cars into this vision , what of today 's models ?
the leaf on show in lisbon can not , slot into a smart grid .
but , he said , the model is easily adapted .
" we are implementing the electric vehicles now , so we have to be cost efficient otherwise people would not buy them , " said antónio joaquim , nissan portugal communications director .
" that is why the cars do n't have this and the grid does n't have this capabilities .
" but from the utility 's point of view the technology is already known , from the car industry the technology is already known , so i do n't think that is a very difficult thing to implement later on .
it 's a question of software . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal has already begun rolling out electrical charging stations the leaf itself can already communicate with the charging point : identifying itself and its charging specifications and needs , as well as its owner - who will after all be paying for the power as part of the electricity bill sent to his home .
some environmentalists see models such as the leaf as primarily a public relations exercise for manufacturers that still devote most of their investment to conventional models .
nissan 's own projections for electric cars do not go beyond 10 percent of total sales .
but given that the company is building factories in japan , the us and the uk dedicated to making the leaf - and which it would be difficult and expensive to convert to make other cars - the company is perhaps not the prime target for such accusations .
" everybody in the automotive business is trying to do their own ' greenwash ' , promising ' green ' products - and most are less polluting than before , but not that green , " said antónio pereira , editor of automotor .
" i think nissan is probably taking a lot of risks with the electric car but it 's not doing greenwash - not at all . "

portuguese consumers are curious about electric cars comments ranged from the polite to the enthusiastic , with the lack of engine noise the most obvious characteristic of what at first glance looks like a regular five-seater family run-around .
but the very lack of engine noise creates some new " problems . "
" for instance , the headlamps have a specific design to avoid air going to the mirrors , " said antónio joaquim , the communications director of nissan iberia portugal .
" the exterior mirrors on a normal car produce a lot of noise with the wind .
but on this car , which does n't make any noise from the engine , all the very small noises that on other cars are not perceptible are - let 's say , uncomfortable . "
the more obvious matter of charging the car seems straightforward : a small panel on the bonnet opens to reveal something rather similar to an ordinary electric plug .
" if you want to charge when you are parking inside a garage in your own house or in a shopping centre , it 's better to have it on the bonnet , " joaquim added .
" it 's a completely different usage from a combustion engine .
you just charge the car during your daily life . "
charging stations are scarce for now , but are expected to increase there are two charging options : a partial quick charge , for example when you are on the motorway and do not want to stop for long , or a cheaper slow charge of up to eight hours .
prospective buyers in lisbon seemed to take the limitations of electric cars on board .
" it 's a nice car , and a good prospect for someone like me who has an urban life , and drives about 30 or 40 kilometres to work and back , " said one man , who declined to give his name .
the innovative design of the leaf 's lithium batteries means that you can drive the car for longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotor 's editor thinks that the european car of the year jury missed out on the prius but even a fully-charged leaf has a more limited range than a car with a full fuel tank .
so the fact that it recently was named european car of the year - the first completely electric vehicle to do so - raised some eyebrows .
antónio pereira , editor of portuguese car magazine automotor , told deutsche welle he suspected the competition 's jury may have been anxious not to miss a trick , having previously failed to garland the first version of the toyota prius , which later became a hit .
the nissan leaf is , he said , an interesting experiment , and portugal a suitably small testing ground , but with some problems .
" recharging stations are still few -lsb- in number -rsb- and mainly in the big cities , " he said .
" and in portugal we mainly live in apartments .
so either you have a parking space in your building or you have to recharge at night in the public recharging station .
that 's complicated because there wo n't be one for each . "
portugal pushing for dynmaic energy flow in its ' smart grid ' still , the spread of on-street charging points in portugal is the reason the leaf is getting its european launch in the country .
the government-led mobi.e consortium is installing 1,300 chargers around the country , compatible with all makes of car .
in addition , the state is offering a 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- subsidy for buyers of electric cars - bringing the leaf 's price down to 30,000 euro - and a road-tax exemption .
portugal 's ambitious declared long-term target of 750,000 electric vehicles on its roads also fits with plans to expand its renewable energy output , going some way to addressing sceptics ' argument that electric cars ' environmental impact depends on where their power comes from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government is subsidizing the purchase price of electric cars " we have defined as a target to be the first country to have a nationwide and comprehensive infrastructure for vehicles and to work to give the necessary framework and incentives so that we can massively introduce the electric vehicle , " luís reis of mobi.e explained at a trade fair earlier this year .
" this is important not only in terms of the sustainability of mobility but also in terms of the strategy that we have for energy . "
portuguese society has high reliance on renewable sources portugal - for decades heavily reliant on imported oil for its energy needs - now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables , and rising .
and officials overseeing the development of the electric grid envision a future in which drivers will actually be able to profit from helping ensure that same energy is used efficiently , when electric cars have full internet capability .
" you drive it home in the evening , plug -lsb- it in to -rsb- both internet and power , and the car starts receiving signals of electricity spot prices , " antónio vidigal , a director of privatised utility edp , one of the mobi.e partners , told a conference on climate change earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables " at night the price is low ; the car will charge overnight , " vidigal went on .
" next day you come to office , plug again into both plugs .
peak time energy will be expensive and the car may sell energy back to the network . "
as in many countries , hydro-electric dams in portugal already store excess energy from wind farms ; this is used to pump water uphill , to be used to generate power when demand is high .
now the groundwork is being laid for a smart grid that could see cars playing a similar role .
as the first step in what is to be a nationwide programme , edp in 2010 made évora in the alentejo , a city with a population of some 50,000 , the first " inovcity " in the future national " inovgrid . "
" consumers have access almost to real-time information as to their energy consumption , so they 'll be able to manage that better , " explained miguel andrade , a director of edp distribuição , the group 's distribution unit .
" from the company 's side obviously we hope to have operational efficiencies from this .
we hope to integrate more renewables , more micro-generation and eventually in the medium to long-term also the electric vehicle into the grid .
" i think we 're genuinely witnessing a revolution in the way we manage distribution networks . "
nissan investing in portugal but if it 's early days for integrating cars into this vision , what of today 's models ?
the leaf on show in lisbon can not , slot into a smart grid .
but , he said , the model is easily adapted .
" we are implementing the electric vehicles now , so we have to be cost efficient otherwise people would not buy them , " said antónio joaquim , nissan portugal communications director .
" that is why the cars do n't have this and the grid does n't have this capabilities .
" but from the utility 's point of view the technology is already known , from the car industry the technology is already known , so i do n't think that is a very difficult thing to implement later on .
it 's a question of software . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal has already begun rolling out electrical charging stations the leaf itself can already communicate with the charging point : identifying itself and its charging specifications and needs , as well as its owner - who will after all be paying for the power as part of the electricity bill sent to his home .
some environmentalists see models such as the leaf as primarily a public relations exercise for manufacturers that still devote most of their investment to conventional models .
nissan 's own projections for electric cars do not go beyond 10 percent of total sales .
but given that the company is building factories in japan , the us and the uk dedicated to making the leaf - and which it would be difficult and expensive to convert to make other cars - the company is perhaps not the prime target for such accusations .
" everybody in the automotive business is trying to do their own ' greenwash ' , promising ' green ' products - and most are less polluting than before , but not that green , " said antónio pereira , editor of automotor .
" i think nissan is probably taking a lot of risks with the electric car but it 's not doing greenwash - not at all . "

" everybody in the automotive business is trying to do their own ' greenwash ' , promising ' green ' products - and most are less polluting than before , but not that green , " said antónio pereira , editor of automotor .
" i think nissan is probably taking a lot of risks with the electric car but it 's not doing greenwash - not at all . "

he is currently a senior adviser for international affairs at the united states institute of peace and a principal in the rice hadley group . deutsche welle : let 's look back at us and european foreign and security policy this year and take a tally of some major issues .
in afghanistan 2010 was the deadliest year for the international troops with more than 700 soldiers killed , most of them american .
has president obama 's surge strategy failed ?
stephen hadley : there 's been an initial assessment which has not been released publicly in all its detail .
but i think the administration 's assessment , and i think it 's right , is that the strategy of the united states and other allies including most europeans who are with us on the ground in afghanistan is making progress .
it 's slower than we would like , it 's fragile and reversible , but there has been progress .
and i think one of the good things about 2010 is that there has been a coming together of europeans and americans about the importance of afghanistan and about how to pursue our strategy .
president obama has said the us would begin to pull troops out of afghanistan in 2011 , the british have said they may do the same and germany has announced its plans to start withdrawing troops next year as well .
when the three biggest troop contributors start pulling back , can the war in afghanistan still be won ?
yes , because the lede here is not that the troops are pulling back , the lede is that the united states and its allies believe that they will be able to begin to transfer security responsibility to the afghans .
remember , americans and europeans have for several years now been training and helping the afghans to build an army and police that can take increasing security responsibility .
and afghan forces are operating with american and nato and other european forces in afghanistan now , so what the president said was that in 2011 we could begin the process of transferring security responsibility to afghan units and as that occurred it would allow some units of american and european origin to begin to withdraw .
but president obama has been clear , and particularly secretary gates has been clear that that handover of security responsibility to afghanistan and any withdrawal of american forces will be condition-based .
that is to say it will have to reflect progress and security on the ground and will be done in a way that does not jeopardize the progress we have achieved or future progress .
another intractable international issue for the us and the eu is how to deal with iran 's nuclear program .
despite a united position by europeans and americans and tough new sanctions that were put in place in 2010 with the help of russia and china , there does n't seem to be a change of tehran 's stance .
is the west simply running out of options on iran ? i think the administration and our european allies have done a better job than i would have anticipated in getting the russians and the chinese to go along with very tough sanctions .
as you point out , regrettably , it has not resulted in a change of iranian policy on the nuclear issue .
and this is obviously a source of concern for all of us , because the worry is that if the region begins to conclude that the international community is not going to be able to prevent iran from having through its enrichment program a clear path to a nuclear weapon that is going to result in an emboldened iran , it is going to result in weakened arab states and it is going to result in arab states trying to develop their own nuclear programs which is a proliferation risk that will make the middle east less stable not more stable .
2010 was the year in which the obama administration like many before tried and failed to make progress on the peace process between israelis and palestinians because it could n't convince the israeli government to extend a settlement stop even for just a few months .
was the us foolish even to try again or has the us completely lost its leverage with both parties , but especially with the israeli government ?
i think the administration has said as much that the effort that began really soon after administration took power in january 2009 to get a construction freeze in the settlement areas did not work as the administration has intended .
what they had hoped to do was to send a strong message to the world that the administration was going to be even-handed between the israelis and palestinians .
that this message would be greeted in the arab world with steps to reach out toward israel and to begin rebuilding diplomatic relations between israel and the arab world and it simply did not work .
and rather than facilitating negotiations and progress on the negotiating table it became a barrier to negotiations .
it was a tactic , i think the administration would say , that did not work .
so they are trying to restart the process to have these proximity talks to try to turn the focus from settlement construction to what the focus should have been really from the beginning which is the terms of peace .
we can only hope that there will be some success in this effort .
but i think what is really good news for the prospects for peace is what is happening in the west bank .
that president abbas and prime minister salam fayad are building the institutions of a palestinian state even while under occupation .
they are now training security forces that are increasingly taking responsibility for security and are going after terrorists .
the israeli military is recognizing the effectiveness of these forces and cooperating with them .
the palestinians are building political institutions , economic activity and growth has returned to the west bank and there is peace , there is calm , that is to say .
there are no incidents of violence either in the west bank or in israel .
so in some sense while the negotiations seem to have foundered , the underpinnings of an ultimate peace , that is to say the institutions of a democratic palestinian state that is not supporting terror , but is maintaining peace and security for both palestinians and israelis , that process has gone forward .
and i think that is a bright spot and an essential element for an ultimate peace and a two-state solution in the middle east .
many us presidents engaged in foreign policy have a doctrine named after them that spells out their vision or version of america 's engagement with the world .
obama has now passed the half-time mark of his first term .
is there something that could be called an obama doctrine and if so how would you describe and compare it to other presidential doctrines like the so-called bush doctrine ?
i think the obama administration is still a work in progress on foreign policy .
i think they would say as much .
i think they want to be known as an administration that has engaged our adversaries .
i think that policy has had some mixed success i think with respect to north korea and chavez in venezuela and in iran .
and they have certainly been very firm on north korea about the prerequisites to resuming the six-party talks .
i think one of the things that has surprised a lot of people is while i think the administration has had a positive tone in how it has spoken to the arab world and how it has spoken to europe , i think there is a lot more continuity in the policies between president obama and president bush than a lot of people expected .
and that 's not unusual .
in the united states , while we have presidential elections that are waged and fought based often on differences in foreign policy , when new administrations come in and see the problems that the prior administration has faced there is a high degree of continuity in policies between administrations .
and i think you see it in terms of the iraq policy , afghanistan policy and policies dealing with the terrorist threat .
so i think there have been some positive changes in tone .
some have succeeded , some have not .
but i think there has also been a high degree and a useful degree of continuity with the policies of its predecessor administrations .
if you had to give a grade to the obama administration for its foreign policy for this year or for the past two years what grade would that be ?
i think any foreign policy in the first two years generally gets an incomplete .
that is to say , the first year they are figuring out what their policies should be .
the second year they begin to roll out those policies in a more serious way , but it takes another year or two to know whether they are working .
so i think almost any administration in the second year gets an incomplete .
let 's switch to transatlantic affairs : one year ago with lady ashton and herman van rompuy , two relatively obscure politicians were chosen as the eu 's first new president and foreign minister .
the us has long complained about the lack of a common european stance on many international issues .
does washington now finally know which numbers to call in europe ? i think there is a feeling that the economic crisis that we have been through has put a lot of strain on the european project .
so i think most americans think that because of the challenge presented by the economic crisis there is a certain amount of introspection going on within europe about where it is going in terms of its political and economic integration .
i think that is very understandable .
the economic crisis has been a real blow to the entire world and it 's going to take some time to work it through . so i think most americans would say there has been a little bit of a pause in the european project of political and economic integration .
that has been a project that the united states has supported for 50 years , both republican and democratic administrations , and one that we want to succeed .
but understandably there is some soul searching going on in the europeans and we need to let our european allies work these issues through .
barack obama has been described as the first us president who is not an atlanticist naturally inclined toward europe , but rather toward asia .
this and the often quoted rise of asia has led some europeans to worry about the nature and future of the transatlantic relationship .
how healthy is the transatlantic relationship today and how important will it be in the future ? i have been in washington for over 40 years and sort of every 10 years somebody comes up and declares the end of the transatlantic relationship .
and so far all those predictions have been premature .
i think this is really the oldest affiliation for the united states this strong relationship with europe .
i think it continues to remain strong and will remain strong from administration to administration .
that said , the rise of asia and major new world powers in asia such as china and india is getting a lot of attention in the united states .
and it is getting a lot of attention in europe .
germany 's economic recovery is heavily driven by exports to asia , so it is not surprising that both in europe and in the united states there is a lot of discussion about asia and ties toward asia .
that is to say , how can meet the rise of new great powers in asia and how can we turn the rise of those great powers and the economic growth and the economic engine that asia is right now literally pulling the world out of recession , how can we turn that so that it is an opportunity for greater peace and prosperity for the world as a whole .
i think that 's the task in asia and it is something that europeans and americans should be working on together .

after her death , her pakistan people 's party won the elections , and her widowed husband asif ali zardari eventually became the president of pakistan .
however , more than two years after the ppp came into power , there has n't been much progress on benazir bhutto 's murder case , which is still shrouded in mystery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president zardari and premier gilani of the ppp have been in power for more than two years " wider parameters " veteran politician and ppp senator taj haider refutes the allegations that the government has not done much to uncover bhutto 's murderers .
" it was a very big controversy that resulted in benazir 's murder .
we want to be on the right track , and we want to conduct the investigation on scientific lines .
in the first place we involved the united nations so that the wider parameters of the conspiracy behind her murder would be determined .
within those parameters , the un has pointed to certain directions , and now we are proceeding in that direction , " haider told deutsche welle .
the recent arrest of two ex-police officials of the rawalpindi police , saud aziz and khurram shehzad , who were responsible for the security of bhutto , is being hailed by the government as a great success .
according to the public prosecutor chaudhry zulfiqar , the two ex-cops have disclosed the names of four or five high-ranking army officials belonging to pakistan 's spy agency , the inter-services intelligence -lrb- isi -rrb- , with whom they claim to have contact .
but political analysts doubt whether the government could do anything against the omnipotent isi .
" the civilian government is completely powerless when it comes to the army and the isi , as we have seen so many times before .
there is a huge cover-up , there is a lot that does n't meet the eye , " said journalist kamran shafi of pakistan 's leading english daily dawn in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of bhutto burn a police vehicle and a bus after bhutto 's murder the isi ' connection ' taj haider maintains the government is capable of bringing the culprits to justice irrespective of their institutional links .
he does not blame the isi as an institution .
" there are intelligence agencies within intelligence agencies , and there are parallel intelligence agencies as well .
some retired isi officers have made their own setups , and through these setups they are still propagating the same ideology of religious extremism that resulted in benazir bhutto 's death . "
a united nations commission , set up to investigate bhutto 's murder on the request of the ppp government , revealed in its detailed report earlier this year that the security arrangements for bhutto were seriously inadequate , and that some security agencies tried to hinder the initial investigations .
although the government considers the un report to be an extremely important document , critics believe the government has not yet implemented the commission 's recommendations .
musharraf 's ' questionnaire ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pervez musharraf was the president at the time of bhutto 's murder another aspect of the case is the role of former military ruler pervez musharraf .
the government is under immense pressure to bring musharraf back to pakistan from england , where he is living in self-imposed exile .
but kamran shafi does not see that happen any time soon .
" all we know so far is that the government has sent him a questionnaire .
this is the second time we are hearing that .
musharraf said he never received such a questionnaire .
but the actual point is that he was the president and the military dictator at that time .
he may not be involved personally in ordering the assassination , but certainly the responsibility rests on his shoulders , " said shafi .
the government has planned several functions to commemorate the third death anniversary of its ' martyred ' leader on december 27 .
but this might not be enough to satisfy the party workers as well as the government 's critics .

he is currently a senior adviser for international affairs at the united states institute of peace and a principal in the rice hadley group . deutsche welle : let 's look back at us and european foreign and security policy this year and take a tally of some major issues .
in afghanistan 2010 was the deadliest year for the international troops with more than 700 soldiers killed , most of them american .
has president obama 's surge strategy failed ?
stephen hadley : there 's been an initial assessment which has not been released publicly in all its detail .
but i think the administration 's assessment , and i think it 's right , is that the strategy of the united states and other allies including most europeans who are with us on the ground in afghanistan is making progress .
it 's slower than we would like , it 's fragile and reversible , but there has been progress .
and i think one of the good things about 2010 is that there has been a coming together of europeans and americans about the importance of afghanistan and about how to pursue our strategy .
president obama has said the us would begin to pull troops out of afghanistan in 2011 , the british have said they may do the same and germany has announced its plans to start withdrawing troops next year as well .
when the three biggest troop contributors start pulling back , can the war in afghanistan still be won ?
yes , because the lede here is not that the troops are pulling back , the lede is that the united states and its allies believe that they will be able to begin to transfer security responsibility to the afghans .
remember , americans and europeans have for several years now been training and helping the afghans to build an army and police that can take increasing security responsibility .
and afghan forces are operating with american and nato and other european forces in afghanistan now , so what the president said was that in 2011 we could begin the process of transferring security responsibility to afghan units and as that occurred it would allow some units of american and european origin to begin to withdraw .
but president obama has been clear , and particularly secretary gates has been clear that that handover of security responsibility to afghanistan and any withdrawal of american forces will be condition-based .
that is to say it will have to reflect progress and security on the ground and will be done in a way that does not jeopardize the progress we have achieved or future progress .
another intractable international issue for the us and the eu is how to deal with iran 's nuclear program .
despite a united position by europeans and americans and tough new sanctions that were put in place in 2010 with the help of russia and china , there does n't seem to be a change of tehran 's stance .
is the west simply running out of options on iran ? i think the administration and our european allies have done a better job than i would have anticipated in getting the russians and the chinese to go along with very tough sanctions .
as you point out , regrettably , it has not resulted in a change of iranian policy on the nuclear issue .
and this is obviously a source of concern for all of us , because the worry is that if the region begins to conclude that the international community is not going to be able to prevent iran from having through its enrichment program a clear path to a nuclear weapon that is going to result in an emboldened iran , it is going to result in weakened arab states and it is going to result in arab states trying to develop their own nuclear programs which is a proliferation risk that will make the middle east less stable not more stable .
2010 was the year in which the obama administration like many before tried and failed to make progress on the peace process between israelis and palestinians because it could n't convince the israeli government to extend a settlement stop even for just a few months .
was the us foolish even to try again or has the us completely lost its leverage with both parties , but especially with the israeli government ?
i think the administration has said as much that the effort that began really soon after administration took power in january 2009 to get a construction freeze in the settlement areas did not work as the administration has intended .
what they had hoped to do was to send a strong message to the world that the administration was going to be even-handed between the israelis and palestinians .
that this message would be greeted in the arab world with steps to reach out toward israel and to begin rebuilding diplomatic relations between israel and the arab world and it simply did not work .
and rather than facilitating negotiations and progress on the negotiating table it became a barrier to negotiations .
it was a tactic , i think the administration would say , that did not work .
so they are trying to restart the process to have these proximity talks to try to turn the focus from settlement construction to what the focus should have been really from the beginning which is the terms of peace .
we can only hope that there will be some success in this effort .
but i think what is really good news for the prospects for peace is what is happening in the west bank .
that president abbas and prime minister salam fayad are building the institutions of a palestinian state even while under occupation .
they are now training security forces that are increasingly taking responsibility for security and are going after terrorists .
the israeli military is recognizing the effectiveness of these forces and cooperating with them .
the palestinians are building political institutions , economic activity and growth has returned to the west bank and there is peace , there is calm , that is to say .
there are no incidents of violence either in the west bank or in israel .
so in some sense while the negotiations seem to have foundered , the underpinnings of an ultimate peace , that is to say the institutions of a democratic palestinian state that is not supporting terror , but is maintaining peace and security for both palestinians and israelis , that process has gone forward .
and i think that is a bright spot and an essential element for an ultimate peace and a two-state solution in the middle east .
many us presidents engaged in foreign policy have a doctrine named after them that spells out their vision or version of america 's engagement with the world .
obama has now passed the half-time mark of his first term .
is there something that could be called an obama doctrine and if so how would you describe and compare it to other presidential doctrines like the so-called bush doctrine ?
i think the obama administration is still a work in progress on foreign policy .
i think they would say as much .
i think they want to be known as an administration that has engaged our adversaries .
i think that policy has had some mixed success i think with respect to north korea and chavez in venezuela and in iran .
and they have certainly been very firm on north korea about the prerequisites to resuming the six-party talks .
i think one of the things that has surprised a lot of people is while i think the administration has had a positive tone in how it has spoken to the arab world and how it has spoken to europe , i think there is a lot more continuity in the policies between president obama and president bush than a lot of people expected .
and that 's not unusual .
in the united states , while we have presidential elections that are waged and fought based often on differences in foreign policy , when new administrations come in and see the problems that the prior administration has faced there is a high degree of continuity in policies between administrations .
and i think you see it in terms of the iraq policy , afghanistan policy and policies dealing with the terrorist threat .
so i think there have been some positive changes in tone .
some have succeeded , some have not .
but i think there has also been a high degree and a useful degree of continuity with the policies of its predecessor administrations .
if you had to give a grade to the obama administration for its foreign policy for this year or for the past two years what grade would that be ?
i think any foreign policy in the first two years generally gets an incomplete .
that is to say , the first year they are figuring out what their policies should be .
the second year they begin to roll out those policies in a more serious way , but it takes another year or two to know whether they are working .
so i think almost any administration in the second year gets an incomplete .
let 's switch to transatlantic affairs : one year ago with lady ashton and herman van rompuy , two relatively obscure politicians were chosen as the eu 's first new president and foreign minister .
the us has long complained about the lack of a common european stance on many international issues .
does washington now finally know which numbers to call in europe ? i think there is a feeling that the economic crisis that we have been through has put a lot of strain on the european project .
so i think most americans think that because of the challenge presented by the economic crisis there is a certain amount of introspection going on within europe about where it is going in terms of its political and economic integration .
i think that is very understandable .
the economic crisis has been a real blow to the entire world and it 's going to take some time to work it through . so i think most americans would say there has been a little bit of a pause in the european project of political and economic integration .
that has been a project that the united states has supported for 50 years , both republican and democratic administrations , and one that we want to succeed .
but understandably there is some soul searching going on in the europeans and we need to let our european allies work these issues through .
barack obama has been described as the first us president who is not an atlanticist naturally inclined toward europe , but rather toward asia .
this and the often quoted rise of asia has led some europeans to worry about the nature and future of the transatlantic relationship .
how healthy is the transatlantic relationship today and how important will it be in the future ? i have been in washington for over 40 years and sort of every 10 years somebody comes up and declares the end of the transatlantic relationship .
and so far all those predictions have been premature .
i think this is really the oldest affiliation for the united states this strong relationship with europe .
i think it continues to remain strong and will remain strong from administration to administration .
that said , the rise of asia and major new world powers in asia such as china and india is getting a lot of attention in the united states .
and it is getting a lot of attention in europe .
germany 's economic recovery is heavily driven by exports to asia , so it is not surprising that both in europe and in the united states there is a lot of discussion about asia and ties toward asia .
that is to say , how can meet the rise of new great powers in asia and how can we turn the rise of those great powers and the economic growth and the economic engine that asia is right now literally pulling the world out of recession , how can we turn that so that it is an opportunity for greater peace and prosperity for the world as a whole .
i think that 's the task in asia and it is something that europeans and americans should be working on together .

" solidarity , understanding and getting along with one another : we need this in our families , in our private lives and in society , " wulff said .
" this won ’ t happen on its own , we need to work at it . "
the president noted that christmas is a time when everyone seeks to spend time with those who are near and dear to them , while at the same time focusing on helping the less fortunate .
around 190 guests were present for the recording of the speech at bellevue palace , the official residence of the president , among them , schoolchildren , scouts , and police officers .
the president singled out those who do voluntary work - in its many forms - for particular praise .
while the state can help those in need through financial support , he said , it ca n't provide the necessary human touch .
" encouragement , a pat on the shoulder and reaching out a helping hand is important for humanity and needs people to do it , " he said .
" and by the way , people engaged in voluntary work in society live longer . " mutual respect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 2,000 years on , the desire for peace remains wulff also reaffirmed his commitment to germany ’ s multicultural society , describing germany as " free and diverse . "
the president highlighted the many differences between citizens , in terms of religion , education , and their hopes and dreams .
" in order for such a diverse society to continue to thrive in the long term , we need one thing above all , respect , " he said .
" respect for those who are different while at the same time recognizing them for their achievements . "
germany as a role model the president noted that germany is well respected in the world for its peaceful and tolerant society , and its reliability when dealing with other nations , both great and small .
and he said germany was prepared to take on greater responsibilities beyond its borders , including within europe .
at the same time , though , germany he said , expected the same from its partners .
" we trust in a united europe and the influence that europe can have , " he said .
the president then used his speech to thank not only the many german soldiers , policemen and aid workers who are serving abroad , but also their families , who are unable to see their loved ones at this special time of year .
before extending christmas wishes to all germans , the president alluded to the christmas story , saying that the desire for peace on earth expressed at bethlehem more than 2,000 years ago remained a constant , even today .

yes , because the lede here is not that the troops are pulling back , the lede is that the united states and its allies believe that they will be able to begin to transfer security responsibility to the afghans .
remember , americans and europeans have for several years now been training and helping the afghans to build an army and police that can take increasing security responsibility .
and afghan forces are operating with american and nato and other european forces in afghanistan now , so what the president said was that in 2011 we could begin the process of transferring security responsibility to afghan units and as that occurred it would allow some units of american and european origin to begin to withdraw .
but president obama has been clear , and particularly secretary gates has been clear that that handover of security responsibility to afghanistan and any withdrawal of american forces will be condition-based .
that is to say it will have to reflect progress and security on the ground and will be done in a way that does not jeopardize the progress we have achieved or future progress .
another intractable international issue for the us and the eu is how to deal with iran 's nuclear program .
despite a united position by europeans and americans and tough new sanctions that were put in place in 2010 with the help of russia and china , there does n't seem to be a change of tehran 's stance .
is the west simply running out of options on iran ? i think the administration and our european allies have done a better job than i would have anticipated in getting the russians and the chinese to go along with very tough sanctions .
as you point out , regrettably , it has not resulted in a change of iranian policy on the nuclear issue .
and this is obviously a source of concern for all of us , because the worry is that if the region begins to conclude that the international community is not going to be able to prevent iran from having through its enrichment program a clear path to a nuclear weapon that is going to result in an emboldened iran , it is going to result in weakened arab states and it is going to result in arab states trying to develop their own nuclear programs which is a proliferation risk that will make the middle east less stable not more stable .
2010 was the year in which the obama administration like many before tried and failed to make progress on the peace process between israelis and palestinians because it could n't convince the israeli government to extend a settlement stop even for just a few months .
was the us foolish even to try again or has the us completely lost its leverage with both parties , but especially with the israeli government ?
i think the administration has said as much that the effort that began really soon after administration took power in january 2009 to get a construction freeze in the settlement areas did not work as the administration has intended .
what they had hoped to do was to send a strong message to the world that the administration was going to be even-handed between the israelis and palestinians .
that this message would be greeted in the arab world with steps to reach out toward israel and to begin rebuilding diplomatic relations between israel and the arab world and it simply did not work .
and rather than facilitating negotiations and progress on the negotiating table it became a barrier to negotiations .
it was a tactic , i think the administration would say , that did not work .
so they are trying to restart the process to have these proximity talks to try to turn the focus from settlement construction to what the focus should have been really from the beginning which is the terms of peace .
we can only hope that there will be some success in this effort .
but i think what is really good news for the prospects for peace is what is happening in the west bank .
that president abbas and prime minister salam fayad are building the institutions of a palestinian state even while under occupation .
they are now training security forces that are increasingly taking responsibility for security and are going after terrorists .
the israeli military is recognizing the effectiveness of these forces and cooperating with them .
the palestinians are building political institutions , economic activity and growth has returned to the west bank and there is peace , there is calm , that is to say .
there are no incidents of violence either in the west bank or in israel .
so in some sense while the negotiations seem to have foundered , the underpinnings of an ultimate peace , that is to say the institutions of a democratic palestinian state that is not supporting terror , but is maintaining peace and security for both palestinians and israelis , that process has gone forward .
and i think that is a bright spot and an essential element for an ultimate peace and a two-state solution in the middle east .
many us presidents engaged in foreign policy have a doctrine named after them that spells out their vision or version of america 's engagement with the world .
obama has now passed the half-time mark of his first term .
is there something that could be called an obama doctrine and if so how would you describe and compare it to other presidential doctrines like the so-called bush doctrine ?
i think the obama administration is still a work in progress on foreign policy .
i think they would say as much .
i think they want to be known as an administration that has engaged our adversaries .
i think that policy has had some mixed success i think with respect to north korea and chavez in venezuela and in iran .
and they have certainly been very firm on north korea about the prerequisites to resuming the six-party talks .
i think one of the things that has surprised a lot of people is while i think the administration has had a positive tone in how it has spoken to the arab world and how it has spoken to europe , i think there is a lot more continuity in the policies between president obama and president bush than a lot of people expected .
and that 's not unusual .
in the united states , while we have presidential elections that are waged and fought based often on differences in foreign policy , when new administrations come in and see the problems that the prior administration has faced there is a high degree of continuity in policies between administrations .
and i think you see it in terms of the iraq policy , afghanistan policy and policies dealing with the terrorist threat .
so i think there have been some positive changes in tone .
some have succeeded , some have not .
but i think there has also been a high degree and a useful degree of continuity with the policies of its predecessor administrations .
if you had to give a grade to the obama administration for its foreign policy for this year or for the past two years what grade would that be ?
i think any foreign policy in the first two years generally gets an incomplete .
that is to say , the first year they are figuring out what their policies should be .
the second year they begin to roll out those policies in a more serious way , but it takes another year or two to know whether they are working .
so i think almost any administration in the second year gets an incomplete .
let 's switch to transatlantic affairs : one year ago with lady ashton and herman van rompuy , two relatively obscure politicians were chosen as the eu 's first new president and foreign minister .
the us has long complained about the lack of a common european stance on many international issues .
does washington now finally know which numbers to call in europe ? i think there is a feeling that the economic crisis that we have been through has put a lot of strain on the european project .
so i think most americans think that because of the challenge presented by the economic crisis there is a certain amount of introspection going on within europe about where it is going in terms of its political and economic integration .
i think that is very understandable .
the economic crisis has been a real blow to the entire world and it 's going to take some time to work it through . so i think most americans would say there has been a little bit of a pause in the european project of political and economic integration .
that has been a project that the united states has supported for 50 years , both republican and democratic administrations , and one that we want to succeed .
but understandably there is some soul searching going on in the europeans and we need to let our european allies work these issues through .
barack obama has been described as the first us president who is not an atlanticist naturally inclined toward europe , but rather toward asia .
this and the often quoted rise of asia has led some europeans to worry about the nature and future of the transatlantic relationship .
how healthy is the transatlantic relationship today and how important will it be in the future ? i have been in washington for over 40 years and sort of every 10 years somebody comes up and declares the end of the transatlantic relationship .
and so far all those predictions have been premature .
i think this is really the oldest affiliation for the united states this strong relationship with europe .
i think it continues to remain strong and will remain strong from administration to administration .
that said , the rise of asia and major new world powers in asia such as china and india is getting a lot of attention in the united states .
and it is getting a lot of attention in europe .
germany 's economic recovery is heavily driven by exports to asia , so it is not surprising that both in europe and in the united states there is a lot of discussion about asia and ties toward asia .
that is to say , how can meet the rise of new great powers in asia and how can we turn the rise of those great powers and the economic growth and the economic engine that asia is right now literally pulling the world out of recession , how can we turn that so that it is an opportunity for greater peace and prosperity for the world as a whole .
i think that 's the task in asia and it is something that europeans and americans should be working on together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.12.2010 rise of electric cars prompt ' smart ' electrical grids in portugal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nissan leaf will launch in portugal in january portugal ’ s long-term target of 750,000 electric cars fits with its smart energy plans .
already , the country has 40 percent of its energy coming from renewable sources . the launch in portugal in january of nissan 's leaf marks the start of the rollout in europe of what the company says is the first 100 percent electric car aimed at a mass market .
nissan targeted portugal - where it will also soon be assembling batteries for the leaf - after that country 's government agreed to setting up a national network of charging points .
in fact , the network is to be compatible with any make of electric car , and is part of still more ambitious long-term plans for a genuinely " smart grid " that could help portugal make fuller use of its fast-expanding renewable energy capacity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government wants to expand its network of charging stations in early december , amid ultra-modern architecture at the former site of the expo 98 world fair in lisbon , members of the portuguese public got the chance to test drive the leaf .
portuguese consumers are curious about electric cars comments ranged from the polite to the enthusiastic , with the lack of engine noise the most obvious characteristic of what at first glance looks like a regular five-seater family run-around .
but the very lack of engine noise creates some new " problems . "
" for instance , the headlamps have a specific design to avoid air going to the mirrors , " said antónio joaquim , the communications director of nissan iberia portugal .
" the exterior mirrors on a normal car produce a lot of noise with the wind .
but on this car , which does n't make any noise from the engine , all the very small noises that on other cars are not perceptible are - let 's say , uncomfortable . "
the more obvious matter of charging the car seems straightforward : a small panel on the bonnet opens to reveal something rather similar to an ordinary electric plug .
" if you want to charge when you are parking inside a garage in your own house or in a shopping centre , it 's better to have it on the bonnet , " joaquim added .
" it 's a completely different usage from a combustion engine .
you just charge the car during your daily life . "
charging stations are scarce for now , but are expected to increase there are two charging options : a partial quick charge , for example when you are on the motorway and do not want to stop for long , or a cheaper slow charge of up to eight hours .
prospective buyers in lisbon seemed to take the limitations of electric cars on board .
" it 's a nice car , and a good prospect for someone like me who has an urban life , and drives about 30 or 40 kilometres to work and back , " said one man , who declined to give his name .
the innovative design of the leaf 's lithium batteries means that you can drive the car for longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotor 's editor thinks that the european car of the year jury missed out on the prius but even a fully-charged leaf has a more limited range than a car with a full fuel tank .
so the fact that it recently was named european car of the year - the first completely electric vehicle to do so - raised some eyebrows .
antónio pereira , editor of portuguese car magazine automotor , told deutsche welle he suspected the competition 's jury may have been anxious not to miss a trick , having previously failed to garland the first version of the toyota prius , which later became a hit .
the nissan leaf is , he said , an interesting experiment , and portugal a suitably small testing ground , but with some problems .
" recharging stations are still few -lsb- in number -rsb- and mainly in the big cities , " he said .
" and in portugal we mainly live in apartments .
so either you have a parking space in your building or you have to recharge at night in the public recharging station .
that 's complicated because there wo n't be one for each . "
portugal pushing for dynmaic energy flow in its ' smart grid ' still , the spread of on-street charging points in portugal is the reason the leaf is getting its european launch in the country .
the government-led mobi.e consortium is installing 1,300 chargers around the country , compatible with all makes of car .
in addition , the state is offering a 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- subsidy for buyers of electric cars - bringing the leaf 's price down to 30,000 euro - and a road-tax exemption .
portugal 's ambitious declared long-term target of 750,000 electric vehicles on its roads also fits with plans to expand its renewable energy output , going some way to addressing sceptics ' argument that electric cars ' environmental impact depends on where their power comes from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government is subsidizing the purchase price of electric cars " we have defined as a target to be the first country to have a nationwide and comprehensive infrastructure for vehicles and to work to give the necessary framework and incentives so that we can massively introduce the electric vehicle , " luís reis of mobi.e explained at a trade fair earlier this year .
" this is important not only in terms of the sustainability of mobility but also in terms of the strategy that we have for energy . "
portuguese society has high reliance on renewable sources portugal - for decades heavily reliant on imported oil for its energy needs - now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables , and rising .
and officials overseeing the development of the electric grid envision a future in which drivers will actually be able to profit from helping ensure that same energy is used efficiently , when electric cars have full internet capability .
" you drive it home in the evening , plug -lsb- it in to -rsb- both internet and power , and the car starts receiving signals of electricity spot prices , " antónio vidigal , a director of privatised utility edp , one of the mobi.e partners , told a conference on climate change earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables " at night the price is low ; the car will charge overnight , " vidigal went on .
" next day you come to office , plug again into both plugs .
peak time energy will be expensive and the car may sell energy back to the network . "
as in many countries , hydro-electric dams in portugal already store excess energy from wind farms ; this is used to pump water uphill , to be used to generate power when demand is high .
now the groundwork is being laid for a smart grid that could see cars playing a similar role .
as the first step in what is to be a nationwide programme , edp in 2010 made évora in the alentejo , a city with a population of some 50,000 , the first " inovcity " in the future national " inovgrid . "
" consumers have access almost to real-time information as to their energy consumption , so they 'll be able to manage that better , " explained miguel andrade , a director of edp distribuição , the group 's distribution unit .
" from the company 's side obviously we hope to have operational efficiencies from this .
we hope to integrate more renewables , more micro-generation and eventually in the medium to long-term also the electric vehicle into the grid .
" i think we 're genuinely witnessing a revolution in the way we manage distribution networks . "
nissan investing in portugal but if it 's early days for integrating cars into this vision , what of today 's models ?
the leaf on show in lisbon can not , slot into a smart grid .
but , he said , the model is easily adapted .
" we are implementing the electric vehicles now , so we have to be cost efficient otherwise people would not buy them , " said antónio joaquim , nissan portugal communications director .
" that is why the cars do n't have this and the grid does n't have this capabilities .
" but from the utility 's point of view the technology is already known , from the car industry the technology is already known , so i do n't think that is a very difficult thing to implement later on .
it 's a question of software . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal has already begun rolling out electrical charging stations the leaf itself can already communicate with the charging point : identifying itself and its charging specifications and needs , as well as its owner - who will after all be paying for the power as part of the electricity bill sent to his home .
some environmentalists see models such as the leaf as primarily a public relations exercise for manufacturers that still devote most of their investment to conventional models .
nissan 's own projections for electric cars do not go beyond 10 percent of total sales .
but given that the company is building factories in japan , the us and the uk dedicated to making the leaf - and which it would be difficult and expensive to convert to make other cars - the company is perhaps not the prime target for such accusations .
" everybody in the automotive business is trying to do their own ' greenwash ' , promising ' green ' products - and most are less polluting than before , but not that green , " said antónio pereira , editor of automotor .
" i think nissan is probably taking a lot of risks with the electric car but it 's not doing greenwash - not at all . "

he is currently a senior adviser for international affairs at the united states institute of peace and a principal in the rice hadley group . deutsche welle : let 's look back at us and european foreign and security policy this year and take a tally of some major issues .
in afghanistan 2010 was the deadliest year for the international troops with more than 700 soldiers killed , most of them american .
has president obama 's surge strategy failed ?
stephen hadley : there 's been an initial assessment which has not been released publicly in all its detail .
but i think the administration 's assessment , and i think it 's right , is that the strategy of the united states and other allies including most europeans who are with us on the ground in afghanistan is making progress .
it 's slower than we would like , it 's fragile and reversible , but there has been progress .
and i think one of the good things about 2010 is that there has been a coming together of europeans and americans about the importance of afghanistan and about how to pursue our strategy .
president obama has said the us would begin to pull troops out of afghanistan in 2011 , the british have said they may do the same and germany has announced its plans to start withdrawing troops next year as well .
when the three biggest troop contributors start pulling back , can the war in afghanistan still be won ?
yes , because the lede here is not that the troops are pulling back , the lede is that the united states and its allies believe that they will be able to begin to transfer security responsibility to the afghans .
remember , americans and europeans have for several years now been training and helping the afghans to build an army and police that can take increasing security responsibility .
and afghan forces are operating with american and nato and other european forces in afghanistan now , so what the president said was that in 2011 we could begin the process of transferring security responsibility to afghan units and as that occurred it would allow some units of american and european origin to begin to withdraw .
but president obama has been clear , and particularly secretary gates has been clear that that handover of security responsibility to afghanistan and any withdrawal of american forces will be condition-based .
that is to say it will have to reflect progress and security on the ground and will be done in a way that does not jeopardize the progress we have achieved or future progress .
another intractable international issue for the us and the eu is how to deal with iran 's nuclear program .
despite a united position by europeans and americans and tough new sanctions that were put in place in 2010 with the help of russia and china , there does n't seem to be a change of tehran 's stance .
is the west simply running out of options on iran ? i think the administration and our european allies have done a better job than i would have anticipated in getting the russians and the chinese to go along with very tough sanctions .
as you point out , regrettably , it has not resulted in a change of iranian policy on the nuclear issue .
and this is obviously a source of concern for all of us , because the worry is that if the region begins to conclude that the international community is not going to be able to prevent iran from having through its enrichment program a clear path to a nuclear weapon that is going to result in an emboldened iran , it is going to result in weakened arab states and it is going to result in arab states trying to develop their own nuclear programs which is a proliferation risk that will make the middle east less stable not more stable .
2010 was the year in which the obama administration like many before tried and failed to make progress on the peace process between israelis and palestinians because it could n't convince the israeli government to extend a settlement stop even for just a few months .
was the us foolish even to try again or has the us completely lost its leverage with both parties , but especially with the israeli government ?
i think the administration has said as much that the effort that began really soon after administration took power in january 2009 to get a construction freeze in the settlement areas did not work as the administration has intended .
what they had hoped to do was to send a strong message to the world that the administration was going to be even-handed between the israelis and palestinians .
that this message would be greeted in the arab world with steps to reach out toward israel and to begin rebuilding diplomatic relations between israel and the arab world and it simply did not work .
and rather than facilitating negotiations and progress on the negotiating table it became a barrier to negotiations .
it was a tactic , i think the administration would say , that did not work .
so they are trying to restart the process to have these proximity talks to try to turn the focus from settlement construction to what the focus should have been really from the beginning which is the terms of peace .
we can only hope that there will be some success in this effort .
but i think what is really good news for the prospects for peace is what is happening in the west bank .
that president abbas and prime minister salam fayad are building the institutions of a palestinian state even while under occupation .
they are now training security forces that are increasingly taking responsibility for security and are going after terrorists .
the israeli military is recognizing the effectiveness of these forces and cooperating with them .
the palestinians are building political institutions , economic activity and growth has returned to the west bank and there is peace , there is calm , that is to say .
there are no incidents of violence either in the west bank or in israel .
so in some sense while the negotiations seem to have foundered , the underpinnings of an ultimate peace , that is to say the institutions of a democratic palestinian state that is not supporting terror , but is maintaining peace and security for both palestinians and israelis , that process has gone forward .
and i think that is a bright spot and an essential element for an ultimate peace and a two-state solution in the middle east .
many us presidents engaged in foreign policy have a doctrine named after them that spells out their vision or version of america 's engagement with the world .
obama has now passed the half-time mark of his first term .
is there something that could be called an obama doctrine and if so how would you describe and compare it to other presidential doctrines like the so-called bush doctrine ?
i think the obama administration is still a work in progress on foreign policy .
i think they would say as much .
i think they want to be known as an administration that has engaged our adversaries .
i think that policy has had some mixed success i think with respect to north korea and chavez in venezuela and in iran .
and they have certainly been very firm on north korea about the prerequisites to resuming the six-party talks .
i think one of the things that has surprised a lot of people is while i think the administration has had a positive tone in how it has spoken to the arab world and how it has spoken to europe , i think there is a lot more continuity in the policies between president obama and president bush than a lot of people expected .
and that 's not unusual .
in the united states , while we have presidential elections that are waged and fought based often on differences in foreign policy , when new administrations come in and see the problems that the prior administration has faced there is a high degree of continuity in policies between administrations .
and i think you see it in terms of the iraq policy , afghanistan policy and policies dealing with the terrorist threat .
so i think there have been some positive changes in tone .
some have succeeded , some have not .
but i think there has also been a high degree and a useful degree of continuity with the policies of its predecessor administrations .
if you had to give a grade to the obama administration for its foreign policy for this year or for the past two years what grade would that be ?
i think any foreign policy in the first two years generally gets an incomplete .
that is to say , the first year they are figuring out what their policies should be .
the second year they begin to roll out those policies in a more serious way , but it takes another year or two to know whether they are working .
so i think almost any administration in the second year gets an incomplete .
let 's switch to transatlantic affairs : one year ago with lady ashton and herman van rompuy , two relatively obscure politicians were chosen as the eu 's first new president and foreign minister .
the us has long complained about the lack of a common european stance on many international issues .
does washington now finally know which numbers to call in europe ? i think there is a feeling that the economic crisis that we have been through has put a lot of strain on the european project .
so i think most americans think that because of the challenge presented by the economic crisis there is a certain amount of introspection going on within europe about where it is going in terms of its political and economic integration .
i think that is very understandable .
the economic crisis has been a real blow to the entire world and it 's going to take some time to work it through . so i think most americans would say there has been a little bit of a pause in the european project of political and economic integration .
that has been a project that the united states has supported for 50 years , both republican and democratic administrations , and one that we want to succeed .
but understandably there is some soul searching going on in the europeans and we need to let our european allies work these issues through .
barack obama has been described as the first us president who is not an atlanticist naturally inclined toward europe , but rather toward asia .
this and the often quoted rise of asia has led some europeans to worry about the nature and future of the transatlantic relationship .
how healthy is the transatlantic relationship today and how important will it be in the future ? i have been in washington for over 40 years and sort of every 10 years somebody comes up and declares the end of the transatlantic relationship .
and so far all those predictions have been premature .
i think this is really the oldest affiliation for the united states this strong relationship with europe .
i think it continues to remain strong and will remain strong from administration to administration .
that said , the rise of asia and major new world powers in asia such as china and india is getting a lot of attention in the united states .
and it is getting a lot of attention in europe .
germany 's economic recovery is heavily driven by exports to asia , so it is not surprising that both in europe and in the united states there is a lot of discussion about asia and ties toward asia .
that is to say , how can meet the rise of new great powers in asia and how can we turn the rise of those great powers and the economic growth and the economic engine that asia is right now literally pulling the world out of recession , how can we turn that so that it is an opportunity for greater peace and prosperity for the world as a whole .
i think that 's the task in asia and it is something that europeans and americans should be working on together .

in afghanistan 2010 was the deadliest year for the international troops with more than 700 soldiers killed , most of them american .
has president obama 's surge strategy failed ?
stephen hadley : there 's been an initial assessment which has not been released publicly in all its detail .
but i think the administration 's assessment , and i think it 's right , is that the strategy of the united states and other allies including most europeans who are with us on the ground in afghanistan is making progress .
it 's slower than we would like , it 's fragile and reversible , but there has been progress .
and i think one of the good things about 2010 is that there has been a coming together of europeans and americans about the importance of afghanistan and about how to pursue our strategy .
president obama has said the us would begin to pull troops out of afghanistan in 2011 , the british have said they may do the same and germany has announced its plans to start withdrawing troops next year as well .
when the three biggest troop contributors start pulling back , can the war in afghanistan still be won ?
yes , because the lede here is not that the troops are pulling back , the lede is that the united states and its allies believe that they will be able to begin to transfer security responsibility to the afghans .
remember , americans and europeans have for several years now been training and helping the afghans to build an army and police that can take increasing security responsibility .
and afghan forces are operating with american and nato and other european forces in afghanistan now , so what the president said was that in 2011 we could begin the process of transferring security responsibility to afghan units and as that occurred it would allow some units of american and european origin to begin to withdraw .
but president obama has been clear , and particularly secretary gates has been clear that that handover of security responsibility to afghanistan and any withdrawal of american forces will be condition-based .
that is to say it will have to reflect progress and security on the ground and will be done in a way that does not jeopardize the progress we have achieved or future progress .
another intractable international issue for the us and the eu is how to deal with iran 's nuclear program .
despite a united position by europeans and americans and tough new sanctions that were put in place in 2010 with the help of russia and china , there does n't seem to be a change of tehran 's stance .
is the west simply running out of options on iran ? i think the administration and our european allies have done a better job than i would have anticipated in getting the russians and the chinese to go along with very tough sanctions .
as you point out , regrettably , it has not resulted in a change of iranian policy on the nuclear issue .
and this is obviously a source of concern for all of us , because the worry is that if the region begins to conclude that the international community is not going to be able to prevent iran from having through its enrichment program a clear path to a nuclear weapon that is going to result in an emboldened iran , it is going to result in weakened arab states and it is going to result in arab states trying to develop their own nuclear programs which is a proliferation risk that will make the middle east less stable not more stable .
2010 was the year in which the obama administration like many before tried and failed to make progress on the peace process between israelis and palestinians because it could n't convince the israeli government to extend a settlement stop even for just a few months .
was the us foolish even to try again or has the us completely lost its leverage with both parties , but especially with the israeli government ?
i think the administration has said as much that the effort that began really soon after administration took power in january 2009 to get a construction freeze in the settlement areas did not work as the administration has intended .
what they had hoped to do was to send a strong message to the world that the administration was going to be even-handed between the israelis and palestinians .
that this message would be greeted in the arab world with steps to reach out toward israel and to begin rebuilding diplomatic relations between israel and the arab world and it simply did not work .
and rather than facilitating negotiations and progress on the negotiating table it became a barrier to negotiations .
it was a tactic , i think the administration would say , that did not work .
so they are trying to restart the process to have these proximity talks to try to turn the focus from settlement construction to what the focus should have been really from the beginning which is the terms of peace .
we can only hope that there will be some success in this effort .
but i think what is really good news for the prospects for peace is what is happening in the west bank .
that president abbas and prime minister salam fayad are building the institutions of a palestinian state even while under occupation .
they are now training security forces that are increasingly taking responsibility for security and are going after terrorists .
the israeli military is recognizing the effectiveness of these forces and cooperating with them .
the palestinians are building political institutions , economic activity and growth has returned to the west bank and there is peace , there is calm , that is to say .
there are no incidents of violence either in the west bank or in israel .
so in some sense while the negotiations seem to have foundered , the underpinnings of an ultimate peace , that is to say the institutions of a democratic palestinian state that is not supporting terror , but is maintaining peace and security for both palestinians and israelis , that process has gone forward .
and i think that is a bright spot and an essential element for an ultimate peace and a two-state solution in the middle east .
many us presidents engaged in foreign policy have a doctrine named after them that spells out their vision or version of america 's engagement with the world .
obama has now passed the half-time mark of his first term .
is there something that could be called an obama doctrine and if so how would you describe and compare it to other presidential doctrines like the so-called bush doctrine ?
i think the obama administration is still a work in progress on foreign policy .
i think they would say as much .
i think they want to be known as an administration that has engaged our adversaries .
i think that policy has had some mixed success i think with respect to north korea and chavez in venezuela and in iran .
and they have certainly been very firm on north korea about the prerequisites to resuming the six-party talks .
i think one of the things that has surprised a lot of people is while i think the administration has had a positive tone in how it has spoken to the arab world and how it has spoken to europe , i think there is a lot more continuity in the policies between president obama and president bush than a lot of people expected .
and that 's not unusual .
in the united states , while we have presidential elections that are waged and fought based often on differences in foreign policy , when new administrations come in and see the problems that the prior administration has faced there is a high degree of continuity in policies between administrations .
and i think you see it in terms of the iraq policy , afghanistan policy and policies dealing with the terrorist threat .
so i think there have been some positive changes in tone .
some have succeeded , some have not .
but i think there has also been a high degree and a useful degree of continuity with the policies of its predecessor administrations .
if you had to give a grade to the obama administration for its foreign policy for this year or for the past two years what grade would that be ?
i think any foreign policy in the first two years generally gets an incomplete .
that is to say , the first year they are figuring out what their policies should be .
the second year they begin to roll out those policies in a more serious way , but it takes another year or two to know whether they are working .
so i think almost any administration in the second year gets an incomplete .
let 's switch to transatlantic affairs : one year ago with lady ashton and herman van rompuy , two relatively obscure politicians were chosen as the eu 's first new president and foreign minister .
the us has long complained about the lack of a common european stance on many international issues .
does washington now finally know which numbers to call in europe ? i think there is a feeling that the economic crisis that we have been through has put a lot of strain on the european project .
so i think most americans think that because of the challenge presented by the economic crisis there is a certain amount of introspection going on within europe about where it is going in terms of its political and economic integration .
i think that is very understandable .
the economic crisis has been a real blow to the entire world and it 's going to take some time to work it through . so i think most americans would say there has been a little bit of a pause in the european project of political and economic integration .
that has been a project that the united states has supported for 50 years , both republican and democratic administrations , and one that we want to succeed .
but understandably there is some soul searching going on in the europeans and we need to let our european allies work these issues through .
barack obama has been described as the first us president who is not an atlanticist naturally inclined toward europe , but rather toward asia .
this and the often quoted rise of asia has led some europeans to worry about the nature and future of the transatlantic relationship .
how healthy is the transatlantic relationship today and how important will it be in the future ? i have been in washington for over 40 years and sort of every 10 years somebody comes up and declares the end of the transatlantic relationship .
and so far all those predictions have been premature .
i think this is really the oldest affiliation for the united states this strong relationship with europe .
i think it continues to remain strong and will remain strong from administration to administration .
that said , the rise of asia and major new world powers in asia such as china and india is getting a lot of attention in the united states .
and it is getting a lot of attention in europe .
germany 's economic recovery is heavily driven by exports to asia , so it is not surprising that both in europe and in the united states there is a lot of discussion about asia and ties toward asia .
that is to say , how can meet the rise of new great powers in asia and how can we turn the rise of those great powers and the economic growth and the economic engine that asia is right now literally pulling the world out of recession , how can we turn that so that it is an opportunity for greater peace and prosperity for the world as a whole .
i think that 's the task in asia and it is something that europeans and americans should be working on together .

an anarchist group has claimed responsibility . a group of italian anarchists claimed responsibility on thursday for two parcel bomb explosions at foreign embassies in rome , according to italian media reports .
two people were injured by two separate package bombs that exploded at the swiss and chilean embassies in rome earlier on thursday , prompting police to conduct checks at all the embassies in the italian capital .
the first incident occurred around midday at the swiss embassy , when a bomb exploded in the mailroom as an employee opened it .
reports said the 53-year-old man was taken to a hospital in central rome and risks the amputation of one or both of his hands , but that his life was not in danger .
three hours later an employee at the chilean embassy was lightly injured after opening the second package bomb .
anarchists claim responsibility the ansa news agency reported that a group calling itself the informal federation of anarchy -lrb- fai -rrb- had written a note claiming the blasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police were checking embassies across rome after the explosions " we have decided to make our voice heard with words and deeds .
let us destroy the system of domination .
long live the fai , " said the statement , found near the site of one of the bombings .
the fai is well known to italian authorities .
in 2010 , intelligence services referred to the group in a statement to parliament as italy 's " main national terrorist threat of an anarchist-insurrectionist type . "
police sweep rome 's embassies ansa reported thursday that police conducted sweeps at all the embassies in rome .
a suspicious package at the ukrainian embassy was first thought to be another bomb , but police later said it was a false alarm .
thursday 's bombs followed the discovery of a crude device designed like an explosive on an empty subway car in rome on tuesday . tests later showed that the device had no detonator and contained no explosives .
chilean foreign minister alfredo moreno condemned the blast in the chilean embassy , calling it " an act of terrorism " and " cowardly . "
he added that the bomb had been adressed to a cultural association , where it severely injured the hands , face and abdomen of cesar mella , a chilean citizen .
suspected connection to greece italy 's interior minister roberto maroni said on a television talk show that he thought a suspected connection to similar bombings in greece last month was the " right track . "
" greece , italy and spain have seen the presence of anarcho-insurrectionalist groups that are tightly linked , " he said .
" they are very violent . "
last month 14 package bombs were discovered at various embassies across athens and in transit to places abroad , including one sent to the chancellery in berlin .
the package , which arrived on a day when chancellor angela merkel was not in berlin , was identified as being suspicious during a routine check at the chancellery 's mail center .
the bomb did not go off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of 14 parcel bombs discovered last month was sent to the german chancellory greek police believed the attacks were connected to a left-wing militant organization , and arrested six people on suspicion of being connected to the group .
a greek police official said he had not yet received any request for help from italian police .
no likely connection to jihadist groups analysts said while the parcel bombings in greece and italy may have been similar , there were not necessarily any direct connections .
" given the similarities with the recent parcel bombs in greece following anti-austerity protests , this could be a copycat incident by domestic activists , " said samantha wolreich , a european risk analyst at the uk-based advisory firm ake .

an anarchist group has claimed responsibility . a group of italian anarchists claimed responsibility on thursday for two parcel bomb explosions at foreign embassies in rome , according to italian media reports .
two people were injured by two separate package bombs that exploded at the swiss and chilean embassies in rome earlier on thursday , prompting police to conduct checks at all the embassies in the italian capital .
the first incident occurred around midday at the swiss embassy , when a bomb exploded in the mailroom as an employee opened it .
reports said the 53-year-old man was taken to a hospital in central rome and risks the amputation of one or both of his hands , but that his life was not in danger .
three hours later an employee at the chilean embassy was lightly injured after opening the second package bomb .
anarchists claim responsibility the ansa news agency reported that a group calling itself the informal federation of anarchy -lrb- fai -rrb- had written a note claiming the blasts .

police sweep rome 's embassies ansa reported thursday that police conducted sweeps at all the embassies in rome .
a suspicious package at the ukrainian embassy was first thought to be another bomb , but police later said it was a false alarm .
thursday 's bombs followed the discovery of a crude device designed like an explosive on an empty subway car in rome on tuesday . tests later showed that the device had no detonator and contained no explosives .
chilean foreign minister alfredo moreno condemned the blast in the chilean embassy , calling it " an act of terrorism " and " cowardly . "
he added that the bomb had been adressed to a cultural association , where it severely injured the hands , face and abdomen of cesar mella , a chilean citizen .
suspected connection to greece italy 's interior minister roberto maroni said on a television talk show that he thought a suspected connection to similar bombings in greece last month was the " right track . "
" greece , italy and spain have seen the presence of anarcho-insurrectionalist groups that are tightly linked , " he said .
" they are very violent . "
last month 14 package bombs were discovered at various embassies across athens and in transit to places abroad , including one sent to the chancellery in berlin .
the package , which arrived on a day when chancellor angela merkel was not in berlin , was identified as being suspicious during a routine check at the chancellery 's mail center .
the bomb did not go off .

a greek police official said he had not yet received any request for help from italian police .
no likely connection to jihadist groups analysts said while the parcel bombings in greece and italy may have been similar , there were not necessarily any direct connections .
" given the similarities with the recent parcel bombs in greece following anti-austerity protests , this could be a copycat incident by domestic activists , " said samantha wolreich , a european risk analyst at the uk-based advisory firm ake .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 24.12.2010 us foreign policy marked by continuity , says former national security adviser großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us national security adviser stephen hadley in an interview with dw , stephen hadley speaks about the continuity between president obama and his predecessor bush that surprised many people and why he views the west bank as a bright spot in the middle east . stephen hadley served as national security adviser to president george w. bush from 2005 to 2009 and as deputy national security adviser from 2001 to 2005 .
he is currently a senior adviser for international affairs at the united states institute of peace and a principal in the rice hadley group . deutsche welle : let 's look back at us and european foreign and security policy this year and take a tally of some major issues .
in afghanistan 2010 was the deadliest year for the international troops with more than 700 soldiers killed , most of them american .
has president obama 's surge strategy failed ?
stephen hadley : there 's been an initial assessment which has not been released publicly in all its detail .
but i think the administration 's assessment , and i think it 's right , is that the strategy of the united states and other allies including most europeans who are with us on the ground in afghanistan is making progress .
it 's slower than we would like , it 's fragile and reversible , but there has been progress .
and i think one of the good things about 2010 is that there has been a coming together of europeans and americans about the importance of afghanistan and about how to pursue our strategy .
president obama has said the us would begin to pull troops out of afghanistan in 2011 , the british have said they may do the same and germany has announced its plans to start withdrawing troops next year as well .
when the three biggest troop contributors start pulling back , can the war in afghanistan still be won ?
yes , because the lede here is not that the troops are pulling back , the lede is that the united states and its allies believe that they will be able to begin to transfer security responsibility to the afghans .
remember , americans and europeans have for several years now been training and helping the afghans to build an army and police that can take increasing security responsibility .
and afghan forces are operating with american and nato and other european forces in afghanistan now , so what the president said was that in 2011 we could begin the process of transferring security responsibility to afghan units and as that occurred it would allow some units of american and european origin to begin to withdraw .
but president obama has been clear , and particularly secretary gates has been clear that that handover of security responsibility to afghanistan and any withdrawal of american forces will be condition-based .
that is to say it will have to reflect progress and security on the ground and will be done in a way that does not jeopardize the progress we have achieved or future progress .
another intractable international issue for the us and the eu is how to deal with iran 's nuclear program .
despite a united position by europeans and americans and tough new sanctions that were put in place in 2010 with the help of russia and china , there does n't seem to be a change of tehran 's stance .
is the west simply running out of options on iran ? i think the administration and our european allies have done a better job than i would have anticipated in getting the russians and the chinese to go along with very tough sanctions .
as you point out , regrettably , it has not resulted in a change of iranian policy on the nuclear issue .
and this is obviously a source of concern for all of us , because the worry is that if the region begins to conclude that the international community is not going to be able to prevent iran from having through its enrichment program a clear path to a nuclear weapon that is going to result in an emboldened iran , it is going to result in weakened arab states and it is going to result in arab states trying to develop their own nuclear programs which is a proliferation risk that will make the middle east less stable not more stable .
2010 was the year in which the obama administration like many before tried and failed to make progress on the peace process between israelis and palestinians because it could n't convince the israeli government to extend a settlement stop even for just a few months .
was the us foolish even to try again or has the us completely lost its leverage with both parties , but especially with the israeli government ?
i think the administration has said as much that the effort that began really soon after administration took power in january 2009 to get a construction freeze in the settlement areas did not work as the administration has intended .
what they had hoped to do was to send a strong message to the world that the administration was going to be even-handed between the israelis and palestinians .
that this message would be greeted in the arab world with steps to reach out toward israel and to begin rebuilding diplomatic relations between israel and the arab world and it simply did not work .
and rather than facilitating negotiations and progress on the negotiating table it became a barrier to negotiations .
it was a tactic , i think the administration would say , that did not work .
so they are trying to restart the process to have these proximity talks to try to turn the focus from settlement construction to what the focus should have been really from the beginning which is the terms of peace .
we can only hope that there will be some success in this effort .
but i think what is really good news for the prospects for peace is what is happening in the west bank .
that president abbas and prime minister salam fayad are building the institutions of a palestinian state even while under occupation .
they are now training security forces that are increasingly taking responsibility for security and are going after terrorists .
the israeli military is recognizing the effectiveness of these forces and cooperating with them .
the palestinians are building political institutions , economic activity and growth has returned to the west bank and there is peace , there is calm , that is to say .
there are no incidents of violence either in the west bank or in israel .
so in some sense while the negotiations seem to have foundered , the underpinnings of an ultimate peace , that is to say the institutions of a democratic palestinian state that is not supporting terror , but is maintaining peace and security for both palestinians and israelis , that process has gone forward .
and i think that is a bright spot and an essential element for an ultimate peace and a two-state solution in the middle east .
many us presidents engaged in foreign policy have a doctrine named after them that spells out their vision or version of america 's engagement with the world .
obama has now passed the half-time mark of his first term .
is there something that could be called an obama doctrine and if so how would you describe and compare it to other presidential doctrines like the so-called bush doctrine ?
i think the obama administration is still a work in progress on foreign policy .
i think they would say as much .
i think they want to be known as an administration that has engaged our adversaries .
i think that policy has had some mixed success i think with respect to north korea and chavez in venezuela and in iran .
and they have certainly been very firm on north korea about the prerequisites to resuming the six-party talks .
i think one of the things that has surprised a lot of people is while i think the administration has had a positive tone in how it has spoken to the arab world and how it has spoken to europe , i think there is a lot more continuity in the policies between president obama and president bush than a lot of people expected .
and that 's not unusual .
in the united states , while we have presidential elections that are waged and fought based often on differences in foreign policy , when new administrations come in and see the problems that the prior administration has faced there is a high degree of continuity in policies between administrations .
and i think you see it in terms of the iraq policy , afghanistan policy and policies dealing with the terrorist threat .
so i think there have been some positive changes in tone .
some have succeeded , some have not .
but i think there has also been a high degree and a useful degree of continuity with the policies of its predecessor administrations .
if you had to give a grade to the obama administration for its foreign policy for this year or for the past two years what grade would that be ?
i think any foreign policy in the first two years generally gets an incomplete .
that is to say , the first year they are figuring out what their policies should be .
the second year they begin to roll out those policies in a more serious way , but it takes another year or two to know whether they are working .
so i think almost any administration in the second year gets an incomplete .
let 's switch to transatlantic affairs : one year ago with lady ashton and herman van rompuy , two relatively obscure politicians were chosen as the eu 's first new president and foreign minister .
the us has long complained about the lack of a common european stance on many international issues .
does washington now finally know which numbers to call in europe ? i think there is a feeling that the economic crisis that we have been through has put a lot of strain on the european project .
so i think most americans think that because of the challenge presented by the economic crisis there is a certain amount of introspection going on within europe about where it is going in terms of its political and economic integration .
i think that is very understandable .
the economic crisis has been a real blow to the entire world and it 's going to take some time to work it through . so i think most americans would say there has been a little bit of a pause in the european project of political and economic integration .
that has been a project that the united states has supported for 50 years , both republican and democratic administrations , and one that we want to succeed .
but understandably there is some soul searching going on in the europeans and we need to let our european allies work these issues through .
barack obama has been described as the first us president who is not an atlanticist naturally inclined toward europe , but rather toward asia .
this and the often quoted rise of asia has led some europeans to worry about the nature and future of the transatlantic relationship .
how healthy is the transatlantic relationship today and how important will it be in the future ? i have been in washington for over 40 years and sort of every 10 years somebody comes up and declares the end of the transatlantic relationship .
and so far all those predictions have been premature .
i think this is really the oldest affiliation for the united states this strong relationship with europe .
i think it continues to remain strong and will remain strong from administration to administration .
that said , the rise of asia and major new world powers in asia such as china and india is getting a lot of attention in the united states .
and it is getting a lot of attention in europe .
germany 's economic recovery is heavily driven by exports to asia , so it is not surprising that both in europe and in the united states there is a lot of discussion about asia and ties toward asia .
that is to say , how can meet the rise of new great powers in asia and how can we turn the rise of those great powers and the economic growth and the economic engine that asia is right now literally pulling the world out of recession , how can we turn that so that it is an opportunity for greater peace and prosperity for the world as a whole .
i think that 's the task in asia and it is something that europeans and americans should be working on together .

already , the country has 40 percent of its energy coming from renewable sources . the launch in portugal in january of nissan 's leaf marks the start of the rollout in europe of what the company says is the first 100 percent electric car aimed at a mass market .
nissan targeted portugal - where it will also soon be assembling batteries for the leaf - after that country 's government agreed to setting up a national network of charging points .
in fact , the network is to be compatible with any make of electric car , and is part of still more ambitious long-term plans for a genuinely " smart grid " that could help portugal make fuller use of its fast-expanding renewable energy capacity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government wants to expand its network of charging stations in early december , amid ultra-modern architecture at the former site of the expo 98 world fair in lisbon , members of the portuguese public got the chance to test drive the leaf .
portuguese consumers are curious about electric cars comments ranged from the polite to the enthusiastic , with the lack of engine noise the most obvious characteristic of what at first glance looks like a regular five-seater family run-around .
but the very lack of engine noise creates some new " problems . "
" for instance , the headlamps have a specific design to avoid air going to the mirrors , " said antónio joaquim , the communications director of nissan iberia portugal .
" the exterior mirrors on a normal car produce a lot of noise with the wind .
but on this car , which does n't make any noise from the engine , all the very small noises that on other cars are not perceptible are - let 's say , uncomfortable . "
the more obvious matter of charging the car seems straightforward : a small panel on the bonnet opens to reveal something rather similar to an ordinary electric plug .
" if you want to charge when you are parking inside a garage in your own house or in a shopping centre , it 's better to have it on the bonnet , " joaquim added .
" it 's a completely different usage from a combustion engine .
you just charge the car during your daily life . "
charging stations are scarce for now , but are expected to increase there are two charging options : a partial quick charge , for example when you are on the motorway and do not want to stop for long , or a cheaper slow charge of up to eight hours .
prospective buyers in lisbon seemed to take the limitations of electric cars on board .
" it 's a nice car , and a good prospect for someone like me who has an urban life , and drives about 30 or 40 kilometres to work and back , " said one man , who declined to give his name .
the innovative design of the leaf 's lithium batteries means that you can drive the car for longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotor 's editor thinks that the european car of the year jury missed out on the prius but even a fully-charged leaf has a more limited range than a car with a full fuel tank .
so the fact that it recently was named european car of the year - the first completely electric vehicle to do so - raised some eyebrows .
antónio pereira , editor of portuguese car magazine automotor , told deutsche welle he suspected the competition 's jury may have been anxious not to miss a trick , having previously failed to garland the first version of the toyota prius , which later became a hit .
the nissan leaf is , he said , an interesting experiment , and portugal a suitably small testing ground , but with some problems .
" recharging stations are still few -lsb- in number -rsb- and mainly in the big cities , " he said .
" and in portugal we mainly live in apartments .
so either you have a parking space in your building or you have to recharge at night in the public recharging station .
that 's complicated because there wo n't be one for each . "
portugal pushing for dynmaic energy flow in its ' smart grid ' still , the spread of on-street charging points in portugal is the reason the leaf is getting its european launch in the country .
the government-led mobi.e consortium is installing 1,300 chargers around the country , compatible with all makes of car .
in addition , the state is offering a 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- subsidy for buyers of electric cars - bringing the leaf 's price down to 30,000 euro - and a road-tax exemption .
portugal 's ambitious declared long-term target of 750,000 electric vehicles on its roads also fits with plans to expand its renewable energy output , going some way to addressing sceptics ' argument that electric cars ' environmental impact depends on where their power comes from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government is subsidizing the purchase price of electric cars " we have defined as a target to be the first country to have a nationwide and comprehensive infrastructure for vehicles and to work to give the necessary framework and incentives so that we can massively introduce the electric vehicle , " luís reis of mobi.e explained at a trade fair earlier this year .
" this is important not only in terms of the sustainability of mobility but also in terms of the strategy that we have for energy . "
portuguese society has high reliance on renewable sources portugal - for decades heavily reliant on imported oil for its energy needs - now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables , and rising .
and officials overseeing the development of the electric grid envision a future in which drivers will actually be able to profit from helping ensure that same energy is used efficiently , when electric cars have full internet capability .
" you drive it home in the evening , plug -lsb- it in to -rsb- both internet and power , and the car starts receiving signals of electricity spot prices , " antónio vidigal , a director of privatised utility edp , one of the mobi.e partners , told a conference on climate change earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables " at night the price is low ; the car will charge overnight , " vidigal went on .
" next day you come to office , plug again into both plugs .
peak time energy will be expensive and the car may sell energy back to the network . "
as in many countries , hydro-electric dams in portugal already store excess energy from wind farms ; this is used to pump water uphill , to be used to generate power when demand is high .
now the groundwork is being laid for a smart grid that could see cars playing a similar role .
as the first step in what is to be a nationwide programme , edp in 2010 made évora in the alentejo , a city with a population of some 50,000 , the first " inovcity " in the future national " inovgrid . "
" consumers have access almost to real-time information as to their energy consumption , so they 'll be able to manage that better , " explained miguel andrade , a director of edp distribuição , the group 's distribution unit .
" from the company 's side obviously we hope to have operational efficiencies from this .
we hope to integrate more renewables , more micro-generation and eventually in the medium to long-term also the electric vehicle into the grid .
" i think we 're genuinely witnessing a revolution in the way we manage distribution networks . "
nissan investing in portugal but if it 's early days for integrating cars into this vision , what of today 's models ?
the leaf on show in lisbon can not , slot into a smart grid .
but , he said , the model is easily adapted .
" we are implementing the electric vehicles now , so we have to be cost efficient otherwise people would not buy them , " said antónio joaquim , nissan portugal communications director .
" that is why the cars do n't have this and the grid does n't have this capabilities .
" but from the utility 's point of view the technology is already known , from the car industry the technology is already known , so i do n't think that is a very difficult thing to implement later on .
it 's a question of software . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal has already begun rolling out electrical charging stations the leaf itself can already communicate with the charging point : identifying itself and its charging specifications and needs , as well as its owner - who will after all be paying for the power as part of the electricity bill sent to his home .
some environmentalists see models such as the leaf as primarily a public relations exercise for manufacturers that still devote most of their investment to conventional models .
nissan 's own projections for electric cars do not go beyond 10 percent of total sales .
but given that the company is building factories in japan , the us and the uk dedicated to making the leaf - and which it would be difficult and expensive to convert to make other cars - the company is perhaps not the prime target for such accusations .
" everybody in the automotive business is trying to do their own ' greenwash ' , promising ' green ' products - and most are less polluting than before , but not that green , " said antónio pereira , editor of automotor .
" i think nissan is probably taking a lot of risks with the electric car but it 's not doing greenwash - not at all . "

an anarchist group has claimed responsibility . a group of italian anarchists claimed responsibility on thursday for two parcel bomb explosions at foreign embassies in rome , according to italian media reports .
two people were injured by two separate package bombs that exploded at the swiss and chilean embassies in rome earlier on thursday , prompting police to conduct checks at all the embassies in the italian capital .
the first incident occurred around midday at the swiss embassy , when a bomb exploded in the mailroom as an employee opened it .
reports said the 53-year-old man was taken to a hospital in central rome and risks the amputation of one or both of his hands , but that his life was not in danger .
three hours later an employee at the chilean embassy was lightly injured after opening the second package bomb .
anarchists claim responsibility the ansa news agency reported that a group calling itself the informal federation of anarchy -lrb- fai -rrb- had written a note claiming the blasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police were checking embassies across rome after the explosions " we have decided to make our voice heard with words and deeds .
let us destroy the system of domination .
long live the fai , " said the statement , found near the site of one of the bombings .
the fai is well known to italian authorities .
in 2010 , intelligence services referred to the group in a statement to parliament as italy 's " main national terrorist threat of an anarchist-insurrectionist type . "
police sweep rome 's embassies ansa reported thursday that police conducted sweeps at all the embassies in rome .
a suspicious package at the ukrainian embassy was first thought to be another bomb , but police later said it was a false alarm .
thursday 's bombs followed the discovery of a crude device designed like an explosive on an empty subway car in rome on tuesday . tests later showed that the device had no detonator and contained no explosives .
chilean foreign minister alfredo moreno condemned the blast in the chilean embassy , calling it " an act of terrorism " and " cowardly . "
he added that the bomb had been adressed to a cultural association , where it severely injured the hands , face and abdomen of cesar mella , a chilean citizen .
suspected connection to greece italy 's interior minister roberto maroni said on a television talk show that he thought a suspected connection to similar bombings in greece last month was the " right track . "
" greece , italy and spain have seen the presence of anarcho-insurrectionalist groups that are tightly linked , " he said .
" they are very violent . "
last month 14 package bombs were discovered at various embassies across athens and in transit to places abroad , including one sent to the chancellery in berlin .
the package , which arrived on a day when chancellor angela merkel was not in berlin , was identified as being suspicious during a routine check at the chancellery 's mail center .
the bomb did not go off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of 14 parcel bombs discovered last month was sent to the german chancellory greek police believed the attacks were connected to a left-wing militant organization , and arrested six people on suspicion of being connected to the group .
a greek police official said he had not yet received any request for help from italian police .
no likely connection to jihadist groups analysts said while the parcel bombings in greece and italy may have been similar , there were not necessarily any direct connections .
" given the similarities with the recent parcel bombs in greece following anti-austerity protests , this could be a copycat incident by domestic activists , " said samantha wolreich , a european risk analyst at the uk-based advisory firm ake .

already , the country has 40 percent of its energy coming from renewable sources . the launch in portugal in january of nissan 's leaf marks the start of the rollout in europe of what the company says is the first 100 percent electric car aimed at a mass market .
nissan targeted portugal - where it will also soon be assembling batteries for the leaf - after that country 's government agreed to setting up a national network of charging points .
in fact , the network is to be compatible with any make of electric car , and is part of still more ambitious long-term plans for a genuinely " smart grid " that could help portugal make fuller use of its fast-expanding renewable energy capacity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government wants to expand its network of charging stations in early december , amid ultra-modern architecture at the former site of the expo 98 world fair in lisbon , members of the portuguese public got the chance to test drive the leaf .

once taboo , the practice may now attract an eco-friendly clientele , saving the industry from tough chinese competition . for decades , the small industrial city of prato in tuscany has produced some of the finest wool textiles in the world - all the while hiding a dirty secret .
but now , hard hit by low-cost textiles produced in china , prato has dug the skeleton out of its closet and turned it into a powerful marketing weapon .
" the production of the reprocessed wool comes from scraps that come from the manufacturing of garments , " romeo balli explained to deutsche welle .
nowadays , with attention focused on eco-friendly manufacturing practices , this process is garnering attention for balli 's fabrics .
saving scraps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recycling wool scraps conserves resources balli 's factory has carried the family name since it was founded by his grandfather in 1946 .
it was once part of a thriving textile industry in prato that produced high quality wool fabric .
back then , as today , most of the textiles were made from left-over wool scraps .
according to balli , this does n't mean a drop in quality , but does make manufacturing less expensive .
" we can find nice quality , divide it by color , quality , and it 's much easier and cheaper , " he said .
not only is the process cheaper , it 's also more environmentally friendly .
prato 's chamber of commerce is now trying to capitalize on this fact to give its industry a boost .
according to carlo longo , who heads the chamber of commerce , it 's ironic the recycled wool is now a selling point , given how for decades prato industries hid the fact .
" nobody was admitting that -lsb- we recycled scraps -rsb- .
we were trying to do it , but hiding it , " he said .
" now it 's become a reason to be proud , because we 're not depleting the world 's resources , so it 's a good thing . "
old product , new brand longo is part of an initiative geared toward reducing the carbon footprint of textile production , which certifies companies that use regenerated or recycled raw materials .
prato 's chamber of commerce has dubbed the regenerated wool " cardato , " hoping consumers will seek out the eco-friendly product .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wool manufacturers face steep competition from china " we have branded it and are launching it again , " longo said .
" there 's now a lot of attention to these kinds of products . "
it 's also economically advantageous .
with cheaply produced wool fabrics being exported from china , prato 's five billion-euro -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- export industry has lost half its business in the last decade .
textile producers like romeo balli say the reprocessed wool not only gives prato an eco-friendly advantage , but also provides cheaper and more stable prices .
according to balli , the difference in price between virgin and reprocessed wool can be between 30 and 40 percent .
those savings could ensure the survival of prato 's textile industry , especially at a time when balli believes chinese producers are stockpiling virgin wool - causing prices to shoot up around the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.12.2010 rise of electric cars prompt ' smart ' electrical grids in portugal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nissan leaf will launch in portugal in january portugal ’ s long-term target of 750,000 electric cars fits with its smart energy plans .
already , the country has 40 percent of its energy coming from renewable sources . the launch in portugal in january of nissan 's leaf marks the start of the rollout in europe of what the company says is the first 100 percent electric car aimed at a mass market .
nissan targeted portugal - where it will also soon be assembling batteries for the leaf - after that country 's government agreed to setting up a national network of charging points .
in fact , the network is to be compatible with any make of electric car , and is part of still more ambitious long-term plans for a genuinely " smart grid " that could help portugal make fuller use of its fast-expanding renewable energy capacity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government wants to expand its network of charging stations in early december , amid ultra-modern architecture at the former site of the expo 98 world fair in lisbon , members of the portuguese public got the chance to test drive the leaf .
portuguese consumers are curious about electric cars comments ranged from the polite to the enthusiastic , with the lack of engine noise the most obvious characteristic of what at first glance looks like a regular five-seater family run-around .
but the very lack of engine noise creates some new " problems . "
" for instance , the headlamps have a specific design to avoid air going to the mirrors , " said antónio joaquim , the communications director of nissan iberia portugal .
" the exterior mirrors on a normal car produce a lot of noise with the wind .
but on this car , which does n't make any noise from the engine , all the very small noises that on other cars are not perceptible are - let 's say , uncomfortable . "
the more obvious matter of charging the car seems straightforward : a small panel on the bonnet opens to reveal something rather similar to an ordinary electric plug .
" if you want to charge when you are parking inside a garage in your own house or in a shopping centre , it 's better to have it on the bonnet , " joaquim added .
" it 's a completely different usage from a combustion engine .
you just charge the car during your daily life . "
charging stations are scarce for now , but are expected to increase there are two charging options : a partial quick charge , for example when you are on the motorway and do not want to stop for long , or a cheaper slow charge of up to eight hours .
prospective buyers in lisbon seemed to take the limitations of electric cars on board .
" it 's a nice car , and a good prospect for someone like me who has an urban life , and drives about 30 or 40 kilometres to work and back , " said one man , who declined to give his name .
the innovative design of the leaf 's lithium batteries means that you can drive the car for longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotor 's editor thinks that the european car of the year jury missed out on the prius but even a fully-charged leaf has a more limited range than a car with a full fuel tank .
so the fact that it recently was named european car of the year - the first completely electric vehicle to do so - raised some eyebrows .
antónio pereira , editor of portuguese car magazine automotor , told deutsche welle he suspected the competition 's jury may have been anxious not to miss a trick , having previously failed to garland the first version of the toyota prius , which later became a hit .
the nissan leaf is , he said , an interesting experiment , and portugal a suitably small testing ground , but with some problems .
" recharging stations are still few -lsb- in number -rsb- and mainly in the big cities , " he said .
" and in portugal we mainly live in apartments .
so either you have a parking space in your building or you have to recharge at night in the public recharging station .
that 's complicated because there wo n't be one for each . "
portugal pushing for dynmaic energy flow in its ' smart grid ' still , the spread of on-street charging points in portugal is the reason the leaf is getting its european launch in the country .
the government-led mobi.e consortium is installing 1,300 chargers around the country , compatible with all makes of car .
in addition , the state is offering a 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- subsidy for buyers of electric cars - bringing the leaf 's price down to 30,000 euro - and a road-tax exemption .
portugal 's ambitious declared long-term target of 750,000 electric vehicles on its roads also fits with plans to expand its renewable energy output , going some way to addressing sceptics ' argument that electric cars ' environmental impact depends on where their power comes from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government is subsidizing the purchase price of electric cars " we have defined as a target to be the first country to have a nationwide and comprehensive infrastructure for vehicles and to work to give the necessary framework and incentives so that we can massively introduce the electric vehicle , " luís reis of mobi.e explained at a trade fair earlier this year .
" this is important not only in terms of the sustainability of mobility but also in terms of the strategy that we have for energy . "
portuguese society has high reliance on renewable sources portugal - for decades heavily reliant on imported oil for its energy needs - now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables , and rising .
and officials overseeing the development of the electric grid envision a future in which drivers will actually be able to profit from helping ensure that same energy is used efficiently , when electric cars have full internet capability .
" you drive it home in the evening , plug -lsb- it in to -rsb- both internet and power , and the car starts receiving signals of electricity spot prices , " antónio vidigal , a director of privatised utility edp , one of the mobi.e partners , told a conference on climate change earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables " at night the price is low ; the car will charge overnight , " vidigal went on .
" next day you come to office , plug again into both plugs .
peak time energy will be expensive and the car may sell energy back to the network . "
as in many countries , hydro-electric dams in portugal already store excess energy from wind farms ; this is used to pump water uphill , to be used to generate power when demand is high .
now the groundwork is being laid for a smart grid that could see cars playing a similar role .
as the first step in what is to be a nationwide programme , edp in 2010 made évora in the alentejo , a city with a population of some 50,000 , the first " inovcity " in the future national " inovgrid . "
" consumers have access almost to real-time information as to their energy consumption , so they 'll be able to manage that better , " explained miguel andrade , a director of edp distribuição , the group 's distribution unit .
" from the company 's side obviously we hope to have operational efficiencies from this .
we hope to integrate more renewables , more micro-generation and eventually in the medium to long-term also the electric vehicle into the grid .
" i think we 're genuinely witnessing a revolution in the way we manage distribution networks . "
nissan investing in portugal but if it 's early days for integrating cars into this vision , what of today 's models ?
the leaf on show in lisbon can not , slot into a smart grid .
but , he said , the model is easily adapted .
" we are implementing the electric vehicles now , so we have to be cost efficient otherwise people would not buy them , " said antónio joaquim , nissan portugal communications director .
" that is why the cars do n't have this and the grid does n't have this capabilities .
" but from the utility 's point of view the technology is already known , from the car industry the technology is already known , so i do n't think that is a very difficult thing to implement later on .
it 's a question of software . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal has already begun rolling out electrical charging stations the leaf itself can already communicate with the charging point : identifying itself and its charging specifications and needs , as well as its owner - who will after all be paying for the power as part of the electricity bill sent to his home .
some environmentalists see models such as the leaf as primarily a public relations exercise for manufacturers that still devote most of their investment to conventional models .
nissan 's own projections for electric cars do not go beyond 10 percent of total sales .
but given that the company is building factories in japan , the us and the uk dedicated to making the leaf - and which it would be difficult and expensive to convert to make other cars - the company is perhaps not the prime target for such accusations .
" everybody in the automotive business is trying to do their own ' greenwash ' , promising ' green ' products - and most are less polluting than before , but not that green , " said antónio pereira , editor of automotor .
" i think nissan is probably taking a lot of risks with the electric car but it 's not doing greenwash - not at all . "

in fact , the network is to be compatible with any make of electric car , and is part of still more ambitious long-term plans for a genuinely " smart grid " that could help portugal make fuller use of its fast-expanding renewable energy capacity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government wants to expand its network of charging stations in early december , amid ultra-modern architecture at the former site of the expo 98 world fair in lisbon , members of the portuguese public got the chance to test drive the leaf .
portuguese consumers are curious about electric cars comments ranged from the polite to the enthusiastic , with the lack of engine noise the most obvious characteristic of what at first glance looks like a regular five-seater family run-around .
but the very lack of engine noise creates some new " problems . "
" for instance , the headlamps have a specific design to avoid air going to the mirrors , " said antónio joaquim , the communications director of nissan iberia portugal .
" the exterior mirrors on a normal car produce a lot of noise with the wind .
but on this car , which does n't make any noise from the engine , all the very small noises that on other cars are not perceptible are - let 's say , uncomfortable . "
the more obvious matter of charging the car seems straightforward : a small panel on the bonnet opens to reveal something rather similar to an ordinary electric plug .
" if you want to charge when you are parking inside a garage in your own house or in a shopping centre , it 's better to have it on the bonnet , " joaquim added .
" it 's a completely different usage from a combustion engine .
you just charge the car during your daily life . "
charging stations are scarce for now , but are expected to increase there are two charging options : a partial quick charge , for example when you are on the motorway and do not want to stop for long , or a cheaper slow charge of up to eight hours .
prospective buyers in lisbon seemed to take the limitations of electric cars on board .
" it 's a nice car , and a good prospect for someone like me who has an urban life , and drives about 30 or 40 kilometres to work and back , " said one man , who declined to give his name .
the innovative design of the leaf 's lithium batteries means that you can drive the car for longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotor 's editor thinks that the european car of the year jury missed out on the prius but even a fully-charged leaf has a more limited range than a car with a full fuel tank .
so the fact that it recently was named european car of the year - the first completely electric vehicle to do so - raised some eyebrows .
antónio pereira , editor of portuguese car magazine automotor , told deutsche welle he suspected the competition 's jury may have been anxious not to miss a trick , having previously failed to garland the first version of the toyota prius , which later became a hit .
the nissan leaf is , he said , an interesting experiment , and portugal a suitably small testing ground , but with some problems .
" recharging stations are still few -lsb- in number -rsb- and mainly in the big cities , " he said .
" and in portugal we mainly live in apartments .
so either you have a parking space in your building or you have to recharge at night in the public recharging station .
that 's complicated because there wo n't be one for each . "
portugal pushing for dynmaic energy flow in its ' smart grid ' still , the spread of on-street charging points in portugal is the reason the leaf is getting its european launch in the country .
the government-led mobi.e consortium is installing 1,300 chargers around the country , compatible with all makes of car .
in addition , the state is offering a 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- subsidy for buyers of electric cars - bringing the leaf 's price down to 30,000 euro - and a road-tax exemption .
portugal 's ambitious declared long-term target of 750,000 electric vehicles on its roads also fits with plans to expand its renewable energy output , going some way to addressing sceptics ' argument that electric cars ' environmental impact depends on where their power comes from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government is subsidizing the purchase price of electric cars " we have defined as a target to be the first country to have a nationwide and comprehensive infrastructure for vehicles and to work to give the necessary framework and incentives so that we can massively introduce the electric vehicle , " luís reis of mobi.e explained at a trade fair earlier this year .
" this is important not only in terms of the sustainability of mobility but also in terms of the strategy that we have for energy . "
portuguese society has high reliance on renewable sources portugal - for decades heavily reliant on imported oil for its energy needs - now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables , and rising .
and officials overseeing the development of the electric grid envision a future in which drivers will actually be able to profit from helping ensure that same energy is used efficiently , when electric cars have full internet capability .
" you drive it home in the evening , plug -lsb- it in to -rsb- both internet and power , and the car starts receiving signals of electricity spot prices , " antónio vidigal , a director of privatised utility edp , one of the mobi.e partners , told a conference on climate change earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables " at night the price is low ; the car will charge overnight , " vidigal went on .
" next day you come to office , plug again into both plugs .
peak time energy will be expensive and the car may sell energy back to the network . "
as in many countries , hydro-electric dams in portugal already store excess energy from wind farms ; this is used to pump water uphill , to be used to generate power when demand is high .
now the groundwork is being laid for a smart grid that could see cars playing a similar role .
as the first step in what is to be a nationwide programme , edp in 2010 made évora in the alentejo , a city with a population of some 50,000 , the first " inovcity " in the future national " inovgrid . "
" consumers have access almost to real-time information as to their energy consumption , so they 'll be able to manage that better , " explained miguel andrade , a director of edp distribuição , the group 's distribution unit .
" from the company 's side obviously we hope to have operational efficiencies from this .
we hope to integrate more renewables , more micro-generation and eventually in the medium to long-term also the electric vehicle into the grid .
" i think we 're genuinely witnessing a revolution in the way we manage distribution networks . "
nissan investing in portugal but if it 's early days for integrating cars into this vision , what of today 's models ?
the leaf on show in lisbon can not , slot into a smart grid .
but , he said , the model is easily adapted .
" we are implementing the electric vehicles now , so we have to be cost efficient otherwise people would not buy them , " said antónio joaquim , nissan portugal communications director .
" that is why the cars do n't have this and the grid does n't have this capabilities .
" but from the utility 's point of view the technology is already known , from the car industry the technology is already known , so i do n't think that is a very difficult thing to implement later on .
it 's a question of software . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal has already begun rolling out electrical charging stations the leaf itself can already communicate with the charging point : identifying itself and its charging specifications and needs , as well as its owner - who will after all be paying for the power as part of the electricity bill sent to his home .
some environmentalists see models such as the leaf as primarily a public relations exercise for manufacturers that still devote most of their investment to conventional models .
nissan 's own projections for electric cars do not go beyond 10 percent of total sales .
but given that the company is building factories in japan , the us and the uk dedicated to making the leaf - and which it would be difficult and expensive to convert to make other cars - the company is perhaps not the prime target for such accusations .
" everybody in the automotive business is trying to do their own ' greenwash ' , promising ' green ' products - and most are less polluting than before , but not that green , " said antónio pereira , editor of automotor .
" i think nissan is probably taking a lot of risks with the electric car but it 's not doing greenwash - not at all . "

if the trend of german shoppers continues , good business could continue after the holidays as well . a lot of german kids are going to think santa was especially generous this year when they open their christmas presents .
even the adults are likely to notice a few more presents under the tree as in 2009 .
according to the german retail association , germans have n't spent as much money on gifts during a holiday season since 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there may be a few more gifts under german trees for november and december , the association estimates total revenues of 77 billion euro -lrb- $ 101 billion -rrb- for the retail sector - 2.5 percent more than last year .
" people have n't let the chaotic winter ruin their shopping plans , " stefan genth , head of the trade union hde , told deutsche welle .
genth says that the economic crisis in germany was over surprisingly quickly .
germans saved money during the year in order to be able to afford something special for christmas , such as a nice watch or jewelry .
at the top of many christmas lists in snowy germany are winter sports items , such as sleds , skis , or ice skates .
warm winter clothes are also in high demand .
in many stores , supply of sleds and snow shovels is running low .
the demand for gloves is sometimes twice what retailers have in stock. ipads and inscriptions if a christmas wish is not snow-related , then there 's a good chance it has to do with staying inside and avoiding it .
electronic devices , including video and computer games are sought-after items as well .
in an interview with the french news agency afp , august-wilhelm scheer , head of the electronic branch 's bitkom association , said the electronic branch was " very satisfied " with their holiday business , and that it was " significantly better " than last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ipads are in high demand the high-tech gadget of the year is without a doubt the ipad .
it and other tablet-pcs have established themselves as a new class among laptop computers .
according to bitkom , around 450,000 tablet-pcs were sold in 2010 .
sales for online retailers are experiencing a boom like never before as well .
many germans want to give personalized gifts , but they do n't always have the time to take care of it themselves .
instead , they take care of a special gift with a few clicks of the mouse .
claudia helming is the head of dawanda , an online marketplace for handmade products that opened in 2006 in berlin .
she says customized jewelry , such as a silver necklace engraved with a name or a phrase , is quite popular .
dawanda gets about 30,000 orders per day - more than twice as many as last year .
trend continues past christmas while some germans go for the one-of-a-kind gifts , many others go completely generic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snow and cold kept people out of christmas markets recent studies indicate that every second present that will be opened on christmas eve is a gift certificate .
hde 's stefan genth says most of the gift certificates will be cashed in during the week between christmas and new year 's eve , making him optimistic that the booming retail business in germany will continue past the holidays .
he also expects that many people will carry out planned shopping sprees that had to be put off because of bad weather .
while the retail sector seems to have come through germany 's early winter quite well , the opposite is true for businesses operating at germany 's christmas markets .
the exceptionally cold weather and snowfall meant that many people opted to stay home instead of patronizing the stalls of the christmas market .
unlike holiday shopping sprees , a trip to the christmas market can not be pushed back a few weeks : after december 23 , the german christmas markets close up shop until next year .

andsnes talked with dw about one program he selected , from which you can hear excerpts below . as pianist in residence with the berlin philharmonic orchestra this season , leif ove andsnes brings a devotion to chamber music that he has maintained alongside an international career as a soloist .
his most recent album of rachmaninov ’ s third and fourth piano concertos with antonio pappano and the london symphony orchestra quickly won widespread critical acclaim .
andsnes spoke to dw about the program he selected for the second concert of his residency in berlin and his upcoming plans .
click below to listen to andsnes and members of the berlin philharmonic live from a concert on december 12 , 2010 .
dw : together with marc-andre hamelin you have performed the four-hand version of stravinsky 's " rite of spring " in risor , brussels , london , new york , and now berlin .
what fascinates you about the piece ?
leif ove andsnes : the " rite of spring " has perhaps more appeal than any other piece of the 20th century .
its energy and rhythms excite people more than any other piece i know .
the harmonies and sheer tension are unbelievable .
it is so iconic that you ca n't imagine someone sitting down and writing it .
stravinsky said himself that he felt like a vessel - that the music just came from somewhere - and he wrote it down very quickly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian composers are in the spotlight this season for the berlin philharmonic why did you choose two of the other pieces in the program , stravinsky 's septet and alfred schnittke 's piano quintet ?
since the philharmonic has a focus on russian music this season , i paired them to show two very different sides of russian music .
the septet was written forty years after the " rite " and shows a giant leap in stravinsky 's language , with the end result very playful and theatrical .
the schnittke , on the other hand , seems born entirely out of an emotional state of grief and sorrow , colored by the death of his mother .
it sometimes sounds like music from the other side , from a different planet .
can you describe your passion for chamber music ?
for me it is the most natural form of music-making , just a few friends coming together to play .
why should it be considered a niche or elitist ?
it is as normal as a rock band gathering in a garage .
just give me a violinist and a cellist , and we can play a trio .
chamber music is also essential in a musician 's development because you have to listen to others and find your place within the landscape of a piece , whether you have the foreground or background .
it 's also a great way to get to know people and a lot of fun .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andsnes will perform with the berlin philharmonic into the summer of 2011 what new projects do you have coming up ?
one thing that will be very much in focus over the next four to five years is beethoven .
having just turned 40 , i feel i 've come to a point in my life where i have to play the greatest , most important music of all .
i will play and record his concertos .
i will also play his sonatas .
what will your personal highlights be as pianist in residence with the berlin philharmonic ?
i ’ m very excited to play brahms 's second piano concerto with bernhard haitink .
i 'll be working with him for the first time .
i ’ m also very much looking forward to a chamber music project in may with students in the orchestra ’ s academy .
we will perform two mozart works and the dvorak piano quintet , a fantastic piece that i played and fell in love with as a student .
what do you hope to get out of the residency with the philharmonic ?
it already feels like i have a base in berlin for this season , which is nice .
in this profession there is a lot of jumping around so you start to want to feel at home in a few places .
and it 's a tremendous experience to play with this fantastic orchestra . what do you like about being in berlin ?
one always has the feeling berlin is on the cutting edge of what 's happening creatively .
i know many freelance musicians who love the way of life here .
it 's absolutely one of the world 's great musical capitals with so many quality orchestras and opera .

in fact , the network is to be compatible with any make of electric car , and is part of still more ambitious long-term plans for a genuinely " smart grid " that could help portugal make fuller use of its fast-expanding renewable energy capacity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government wants to expand its network of charging stations in early december , amid ultra-modern architecture at the former site of the expo 98 world fair in lisbon , members of the portuguese public got the chance to test drive the leaf .
portuguese consumers are curious about electric cars comments ranged from the polite to the enthusiastic , with the lack of engine noise the most obvious characteristic of what at first glance looks like a regular five-seater family run-around .
but the very lack of engine noise creates some new " problems . "
" for instance , the headlamps have a specific design to avoid air going to the mirrors , " said antónio joaquim , the communications director of nissan iberia portugal .
" the exterior mirrors on a normal car produce a lot of noise with the wind .
but on this car , which does n't make any noise from the engine , all the very small noises that on other cars are not perceptible are - let 's say , uncomfortable . "
the more obvious matter of charging the car seems straightforward : a small panel on the bonnet opens to reveal something rather similar to an ordinary electric plug .
" if you want to charge when you are parking inside a garage in your own house or in a shopping centre , it 's better to have it on the bonnet , " joaquim added .
" it 's a completely different usage from a combustion engine .
you just charge the car during your daily life . "
charging stations are scarce for now , but are expected to increase there are two charging options : a partial quick charge , for example when you are on the motorway and do not want to stop for long , or a cheaper slow charge of up to eight hours .
prospective buyers in lisbon seemed to take the limitations of electric cars on board .
" it 's a nice car , and a good prospect for someone like me who has an urban life , and drives about 30 or 40 kilometres to work and back , " said one man , who declined to give his name .
the innovative design of the leaf 's lithium batteries means that you can drive the car for longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotor 's editor thinks that the european car of the year jury missed out on the prius but even a fully-charged leaf has a more limited range than a car with a full fuel tank .
so the fact that it recently was named european car of the year - the first completely electric vehicle to do so - raised some eyebrows .
antónio pereira , editor of portuguese car magazine automotor , told deutsche welle he suspected the competition 's jury may have been anxious not to miss a trick , having previously failed to garland the first version of the toyota prius , which later became a hit .
the nissan leaf is , he said , an interesting experiment , and portugal a suitably small testing ground , but with some problems .
" recharging stations are still few -lsb- in number -rsb- and mainly in the big cities , " he said .
" and in portugal we mainly live in apartments .
so either you have a parking space in your building or you have to recharge at night in the public recharging station .
that 's complicated because there wo n't be one for each . "
portugal pushing for dynmaic energy flow in its ' smart grid ' still , the spread of on-street charging points in portugal is the reason the leaf is getting its european launch in the country .
the government-led mobi.e consortium is installing 1,300 chargers around the country , compatible with all makes of car .
in addition , the state is offering a 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- subsidy for buyers of electric cars - bringing the leaf 's price down to 30,000 euro - and a road-tax exemption .
portugal 's ambitious declared long-term target of 750,000 electric vehicles on its roads also fits with plans to expand its renewable energy output , going some way to addressing sceptics ' argument that electric cars ' environmental impact depends on where their power comes from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government is subsidizing the purchase price of electric cars " we have defined as a target to be the first country to have a nationwide and comprehensive infrastructure for vehicles and to work to give the necessary framework and incentives so that we can massively introduce the electric vehicle , " luís reis of mobi.e explained at a trade fair earlier this year .
" this is important not only in terms of the sustainability of mobility but also in terms of the strategy that we have for energy . "
portuguese society has high reliance on renewable sources portugal - for decades heavily reliant on imported oil for its energy needs - now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables , and rising .
and officials overseeing the development of the electric grid envision a future in which drivers will actually be able to profit from helping ensure that same energy is used efficiently , when electric cars have full internet capability .
" you drive it home in the evening , plug -lsb- it in to -rsb- both internet and power , and the car starts receiving signals of electricity spot prices , " antónio vidigal , a director of privatised utility edp , one of the mobi.e partners , told a conference on climate change earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables " at night the price is low ; the car will charge overnight , " vidigal went on .
" next day you come to office , plug again into both plugs .
peak time energy will be expensive and the car may sell energy back to the network . "
as in many countries , hydro-electric dams in portugal already store excess energy from wind farms ; this is used to pump water uphill , to be used to generate power when demand is high .
now the groundwork is being laid for a smart grid that could see cars playing a similar role .
as the first step in what is to be a nationwide programme , edp in 2010 made évora in the alentejo , a city with a population of some 50,000 , the first " inovcity " in the future national " inovgrid . "
" consumers have access almost to real-time information as to their energy consumption , so they 'll be able to manage that better , " explained miguel andrade , a director of edp distribuição , the group 's distribution unit .
" from the company 's side obviously we hope to have operational efficiencies from this .
we hope to integrate more renewables , more micro-generation and eventually in the medium to long-term also the electric vehicle into the grid .
" i think we 're genuinely witnessing a revolution in the way we manage distribution networks . "
nissan investing in portugal but if it 's early days for integrating cars into this vision , what of today 's models ?
the leaf on show in lisbon can not , slot into a smart grid .
but , he said , the model is easily adapted .
" we are implementing the electric vehicles now , so we have to be cost efficient otherwise people would not buy them , " said antónio joaquim , nissan portugal communications director .
" that is why the cars do n't have this and the grid does n't have this capabilities .
" but from the utility 's point of view the technology is already known , from the car industry the technology is already known , so i do n't think that is a very difficult thing to implement later on .
it 's a question of software . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal has already begun rolling out electrical charging stations the leaf itself can already communicate with the charging point : identifying itself and its charging specifications and needs , as well as its owner - who will after all be paying for the power as part of the electricity bill sent to his home .
some environmentalists see models such as the leaf as primarily a public relations exercise for manufacturers that still devote most of their investment to conventional models .
nissan 's own projections for electric cars do not go beyond 10 percent of total sales .
but given that the company is building factories in japan , the us and the uk dedicated to making the leaf - and which it would be difficult and expensive to convert to make other cars - the company is perhaps not the prime target for such accusations .
" everybody in the automotive business is trying to do their own ' greenwash ' , promising ' green ' products - and most are less polluting than before , but not that green , " said antónio pereira , editor of automotor .
" i think nissan is probably taking a lot of risks with the electric car but it 's not doing greenwash - not at all . "

he is currently a senior adviser for international affairs at the united states institute of peace and a principal in the rice hadley group . deutsche welle : let 's look back at us and european foreign and security policy this year and take a tally of some major issues .
in afghanistan 2010 was the deadliest year for the international troops with more than 700 soldiers killed , most of them american .
has president obama 's surge strategy failed ?
stephen hadley : there 's been an initial assessment which has not been released publicly in all its detail .
but i think the administration 's assessment , and i think it 's right , is that the strategy of the united states and other allies including most europeans who are with us on the ground in afghanistan is making progress .
it 's slower than we would like , it 's fragile and reversible , but there has been progress .
and i think one of the good things about 2010 is that there has been a coming together of europeans and americans about the importance of afghanistan and about how to pursue our strategy .
president obama has said the us would begin to pull troops out of afghanistan in 2011 , the british have said they may do the same and germany has announced its plans to start withdrawing troops next year as well .
when the three biggest troop contributors start pulling back , can the war in afghanistan still be won ?
yes , because the lede here is not that the troops are pulling back , the lede is that the united states and its allies believe that they will be able to begin to transfer security responsibility to the afghans .
remember , americans and europeans have for several years now been training and helping the afghans to build an army and police that can take increasing security responsibility .
and afghan forces are operating with american and nato and other european forces in afghanistan now , so what the president said was that in 2011 we could begin the process of transferring security responsibility to afghan units and as that occurred it would allow some units of american and european origin to begin to withdraw .
but president obama has been clear , and particularly secretary gates has been clear that that handover of security responsibility to afghanistan and any withdrawal of american forces will be condition-based .
that is to say it will have to reflect progress and security on the ground and will be done in a way that does not jeopardize the progress we have achieved or future progress .
another intractable international issue for the us and the eu is how to deal with iran 's nuclear program .
despite a united position by europeans and americans and tough new sanctions that were put in place in 2010 with the help of russia and china , there does n't seem to be a change of tehran 's stance .
is the west simply running out of options on iran ? i think the administration and our european allies have done a better job than i would have anticipated in getting the russians and the chinese to go along with very tough sanctions .
as you point out , regrettably , it has not resulted in a change of iranian policy on the nuclear issue .
and this is obviously a source of concern for all of us , because the worry is that if the region begins to conclude that the international community is not going to be able to prevent iran from having through its enrichment program a clear path to a nuclear weapon that is going to result in an emboldened iran , it is going to result in weakened arab states and it is going to result in arab states trying to develop their own nuclear programs which is a proliferation risk that will make the middle east less stable not more stable .
2010 was the year in which the obama administration like many before tried and failed to make progress on the peace process between israelis and palestinians because it could n't convince the israeli government to extend a settlement stop even for just a few months .
was the us foolish even to try again or has the us completely lost its leverage with both parties , but especially with the israeli government ?
i think the administration has said as much that the effort that began really soon after administration took power in january 2009 to get a construction freeze in the settlement areas did not work as the administration has intended .
what they had hoped to do was to send a strong message to the world that the administration was going to be even-handed between the israelis and palestinians .
that this message would be greeted in the arab world with steps to reach out toward israel and to begin rebuilding diplomatic relations between israel and the arab world and it simply did not work .
and rather than facilitating negotiations and progress on the negotiating table it became a barrier to negotiations .
it was a tactic , i think the administration would say , that did not work .
so they are trying to restart the process to have these proximity talks to try to turn the focus from settlement construction to what the focus should have been really from the beginning which is the terms of peace .
we can only hope that there will be some success in this effort .
but i think what is really good news for the prospects for peace is what is happening in the west bank .
that president abbas and prime minister salam fayad are building the institutions of a palestinian state even while under occupation .
they are now training security forces that are increasingly taking responsibility for security and are going after terrorists .
the israeli military is recognizing the effectiveness of these forces and cooperating with them .
the palestinians are building political institutions , economic activity and growth has returned to the west bank and there is peace , there is calm , that is to say .
there are no incidents of violence either in the west bank or in israel .
so in some sense while the negotiations seem to have foundered , the underpinnings of an ultimate peace , that is to say the institutions of a democratic palestinian state that is not supporting terror , but is maintaining peace and security for both palestinians and israelis , that process has gone forward .
and i think that is a bright spot and an essential element for an ultimate peace and a two-state solution in the middle east .
many us presidents engaged in foreign policy have a doctrine named after them that spells out their vision or version of america 's engagement with the world .
obama has now passed the half-time mark of his first term .
is there something that could be called an obama doctrine and if so how would you describe and compare it to other presidential doctrines like the so-called bush doctrine ?
i think the obama administration is still a work in progress on foreign policy .
i think they would say as much .
i think they want to be known as an administration that has engaged our adversaries .
i think that policy has had some mixed success i think with respect to north korea and chavez in venezuela and in iran .
and they have certainly been very firm on north korea about the prerequisites to resuming the six-party talks .
i think one of the things that has surprised a lot of people is while i think the administration has had a positive tone in how it has spoken to the arab world and how it has spoken to europe , i think there is a lot more continuity in the policies between president obama and president bush than a lot of people expected .
and that 's not unusual .
in the united states , while we have presidential elections that are waged and fought based often on differences in foreign policy , when new administrations come in and see the problems that the prior administration has faced there is a high degree of continuity in policies between administrations .
and i think you see it in terms of the iraq policy , afghanistan policy and policies dealing with the terrorist threat .
so i think there have been some positive changes in tone .
some have succeeded , some have not .
but i think there has also been a high degree and a useful degree of continuity with the policies of its predecessor administrations .
if you had to give a grade to the obama administration for its foreign policy for this year or for the past two years what grade would that be ?
i think any foreign policy in the first two years generally gets an incomplete .
that is to say , the first year they are figuring out what their policies should be .
the second year they begin to roll out those policies in a more serious way , but it takes another year or two to know whether they are working .
so i think almost any administration in the second year gets an incomplete .
let 's switch to transatlantic affairs : one year ago with lady ashton and herman van rompuy , two relatively obscure politicians were chosen as the eu 's first new president and foreign minister .
the us has long complained about the lack of a common european stance on many international issues .
does washington now finally know which numbers to call in europe ? i think there is a feeling that the economic crisis that we have been through has put a lot of strain on the european project .
so i think most americans think that because of the challenge presented by the economic crisis there is a certain amount of introspection going on within europe about where it is going in terms of its political and economic integration .
i think that is very understandable .
the economic crisis has been a real blow to the entire world and it 's going to take some time to work it through . so i think most americans would say there has been a little bit of a pause in the european project of political and economic integration .
that has been a project that the united states has supported for 50 years , both republican and democratic administrations , and one that we want to succeed .
but understandably there is some soul searching going on in the europeans and we need to let our european allies work these issues through .
barack obama has been described as the first us president who is not an atlanticist naturally inclined toward europe , but rather toward asia .
this and the often quoted rise of asia has led some europeans to worry about the nature and future of the transatlantic relationship .
how healthy is the transatlantic relationship today and how important will it be in the future ? i have been in washington for over 40 years and sort of every 10 years somebody comes up and declares the end of the transatlantic relationship .
and so far all those predictions have been premature .
i think this is really the oldest affiliation for the united states this strong relationship with europe .
i think it continues to remain strong and will remain strong from administration to administration .
that said , the rise of asia and major new world powers in asia such as china and india is getting a lot of attention in the united states .
and it is getting a lot of attention in europe .
germany 's economic recovery is heavily driven by exports to asia , so it is not surprising that both in europe and in the united states there is a lot of discussion about asia and ties toward asia .
that is to say , how can meet the rise of new great powers in asia and how can we turn the rise of those great powers and the economic growth and the economic engine that asia is right now literally pulling the world out of recession , how can we turn that so that it is an opportunity for greater peace and prosperity for the world as a whole .
i think that 's the task in asia and it is something that europeans and americans should be working on together .

the second year they begin to roll out those policies in a more serious way , but it takes another year or two to know whether they are working .
so i think almost any administration in the second year gets an incomplete .
let 's switch to transatlantic affairs : one year ago with lady ashton and herman van rompuy , two relatively obscure politicians were chosen as the eu 's first new president and foreign minister .
the us has long complained about the lack of a common european stance on many international issues .
does washington now finally know which numbers to call in europe ? i think there is a feeling that the economic crisis that we have been through has put a lot of strain on the european project .
so i think most americans think that because of the challenge presented by the economic crisis there is a certain amount of introspection going on within europe about where it is going in terms of its political and economic integration .
i think that is very understandable .
the economic crisis has been a real blow to the entire world and it 's going to take some time to work it through . so i think most americans would say there has been a little bit of a pause in the european project of political and economic integration .
that has been a project that the united states has supported for 50 years , both republican and democratic administrations , and one that we want to succeed .
but understandably there is some soul searching going on in the europeans and we need to let our european allies work these issues through .
barack obama has been described as the first us president who is not an atlanticist naturally inclined toward europe , but rather toward asia .
this and the often quoted rise of asia has led some europeans to worry about the nature and future of the transatlantic relationship .
how healthy is the transatlantic relationship today and how important will it be in the future ? i have been in washington for over 40 years and sort of every 10 years somebody comes up and declares the end of the transatlantic relationship .
and so far all those predictions have been premature .
i think this is really the oldest affiliation for the united states this strong relationship with europe .
i think it continues to remain strong and will remain strong from administration to administration .
that said , the rise of asia and major new world powers in asia such as china and india is getting a lot of attention in the united states .
and it is getting a lot of attention in europe .
germany 's economic recovery is heavily driven by exports to asia , so it is not surprising that both in europe and in the united states there is a lot of discussion about asia and ties toward asia .
that is to say , how can meet the rise of new great powers in asia and how can we turn the rise of those great powers and the economic growth and the economic engine that asia is right now literally pulling the world out of recession , how can we turn that so that it is an opportunity for greater peace and prosperity for the world as a whole .
i think that 's the task in asia and it is something that europeans and americans should be working on together .

he is currently a senior adviser for international affairs at the united states institute of peace and a principal in the rice hadley group . deutsche welle : let 's look back at us and european foreign and security policy this year and take a tally of some major issues .
in afghanistan 2010 was the deadliest year for the international troops with more than 700 soldiers killed , most of them american .
has president obama 's surge strategy failed ?
stephen hadley : there 's been an initial assessment which has not been released publicly in all its detail .
but i think the administration 's assessment , and i think it 's right , is that the strategy of the united states and other allies including most europeans who are with us on the ground in afghanistan is making progress .
it 's slower than we would like , it 's fragile and reversible , but there has been progress .
and i think one of the good things about 2010 is that there has been a coming together of europeans and americans about the importance of afghanistan and about how to pursue our strategy .
president obama has said the us would begin to pull troops out of afghanistan in 2011 , the british have said they may do the same and germany has announced its plans to start withdrawing troops next year as well .
when the three biggest troop contributors start pulling back , can the war in afghanistan still be won ?
yes , because the lede here is not that the troops are pulling back , the lede is that the united states and its allies believe that they will be able to begin to transfer security responsibility to the afghans .
remember , americans and europeans have for several years now been training and helping the afghans to build an army and police that can take increasing security responsibility .
and afghan forces are operating with american and nato and other european forces in afghanistan now , so what the president said was that in 2011 we could begin the process of transferring security responsibility to afghan units and as that occurred it would allow some units of american and european origin to begin to withdraw .
but president obama has been clear , and particularly secretary gates has been clear that that handover of security responsibility to afghanistan and any withdrawal of american forces will be condition-based .
that is to say it will have to reflect progress and security on the ground and will be done in a way that does not jeopardize the progress we have achieved or future progress .
another intractable international issue for the us and the eu is how to deal with iran 's nuclear program .
despite a united position by europeans and americans and tough new sanctions that were put in place in 2010 with the help of russia and china , there does n't seem to be a change of tehran 's stance .
is the west simply running out of options on iran ? i think the administration and our european allies have done a better job than i would have anticipated in getting the russians and the chinese to go along with very tough sanctions .
as you point out , regrettably , it has not resulted in a change of iranian policy on the nuclear issue .
and this is obviously a source of concern for all of us , because the worry is that if the region begins to conclude that the international community is not going to be able to prevent iran from having through its enrichment program a clear path to a nuclear weapon that is going to result in an emboldened iran , it is going to result in weakened arab states and it is going to result in arab states trying to develop their own nuclear programs which is a proliferation risk that will make the middle east less stable not more stable .
2010 was the year in which the obama administration like many before tried and failed to make progress on the peace process between israelis and palestinians because it could n't convince the israeli government to extend a settlement stop even for just a few months .
was the us foolish even to try again or has the us completely lost its leverage with both parties , but especially with the israeli government ?
i think the administration has said as much that the effort that began really soon after administration took power in january 2009 to get a construction freeze in the settlement areas did not work as the administration has intended .
what they had hoped to do was to send a strong message to the world that the administration was going to be even-handed between the israelis and palestinians .
that this message would be greeted in the arab world with steps to reach out toward israel and to begin rebuilding diplomatic relations between israel and the arab world and it simply did not work .
and rather than facilitating negotiations and progress on the negotiating table it became a barrier to negotiations .
it was a tactic , i think the administration would say , that did not work .
so they are trying to restart the process to have these proximity talks to try to turn the focus from settlement construction to what the focus should have been really from the beginning which is the terms of peace .
we can only hope that there will be some success in this effort .
but i think what is really good news for the prospects for peace is what is happening in the west bank .
that president abbas and prime minister salam fayad are building the institutions of a palestinian state even while under occupation .
they are now training security forces that are increasingly taking responsibility for security and are going after terrorists .
the israeli military is recognizing the effectiveness of these forces and cooperating with them .
the palestinians are building political institutions , economic activity and growth has returned to the west bank and there is peace , there is calm , that is to say .
there are no incidents of violence either in the west bank or in israel .
so in some sense while the negotiations seem to have foundered , the underpinnings of an ultimate peace , that is to say the institutions of a democratic palestinian state that is not supporting terror , but is maintaining peace and security for both palestinians and israelis , that process has gone forward .
and i think that is a bright spot and an essential element for an ultimate peace and a two-state solution in the middle east .
many us presidents engaged in foreign policy have a doctrine named after them that spells out their vision or version of america 's engagement with the world .
obama has now passed the half-time mark of his first term .
is there something that could be called an obama doctrine and if so how would you describe and compare it to other presidential doctrines like the so-called bush doctrine ?
i think the obama administration is still a work in progress on foreign policy .
i think they would say as much .
i think they want to be known as an administration that has engaged our adversaries .
i think that policy has had some mixed success i think with respect to north korea and chavez in venezuela and in iran .
and they have certainly been very firm on north korea about the prerequisites to resuming the six-party talks .
i think one of the things that has surprised a lot of people is while i think the administration has had a positive tone in how it has spoken to the arab world and how it has spoken to europe , i think there is a lot more continuity in the policies between president obama and president bush than a lot of people expected .
and that 's not unusual .
in the united states , while we have presidential elections that are waged and fought based often on differences in foreign policy , when new administrations come in and see the problems that the prior administration has faced there is a high degree of continuity in policies between administrations .
and i think you see it in terms of the iraq policy , afghanistan policy and policies dealing with the terrorist threat .
so i think there have been some positive changes in tone .
some have succeeded , some have not .
but i think there has also been a high degree and a useful degree of continuity with the policies of its predecessor administrations .
if you had to give a grade to the obama administration for its foreign policy for this year or for the past two years what grade would that be ?
i think any foreign policy in the first two years generally gets an incomplete .
that is to say , the first year they are figuring out what their policies should be .
the second year they begin to roll out those policies in a more serious way , but it takes another year or two to know whether they are working .
so i think almost any administration in the second year gets an incomplete .
let 's switch to transatlantic affairs : one year ago with lady ashton and herman van rompuy , two relatively obscure politicians were chosen as the eu 's first new president and foreign minister .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 24.12.2010 us foreign policy marked by continuity , says former national security adviser großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us national security adviser stephen hadley in an interview with dw , stephen hadley speaks about the continuity between president obama and his predecessor bush that surprised many people and why he views the west bank as a bright spot in the middle east . stephen hadley served as national security adviser to president george w. bush from 2005 to 2009 and as deputy national security adviser from 2001 to 2005 .
he is currently a senior adviser for international affairs at the united states institute of peace and a principal in the rice hadley group . deutsche welle : let 's look back at us and european foreign and security policy this year and take a tally of some major issues .
in afghanistan 2010 was the deadliest year for the international troops with more than 700 soldiers killed , most of them american .
has president obama 's surge strategy failed ?
stephen hadley : there 's been an initial assessment which has not been released publicly in all its detail .
but i think the administration 's assessment , and i think it 's right , is that the strategy of the united states and other allies including most europeans who are with us on the ground in afghanistan is making progress .
it 's slower than we would like , it 's fragile and reversible , but there has been progress .
and i think one of the good things about 2010 is that there has been a coming together of europeans and americans about the importance of afghanistan and about how to pursue our strategy .
president obama has said the us would begin to pull troops out of afghanistan in 2011 , the british have said they may do the same and germany has announced its plans to start withdrawing troops next year as well .
when the three biggest troop contributors start pulling back , can the war in afghanistan still be won ?
yes , because the lede here is not that the troops are pulling back , the lede is that the united states and its allies believe that they will be able to begin to transfer security responsibility to the afghans .
remember , americans and europeans have for several years now been training and helping the afghans to build an army and police that can take increasing security responsibility .
and afghan forces are operating with american and nato and other european forces in afghanistan now , so what the president said was that in 2011 we could begin the process of transferring security responsibility to afghan units and as that occurred it would allow some units of american and european origin to begin to withdraw .
but president obama has been clear , and particularly secretary gates has been clear that that handover of security responsibility to afghanistan and any withdrawal of american forces will be condition-based .
that is to say it will have to reflect progress and security on the ground and will be done in a way that does not jeopardize the progress we have achieved or future progress .
another intractable international issue for the us and the eu is how to deal with iran 's nuclear program .
despite a united position by europeans and americans and tough new sanctions that were put in place in 2010 with the help of russia and china , there does n't seem to be a change of tehran 's stance .
is the west simply running out of options on iran ? i think the administration and our european allies have done a better job than i would have anticipated in getting the russians and the chinese to go along with very tough sanctions .
as you point out , regrettably , it has not resulted in a change of iranian policy on the nuclear issue .
and this is obviously a source of concern for all of us , because the worry is that if the region begins to conclude that the international community is not going to be able to prevent iran from having through its enrichment program a clear path to a nuclear weapon that is going to result in an emboldened iran , it is going to result in weakened arab states and it is going to result in arab states trying to develop their own nuclear programs which is a proliferation risk that will make the middle east less stable not more stable .
2010 was the year in which the obama administration like many before tried and failed to make progress on the peace process between israelis and palestinians because it could n't convince the israeli government to extend a settlement stop even for just a few months .
was the us foolish even to try again or has the us completely lost its leverage with both parties , but especially with the israeli government ?
i think the administration has said as much that the effort that began really soon after administration took power in january 2009 to get a construction freeze in the settlement areas did not work as the administration has intended .
what they had hoped to do was to send a strong message to the world that the administration was going to be even-handed between the israelis and palestinians .
that this message would be greeted in the arab world with steps to reach out toward israel and to begin rebuilding diplomatic relations between israel and the arab world and it simply did not work .
and rather than facilitating negotiations and progress on the negotiating table it became a barrier to negotiations .
it was a tactic , i think the administration would say , that did not work .
so they are trying to restart the process to have these proximity talks to try to turn the focus from settlement construction to what the focus should have been really from the beginning which is the terms of peace .
we can only hope that there will be some success in this effort .
but i think what is really good news for the prospects for peace is what is happening in the west bank .
that president abbas and prime minister salam fayad are building the institutions of a palestinian state even while under occupation .
they are now training security forces that are increasingly taking responsibility for security and are going after terrorists .
the israeli military is recognizing the effectiveness of these forces and cooperating with them .
the palestinians are building political institutions , economic activity and growth has returned to the west bank and there is peace , there is calm , that is to say .
there are no incidents of violence either in the west bank or in israel .
so in some sense while the negotiations seem to have foundered , the underpinnings of an ultimate peace , that is to say the institutions of a democratic palestinian state that is not supporting terror , but is maintaining peace and security for both palestinians and israelis , that process has gone forward .
and i think that is a bright spot and an essential element for an ultimate peace and a two-state solution in the middle east .
many us presidents engaged in foreign policy have a doctrine named after them that spells out their vision or version of america 's engagement with the world .
obama has now passed the half-time mark of his first term .
is there something that could be called an obama doctrine and if so how would you describe and compare it to other presidential doctrines like the so-called bush doctrine ?
i think the obama administration is still a work in progress on foreign policy .
i think they would say as much .
i think they want to be known as an administration that has engaged our adversaries .
i think that policy has had some mixed success i think with respect to north korea and chavez in venezuela and in iran .
and they have certainly been very firm on north korea about the prerequisites to resuming the six-party talks .
i think one of the things that has surprised a lot of people is while i think the administration has had a positive tone in how it has spoken to the arab world and how it has spoken to europe , i think there is a lot more continuity in the policies between president obama and president bush than a lot of people expected .
and that 's not unusual .
in the united states , while we have presidential elections that are waged and fought based often on differences in foreign policy , when new administrations come in and see the problems that the prior administration has faced there is a high degree of continuity in policies between administrations .
and i think you see it in terms of the iraq policy , afghanistan policy and policies dealing with the terrorist threat .
so i think there have been some positive changes in tone .
some have succeeded , some have not .
but i think there has also been a high degree and a useful degree of continuity with the policies of its predecessor administrations .
if you had to give a grade to the obama administration for its foreign policy for this year or for the past two years what grade would that be ?
i think any foreign policy in the first two years generally gets an incomplete .
that is to say , the first year they are figuring out what their policies should be .
the second year they begin to roll out those policies in a more serious way , but it takes another year or two to know whether they are working .
so i think almost any administration in the second year gets an incomplete .
let 's switch to transatlantic affairs : one year ago with lady ashton and herman van rompuy , two relatively obscure politicians were chosen as the eu 's first new president and foreign minister .
the us has long complained about the lack of a common european stance on many international issues .
does washington now finally know which numbers to call in europe ? i think there is a feeling that the economic crisis that we have been through has put a lot of strain on the european project .
so i think most americans think that because of the challenge presented by the economic crisis there is a certain amount of introspection going on within europe about where it is going in terms of its political and economic integration .
i think that is very understandable .
the economic crisis has been a real blow to the entire world and it 's going to take some time to work it through . so i think most americans would say there has been a little bit of a pause in the european project of political and economic integration .
that has been a project that the united states has supported for 50 years , both republican and democratic administrations , and one that we want to succeed .
but understandably there is some soul searching going on in the europeans and we need to let our european allies work these issues through .
barack obama has been described as the first us president who is not an atlanticist naturally inclined toward europe , but rather toward asia .
this and the often quoted rise of asia has led some europeans to worry about the nature and future of the transatlantic relationship .
how healthy is the transatlantic relationship today and how important will it be in the future ? i have been in washington for over 40 years and sort of every 10 years somebody comes up and declares the end of the transatlantic relationship .
and so far all those predictions have been premature .
i think this is really the oldest affiliation for the united states this strong relationship with europe .
i think it continues to remain strong and will remain strong from administration to administration .
that said , the rise of asia and major new world powers in asia such as china and india is getting a lot of attention in the united states .
and it is getting a lot of attention in europe .
germany 's economic recovery is heavily driven by exports to asia , so it is not surprising that both in europe and in the united states there is a lot of discussion about asia and ties toward asia .
that is to say , how can meet the rise of new great powers in asia and how can we turn the rise of those great powers and the economic growth and the economic engine that asia is right now literally pulling the world out of recession , how can we turn that so that it is an opportunity for greater peace and prosperity for the world as a whole .
i think that 's the task in asia and it is something that europeans and americans should be working on together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.12.2010 rise of electric cars prompt ' smart ' electrical grids in portugal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nissan leaf will launch in portugal in january portugal ’ s long-term target of 750,000 electric cars fits with its smart energy plans .
already , the country has 40 percent of its energy coming from renewable sources . the launch in portugal in january of nissan 's leaf marks the start of the rollout in europe of what the company says is the first 100 percent electric car aimed at a mass market .
nissan targeted portugal - where it will also soon be assembling batteries for the leaf - after that country 's government agreed to setting up a national network of charging points .
in fact , the network is to be compatible with any make of electric car , and is part of still more ambitious long-term plans for a genuinely " smart grid " that could help portugal make fuller use of its fast-expanding renewable energy capacity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government wants to expand its network of charging stations in early december , amid ultra-modern architecture at the former site of the expo 98 world fair in lisbon , members of the portuguese public got the chance to test drive the leaf .
portuguese consumers are curious about electric cars comments ranged from the polite to the enthusiastic , with the lack of engine noise the most obvious characteristic of what at first glance looks like a regular five-seater family run-around .
but the very lack of engine noise creates some new " problems . "
" for instance , the headlamps have a specific design to avoid air going to the mirrors , " said antónio joaquim , the communications director of nissan iberia portugal .
" the exterior mirrors on a normal car produce a lot of noise with the wind .
but on this car , which does n't make any noise from the engine , all the very small noises that on other cars are not perceptible are - let 's say , uncomfortable . "
the more obvious matter of charging the car seems straightforward : a small panel on the bonnet opens to reveal something rather similar to an ordinary electric plug .
" if you want to charge when you are parking inside a garage in your own house or in a shopping centre , it 's better to have it on the bonnet , " joaquim added .
" it 's a completely different usage from a combustion engine .
you just charge the car during your daily life . "
charging stations are scarce for now , but are expected to increase there are two charging options : a partial quick charge , for example when you are on the motorway and do not want to stop for long , or a cheaper slow charge of up to eight hours .
prospective buyers in lisbon seemed to take the limitations of electric cars on board .
" it 's a nice car , and a good prospect for someone like me who has an urban life , and drives about 30 or 40 kilometres to work and back , " said one man , who declined to give his name .
the innovative design of the leaf 's lithium batteries means that you can drive the car for longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotor 's editor thinks that the european car of the year jury missed out on the prius but even a fully-charged leaf has a more limited range than a car with a full fuel tank .
so the fact that it recently was named european car of the year - the first completely electric vehicle to do so - raised some eyebrows .
antónio pereira , editor of portuguese car magazine automotor , told deutsche welle he suspected the competition 's jury may have been anxious not to miss a trick , having previously failed to garland the first version of the toyota prius , which later became a hit .
the nissan leaf is , he said , an interesting experiment , and portugal a suitably small testing ground , but with some problems .
" recharging stations are still few -lsb- in number -rsb- and mainly in the big cities , " he said .
" and in portugal we mainly live in apartments .
so either you have a parking space in your building or you have to recharge at night in the public recharging station .
that 's complicated because there wo n't be one for each . "
portugal pushing for dynmaic energy flow in its ' smart grid ' still , the spread of on-street charging points in portugal is the reason the leaf is getting its european launch in the country .
the government-led mobi.e consortium is installing 1,300 chargers around the country , compatible with all makes of car .
in addition , the state is offering a 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- subsidy for buyers of electric cars - bringing the leaf 's price down to 30,000 euro - and a road-tax exemption .
portugal 's ambitious declared long-term target of 750,000 electric vehicles on its roads also fits with plans to expand its renewable energy output , going some way to addressing sceptics ' argument that electric cars ' environmental impact depends on where their power comes from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government is subsidizing the purchase price of electric cars " we have defined as a target to be the first country to have a nationwide and comprehensive infrastructure for vehicles and to work to give the necessary framework and incentives so that we can massively introduce the electric vehicle , " luís reis of mobi.e explained at a trade fair earlier this year .
" this is important not only in terms of the sustainability of mobility but also in terms of the strategy that we have for energy . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.12.2010 rise of electric cars prompt ' smart ' electrical grids in portugal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nissan leaf will launch in portugal in january portugal ’ s long-term target of 750,000 electric cars fits with its smart energy plans .
already , the country has 40 percent of its energy coming from renewable sources . the launch in portugal in january of nissan 's leaf marks the start of the rollout in europe of what the company says is the first 100 percent electric car aimed at a mass market .
nissan targeted portugal - where it will also soon be assembling batteries for the leaf - after that country 's government agreed to setting up a national network of charging points .
in fact , the network is to be compatible with any make of electric car , and is part of still more ambitious long-term plans for a genuinely " smart grid " that could help portugal make fuller use of its fast-expanding renewable energy capacity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government wants to expand its network of charging stations in early december , amid ultra-modern architecture at the former site of the expo 98 world fair in lisbon , members of the portuguese public got the chance to test drive the leaf .
portuguese consumers are curious about electric cars comments ranged from the polite to the enthusiastic , with the lack of engine noise the most obvious characteristic of what at first glance looks like a regular five-seater family run-around .
but the very lack of engine noise creates some new " problems . "
" for instance , the headlamps have a specific design to avoid air going to the mirrors , " said antónio joaquim , the communications director of nissan iberia portugal .
" the exterior mirrors on a normal car produce a lot of noise with the wind .
but on this car , which does n't make any noise from the engine , all the very small noises that on other cars are not perceptible are - let 's say , uncomfortable . "
the more obvious matter of charging the car seems straightforward : a small panel on the bonnet opens to reveal something rather similar to an ordinary electric plug .
" if you want to charge when you are parking inside a garage in your own house or in a shopping centre , it 's better to have it on the bonnet , " joaquim added .
" it 's a completely different usage from a combustion engine .
you just charge the car during your daily life . "
charging stations are scarce for now , but are expected to increase there are two charging options : a partial quick charge , for example when you are on the motorway and do not want to stop for long , or a cheaper slow charge of up to eight hours .
prospective buyers in lisbon seemed to take the limitations of electric cars on board .
" it 's a nice car , and a good prospect for someone like me who has an urban life , and drives about 30 or 40 kilometres to work and back , " said one man , who declined to give his name .
the innovative design of the leaf 's lithium batteries means that you can drive the car for longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotor 's editor thinks that the european car of the year jury missed out on the prius but even a fully-charged leaf has a more limited range than a car with a full fuel tank .
so the fact that it recently was named european car of the year - the first completely electric vehicle to do so - raised some eyebrows .
antónio pereira , editor of portuguese car magazine automotor , told deutsche welle he suspected the competition 's jury may have been anxious not to miss a trick , having previously failed to garland the first version of the toyota prius , which later became a hit .
the nissan leaf is , he said , an interesting experiment , and portugal a suitably small testing ground , but with some problems .
" recharging stations are still few -lsb- in number -rsb- and mainly in the big cities , " he said .
" and in portugal we mainly live in apartments .
so either you have a parking space in your building or you have to recharge at night in the public recharging station .
that 's complicated because there wo n't be one for each . "
portugal pushing for dynmaic energy flow in its ' smart grid ' still , the spread of on-street charging points in portugal is the reason the leaf is getting its european launch in the country .
the government-led mobi.e consortium is installing 1,300 chargers around the country , compatible with all makes of car .
in addition , the state is offering a 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- subsidy for buyers of electric cars - bringing the leaf 's price down to 30,000 euro - and a road-tax exemption .
portugal 's ambitious declared long-term target of 750,000 electric vehicles on its roads also fits with plans to expand its renewable energy output , going some way to addressing sceptics ' argument that electric cars ' environmental impact depends on where their power comes from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government is subsidizing the purchase price of electric cars " we have defined as a target to be the first country to have a nationwide and comprehensive infrastructure for vehicles and to work to give the necessary framework and incentives so that we can massively introduce the electric vehicle , " luís reis of mobi.e explained at a trade fair earlier this year .
" this is important not only in terms of the sustainability of mobility but also in terms of the strategy that we have for energy . "
portuguese society has high reliance on renewable sources portugal - for decades heavily reliant on imported oil for its energy needs - now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables , and rising .
and officials overseeing the development of the electric grid envision a future in which drivers will actually be able to profit from helping ensure that same energy is used efficiently , when electric cars have full internet capability .

but when it comes to christmas , some old habits are reluctant to die . many years ago , back in the days when berlin was new to me and latte macchiato had yet to be imported to prenzlauer berg 's kastanienallee , i remember christmas being a quiet and even gentle affair .
seasons greetings were not splashed across the fronts of thousands of garish cards , nor were they blasted from brass bands at shoppers too busy hunting down their must-haves of the year to stop and lend an ear .
christmas trees were rarely seen in advance of the first advent and their decorations consisted almost entirely of straw stars on skinny red string .
that same year , i received a parcel from england containing presents wrapped in stylish paper .
i recall a german friend who was with me at the time , studying the design and wondering why shop owners here could n't find a way to stock the same kind of thing .
fast forward fifteen years and he need ask no more .
it arrived at around the same time as the cards emblazoned with christmas wishes , often enough in english , and the multi-colored baubles which shine more brightly than any straw star could ever hope to .

when the shops closed last night , hundreds of people flocked to the one mega book store that stays open until midnight .
i splashed through the sludgy brown puddles at its threshold to see what all the fuss was about .
i was surprised to see berliners , who are ordinarily cautious spenders , behaving with such reckless purchasing abandon .
the scene , which i 'm sure was being repeated all over the city , would have been excellent fodder for anyone who holds that christmas in berlin has become a sacrilegious shopping fest .
and there are plenty who would say just that .
the other side of christmas but i 'd argue that such a complaint is too black and white .
it 's clearly true that glitz and gifts are gaining momentum at christmas time - which ca n't be a bad thing from an economic point of view - but shopping and tradition have never been mutually exclusive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner dom might be big , but come christmas eve , it can also be very full on christmas eve last year , someone in my family decided we ought to go to midnight mass at the berliner dom .
i do n't go every year or very often at all for that matter , but it sounded like a nice idea , so off we trundled .
we arrived in plenty of time , only to find that there was no room .
the place was even more packed than that sprawling bookstore a little way down the road .
we tried st. hedwig 's cathedral , but could n't get in there either .
the irony of being turned away on christmas eve was not lost on us , but we did what others have clearly done before us and kept on looking .
and in our case we did n't need a bed for the night , just somewhere to stand for the duration of the service .
we tramped on to two other churches before we found a corner in the marienkirche into which we could settle .
looking back , it is hard to imagine that of all those people who turned out that night , none had walked the same streets in the preceding days in search of gifts for the people they hold dear .
i wo n't be in berlin this christmas or i might just be tempted -lrb- in the name of research -rrb- to go back and see if there are any faces i recognise from my recent expedition to friedrichstrasse .

but when it comes to christmas , some old habits are reluctant to die . many years ago , back in the days when berlin was new to me and latte macchiato had yet to be imported to prenzlauer berg 's kastanienallee , i remember christmas being a quiet and even gentle affair .
seasons greetings were not splashed across the fronts of thousands of garish cards , nor were they blasted from brass bands at shoppers too busy hunting down their must-haves of the year to stop and lend an ear .
christmas trees were rarely seen in advance of the first advent and their decorations consisted almost entirely of straw stars on skinny red string .
that same year , i received a parcel from england containing presents wrapped in stylish paper .
i recall a german friend who was with me at the time , studying the design and wondering why shop owners here could n't find a way to stock the same kind of thing .
fast forward fifteen years and he need ask no more .
it arrived at around the same time as the cards emblazoned with christmas wishes , often enough in english , and the multi-colored baubles which shine more brightly than any straw star could ever hope to .
shopping up a storm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas shopping en-masse and it is in precisely such paper that shoppers like the thousands i bumped into yesterday evening when i ventured out to friedrichstrasse -lrb- all in the name of research -rrb- will be using to wrap the gifts they had to tramp through icy temperatures and piles of snow to buy .
when the shops closed last night , hundreds of people flocked to the one mega book store that stays open until midnight .
i splashed through the sludgy brown puddles at its threshold to see what all the fuss was about .
i was surprised to see berliners , who are ordinarily cautious spenders , behaving with such reckless purchasing abandon .
the scene , which i 'm sure was being repeated all over the city , would have been excellent fodder for anyone who holds that christmas in berlin has become a sacrilegious shopping fest .
and there are plenty who would say just that .
the other side of christmas but i 'd argue that such a complaint is too black and white .
it 's clearly true that glitz and gifts are gaining momentum at christmas time - which ca n't be a bad thing from an economic point of view - but shopping and tradition have never been mutually exclusive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berliner dom might be big , but come christmas eve , it can also be very full on christmas eve last year , someone in my family decided we ought to go to midnight mass at the berliner dom .
i do n't go every year or very often at all for that matter , but it sounded like a nice idea , so off we trundled .
we arrived in plenty of time , only to find that there was no room .
the place was even more packed than that sprawling bookstore a little way down the road .
we tried st. hedwig 's cathedral , but could n't get in there either .
the irony of being turned away on christmas eve was not lost on us , but we did what others have clearly done before us and kept on looking .
and in our case we did n't need a bed for the night , just somewhere to stand for the duration of the service .
we tramped on to two other churches before we found a corner in the marienkirche into which we could settle .
looking back , it is hard to imagine that of all those people who turned out that night , none had walked the same streets in the preceding days in search of gifts for the people they hold dear .
i wo n't be in berlin this christmas or i might just be tempted -lrb- in the name of research -rrb- to go back and see if there are any faces i recognise from my recent expedition to friedrichstrasse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.12.2010 rise of electric cars prompt ' smart ' electrical grids in portugal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nissan leaf will launch in portugal in january portugal ’ s long-term target of 750,000 electric cars fits with its smart energy plans .
already , the country has 40 percent of its energy coming from renewable sources . the launch in portugal in january of nissan 's leaf marks the start of the rollout in europe of what the company says is the first 100 percent electric car aimed at a mass market .
nissan targeted portugal - where it will also soon be assembling batteries for the leaf - after that country 's government agreed to setting up a national network of charging points .
in fact , the network is to be compatible with any make of electric car , and is part of still more ambitious long-term plans for a genuinely " smart grid " that could help portugal make fuller use of its fast-expanding renewable energy capacity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government wants to expand its network of charging stations in early december , amid ultra-modern architecture at the former site of the expo 98 world fair in lisbon , members of the portuguese public got the chance to test drive the leaf .
portuguese consumers are curious about electric cars comments ranged from the polite to the enthusiastic , with the lack of engine noise the most obvious characteristic of what at first glance looks like a regular five-seater family run-around .
but the very lack of engine noise creates some new " problems . "
" for instance , the headlamps have a specific design to avoid air going to the mirrors , " said antónio joaquim , the communications director of nissan iberia portugal .
" the exterior mirrors on a normal car produce a lot of noise with the wind .
but on this car , which does n't make any noise from the engine , all the very small noises that on other cars are not perceptible are - let 's say , uncomfortable . "
the more obvious matter of charging the car seems straightforward : a small panel on the bonnet opens to reveal something rather similar to an ordinary electric plug .
" if you want to charge when you are parking inside a garage in your own house or in a shopping centre , it 's better to have it on the bonnet , " joaquim added .
" it 's a completely different usage from a combustion engine .
you just charge the car during your daily life . "
charging stations are scarce for now , but are expected to increase there are two charging options : a partial quick charge , for example when you are on the motorway and do not want to stop for long , or a cheaper slow charge of up to eight hours .
prospective buyers in lisbon seemed to take the limitations of electric cars on board .
" it 's a nice car , and a good prospect for someone like me who has an urban life , and drives about 30 or 40 kilometres to work and back , " said one man , who declined to give his name .
the innovative design of the leaf 's lithium batteries means that you can drive the car for longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotor 's editor thinks that the european car of the year jury missed out on the prius but even a fully-charged leaf has a more limited range than a car with a full fuel tank .
so the fact that it recently was named european car of the year - the first completely electric vehicle to do so - raised some eyebrows .
antónio pereira , editor of portuguese car magazine automotor , told deutsche welle he suspected the competition 's jury may have been anxious not to miss a trick , having previously failed to garland the first version of the toyota prius , which later became a hit .
the nissan leaf is , he said , an interesting experiment , and portugal a suitably small testing ground , but with some problems .
" recharging stations are still few -lsb- in number -rsb- and mainly in the big cities , " he said .
" and in portugal we mainly live in apartments .
so either you have a parking space in your building or you have to recharge at night in the public recharging station .
that 's complicated because there wo n't be one for each . "
portugal pushing for dynmaic energy flow in its ' smart grid ' still , the spread of on-street charging points in portugal is the reason the leaf is getting its european launch in the country .
the government-led mobi.e consortium is installing 1,300 chargers around the country , compatible with all makes of car .
in addition , the state is offering a 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- subsidy for buyers of electric cars - bringing the leaf 's price down to 30,000 euro - and a road-tax exemption .
portugal 's ambitious declared long-term target of 750,000 electric vehicles on its roads also fits with plans to expand its renewable energy output , going some way to addressing sceptics ' argument that electric cars ' environmental impact depends on where their power comes from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government is subsidizing the purchase price of electric cars " we have defined as a target to be the first country to have a nationwide and comprehensive infrastructure for vehicles and to work to give the necessary framework and incentives so that we can massively introduce the electric vehicle , " luís reis of mobi.e explained at a trade fair earlier this year .
" this is important not only in terms of the sustainability of mobility but also in terms of the strategy that we have for energy . "
portuguese society has high reliance on renewable sources portugal - for decades heavily reliant on imported oil for its energy needs - now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables , and rising .
and officials overseeing the development of the electric grid envision a future in which drivers will actually be able to profit from helping ensure that same energy is used efficiently , when electric cars have full internet capability .
" you drive it home in the evening , plug -lsb- it in to -rsb- both internet and power , and the car starts receiving signals of electricity spot prices , " antónio vidigal , a director of privatised utility edp , one of the mobi.e partners , told a conference on climate change earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables " at night the price is low ; the car will charge overnight , " vidigal went on .
" next day you come to office , plug again into both plugs .
peak time energy will be expensive and the car may sell energy back to the network . "
as in many countries , hydro-electric dams in portugal already store excess energy from wind farms ; this is used to pump water uphill , to be used to generate power when demand is high .
now the groundwork is being laid for a smart grid that could see cars playing a similar role .
as the first step in what is to be a nationwide programme , edp in 2010 made évora in the alentejo , a city with a population of some 50,000 , the first " inovcity " in the future national " inovgrid . "
" consumers have access almost to real-time information as to their energy consumption , so they 'll be able to manage that better , " explained miguel andrade , a director of edp distribuição , the group 's distribution unit .
" from the company 's side obviously we hope to have operational efficiencies from this .
we hope to integrate more renewables , more micro-generation and eventually in the medium to long-term also the electric vehicle into the grid .
" i think we 're genuinely witnessing a revolution in the way we manage distribution networks . "
nissan investing in portugal but if it 's early days for integrating cars into this vision , what of today 's models ?
the leaf on show in lisbon can not , slot into a smart grid .
but , he said , the model is easily adapted .
" we are implementing the electric vehicles now , so we have to be cost efficient otherwise people would not buy them , " said antónio joaquim , nissan portugal communications director .
" that is why the cars do n't have this and the grid does n't have this capabilities .
" but from the utility 's point of view the technology is already known , from the car industry the technology is already known , so i do n't think that is a very difficult thing to implement later on .
it 's a question of software . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal has already begun rolling out electrical charging stations the leaf itself can already communicate with the charging point : identifying itself and its charging specifications and needs , as well as its owner - who will after all be paying for the power as part of the electricity bill sent to his home .
some environmentalists see models such as the leaf as primarily a public relations exercise for manufacturers that still devote most of their investment to conventional models .
nissan 's own projections for electric cars do not go beyond 10 percent of total sales .
but given that the company is building factories in japan , the us and the uk dedicated to making the leaf - and which it would be difficult and expensive to convert to make other cars - the company is perhaps not the prime target for such accusations .
" everybody in the automotive business is trying to do their own ' greenwash ' , promising ' green ' products - and most are less polluting than before , but not that green , " said antónio pereira , editor of automotor .
" i think nissan is probably taking a lot of risks with the electric car but it 's not doing greenwash - not at all . "

" it 's a completely different usage from a combustion engine .
you just charge the car during your daily life . "
charging stations are scarce for now , but are expected to increase there are two charging options : a partial quick charge , for example when you are on the motorway and do not want to stop for long , or a cheaper slow charge of up to eight hours .
prospective buyers in lisbon seemed to take the limitations of electric cars on board .
" it 's a nice car , and a good prospect for someone like me who has an urban life , and drives about 30 or 40 kilometres to work and back , " said one man , who declined to give his name .
the innovative design of the leaf 's lithium batteries means that you can drive the car for longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automotor 's editor thinks that the european car of the year jury missed out on the prius but even a fully-charged leaf has a more limited range than a car with a full fuel tank .
so the fact that it recently was named european car of the year - the first completely electric vehicle to do so - raised some eyebrows .
antónio pereira , editor of portuguese car magazine automotor , told deutsche welle he suspected the competition 's jury may have been anxious not to miss a trick , having previously failed to garland the first version of the toyota prius , which later became a hit .
the nissan leaf is , he said , an interesting experiment , and portugal a suitably small testing ground , but with some problems .
" recharging stations are still few -lsb- in number -rsb- and mainly in the big cities , " he said .
" and in portugal we mainly live in apartments .
so either you have a parking space in your building or you have to recharge at night in the public recharging station .
that 's complicated because there wo n't be one for each . "
portugal pushing for dynmaic energy flow in its ' smart grid ' still , the spread of on-street charging points in portugal is the reason the leaf is getting its european launch in the country .
the government-led mobi.e consortium is installing 1,300 chargers around the country , compatible with all makes of car .
in addition , the state is offering a 5,000 euro -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- subsidy for buyers of electric cars - bringing the leaf 's price down to 30,000 euro - and a road-tax exemption .
portugal 's ambitious declared long-term target of 750,000 electric vehicles on its roads also fits with plans to expand its renewable energy output , going some way to addressing sceptics ' argument that electric cars ' environmental impact depends on where their power comes from .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the portuguese government is subsidizing the purchase price of electric cars " we have defined as a target to be the first country to have a nationwide and comprehensive infrastructure for vehicles and to work to give the necessary framework and incentives so that we can massively introduce the electric vehicle , " luís reis of mobi.e explained at a trade fair earlier this year .
" this is important not only in terms of the sustainability of mobility but also in terms of the strategy that we have for energy . "
portuguese society has high reliance on renewable sources portugal - for decades heavily reliant on imported oil for its energy needs - now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables , and rising .
and officials overseeing the development of the electric grid envision a future in which drivers will actually be able to profit from helping ensure that same energy is used efficiently , when electric cars have full internet capability .
" you drive it home in the evening , plug -lsb- it in to -rsb- both internet and power , and the car starts receiving signals of electricity spot prices , " antónio vidigal , a director of privatised utility edp , one of the mobi.e partners , told a conference on climate change earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal now generates over 40 percent of electricity from renewables " at night the price is low ; the car will charge overnight , " vidigal went on .
" next day you come to office , plug again into both plugs .
peak time energy will be expensive and the car may sell energy back to the network . "
as in many countries , hydro-electric dams in portugal already store excess energy from wind farms ; this is used to pump water uphill , to be used to generate power when demand is high .
now the groundwork is being laid for a smart grid that could see cars playing a similar role .
as the first step in what is to be a nationwide programme , edp in 2010 made évora in the alentejo , a city with a population of some 50,000 , the first " inovcity " in the future national " inovgrid . "
" consumers have access almost to real-time information as to their energy consumption , so they 'll be able to manage that better , " explained miguel andrade , a director of edp distribuição , the group 's distribution unit .
" from the company 's side obviously we hope to have operational efficiencies from this .
we hope to integrate more renewables , more micro-generation and eventually in the medium to long-term also the electric vehicle into the grid .
" i think we 're genuinely witnessing a revolution in the way we manage distribution networks . "
nissan investing in portugal but if it 's early days for integrating cars into this vision , what of today 's models ?
the leaf on show in lisbon can not , slot into a smart grid .
but , he said , the model is easily adapted .
" we are implementing the electric vehicles now , so we have to be cost efficient otherwise people would not buy them , " said antónio joaquim , nissan portugal communications director .
" that is why the cars do n't have this and the grid does n't have this capabilities .
" but from the utility 's point of view the technology is already known , from the car industry the technology is already known , so i do n't think that is a very difficult thing to implement later on .
it 's a question of software . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal has already begun rolling out electrical charging stations the leaf itself can already communicate with the charging point : identifying itself and its charging specifications and needs , as well as its owner - who will after all be paying for the power as part of the electricity bill sent to his home .
some environmentalists see models such as the leaf as primarily a public relations exercise for manufacturers that still devote most of their investment to conventional models .
nissan 's own projections for electric cars do not go beyond 10 percent of total sales .
but given that the company is building factories in japan , the us and the uk dedicated to making the leaf - and which it would be difficult and expensive to convert to make other cars - the company is perhaps not the prime target for such accusations .
" everybody in the automotive business is trying to do their own ' greenwash ' , promising ' green ' products - and most are less polluting than before , but not that green , " said antónio pereira , editor of automotor .
" i think nissan is probably taking a lot of risks with the electric car but it 's not doing greenwash - not at all . "
