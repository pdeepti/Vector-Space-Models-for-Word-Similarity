program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 20.10.2010 new television show confronts men looking for underage relationships großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the online world can be a dangerous place for children critics say a new television show that catches men chatting with teens about sex and then meeting up with them is mob justice .
along for the ride is defense minister theodor zu guttenberg 's wife , who co-hosts the show . the man 's face and body is completely pixilated .
his voice is distorted .
but it 's easy enough to see what this guy wants .
he 's had the windows of his car tinted so no one can see inside .
no one will notice them when they 're out in the woods , anyway , he tells his companion , who he thinks is just 13 years old .
this is " tatort internet , " a new television show that uses fake chat usernames to trick men into thinking they 're talking with young girls or boys and set up a meeting .
then they secretly film the encounter and confront the man with his inappropriate messages , the inappropriate photos he 's sent and his inappropriate intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister says the show could put innocent people at risk the show is co-hosted by stephanie zu guttenberg , the wife of german defense minister theodor zu guttenberg .
that did n't stop fellow cabinet member and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from expressing her distaste for the show to the newspaper passauer neue presse .
" there 's the risk that innocent people are being publicly condemned , " she said .
" the german legal system does n't have to resort to mob justice . "
one man featured on the show was identified and then fired from his job where he worked with teens .
he subsequently went missing for several days and his colleagues and family said they feared he may have killed himself .
he has since resurfaced .
paula honkanen-schoberth , director of the german league for child protection , told deutsche welle that she was also worried about the vigilante aspect of the television show .
" of course we think that sexual abuse is a severe crime and must be prosecuted in all possible , but legal ways , " she said .
" but in germany we live under the rule of law , and that is why we regard the criminal prosecution as a matter for the police .
and television is not the police .
and should n't act like it is . "
getting the safety message to teens what needs to be done , honkanen-schoberth said , is to get parents talking with their kids about staying safe online .
they should tell them not to give out their name and address or to meet up with strangers alone .
they should let them know they can always come to them if someone is threatening them or pressuring them to do something they do n't want to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents must talk with their children about staying safe online , says honkanen-schoberth honkanen-schoberth said she would welcome a show that addressed these things .
but media expert jo groeber from the german digital institute says the show itself could be a revolutionary way to inform young people about the dangers of the internet and chatting with adult strangers .
" it 's entertaining , it 's even , i 'm afraid to say it , thrilling , " he said .
" it 's probably tasteless , but it reaches the audience . "
one concern he does have , he said , is whether the show 's producers know of potential abusers for months at time before informing the police .
the guttenberg image stephanie zu guttenberg 's presence on the show comes as her husband 's political star gets brighter and brighter .
there 's even been speculation that he could become the country 's next chancellor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephanie zu guttenberg 's role in the show could affect her husband 's career in a survey by the forsa research institute released on wednesday , 25 percent of those surveyed said the defense minister would make a better chancellor than his boss , chancellor angela merkel .
this new role for stephanie zu guttenberg will only enhance her husband 's image , according to groebel .
" let 's be honest , the partner of a high-ranking politician is usually on the safe side .
they 're involved in charity work , but they never take any risks , " he said .
" i think the fact that she 's taking a risk will strengthen his image , as the husband of a completely independent wife . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 20.10.2010 debate about islam in germany heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has seen a rise in anti-islamic feeling germany 's top-selling non-fiction bestseller is a book that attacks islam - and the german president ca n't get the public to agree with him when he says that islam is part of germany . thilo sarrazin , former state finance minister in berlin and just a short time ago on the board of the german central bank , has written a bestseller : " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany is doing away with itself " -rrb- .
he predicts a dire future for the country and he blames it above all on islam and the uncontrolled immigration of muslims .
most muslims have different values than the germans , he writes .
they ostensibly hold god higher than the constitutional state and democracy .
this is the reason , he claims , why germany will gradually do away with itself if it does n't carry out an active immigration and integration debate .
sarrazin 's arguments are meeting with a great deal of support .
but he is also encountering opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book has sparked much of the recent debate michael bommes , a sociologist teaching at the university of osnabrueck , notes that the current debate about islam shows that most people have still to grasp the fact that germany has long since become a country of immigrants , with a correspondingly complex diversity of values and viewpoints .
" through modern international immigration , world religions such as islam have now arrived in europe , " says bommes .
he argues that muslims have to adjust to this situation , as do the citizens of other european nations .
the relationships between politics , law and religion have to be rethought , he says .
people have always had to find compromises over these three elements .
and islam is making this necessary once more in today 's world .
fear of headscarves and mosques many germans are worried because they see their way of life being called into question by the presence of islam .
they find the headscarves and veils worn by muslim women particularly offensive .
they raise the possibility that these women are being oppressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic headwear is viewed with suspicion by many europeans such concerns are also evident in the results of a study recently published by the friedrich ebert foundation .
oliver decker , who led the study , speaks of a " very distinct increase from 34 percent to over half the population who agree with statements hostile to islam . "
many germans are also skeptical with regard to the building of new mosques , he says .
where do these negative appraisals of islam come from ?
islam scholar navid kermani believes that germans see their identity being threatened .
identity , he explains , is formed when we distinguish ourselves from other groups .
every social group defines itself by how it differs from other groups .
that 's why , he argues , it seems logical to keep one 's distance from islam .
after all , westerners tend to be unfamiliar with islamic symbols , making the religion seem especially alien .
the process of differentiation itself is then only natural .
but it becomes problematic when those who are different are declared to be the enemy .
a sometimes superficial discussion seen in this light , there is nothing reprehensible about the debate on islam .
it seems to reflect primarily the struggle for a new german self-image and the difficulties connected with the fact that germany has indeed become a country of immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western impressions of islam may be too simplistic nevertheless , political scientist claus leggewie contends that the discussions about islam are often conducted on too superficial a level .
most people make little distinction between the various currents within islam .
nor do they make sufficient allowance for the differences between moderate and radical muslims .
" i believe that most europeans tend to develop a rather schematic image of islam , " says leggewie .
he finds it astounding that europeans , who do so much travelling and know the world so well , whose opinions on all other issues are so carefully formed and objective , are often so quick to make superficial judgments when it comes to islam .
but the debate on islam did n't exactly appear out of thin air , either .
it stems from the fact that religion has regained a great deal of power in the middle east itself .
of course people in germany have taken note of this resurgence , explains navid kermani .
the problem is that , in the muslim world as well , many issues are being viewed through a religious lens .
for many years , religion played no role on the political front there .
now all that has changed .
and germany feels threatened , fearing an increasing powerful cocktail of religion and politics here as well .
islam as a way of helping to define europe first and foremost , the battle about islam is an inner-german struggle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate may ultimately be about how international germany should be it 's about how open germany and the germans want to be .
since the end of the nazi dictatorship , germans have agonized about their history , and have developed a troubled relationship with their national identity .
whoever makes a statement about islam , says claus leggewie , is also indirectly speaking out on an entirely different issue - namely , how international germany should be .
" there are islamophobic tendencies on the one side and islamophile leanings on the other , " says leggewie .
" and , as we know , they have historically very frequently been interrelated , even when they seem on the outside to be diametrically opposed .
this very obviously means that islam continues to play an essential role in our construction of what europe means , i.e. in the collective identity of the europeans . "

now ppr wants puma 's unconventional ceo jochen zeitz to build a new sports and leisure empire . french luxury goods producer ppr has big plans for german sports brand puma , as well as that company 's unconventional ceo , jochen zeitz .
zeitz – who reportedly divides his time between puma 's headquarters in herzogenaurach and his farm in kenya – took charge of puma in 1993 , when he was just 30 years old .
he quickly gained a reputation as a mover and shaker as he transformed the struggling company into a successful brand with a global presence .
ppr acquired puma in 2007 , and has since purchased other sports brands including the cobra golf label .
it wants zeitz , now 47 , to head up a new sporting goods and leisure division with puma as its centerpiece .
ppr chief francois-henri pinault said in a statement that " the reinforcement of the puma management team under jochen zeitz is a decisive factor in the implementation of our strategy , which aims to make puma the core brand of ppr 's second pillar -lrb- sporting goods and leisure -rrb- . "
logical conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois-henri pinault 's ppr bought zeitz 's puma in 2007 antoine belge , a luxury and sporting goods analyst for hsbc , said zeitz has been involved in ppr 's strategic development for some time now .
" it 's just a sort of formalization of something that already existed ... effectively he was already in charge of doing acquisition , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's just a sign that expansion may accelerate . "
to facilitate change , puma will be restructured from a german ag corporation to a european se corporation .
analysts expect a senior puma manager will be appointed ceo , while zeitz himself is stays on as executive chairman until a replacement is found .
" that is why they want to have a specific ceo for the puma brand , because jochen zeitz will probably spend more time finding other brands to integrate into that division , " belge said .
tighter branding control ppr is expected to sell a number of subsidiaries – including electronics and entertainment retailer fnac , furniture seller conforama and redcats mail order- to finance the acquisition of further high-end brands .
john horan , publisher of industry newsletter sporting goods intelligence , said it makes sense for ppr to shed its multi-brand retail chains and concentrate on developing its own labels .
he described this as ' vertical retail , ' in which brands maintain stores exclusively to sell their products .
" if you look at where all the real strength in retail is recently , it 's been with vertical retailers of one kind or another , " horan told deutsche welle .
" they see it as a way to really make a brand statement that is very difficult to make when you 're selling through a retailer . "

his address had important messages for germans and turks , says baha gungor of dw 's turkish service . the omens for christian wulff 's third trip abroad as german president , this time to turkey , were unfavorable .
in germany , a debate on integration was raging , charged with emotions .
the weekly magazine " focus " published a cover with wulff 's face on it - distorted as an islamic prayer leader .
wulff had , however , merely pointed out in an october 3 speech that islam - in addition to christianity and judaism - is part of life in germany . public attention became focused on the first speech given by a german president to the turkish parliament .
wulff did not mince words .
for one , he repeated that islam has become an integral part of germany .
he also demanded that turkey acknowledge that christianity has a place in turkey , and that christians there should be free to worship as they wish .
that included priests being trained in turkey , he said , which is not possible now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha gungor , head of dw 's turkish department wulff did not avoid critical topics , such as turkey 's difficult relationship with cyprus and armenia .
not least , he affirmed israel 's right to exist while demanding an autonomous , viable and democratically ruled palestine .
that was an indirect request for turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to resume dialogue with israel . wulff refrained from making empty promises regarding turkey joining the european union .
shrewdly , clearly and unmistakably , wulff said that regardless of the democratic and economic progress turkey has indeed made , eu membership was not a foregone conclusion . the most distinct messages that wulff addressed to both germans and turks had to do with the need for people of turkish descent in germany to find a place in german society .
it was striking that wulff avoided using the loaded word " integration . "
his call for immigrants to learn the german language had been supported by the turkish president abdullah gul in the run-up to his visit .
and gul did not forget to mention in a joint press conference ahead of wulff 's speech that he was the president of all turkish citizens - those with armenian , jewish and greek roots included - and that all people in turkey should speak turkish . wulff 's five-day state visit will evidently help to minimize misunderstanding between berlin and ankara .
wulff 's manner has been well-received and his cautious words will not be ignored . whether a change of direction in germany 's out-of-control integration debate can be expected remains to be seen ; wulff does not have to win elections anymore . certain politicians , on the other hand , are not likely to pass on the strategy of pitting popular emotions against foreigners and migrants for their election campaigns . author : baha gungor -lrb- sst / rc -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead of recreating pre-crisis life , they should stimulate economies so people are n't forced to live off foreign aid . dr. peter walker , the founder of the world disasters report , advocated professionalizing the disaster response business , developing both the global code of conduct for disaster workers and the sphere humanitarian standards .
he is the director of the feinstein international center at tufts university in the united states , and is involved in research into possible future global drivers of humanitarian crises , and the effectiveness of the international humanitarian system . he told deutsche welle about the changes in mentality that he thinks would make development aid more effective over the long-term . deutsche welle : you have put forward the premise that responding to humanitarian crises is becoming more problematic .
what is the problem ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development aid groups need to rethink their strategies , walker said dr. peter walker : i think what 's becoming problematic is the model we use .
the traditional model is that disasters are abnormal .
they knock you down , then you have response , and the response puts people back in a position to carry on with normal life .
just like the way we would recover after a car accident .
but what the research is showing is that as you have more processes that affect the way our economies work - like climate change , globalization , the increase in organized crime - there is a stress on society , and when there 's a crisis it 's much larger than it was in the past and it is much more pervasive .
it actually changes the direction of development and the way society moves forward .
that 's very different from what happened in the past . you almost need to think it 's no longer a temporary thing .
these crises permanently affect large populations and large parts of the economy , so we need to respond differently .
it 's not a sideshow anymore .
it 's actually an integral part of the economies .
that means aid agencies have to change the way they think about disaster response : how they work with local governments , how they can do a lot of work beforehand to try and influence the way governments look at risk reduction in their community . what needs to change ? the analysis that we 've done is that the old notion of quick crisis and long-term development is not quite right .
you have this body of people in the middle who essentially live off what is tantamount to an international social welfare system - in refugee camps , in internally displaced persons camps .
many of the pastoralist populations around the world are in this state , people who are living on the margins of cities and shanty towns , where there 's no obvious way forward in development terms , levels of violence are very high and effectively the main source of livelihood they have is humanitarian assistance .
but that 's just like being drip-fed in a hospital ward .
people do n't want to be in that position .
people are the same the world over .
they want to build a better future for their kids , and so they want to have economic opportunities . you advocate stimulating the economies of conflict-ridden states even as the conflict unfolds .
is that feasible ? i think we have really got to look again at how we work in these crisis situations .
you ca n't wait for stability before you start development .
somalia has n't been stable for 20 years ; it is not going to be stable .
that 's the reality .
so do you do development there ?
that 's really what agencies should be focusing on – how do you stimulate an economy in high levels of violence so that people have an opportunity . can you really stimulate an economy in times of violence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enabling trade would help those suffering in darfur the answer is yes , you can stimulate economies in crisis situations .
for instance , we are doing research in darfur , and one of the things that is obvious in darfur is that as a region it basically works by trading networks .
different agro-ecological zones , the desert in the north to tropics in the south , you need to trade .
everybody in darfur knows that , and conflict disrupts that trade .
re-establishing trade and the ability to move is in most people 's best interests .
even those who control armed groups , the money has to come from somewhere , and trade is a good thing .
you can establish trading networks and get the economy moving again .
it takes a bit of lateral thinking about how you 're going to do it , but it 's possible . do you see development agencies thinking on these lines ? i think there 's a certain inertia within aid agencies to approach crises in this fashion .
it 's still easier essentially just to provide social welfare services , and that 's absolutely necessary where the alternative is starvation , death from disease or lack of shelter .
but how do you build on that to go further ?
essentially what our research is showing is that just doing life-saving humanitarian assistance is necessary but not sufficient in these crises . who 's going to nudge the system in the direction you 're suggesting ? what works is trying to change the standards that people expect and the approaches they take .
that 's actually how most of our systems in the west work .
they are not through command and control .
they are through ratcheting up people 's expectations .
the way a health system improves in a country is because as a consumer you expect a certain higher level .
you become educated , you know what 's available and that moves the system in a certain direction .
i think that 's the approach : how do you change the expectations within aid agencies of what is good aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone use will let more people 's voices be heard to be honest , it 's also going to change because you 're going to find that the survivor populations in these areas have the ability to have a say .
the influence mobile phones have had in many of these crises in the last few years has been stunning because it enables people to have a voice .
that is going to change things dramatically in the next 10 years .
the populations that you 're serving will not be passive . you are critical of military humanitarianism , in afghanistan for instance , suggesting it 's a " weapons system " that is not attuned to the people 's real concerns . the purpose of any military system is to try and improve security .
you can think of things like money being a weapons system because you can use money to stimulate an economy , to improve security and to bribe people to improve security . from research we 've carried out in our center in afghanistan recently , when you really started to talk to afghans about what they thought caused insecurity what really angered them was n't really poverty .
it was the failure of governance .
the fact that they felt they did n't have leaders who represented them anymore , that they could n't trust leadership .
everywhere they turned , they saw corruption and people benefitting from the aid business but not them .
one of the things we 've realized is that if you 're running an aid project where you 're trying to spend a lot of money very quickly , in an area you do n't know , maybe in a field you have n't worked in very often , it fuels corruption and effectively makes it less secure . interview : ranjitha balasubramanyam editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

etna was the first location to be imaged four months after the second of the two satellites was launched , a satellite tandem is in position and has begun its mission of taking high-resolution photographs of the earth 's surface . the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- announced tuesday that its two satellites currently flying in tight formation around the earth have acquired their first detailed image of the earth 's surface .
the new image details mt .

german space authorities said the level of accuracy this method produces is unprecedented . " processing the bistatic pairs of data is a big challenge , " thomas fritz , a dlr processing engineer , said in a statement .
" everything must match up exactly in order to reach this level of precision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de caucasus -pipe- 20.10.2010 chechnya still a long way from stability , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya has been in a state of crisis since the fall of the soviet union tuesday 's dramatic raid on the chechen parliament was a blow to russian claims that chechnya has been pacified .
commentators believe that only a change of policy can end the long years of violence and unrest . the kremlin remained bullish after the separatist attack on the chechen parliament in grozny on tuesday , in which three people were killed .
" as always , they -lrb- the militants -rrb- failed , " russian interior minister rashid nurgaliyev said at a televized meeting at the local interior ministry .
the minister , by coincidence on a trip to grozny , said the chechen gunmen were intercepted by interior ministry troops , and that the operation by the security forces to free the deputies was a success .
he then claimed chechnya was " stable and safe . "
but since russia officially ended its " counter-terror " operation in the province in april 2009 , there have been plenty of signs that chechnya is far from pacified .
the double bombings carried out by two suicide bombers on the moscow metro in march , which killed 40 and wounded more than 100 , showed that separatist violence has the power to reach the russian capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chechen parliament was attacked tuesday uwe halbach , researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the violence has actually been increasing in the region since 2009 .
" what we have in chechnya is a trend that is also evident in other republics in the northern caucasus , such as kabardino-balkaria and dagestan , " halbach told deutsche welle .
" attacks are being very deliberately directed at security organizations and authorities , in this case the parliament . "
scars from two wars chechnya unilaterally declared independence from russia in 1991 , following the collapse of the soviet union .
in 1994 , the first russian troops marched in to put the separatist movement down .
the destruction and reoccupation of the capital city grozny in 1996 represented only a partial resolution , and the ceasefire remained fragile .
the russian soldiers returned in 1999 , starting what has become known as the second chechen war .
this military offensive lasted until the spring of 2000 and ended with russia 's military occupation of the province .
but the underlying conflict lingered , and chechen resistance has continued since then , mostly in the form of guerrilla attacks on civilian targets in chechnya , neighboring dagestan and russia itself .
chechnya has been governed by presidents loyal to moscow since 2003 .
achmat kadyrov was killed in a bomb attack in 2004 and succeeded by his son ramzan kadyrov , who has been criticized for using extra-legal measures .
divided separatists but while kadyrov 's government faces a violent front of rebels who want to turn chechnya into an independent islamic state , many chechens have actually come to support the president in recent years .
ivan sukhov , caucasus correspondent for the independent moscow newspaper vremya novostyey , told deutsche welle , " in the last few years , ramzan kadyrov has almost become a figure symbolic of the chechen idea - the man who defends ethnic chechen interests .
that 's why many who fought for chechen freedom and independence from russia have joined him .
now there is a division in the movement . "
gerhard mangott , russia expert with the innsbruck institute for political science , says that three leading chechen rebels have now declared themselves against the idea of turning the republic into a muslim emirate .
instead , they favor a nation state based on the chechen ethnicity .
but it is this group that is apparently responsible for this week 's attack on the parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzan kadyrov has won some support recently " this group has abandoned doku umarov , who leads the islamist movement , " he said .
" it is certainly probable that this group started -lrb- this week 's -rrb- attacks to show it is capable of executing a massive strike on the center of president kadyrov 's power . "
mangott also notes a significant increase in rebel activity in the region in the last few months , particularly in dagestan and ingushetia , another russian republic bordering chechnya .
he believes the russian government 's attempts to stabilize the region have all failed so far .
both the tactic of military invasion and the tactic of targeted attacks on rebel leaders using secret service intelligence have so far yielded little result .
even russian president dmitry medvedev is apparently opening up to the idea that the solution can not only be a military one .
fresh ideas needed halbach also believes that russia should rethink its strategy in the northern caucasus .
development strategies that focus on social and economic problems are also necessary , and halbach believes the european union should support such initiatives and actively encourage russia to seek alternatives to military action .
but russia continues to declare the troubles in the region a domestic issue , making intervention in the form of international development aid impossible .
" i think there needs to be dialogue between the eu and russia about the alarming security situation in this region , " halbach said .
" it is not just russia 's ' internal foreign country , ' not just a crisis region on russia 's periphery , it is also a region on the edge of europe , and it is certainly in europe 's interests to know whether we can expect a further escalation in violence there , or whether it will be possible to limit it .

included in the resolution are 700 million euros to help educate poor children . the german cabinet on wednesday approved proposed legislation that would reform state benefits for the long-term unemployed .
the new policy would see the basic welfare payments , known as hartz iv , raised to 364 euros -lrb- $ 505 -rrb- per adult recipient per month - a five euro increase over the current rate .
in order to satisfy a constitutional court ruling , the bill must be passed into law by year 's end .
chancellor merkel 's center-right coalition government does n't have a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , and the opposition has said that it will only approve the bill if signifigant amendments are made .
merkel defends reforms against criticism since chancellor merkel 's center-right coalition government unveiled its proposals last month , opposition parties have criticized the increase as being too small .
" a failure to massively raise -lsb- welfare -rsb- rates will mean a permanent state of poverty and marginalization , " said gregor gysi , the head of the left party 's parliamentary group .
the chancellor meanwhile defended the welfare reforms .
" hartz iv is not a way of life , " merkel said in berlin on wednesday , adding that the payments were " meant as a bridge back to employment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen called on germany 's parties to work together to pass the reform more money for education the new measures , which are expected to cost an additional 900 million euros , include 700 million to improve education for children in welfare recipient households .
yet opponents say the education package is not enough either .
gysi said it was " not enough to finance a sports club or a music school and certainly not remedial courses . "
chancellor merkel expressed some sympathy for welfare beneficiaries , saying , " i know that -lsb- these cuts -rsb- can be hard .
but there must be some motivation to go back to work . "
the new regulation needs to be passed into law before the end of the year , to satisfy a court ruling that deemed the way the payments have been calculated up until now to be unconstitutional . the government hopes to be able to implement the reforms on january 1 , 2011 .
labor minister ursula von der leyen called on all parties to work together in order to make the reform work , saying that the “ this tight deadline means we all have to take responsibility . ”

his address had important messages for germans and turks , says baha gungor of dw 's turkish service . the omens for christian wulff 's third trip abroad as german president , this time to turkey , were unfavorable .
in germany , a debate on integration was raging , charged with emotions .
the weekly magazine " focus " published a cover with wulff 's face on it - distorted as an islamic prayer leader .
wulff had , however , merely pointed out in an october 3 speech that islam - in addition to christianity and judaism - is part of life in germany . public attention became focused on the first speech given by a german president to the turkish parliament .
wulff did not mince words .
for one , he repeated that islam has become an integral part of germany .
he also demanded that turkey acknowledge that christianity has a place in turkey , and that christians there should be free to worship as they wish .
that included priests being trained in turkey , he said , which is not possible now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha gungor , head of dw 's turkish department wulff did not avoid critical topics , such as turkey 's difficult relationship with cyprus and armenia .
not least , he affirmed israel 's right to exist while demanding an autonomous , viable and democratically ruled palestine .
that was an indirect request for turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to resume dialogue with israel . wulff refrained from making empty promises regarding turkey joining the european union .
shrewdly , clearly and unmistakably , wulff said that regardless of the democratic and economic progress turkey has indeed made , eu membership was not a foregone conclusion . the most distinct messages that wulff addressed to both germans and turks had to do with the need for people of turkish descent in germany to find a place in german society .
it was striking that wulff avoided using the loaded word " integration . "
his call for immigrants to learn the german language had been supported by the turkish president abdullah gul in the run-up to his visit .
and gul did not forget to mention in a joint press conference ahead of wulff 's speech that he was the president of all turkish citizens - those with armenian , jewish and greek roots included - and that all people in turkey should speak turkish . wulff 's five-day state visit will evidently help to minimize misunderstanding between berlin and ankara .
wulff 's manner has been well-received and his cautious words will not be ignored . whether a change of direction in germany 's out-of-control integration debate can be expected remains to be seen ; wulff does not have to win elections anymore . certain politicians , on the other hand , are not likely to pass on the strategy of pitting popular emotions against foreigners and migrants for their election campaigns . author : baha gungor -lrb- sst / rc -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

india is widely viewed as an emerging great power in asia .
the south asian sub-continent is on the rise politically as well as economically .
but india has to cope with several key issues to secure its new-found status . the crisis-torn region of kashmir has experienced one of its bloodiest summers ever .
after a teenager was allegedly killed by indian security forces violence erupted amongst young kashmiris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kashmir has been a bone of contention between india and pakistan for decades more than 100 people have died in the last couple of months in indian-administered kashmir .
the disputed region has been a bone of contention between india and pakistan for the past 60 years , with neither side willing to give an inch .
arch-rivals after the mumbai terror attacks of 2008 , which was planned on pakistani soil , diplomatic relations between the two sides cooled down .
the peace process between india and pakistan came to a standstill .
foreign policy expert raja mohan from delhi says pakistan has more than enough problems of its own .
" right now , pakistan is in a bad shape .
not only because of the floods .
the civilian government has problems , the military has gained a lot more power , " says mohan , " so you have a situation where you have no single authority to negotiate to within pakistan .
so i don ’ t see any prospects for any breakthrough .
unless pakistan itself stabilizes to some extent . "
bildunterschrift : arch-rivals armed to the teeth , also with nuclear weapons the other mighty neighbor and india has to solve its issues with pakistan , says raja mohan - not only because both nations are nuclear powers .
because " there are no great powers which have significant problems with their neighbors .
so therefore resolving the disputes with pakistan is an important one purely from an instrumental perspective , " he explains .
one might think that india has already enough issues to solve with pakistan .
but india also shares a border with china .
both are powerhouses in the region in terms of the size of their respective populations and economies .
as economic relations between the two intensify , political conflicts are on the rise , especially as china becomes more successful and dominant .
strategic game it is a rivalry and partnership .
" since today india ’ s power sector has been already dominated by chinese suppliers .
china is playing a big role in india ’ s telecom industry , " says mohan , " we might even invite chinese companies to build roads in india .
so , on the economic side you see an expansion of the partnership .
more on the political side , in terms of how we look at each other , more in terms of our boundaries our perspective role in asia and in the world there is a problem . "
china is also a close ally of pakistan .
and amidst all of this there is another player : the usa .
in recent years the united states has tried to court india ’ s partnership , also to balance china ’ s growing influence within asia .
india is happy to deepen its relationship with the us , and is even warming up its old ties with russia to fence china in .
and all the time indian policymakers are looking north , over the himalayas , to see what beijing will do next in the big strategic game in asia in the 21st century .

the move comes as his unpopular government is poised to implement painful austerity measures to combat a huge budget deficit . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has announced his biggest cabinet shuffle since taking office in 2004 .
in a nationally televised speech zapatero said that spain needed “ a politically strong ” and experienced government to manage the country ’ s difficult economic situation .
the cabinet shuffle is being seen as an effort to tackle the government ’ s widespread unpopularity in face of painful austerity measures .
zapatero 's government is poised to implement major spending cuts while at the same time raising taxes in an effort to reduce the country 's gaping public deficit and avoid a greek-style debt crisis .
the country ’ s unemployment rate stands at 20 percent - the highest in the european union .
recent opinion polls indicate that the opposition conservative popular party has the most support among the electorate , with a lead of around 15 percentage points over zapatero ’ s socialists . the prime minister 's approval rate has sunk to below 30 percent , the worst since his re-election in 2008 .
unexpected changes the extent of the shuffle came as a surprise as initially the prime minister ’ s office had only announced that labor minister celestine corbacho would be replaced .
his successor is the secretary general for employment , valeriano gomez .
interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba is to replace deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega .
rubalcaba , who is widely seen as a potential successor to zapatero , will however retain his old portfolio . the changes will also see foreign minister miguel angel moratinos be replaced by current health minister trinidad jimenez .
both moratinos and vega have been in office since the socialists won the 2004 elections .
the shuffle will also affect the health and the environment ministries .
the portfolio for housing and equality is being dissolved as part of the efforts to cut government spending .

instead of recreating pre-crisis life , they should stimulate economies so people are n't forced to live off foreign aid . dr. peter walker , the founder of the world disasters report , advocated professionalizing the disaster response business , developing both the global code of conduct for disaster workers and the sphere humanitarian standards .
he is the director of the feinstein international center at tufts university in the united states , and is involved in research into possible future global drivers of humanitarian crises , and the effectiveness of the international humanitarian system . he told deutsche welle about the changes in mentality that he thinks would make development aid more effective over the long-term . deutsche welle : you have put forward the premise that responding to humanitarian crises is becoming more problematic .
what is the problem ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development aid groups need to rethink their strategies , walker said dr. peter walker : i think what 's becoming problematic is the model we use .
the traditional model is that disasters are abnormal .
they knock you down , then you have response , and the response puts people back in a position to carry on with normal life .
just like the way we would recover after a car accident .
but what the research is showing is that as you have more processes that affect the way our economies work - like climate change , globalization , the increase in organized crime - there is a stress on society , and when there 's a crisis it 's much larger than it was in the past and it is much more pervasive .
it actually changes the direction of development and the way society moves forward .
that 's very different from what happened in the past . you almost need to think it 's no longer a temporary thing .
these crises permanently affect large populations and large parts of the economy , so we need to respond differently .
it 's not a sideshow anymore .
it 's actually an integral part of the economies .
that means aid agencies have to change the way they think about disaster response : how they work with local governments , how they can do a lot of work beforehand to try and influence the way governments look at risk reduction in their community . what needs to change ? the analysis that we 've done is that the old notion of quick crisis and long-term development is not quite right .
you have this body of people in the middle who essentially live off what is tantamount to an international social welfare system - in refugee camps , in internally displaced persons camps .
many of the pastoralist populations around the world are in this state , people who are living on the margins of cities and shanty towns , where there 's no obvious way forward in development terms , levels of violence are very high and effectively the main source of livelihood they have is humanitarian assistance .
but that 's just like being drip-fed in a hospital ward .
people do n't want to be in that position .
people are the same the world over .
they want to build a better future for their kids , and so they want to have economic opportunities . you advocate stimulating the economies of conflict-ridden states even as the conflict unfolds .

werder bremen only managed a draw , failing to turn around a poor european campaign start . spanish striker raul scored twice as schalke clinched a win in their champions league group stage encounter against israeli side hapoel tel aviv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul 's compatriot jorado put the game out of reach for hapoel the first goal for schalke came after only three minutes , when a pass from dutchman klaas-jan huntelaar put raul one-on-one with tel aviv keeper vincent enyeama .
raul made no mistake and went on to double his tally after 58 minutes , rolling the ball across the line after an exchange of passes between huntelaar and substitute ivan rakitic .
raul 's fellow spaniard jose manuel jurado secured the win , controlling a high ball into the box to expertly curl the ball into goal .
there was a consolation for hapoel in the final minute of injury time , when forward etey schachter took advantage of a mistake in the schalke defense to score from a simple tap-in , brining the final tally to 3-1 for schalke .
former real madrid man raul is the champions league 's all-time top goal scorer , with the two goals against hapoel taking his competition tally to 68 .

instead of recreating pre-crisis life , they should stimulate economies so people are n't forced to live off foreign aid . dr. peter walker , the founder of the world disasters report , advocated professionalizing the disaster response business , developing both the global code of conduct for disaster workers and the sphere humanitarian standards .
he is the director of the feinstein international center at tufts university in the united states , and is involved in research into possible future global drivers of humanitarian crises , and the effectiveness of the international humanitarian system . he told deutsche welle about the changes in mentality that he thinks would make development aid more effective over the long-term . deutsche welle : you have put forward the premise that responding to humanitarian crises is becoming more problematic .
what is the problem ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development aid groups need to rethink their strategies , walker said dr. peter walker : i think what 's becoming problematic is the model we use .
the traditional model is that disasters are abnormal .
they knock you down , then you have response , and the response puts people back in a position to carry on with normal life .
just like the way we would recover after a car accident .
but what the research is showing is that as you have more processes that affect the way our economies work - like climate change , globalization , the increase in organized crime - there is a stress on society , and when there 's a crisis it 's much larger than it was in the past and it is much more pervasive .
it actually changes the direction of development and the way society moves forward .
that 's very different from what happened in the past . you almost need to think it 's no longer a temporary thing .
these crises permanently affect large populations and large parts of the economy , so we need to respond differently .
it 's not a sideshow anymore .
it 's actually an integral part of the economies .
that means aid agencies have to change the way they think about disaster response : how they work with local governments , how they can do a lot of work beforehand to try and influence the way governments look at risk reduction in their community . what needs to change ? the analysis that we 've done is that the old notion of quick crisis and long-term development is not quite right .
you have this body of people in the middle who essentially live off what is tantamount to an international social welfare system - in refugee camps , in internally displaced persons camps .
many of the pastoralist populations around the world are in this state , people who are living on the margins of cities and shanty towns , where there 's no obvious way forward in development terms , levels of violence are very high and effectively the main source of livelihood they have is humanitarian assistance .
but that 's just like being drip-fed in a hospital ward .
people do n't want to be in that position .
people are the same the world over .
they want to build a better future for their kids , and so they want to have economic opportunities . you advocate stimulating the economies of conflict-ridden states even as the conflict unfolds .
is that feasible ? i think we have really got to look again at how we work in these crisis situations .
you ca n't wait for stability before you start development .
somalia has n't been stable for 20 years ; it is not going to be stable .
that 's the reality .
so do you do development there ?
that 's really what agencies should be focusing on – how do you stimulate an economy in high levels of violence so that people have an opportunity . can you really stimulate an economy in times of violence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enabling trade would help those suffering in darfur the answer is yes , you can stimulate economies in crisis situations .

in an attempt to get the uk back on track , the chancellor of the exchequer has announced new austerity measures , including half a million job cuts . british chancellor of the exchequer george osborne used a speech to the house of commons on wednesday to announce his country 's biggest public spending cuts since world war ii .
the chancellor outlined budget cuts to the tune of seven billion pounds -lrb- eight billion euros , $ 11 billion -rrb- as well as projected spending reductions of 81 billion pounds over four years .
" today is the day when britain steps back from the brink , when we confront the bills from a decade of debt , " osborne said , to cheers from the government benches in the house .
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- a day of rebuilding , when we set out a four-year plan to put our public services and welfare state on a sustainable footing for the long term , " he added .
slashing the budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans major spending cuts the conservative chancellor outlined wide-reaching austerity measures , including a drop in police budgets , a 24-percent cut in spending by the foreign office and an increase in the state pension age from 65 to 66 in 2020 - six years earlier than previously planned .
the government also intends to slash welfare spending by making changes to incapacity and housing benefits .
the opposition labour party meanwhile accused osborne of playing with people 's futures , with half a million public sector jobs expected to be lost .
while britain has remained true to its overseas aid pledges and increased spending on schools and the national health service , it will now make cuts to departmental budgets at an average of just under 20 percent .
job cuts ' reckless ' reining in spending means cutting some 490,000 public sector jobs , according to the office for budgetary responsibility .
the chancellor said he regretted that many would lose their jobs , but that it " is unavoidable when the country runs out of money . "
shadow chancellor alan johnson came out against the proposed job cuts , saying they were " reckless " and that the british people would suffer .
" today is the day that abstract figures and spread-sheets turn into people 's futures , people 's jobs , people 's services , their prospects for the future , " johnson said .
deficit triples disaster rates but the coalition government has laid blame for the cuts at the door of the previous labour administration for running up significant debts .
they insist that action must be taken now , and rapidly , if investor confidence in the british economy is to be restored .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the queen 's allowance will be affected by budget cuts the sheer size of britain 's debts makes cuts necessary , according to dr. andrew lilico , chief economist at right-of-center think tank policy exchange .
" running a deficit of around 10 percent of gdp is just way off the mark , " lilico said , adding that " within europe there are restrictions under treaty rules that say they should have deficits of no more than three percent of gdp . "
" we 're running a deficit well over three times as much as what was previously thought to be the absolute maximum that you should be running even in a disaster scenario , " lilico added .
unions plan to put up a fight trade unions , meanwhile , are promising to fight public sector job losses and have threatened widespread industrial action .
already on wednesday , protesters descended on westminster to express their disapproval of the austerity measures .
eighty-one billion pounds worth of cuts over four years represent an approximate halving of britain 's budget deficit .
the coalition government claims this will restore the economy to health , although opponents argue the measures may have the opposite effect , plunging britain back into recession .

etna was the first location to be imaged four months after the second of the two satellites was launched , a satellite tandem is in position and has begun its mission of taking high-resolution photographs of the earth 's surface . the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- announced tuesday that its two satellites currently flying in tight formation around the earth have acquired their first detailed image of the earth 's surface .
the new image details mt .
etna , on the eastern coast of sicily , in italy 's southern island province . the satellites , tandem-x and terrasar-x launched in june 2010 and june 2007 , respectively , are currently flying just 350 meters -lrb- 1,100 feet -rrb- apart on a mission to photograph the surface of the planet in unprecedented detail . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the satellite measure the same points from two angles using a process called bistatic radar , the satellites send microwave pulses from their approximate 500-kilometer orbits to earth and measure how long it takes for pulses to bounce back from the earth .
then the satellites ' on-board computers determine the height of the ground surveyed .
german space authorities said the level of accuracy this method produces is unprecedented . " processing the bistatic pairs of data is a big challenge , " thomas fritz , a dlr processing engineer , said in a statement .

along for the ride is defense minister theodor zu guttenberg 's wife , who co-hosts the show . the man 's face and body is completely pixilated .
his voice is distorted .
but it 's easy enough to see what this guy wants .
he 's had the windows of his car tinted so no one can see inside .
no one will notice them when they 're out in the woods , anyway , he tells his companion , who he thinks is just 13 years old .
this is " tatort internet , " a new television show that uses fake chat usernames to trick men into thinking they 're talking with young girls or boys and set up a meeting .
then they secretly film the encounter and confront the man with his inappropriate messages , the inappropriate photos he 's sent and his inappropriate intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister says the show could put innocent people at risk the show is co-hosted by stephanie zu guttenberg , the wife of german defense minister theodor zu guttenberg .
that did n't stop fellow cabinet member and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from expressing her distaste for the show to the newspaper passauer neue presse .
" there 's the risk that innocent people are being publicly condemned , " she said .
" the german legal system does n't have to resort to mob justice . "
one man featured on the show was identified and then fired from his job where he worked with teens .
he subsequently went missing for several days and his colleagues and family said they feared he may have killed himself .
he has since resurfaced .
paula honkanen-schoberth , director of the german league for child protection , told deutsche welle that she was also worried about the vigilante aspect of the television show .
" of course we think that sexual abuse is a severe crime and must be prosecuted in all possible , but legal ways , " she said .
" but in germany we live under the rule of law , and that is why we regard the criminal prosecution as a matter for the police .
and television is not the police .
and should n't act like it is . "
getting the safety message to teens what needs to be done , honkanen-schoberth said , is to get parents talking with their kids about staying safe online .
they should tell them not to give out their name and address or to meet up with strangers alone .
they should let them know they can always come to them if someone is threatening them or pressuring them to do something they do n't want to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents must talk with their children about staying safe online , says honkanen-schoberth honkanen-schoberth said she would welcome a show that addressed these things .
but media expert jo groeber from the german digital institute says the show itself could be a revolutionary way to inform young people about the dangers of the internet and chatting with adult strangers .
" it 's entertaining , it 's even , i 'm afraid to say it , thrilling , " he said .
" it 's probably tasteless , but it reaches the audience . "
one concern he does have , he said , is whether the show 's producers know of potential abusers for months at time before informing the police .
the guttenberg image stephanie zu guttenberg 's presence on the show comes as her husband 's political star gets brighter and brighter .
there 's even been speculation that he could become the country 's next chancellor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephanie zu guttenberg 's role in the show could affect her husband 's career in a survey by the forsa research institute released on wednesday , 25 percent of those surveyed said the defense minister would make a better chancellor than his boss , chancellor angela merkel .
this new role for stephanie zu guttenberg will only enhance her husband 's image , according to groebel .
" let 's be honest , the partner of a high-ranking politician is usually on the safe side .
they 're involved in charity work , but they never take any risks , " he said .
" i think the fact that she 's taking a risk will strengthen his image , as the husband of a completely independent wife . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 20.10.2010 debate about islam in germany heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has seen a rise in anti-islamic feeling germany 's top-selling non-fiction bestseller is a book that attacks islam - and the german president ca n't get the public to agree with him when he says that islam is part of germany . thilo sarrazin , former state finance minister in berlin and just a short time ago on the board of the german central bank , has written a bestseller : " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany is doing away with itself " -rrb- .
he predicts a dire future for the country and he blames it above all on islam and the uncontrolled immigration of muslims .
most muslims have different values than the germans , he writes .
they ostensibly hold god higher than the constitutional state and democracy .
this is the reason , he claims , why germany will gradually do away with itself if it does n't carry out an active immigration and integration debate .
sarrazin 's arguments are meeting with a great deal of support .
but he is also encountering opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book has sparked much of the recent debate michael bommes , a sociologist teaching at the university of osnabrueck , notes that the current debate about islam shows that most people have still to grasp the fact that germany has long since become a country of immigrants , with a correspondingly complex diversity of values and viewpoints .
" through modern international immigration , world religions such as islam have now arrived in europe , " says bommes .
he argues that muslims have to adjust to this situation , as do the citizens of other european nations .
the relationships between politics , law and religion have to be rethought , he says .
people have always had to find compromises over these three elements .
and islam is making this necessary once more in today 's world .
fear of headscarves and mosques many germans are worried because they see their way of life being called into question by the presence of islam .
they find the headscarves and veils worn by muslim women particularly offensive .
they raise the possibility that these women are being oppressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic headwear is viewed with suspicion by many europeans such concerns are also evident in the results of a study recently published by the friedrich ebert foundation .
oliver decker , who led the study , speaks of a " very distinct increase from 34 percent to over half the population who agree with statements hostile to islam . "
many germans are also skeptical with regard to the building of new mosques , he says .
where do these negative appraisals of islam come from ?
islam scholar navid kermani believes that germans see their identity being threatened .
identity , he explains , is formed when we distinguish ourselves from other groups .
every social group defines itself by how it differs from other groups .
that 's why , he argues , it seems logical to keep one 's distance from islam .
after all , westerners tend to be unfamiliar with islamic symbols , making the religion seem especially alien .
the process of differentiation itself is then only natural .
but it becomes problematic when those who are different are declared to be the enemy .
a sometimes superficial discussion seen in this light , there is nothing reprehensible about the debate on islam .
it seems to reflect primarily the struggle for a new german self-image and the difficulties connected with the fact that germany has indeed become a country of immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western impressions of islam may be too simplistic nevertheless , political scientist claus leggewie contends that the discussions about islam are often conducted on too superficial a level .
most people make little distinction between the various currents within islam .
nor do they make sufficient allowance for the differences between moderate and radical muslims .
" i believe that most europeans tend to develop a rather schematic image of islam , " says leggewie .
he finds it astounding that europeans , who do so much travelling and know the world so well , whose opinions on all other issues are so carefully formed and objective , are often so quick to make superficial judgments when it comes to islam .
but the debate on islam did n't exactly appear out of thin air , either .
it stems from the fact that religion has regained a great deal of power in the middle east itself .
of course people in germany have taken note of this resurgence , explains navid kermani .
the problem is that , in the muslim world as well , many issues are being viewed through a religious lens .
for many years , religion played no role on the political front there .
now all that has changed .
and germany feels threatened , fearing an increasing powerful cocktail of religion and politics here as well .
islam as a way of helping to define europe first and foremost , the battle about islam is an inner-german struggle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate may ultimately be about how international germany should be it 's about how open germany and the germans want to be .
since the end of the nazi dictatorship , germans have agonized about their history , and have developed a troubled relationship with their national identity .
whoever makes a statement about islam , says claus leggewie , is also indirectly speaking out on an entirely different issue - namely , how international germany should be .
" there are islamophobic tendencies on the one side and islamophile leanings on the other , " says leggewie .
" and , as we know , they have historically very frequently been interrelated , even when they seem on the outside to be diametrically opposed .
this very obviously means that islam continues to play an essential role in our construction of what europe means , i.e. in the collective identity of the europeans . "

he predicts a dire future for the country and he blames it above all on islam and the uncontrolled immigration of muslims .
most muslims have different values than the germans , he writes .
they ostensibly hold god higher than the constitutional state and democracy .
this is the reason , he claims , why germany will gradually do away with itself if it does n't carry out an active immigration and integration debate .
sarrazin 's arguments are meeting with a great deal of support .
but he is also encountering opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book has sparked much of the recent debate michael bommes , a sociologist teaching at the university of osnabrueck , notes that the current debate about islam shows that most people have still to grasp the fact that germany has long since become a country of immigrants , with a correspondingly complex diversity of values and viewpoints .
" through modern international immigration , world religions such as islam have now arrived in europe , " says bommes .
he argues that muslims have to adjust to this situation , as do the citizens of other european nations .
the relationships between politics , law and religion have to be rethought , he says .
people have always had to find compromises over these three elements .
and islam is making this necessary once more in today 's world .
fear of headscarves and mosques many germans are worried because they see their way of life being called into question by the presence of islam .
they find the headscarves and veils worn by muslim women particularly offensive .
they raise the possibility that these women are being oppressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic headwear is viewed with suspicion by many europeans such concerns are also evident in the results of a study recently published by the friedrich ebert foundation .
oliver decker , who led the study , speaks of a " very distinct increase from 34 percent to over half the population who agree with statements hostile to islam . "
many germans are also skeptical with regard to the building of new mosques , he says .
where do these negative appraisals of islam come from ?
islam scholar navid kermani believes that germans see their identity being threatened .
identity , he explains , is formed when we distinguish ourselves from other groups .
every social group defines itself by how it differs from other groups .
that 's why , he argues , it seems logical to keep one 's distance from islam .
after all , westerners tend to be unfamiliar with islamic symbols , making the religion seem especially alien .
the process of differentiation itself is then only natural .
but it becomes problematic when those who are different are declared to be the enemy .
a sometimes superficial discussion seen in this light , there is nothing reprehensible about the debate on islam .
it seems to reflect primarily the struggle for a new german self-image and the difficulties connected with the fact that germany has indeed become a country of immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western impressions of islam may be too simplistic nevertheless , political scientist claus leggewie contends that the discussions about islam are often conducted on too superficial a level .
most people make little distinction between the various currents within islam .
nor do they make sufficient allowance for the differences between moderate and radical muslims .
" i believe that most europeans tend to develop a rather schematic image of islam , " says leggewie .
he finds it astounding that europeans , who do so much travelling and know the world so well , whose opinions on all other issues are so carefully formed and objective , are often so quick to make superficial judgments when it comes to islam .
but the debate on islam did n't exactly appear out of thin air , either .
it stems from the fact that religion has regained a great deal of power in the middle east itself .
of course people in germany have taken note of this resurgence , explains navid kermani .
the problem is that , in the muslim world as well , many issues are being viewed through a religious lens .
for many years , religion played no role on the political front there .
now all that has changed .
and germany feels threatened , fearing an increasing powerful cocktail of religion and politics here as well .
islam as a way of helping to define europe first and foremost , the battle about islam is an inner-german struggle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate may ultimately be about how international germany should be it 's about how open germany and the germans want to be .
since the end of the nazi dictatorship , germans have agonized about their history , and have developed a troubled relationship with their national identity .
whoever makes a statement about islam , says claus leggewie , is also indirectly speaking out on an entirely different issue - namely , how international germany should be .
" there are islamophobic tendencies on the one side and islamophile leanings on the other , " says leggewie .
" and , as we know , they have historically very frequently been interrelated , even when they seem on the outside to be diametrically opposed .
this very obviously means that islam continues to play an essential role in our construction of what europe means , i.e. in the collective identity of the europeans . "

in an attempt to get the uk back on track , the chancellor of the exchequer has announced new austerity measures , including half a million job cuts . british chancellor of the exchequer george osborne used a speech to the house of commons on wednesday to announce his country 's biggest public spending cuts since world war ii .
the chancellor outlined budget cuts to the tune of seven billion pounds -lrb- eight billion euros , $ 11 billion -rrb- as well as projected spending reductions of 81 billion pounds over four years .
" today is the day when britain steps back from the brink , when we confront the bills from a decade of debt , " osborne said , to cheers from the government benches in the house .
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- a day of rebuilding , when we set out a four-year plan to put our public services and welfare state on a sustainable footing for the long term , " he added .
slashing the budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans major spending cuts the conservative chancellor outlined wide-reaching austerity measures , including a drop in police budgets , a 24-percent cut in spending by the foreign office and an increase in the state pension age from 65 to 66 in 2020 - six years earlier than previously planned .
the government also intends to slash welfare spending by making changes to incapacity and housing benefits .
the opposition labour party meanwhile accused osborne of playing with people 's futures , with half a million public sector jobs expected to be lost .
while britain has remained true to its overseas aid pledges and increased spending on schools and the national health service , it will now make cuts to departmental budgets at an average of just under 20 percent .
job cuts ' reckless ' reining in spending means cutting some 490,000 public sector jobs , according to the office for budgetary responsibility .
the chancellor said he regretted that many would lose their jobs , but that it " is unavoidable when the country runs out of money . "
shadow chancellor alan johnson came out against the proposed job cuts , saying they were " reckless " and that the british people would suffer .
" today is the day that abstract figures and spread-sheets turn into people 's futures , people 's jobs , people 's services , their prospects for the future , " johnson said .
deficit triples disaster rates but the coalition government has laid blame for the cuts at the door of the previous labour administration for running up significant debts .
they insist that action must be taken now , and rapidly , if investor confidence in the british economy is to be restored .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the queen 's allowance will be affected by budget cuts the sheer size of britain 's debts makes cuts necessary , according to dr. andrew lilico , chief economist at right-of-center think tank policy exchange .
" running a deficit of around 10 percent of gdp is just way off the mark , " lilico said , adding that " within europe there are restrictions under treaty rules that say they should have deficits of no more than three percent of gdp . "
" we 're running a deficit well over three times as much as what was previously thought to be the absolute maximum that you should be running even in a disaster scenario , " lilico added .
unions plan to put up a fight trade unions , meanwhile , are promising to fight public sector job losses and have threatened widespread industrial action .
already on wednesday , protesters descended on westminster to express their disapproval of the austerity measures .
eighty-one billion pounds worth of cuts over four years represent an approximate halving of britain 's budget deficit .
the coalition government claims this will restore the economy to health , although opponents argue the measures may have the opposite effect , plunging britain back into recession .

in an attempt to get the uk back on track , the chancellor of the exchequer has announced new austerity measures , including half a million job cuts . british chancellor of the exchequer george osborne used a speech to the house of commons on wednesday to announce his country 's biggest public spending cuts since world war ii .
the chancellor outlined budget cuts to the tune of seven billion pounds -lrb- eight billion euros , $ 11 billion -rrb- as well as projected spending reductions of 81 billion pounds over four years .
" today is the day when britain steps back from the brink , when we confront the bills from a decade of debt , " osborne said , to cheers from the government benches in the house .
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- a day of rebuilding , when we set out a four-year plan to put our public services and welfare state on a sustainable footing for the long term , " he added .
slashing the budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans major spending cuts the conservative chancellor outlined wide-reaching austerity measures , including a drop in police budgets , a 24-percent cut in spending by the foreign office and an increase in the state pension age from 65 to 66 in 2020 - six years earlier than previously planned .
the government also intends to slash welfare spending by making changes to incapacity and housing benefits .
the opposition labour party meanwhile accused osborne of playing with people 's futures , with half a million public sector jobs expected to be lost .
while britain has remained true to its overseas aid pledges and increased spending on schools and the national health service , it will now make cuts to departmental budgets at an average of just under 20 percent .
job cuts ' reckless ' reining in spending means cutting some 490,000 public sector jobs , according to the office for budgetary responsibility .
the chancellor said he regretted that many would lose their jobs , but that it " is unavoidable when the country runs out of money . "
shadow chancellor alan johnson came out against the proposed job cuts , saying they were " reckless " and that the british people would suffer .
" today is the day that abstract figures and spread-sheets turn into people 's futures , people 's jobs , people 's services , their prospects for the future , " johnson said .
deficit triples disaster rates but the coalition government has laid blame for the cuts at the door of the previous labour administration for running up significant debts .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the queen 's allowance will be affected by budget cuts the sheer size of britain 's debts makes cuts necessary , according to dr. andrew lilico , chief economist at right-of-center think tank policy exchange .
" running a deficit of around 10 percent of gdp is just way off the mark , " lilico said , adding that " within europe there are restrictions under treaty rules that say they should have deficits of no more than three percent of gdp . "
" we 're running a deficit well over three times as much as what was previously thought to be the absolute maximum that you should be running even in a disaster scenario , " lilico added .
unions plan to put up a fight trade unions , meanwhile , are promising to fight public sector job losses and have threatened widespread industrial action .
already on wednesday , protesters descended on westminster to express their disapproval of the austerity measures .
eighty-one billion pounds worth of cuts over four years represent an approximate halving of britain 's budget deficit .
the coalition government claims this will restore the economy to health , although opponents argue the measures may have the opposite effect , plunging britain back into recession .

the chancellor said he regretted that many would lose their jobs , but that it " is unavoidable when the country runs out of money . "
shadow chancellor alan johnson came out against the proposed job cuts , saying they were " reckless " and that the british people would suffer .
" today is the day that abstract figures and spread-sheets turn into people 's futures , people 's jobs , people 's services , their prospects for the future , " johnson said .
deficit triples disaster rates but the coalition government has laid blame for the cuts at the door of the previous labour administration for running up significant debts .
they insist that action must be taken now , and rapidly , if investor confidence in the british economy is to be restored .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the queen 's allowance will be affected by budget cuts the sheer size of britain 's debts makes cuts necessary , according to dr. andrew lilico , chief economist at right-of-center think tank policy exchange .
" running a deficit of around 10 percent of gdp is just way off the mark , " lilico said , adding that " within europe there are restrictions under treaty rules that say they should have deficits of no more than three percent of gdp . "
" we 're running a deficit well over three times as much as what was previously thought to be the absolute maximum that you should be running even in a disaster scenario , " lilico added .
unions plan to put up a fight trade unions , meanwhile , are promising to fight public sector job losses and have threatened widespread industrial action .
already on wednesday , protesters descended on westminster to express their disapproval of the austerity measures .
eighty-one billion pounds worth of cuts over four years represent an approximate halving of britain 's budget deficit .
the coalition government claims this will restore the economy to health , although opponents argue the measures may have the opposite effect , plunging britain back into recession .

but it is facing an uphill battle to win support for the idea , with opposition being spearheaded by germany , france and britain . the european commission 's proposal to introduce a europe-wide value-added tax is being met with stiff resistance from the 27-member bloc 's economic powerhouses , germany , france and britain .
the commission wants to introduce direct taxation from brussels for the 2014-2020 budget due to fears that cash-strapped governments may want to reduce their contributions to the bloc .
" at times where public spending is under pressure , we suggest ways to achieve a european budget that is up to the challenges we are facing collectively , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso .
among the eu executive 's proposals are the creation of a separate value-added tax , an eu energy tax or an eu corporate income tax .
under the current system , the eu raises about three quarters of its budget from national government contributions .
" this is not such a bad system because the national governments have a strong incentive to press for fiscal discipline in brussels , " professor friedrich heinemann of the centre for european economic research in mannheim told deutsche welle fears of eu expansion heinemann thinks the move is aimed at expanding the eu 's budget .
" why has the european commission been pressing so hard for years and even decades for a european tax ? " he asked . " it 's about preparing a more aggressive expansion of the budget .
this is a central interest of the european commission and the idea is to let the eu budget grow . "
those in favor of the tax believe it will create more transparency and add value to european decisions by giving europe real power to pool its resources to work on special projects .
" i do n't want the eu to deal with the size and shape of bananas .
i would like the eu to create value added at the european level , with things like large research projects , " henrik enderlein , professor of political economy at the hertie school of governance in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the eu can only do if it has this autonomous spending and taxing capacity , " he added critics are worried about tax increases .
the recent recession and debt crisis has already forced national governments to cut budgets and raise taxes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european wide vat could hit consumers but enderlein does n't think this will necessarily lead to more taxation .
he says that germany knows exactly which proportion of its tax is sent to europe and the european parliament could effectively replace this .
he argues that the elected european parliament would provide adequate democratic controls .
" look at the united states : in every state there is a different value added tax and that works perfectly well and so there can be taxation at different levels and i do n't see why this would n't function in the european union , " he told deutsche welle . observers say it is unlikely that such a form of direct taxation will be passed by the eu anytime soon , but enderlein thinks that it 's inevitable that countries sharing a single currency will eventually want to have taxation at european level .
" the process of eu integration is a process of unlikely events ultimately taking place .
nobody thought the single currency would appear or that borders would be abolished , but we saw all of these happen , " enderlein told deutsche welle .
to be adopted , any proposal must be approved by the eu 's member states and the european parliament .
the european commission plans to present proposed legislation by july of next year .

" this is not such a bad system because the national governments have a strong incentive to press for fiscal discipline in brussels , " professor friedrich heinemann of the centre for european economic research in mannheim told deutsche welle fears of eu expansion heinemann thinks the move is aimed at expanding the eu 's budget .
" why has the european commission been pressing so hard for years and even decades for a european tax ? " he asked . " it 's about preparing a more aggressive expansion of the budget .
this is a central interest of the european commission and the idea is to let the eu budget grow . "
those in favor of the tax believe it will create more transparency and add value to european decisions by giving europe real power to pool its resources to work on special projects .
" i do n't want the eu to deal with the size and shape of bananas .
i would like the eu to create value added at the european level , with things like large research projects , " henrik enderlein , professor of political economy at the hertie school of governance in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the eu can only do if it has this autonomous spending and taxing capacity , " he added critics are worried about tax increases .
the recent recession and debt crisis has already forced national governments to cut budgets and raise taxes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european wide vat could hit consumers but enderlein does n't think this will necessarily lead to more taxation .
he says that germany knows exactly which proportion of its tax is sent to europe and the european parliament could effectively replace this .
he argues that the elected european parliament would provide adequate democratic controls .
" look at the united states : in every state there is a different value added tax and that works perfectly well and so there can be taxation at different levels and i do n't see why this would n't function in the european union , " he told deutsche welle . observers say it is unlikely that such a form of direct taxation will be passed by the eu anytime soon , but enderlein thinks that it 's inevitable that countries sharing a single currency will eventually want to have taxation at european level .
" the process of eu integration is a process of unlikely events ultimately taking place .
nobody thought the single currency would appear or that borders would be abolished , but we saw all of these happen , " enderlein told deutsche welle .
to be adopted , any proposal must be approved by the eu 's member states and the european parliament .
the european commission plans to present proposed legislation by july of next year .

but it is facing an uphill battle to win support for the idea , with opposition being spearheaded by germany , france and britain . the european commission 's proposal to introduce a europe-wide value-added tax is being met with stiff resistance from the 27-member bloc 's economic powerhouses , germany , france and britain .
the commission wants to introduce direct taxation from brussels for the 2014-2020 budget due to fears that cash-strapped governments may want to reduce their contributions to the bloc .
" at times where public spending is under pressure , we suggest ways to achieve a european budget that is up to the challenges we are facing collectively , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso .
among the eu executive 's proposals are the creation of a separate value-added tax , an eu energy tax or an eu corporate income tax .
under the current system , the eu raises about three quarters of its budget from national government contributions .

the disputed region has been a bone of contention between india and pakistan for the past 60 years , with neither side willing to give an inch .
arch-rivals after the mumbai terror attacks of 2008 , which was planned on pakistani soil , diplomatic relations between the two sides cooled down .
the peace process between india and pakistan came to a standstill .
foreign policy expert raja mohan from delhi says pakistan has more than enough problems of its own .
" right now , pakistan is in a bad shape .
not only because of the floods .
the civilian government has problems , the military has gained a lot more power , " says mohan , " so you have a situation where you have no single authority to negotiate to within pakistan .
so i don ’ t see any prospects for any breakthrough .
unless pakistan itself stabilizes to some extent . "

" since today india ’ s power sector has been already dominated by chinese suppliers .
china is playing a big role in india ’ s telecom industry , " says mohan , " we might even invite chinese companies to build roads in india .
so , on the economic side you see an expansion of the partnership .
more on the political side , in terms of how we look at each other , more in terms of our boundaries our perspective role in asia and in the world there is a problem . "
china is also a close ally of pakistan .
and amidst all of this there is another player : the usa .
in recent years the united states has tried to court india ’ s partnership , also to balance china ’ s growing influence within asia .
india is happy to deepen its relationship with the us , and is even warming up its old ties with russia to fence china in .
and all the time indian policymakers are looking north , over the himalayas , to see what beijing will do next in the big strategic game in asia in the 21st century .

included in the resolution are 700 million euros to help educate poor children . the german cabinet on wednesday approved proposed legislation that would reform state benefits for the long-term unemployed .
the new policy would see the basic welfare payments , known as hartz iv , raised to 364 euros -lrb- $ 505 -rrb- per adult recipient per month - a five euro increase over the current rate .
in order to satisfy a constitutional court ruling , the bill must be passed into law by year 's end .
chancellor merkel 's center-right coalition government does n't have a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , and the opposition has said that it will only approve the bill if signifigant amendments are made .
merkel defends reforms against criticism since chancellor merkel 's center-right coalition government unveiled its proposals last month , opposition parties have criticized the increase as being too small .
" a failure to massively raise -lsb- welfare -rsb- rates will mean a permanent state of poverty and marginalization , " said gregor gysi , the head of the left party 's parliamentary group .
the chancellor meanwhile defended the welfare reforms .
" hartz iv is not a way of life , " merkel said in berlin on wednesday , adding that the payments were " meant as a bridge back to employment . "

yet opponents say the education package is not enough either .
gysi said it was " not enough to finance a sports club or a music school and certainly not remedial courses . "
chancellor merkel expressed some sympathy for welfare beneficiaries , saying , " i know that -lsb- these cuts -rsb- can be hard .
but there must be some motivation to go back to work . "
the new regulation needs to be passed into law before the end of the year , to satisfy a court ruling that deemed the way the payments have been calculated up until now to be unconstitutional . the government hopes to be able to implement the reforms on january 1 , 2011 .
labor minister ursula von der leyen called on all parties to work together in order to make the reform work , saying that the “ this tight deadline means we all have to take responsibility . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 20.10.2010 new television show confronts men looking for underage relationships großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the online world can be a dangerous place for children critics say a new television show that catches men chatting with teens about sex and then meeting up with them is mob justice .
along for the ride is defense minister theodor zu guttenberg 's wife , who co-hosts the show . the man 's face and body is completely pixilated .
his voice is distorted .
but it 's easy enough to see what this guy wants .
he 's had the windows of his car tinted so no one can see inside .
no one will notice them when they 're out in the woods , anyway , he tells his companion , who he thinks is just 13 years old .
this is " tatort internet , " a new television show that uses fake chat usernames to trick men into thinking they 're talking with young girls or boys and set up a meeting .
then they secretly film the encounter and confront the man with his inappropriate messages , the inappropriate photos he 's sent and his inappropriate intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister says the show could put innocent people at risk the show is co-hosted by stephanie zu guttenberg , the wife of german defense minister theodor zu guttenberg .
that did n't stop fellow cabinet member and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from expressing her distaste for the show to the newspaper passauer neue presse .
" there 's the risk that innocent people are being publicly condemned , " she said .
" the german legal system does n't have to resort to mob justice . "
one man featured on the show was identified and then fired from his job where he worked with teens .
he subsequently went missing for several days and his colleagues and family said they feared he may have killed himself .
he has since resurfaced .
paula honkanen-schoberth , director of the german league for child protection , told deutsche welle that she was also worried about the vigilante aspect of the television show .
" of course we think that sexual abuse is a severe crime and must be prosecuted in all possible , but legal ways , " she said .
" but in germany we live under the rule of law , and that is why we regard the criminal prosecution as a matter for the police .
and television is not the police .
and should n't act like it is . "
getting the safety message to teens what needs to be done , honkanen-schoberth said , is to get parents talking with their kids about staying safe online .
they should tell them not to give out their name and address or to meet up with strangers alone .
they should let them know they can always come to them if someone is threatening them or pressuring them to do something they do n't want to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents must talk with their children about staying safe online , says honkanen-schoberth honkanen-schoberth said she would welcome a show that addressed these things .
but media expert jo groeber from the german digital institute says the show itself could be a revolutionary way to inform young people about the dangers of the internet and chatting with adult strangers .
" it 's entertaining , it 's even , i 'm afraid to say it , thrilling , " he said .
" it 's probably tasteless , but it reaches the audience . "
one concern he does have , he said , is whether the show 's producers know of potential abusers for months at time before informing the police .
the guttenberg image stephanie zu guttenberg 's presence on the show comes as her husband 's political star gets brighter and brighter .
there 's even been speculation that he could become the country 's next chancellor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephanie zu guttenberg 's role in the show could affect her husband 's career in a survey by the forsa research institute released on wednesday , 25 percent of those surveyed said the defense minister would make a better chancellor than his boss , chancellor angela merkel .
this new role for stephanie zu guttenberg will only enhance her husband 's image , according to groebel .
" let 's be honest , the partner of a high-ranking politician is usually on the safe side .
they 're involved in charity work , but they never take any risks , " he said .
" i think the fact that she 's taking a risk will strengthen his image , as the husband of a completely independent wife . "

along for the ride is defense minister theodor zu guttenberg 's wife , who co-hosts the show . the man 's face and body is completely pixilated .
his voice is distorted .
but it 's easy enough to see what this guy wants .
he 's had the windows of his car tinted so no one can see inside .
no one will notice them when they 're out in the woods , anyway , he tells his companion , who he thinks is just 13 years old .
this is " tatort internet , " a new television show that uses fake chat usernames to trick men into thinking they 're talking with young girls or boys and set up a meeting .
then they secretly film the encounter and confront the man with his inappropriate messages , the inappropriate photos he 's sent and his inappropriate intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister says the show could put innocent people at risk the show is co-hosted by stephanie zu guttenberg , the wife of german defense minister theodor zu guttenberg .
that did n't stop fellow cabinet member and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from expressing her distaste for the show to the newspaper passauer neue presse .
" there 's the risk that innocent people are being publicly condemned , " she said .
" the german legal system does n't have to resort to mob justice . "
one man featured on the show was identified and then fired from his job where he worked with teens .
he subsequently went missing for several days and his colleagues and family said they feared he may have killed himself .
he has since resurfaced .
paula honkanen-schoberth , director of the german league for child protection , told deutsche welle that she was also worried about the vigilante aspect of the television show .
" of course we think that sexual abuse is a severe crime and must be prosecuted in all possible , but legal ways , " she said .
" but in germany we live under the rule of law , and that is why we regard the criminal prosecution as a matter for the police .
and television is not the police .
and should n't act like it is . "
getting the safety message to teens what needs to be done , honkanen-schoberth said , is to get parents talking with their kids about staying safe online .
they should tell them not to give out their name and address or to meet up with strangers alone .
they should let them know they can always come to them if someone is threatening them or pressuring them to do something they do n't want to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents must talk with their children about staying safe online , says honkanen-schoberth honkanen-schoberth said she would welcome a show that addressed these things .
but media expert jo groeber from the german digital institute says the show itself could be a revolutionary way to inform young people about the dangers of the internet and chatting with adult strangers .
" it 's entertaining , it 's even , i 'm afraid to say it , thrilling , " he said .
" it 's probably tasteless , but it reaches the audience . "
one concern he does have , he said , is whether the show 's producers know of potential abusers for months at time before informing the police .
the guttenberg image stephanie zu guttenberg 's presence on the show comes as her husband 's political star gets brighter and brighter .
there 's even been speculation that he could become the country 's next chancellor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephanie zu guttenberg 's role in the show could affect her husband 's career in a survey by the forsa research institute released on wednesday , 25 percent of those surveyed said the defense minister would make a better chancellor than his boss , chancellor angela merkel .
this new role for stephanie zu guttenberg will only enhance her husband 's image , according to groebel .
" let 's be honest , the partner of a high-ranking politician is usually on the safe side .
they 're involved in charity work , but they never take any risks , " he said .
" i think the fact that she 's taking a risk will strengthen his image , as the husband of a completely independent wife . "

now the eu 's executive is considering a ban of the drug called meow meow . the european commission on wednesday called for a ban of the party drug , mephedrone , also known as " meow meow , " which has hallucinogenic effects similar to ecstasy . while the drug is illegal in 15 of the european union 's 27-memberbloc , including germany , estonia and romania , it remains legal in others , including spain , portugal , and greece .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de caucasus -pipe- 20.10.2010 chechnya still a long way from stability , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya has been in a state of crisis since the fall of the soviet union tuesday 's dramatic raid on the chechen parliament was a blow to russian claims that chechnya has been pacified .
commentators believe that only a change of policy can end the long years of violence and unrest . the kremlin remained bullish after the separatist attack on the chechen parliament in grozny on tuesday , in which three people were killed .
" as always , they -lrb- the militants -rrb- failed , " russian interior minister rashid nurgaliyev said at a televized meeting at the local interior ministry .
the minister , by coincidence on a trip to grozny , said the chechen gunmen were intercepted by interior ministry troops , and that the operation by the security forces to free the deputies was a success .
he then claimed chechnya was " stable and safe . "
but since russia officially ended its " counter-terror " operation in the province in april 2009 , there have been plenty of signs that chechnya is far from pacified .
the double bombings carried out by two suicide bombers on the moscow metro in march , which killed 40 and wounded more than 100 , showed that separatist violence has the power to reach the russian capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chechen parliament was attacked tuesday uwe halbach , researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the violence has actually been increasing in the region since 2009 .
" what we have in chechnya is a trend that is also evident in other republics in the northern caucasus , such as kabardino-balkaria and dagestan , " halbach told deutsche welle .
" attacks are being very deliberately directed at security organizations and authorities , in this case the parliament . "
scars from two wars chechnya unilaterally declared independence from russia in 1991 , following the collapse of the soviet union .
in 1994 , the first russian troops marched in to put the separatist movement down .
the destruction and reoccupation of the capital city grozny in 1996 represented only a partial resolution , and the ceasefire remained fragile .
the russian soldiers returned in 1999 , starting what has become known as the second chechen war .
this military offensive lasted until the spring of 2000 and ended with russia 's military occupation of the province .
but the underlying conflict lingered , and chechen resistance has continued since then , mostly in the form of guerrilla attacks on civilian targets in chechnya , neighboring dagestan and russia itself .
chechnya has been governed by presidents loyal to moscow since 2003 .
achmat kadyrov was killed in a bomb attack in 2004 and succeeded by his son ramzan kadyrov , who has been criticized for using extra-legal measures .
divided separatists but while kadyrov 's government faces a violent front of rebels who want to turn chechnya into an independent islamic state , many chechens have actually come to support the president in recent years .
ivan sukhov , caucasus correspondent for the independent moscow newspaper vremya novostyey , told deutsche welle , " in the last few years , ramzan kadyrov has almost become a figure symbolic of the chechen idea - the man who defends ethnic chechen interests .
that 's why many who fought for chechen freedom and independence from russia have joined him .
now there is a division in the movement . "
gerhard mangott , russia expert with the innsbruck institute for political science , says that three leading chechen rebels have now declared themselves against the idea of turning the republic into a muslim emirate .
instead , they favor a nation state based on the chechen ethnicity .
but it is this group that is apparently responsible for this week 's attack on the parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzan kadyrov has won some support recently " this group has abandoned doku umarov , who leads the islamist movement , " he said .
" it is certainly probable that this group started -lrb- this week 's -rrb- attacks to show it is capable of executing a massive strike on the center of president kadyrov 's power . "
mangott also notes a significant increase in rebel activity in the region in the last few months , particularly in dagestan and ingushetia , another russian republic bordering chechnya .
he believes the russian government 's attempts to stabilize the region have all failed so far .
both the tactic of military invasion and the tactic of targeted attacks on rebel leaders using secret service intelligence have so far yielded little result .
even russian president dmitry medvedev is apparently opening up to the idea that the solution can not only be a military one .
fresh ideas needed halbach also believes that russia should rethink its strategy in the northern caucasus .
development strategies that focus on social and economic problems are also necessary , and halbach believes the european union should support such initiatives and actively encourage russia to seek alternatives to military action .
but russia continues to declare the troubles in the region a domestic issue , making intervention in the form of international development aid impossible .
" i think there needs to be dialogue between the eu and russia about the alarming security situation in this region , " halbach said .
" it is not just russia 's ' internal foreign country , ' not just a crisis region on russia 's periphery , it is also a region on the edge of europe , and it is certainly in europe 's interests to know whether we can expect a further escalation in violence there , or whether it will be possible to limit it .

the russian soldiers returned in 1999 , starting what has become known as the second chechen war .
this military offensive lasted until the spring of 2000 and ended with russia 's military occupation of the province .
but the underlying conflict lingered , and chechen resistance has continued since then , mostly in the form of guerrilla attacks on civilian targets in chechnya , neighboring dagestan and russia itself .
chechnya has been governed by presidents loyal to moscow since 2003 .
achmat kadyrov was killed in a bomb attack in 2004 and succeeded by his son ramzan kadyrov , who has been criticized for using extra-legal measures .
divided separatists but while kadyrov 's government faces a violent front of rebels who want to turn chechnya into an independent islamic state , many chechens have actually come to support the president in recent years .
ivan sukhov , caucasus correspondent for the independent moscow newspaper vremya novostyey , told deutsche welle , " in the last few years , ramzan kadyrov has almost become a figure symbolic of the chechen idea - the man who defends ethnic chechen interests .
that 's why many who fought for chechen freedom and independence from russia have joined him .
now there is a division in the movement . "
gerhard mangott , russia expert with the innsbruck institute for political science , says that three leading chechen rebels have now declared themselves against the idea of turning the republic into a muslim emirate .
instead , they favor a nation state based on the chechen ethnicity .
but it is this group that is apparently responsible for this week 's attack on the parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzan kadyrov has won some support recently " this group has abandoned doku umarov , who leads the islamist movement , " he said .
" it is certainly probable that this group started -lrb- this week 's -rrb- attacks to show it is capable of executing a massive strike on the center of president kadyrov 's power . "
mangott also notes a significant increase in rebel activity in the region in the last few months , particularly in dagestan and ingushetia , another russian republic bordering chechnya .
he believes the russian government 's attempts to stabilize the region have all failed so far .
both the tactic of military invasion and the tactic of targeted attacks on rebel leaders using secret service intelligence have so far yielded little result .
even russian president dmitry medvedev is apparently opening up to the idea that the solution can not only be a military one .
fresh ideas needed halbach also believes that russia should rethink its strategy in the northern caucasus .
development strategies that focus on social and economic problems are also necessary , and halbach believes the european union should support such initiatives and actively encourage russia to seek alternatives to military action .
but russia continues to declare the troubles in the region a domestic issue , making intervention in the form of international development aid impossible .
" i think there needs to be dialogue between the eu and russia about the alarming security situation in this region , " halbach said .
" it is not just russia 's ' internal foreign country , ' not just a crisis region on russia 's periphery , it is also a region on the edge of europe , and it is certainly in europe 's interests to know whether we can expect a further escalation in violence there , or whether it will be possible to limit it .

now the eu 's executive is considering a ban of the drug called meow meow . the european commission on wednesday called for a ban of the party drug , mephedrone , also known as " meow meow , " which has hallucinogenic effects similar to ecstasy . while the drug is illegal in 15 of the european union 's 27-memberbloc , including germany , estonia and romania , it remains legal in others , including spain , portugal , and greece . " mephedrone is a dangerous drug that is available online and on the street corner , " viviane reding , the eu 's justice commissioner , said in a statement .
" we have a responsibility to protect young people against dangerous new psychoactive substances like mephedrone , " she said . the drug has been linked to 37 deaths in britain and ireland and the commission 's proposal would make it an offense to manufacture or sell mephedrone .

along for the ride is defense minister theodor zu guttenberg 's wife , who co-hosts the show . the man 's face and body is completely pixilated .
his voice is distorted .
but it 's easy enough to see what this guy wants .
he 's had the windows of his car tinted so no one can see inside .
no one will notice them when they 're out in the woods , anyway , he tells his companion , who he thinks is just 13 years old .
this is " tatort internet , " a new television show that uses fake chat usernames to trick men into thinking they 're talking with young girls or boys and set up a meeting .
then they secretly film the encounter and confront the man with his inappropriate messages , the inappropriate photos he 's sent and his inappropriate intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister says the show could put innocent people at risk the show is co-hosted by stephanie zu guttenberg , the wife of german defense minister theodor zu guttenberg .
that did n't stop fellow cabinet member and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from expressing her distaste for the show to the newspaper passauer neue presse .
" there 's the risk that innocent people are being publicly condemned , " she said .
" the german legal system does n't have to resort to mob justice . "
one man featured on the show was identified and then fired from his job where he worked with teens .
he subsequently went missing for several days and his colleagues and family said they feared he may have killed himself .
he has since resurfaced .
paula honkanen-schoberth , director of the german league for child protection , told deutsche welle that she was also worried about the vigilante aspect of the television show .
" of course we think that sexual abuse is a severe crime and must be prosecuted in all possible , but legal ways , " she said .
" but in germany we live under the rule of law , and that is why we regard the criminal prosecution as a matter for the police .
and television is not the police .
and should n't act like it is . "
getting the safety message to teens what needs to be done , honkanen-schoberth said , is to get parents talking with their kids about staying safe online .

this new role for stephanie zu guttenberg will only enhance her husband 's image , according to groebel .
" let 's be honest , the partner of a high-ranking politician is usually on the safe side .

along for the ride is defense minister theodor zu guttenberg 's wife , who co-hosts the show . the man 's face and body is completely pixilated .
his voice is distorted .
but it 's easy enough to see what this guy wants .
he 's had the windows of his car tinted so no one can see inside .
no one will notice them when they 're out in the woods , anyway , he tells his companion , who he thinks is just 13 years old .
this is " tatort internet , " a new television show that uses fake chat usernames to trick men into thinking they 're talking with young girls or boys and set up a meeting .
then they secretly film the encounter and confront the man with his inappropriate messages , the inappropriate photos he 's sent and his inappropriate intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister says the show could put innocent people at risk the show is co-hosted by stephanie zu guttenberg , the wife of german defense minister theodor zu guttenberg .
that did n't stop fellow cabinet member and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from expressing her distaste for the show to the newspaper passauer neue presse .
" there 's the risk that innocent people are being publicly condemned , " she said .
" the german legal system does n't have to resort to mob justice . "
one man featured on the show was identified and then fired from his job where he worked with teens .
he subsequently went missing for several days and his colleagues and family said they feared he may have killed himself .
he has since resurfaced .
paula honkanen-schoberth , director of the german league for child protection , told deutsche welle that she was also worried about the vigilante aspect of the television show .
" of course we think that sexual abuse is a severe crime and must be prosecuted in all possible , but legal ways , " she said .
" but in germany we live under the rule of law , and that is why we regard the criminal prosecution as a matter for the police .
and television is not the police .
and should n't act like it is . "
getting the safety message to teens what needs to be done , honkanen-schoberth said , is to get parents talking with their kids about staying safe online .
they should tell them not to give out their name and address or to meet up with strangers alone .
they should let them know they can always come to them if someone is threatening them or pressuring them to do something they do n't want to do .

in an attempt to get the uk back on track , the chancellor of the exchequer has announced new austerity measures , including half a million job cuts . british chancellor of the exchequer george osborne used a speech to the house of commons on wednesday to announce his country 's biggest public spending cuts since world war ii .
the chancellor outlined budget cuts to the tune of seven billion pounds -lrb- eight billion euros , $ 11 billion -rrb- as well as projected spending reductions of 81 billion pounds over four years .
" today is the day when britain steps back from the brink , when we confront the bills from a decade of debt , " osborne said , to cheers from the government benches in the house .
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- a day of rebuilding , when we set out a four-year plan to put our public services and welfare state on a sustainable footing for the long term , " he added .
slashing the budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans major spending cuts the conservative chancellor outlined wide-reaching austerity measures , including a drop in police budgets , a 24-percent cut in spending by the foreign office and an increase in the state pension age from 65 to 66 in 2020 - six years earlier than previously planned .
the government also intends to slash welfare spending by making changes to incapacity and housing benefits .
the opposition labour party meanwhile accused osborne of playing with people 's futures , with half a million public sector jobs expected to be lost .
while britain has remained true to its overseas aid pledges and increased spending on schools and the national health service , it will now make cuts to departmental budgets at an average of just under 20 percent .
job cuts ' reckless ' reining in spending means cutting some 490,000 public sector jobs , according to the office for budgetary responsibility .
the chancellor said he regretted that many would lose their jobs , but that it " is unavoidable when the country runs out of money . "
shadow chancellor alan johnson came out against the proposed job cuts , saying they were " reckless " and that the british people would suffer .
" today is the day that abstract figures and spread-sheets turn into people 's futures , people 's jobs , people 's services , their prospects for the future , " johnson said .
deficit triples disaster rates but the coalition government has laid blame for the cuts at the door of the previous labour administration for running up significant debts .
they insist that action must be taken now , and rapidly , if investor confidence in the british economy is to be restored .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the queen 's allowance will be affected by budget cuts the sheer size of britain 's debts makes cuts necessary , according to dr. andrew lilico , chief economist at right-of-center think tank policy exchange .
" running a deficit of around 10 percent of gdp is just way off the mark , " lilico said , adding that " within europe there are restrictions under treaty rules that say they should have deficits of no more than three percent of gdp . "
" we 're running a deficit well over three times as much as what was previously thought to be the absolute maximum that you should be running even in a disaster scenario , " lilico added .
unions plan to put up a fight trade unions , meanwhile , are promising to fight public sector job losses and have threatened widespread industrial action .
already on wednesday , protesters descended on westminster to express their disapproval of the austerity measures .
eighty-one billion pounds worth of cuts over four years represent an approximate halving of britain 's budget deficit .
the coalition government claims this will restore the economy to health , although opponents argue the measures may have the opposite effect , plunging britain back into recession .

the timetable means that the last british troops are set to leave 15 years earlier than originally planned . britain is to pull the last of its troops out of germany 15 years ahead of schedule as part of a wide-ranging program of defense cuts .
some 20,000 british service personnel are set to leave germany in the next decade .
the troops , originally stationed in the aftermath of the second world war , had previously been set to remain until 2035 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister cameron announced details of the military cuts " in terms of the return from germany , half our personnel should be back by 2015 and the remainder by 2020 , " prime minister david cameron said on tuesday , announcing details of the defense review .
a representative of the german army told the news agency reuters that the announcement had been unexpected . " we are all surprised , " spokeswoman helga heine said .
" we were not informed of this at all in advance . "
british soldiers are currently based at 12 sites in northern and western germany .
the review found that this was no longer necessary .
the united kingdom , france and the united states maintained troops in west germany throughout the cold war .
" the presence of the british military has played an important role in demonstrating alliance solidarity , and has also been a symbol of steadfast uk-german friendship , " the security review said .
but , it added , " there is no longer any operational requirement for uk forces to be based there . "
substantial reduction since end of cold war the former british army of the rhine - now british forces germany - had 58,000 soldiers stationed in germany in the 1980s .
that number was reduced substantially following the end of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osnabrueck was the largest british base outside the uk the last british troops left their base in osnabrueck , at one time home to the largest british garrison outside the united kingdom , in 2008 . britain 's defense budget , which totals 37 billion pounds -lrb- 42 billion euro , $ 58 billion -rrb- , is to be slashed by eight percent .
some 17,000 service personnel will be cut from the british forces ' payroll . cameron promised that the defense budget would remain the fourth-largest in the world and would meet a nato requirement for members to spend two percent of gross domestic product on defense . the defense cuts are part of a wider raft of measures being introduced by the government to cut spending by some 95 billion euros by 2015 , with the majority of cuts to be announced on wednesday afternoon .

his address had important messages for germans and turks , says baha gungor of dw 's turkish service . the omens for christian wulff 's third trip abroad as german president , this time to turkey , were unfavorable .
in germany , a debate on integration was raging , charged with emotions .
the weekly magazine " focus " published a cover with wulff 's face on it - distorted as an islamic prayer leader .
wulff had , however , merely pointed out in an october 3 speech that islam - in addition to christianity and judaism - is part of life in germany . public attention became focused on the first speech given by a german president to the turkish parliament .
wulff did not mince words .
for one , he repeated that islam has become an integral part of germany .
he also demanded that turkey acknowledge that christianity has a place in turkey , and that christians there should be free to worship as they wish .
that included priests being trained in turkey , he said , which is not possible now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha gungor , head of dw 's turkish department wulff did not avoid critical topics , such as turkey 's difficult relationship with cyprus and armenia .
not least , he affirmed israel 's right to exist while demanding an autonomous , viable and democratically ruled palestine .
that was an indirect request for turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to resume dialogue with israel . wulff refrained from making empty promises regarding turkey joining the european union .
shrewdly , clearly and unmistakably , wulff said that regardless of the democratic and economic progress turkey has indeed made , eu membership was not a foregone conclusion . the most distinct messages that wulff addressed to both germans and turks had to do with the need for people of turkish descent in germany to find a place in german society .
it was striking that wulff avoided using the loaded word " integration . "
his call for immigrants to learn the german language had been supported by the turkish president abdullah gul in the run-up to his visit .
and gul did not forget to mention in a joint press conference ahead of wulff 's speech that he was the president of all turkish citizens - those with armenian , jewish and greek roots included - and that all people in turkey should speak turkish . wulff 's five-day state visit will evidently help to minimize misunderstanding between berlin and ankara .
wulff 's manner has been well-received and his cautious words will not be ignored . whether a change of direction in germany 's out-of-control integration debate can be expected remains to be seen ; wulff does not have to win elections anymore . certain politicians , on the other hand , are not likely to pass on the strategy of pitting popular emotions against foreigners and migrants for their election campaigns . author : baha gungor -lrb- sst / rc -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 20.10.2010 debate about islam in germany heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has seen a rise in anti-islamic feeling germany 's top-selling non-fiction bestseller is a book that attacks islam - and the german president ca n't get the public to agree with him when he says that islam is part of germany . thilo sarrazin , former state finance minister in berlin and just a short time ago on the board of the german central bank , has written a bestseller : " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany is doing away with itself " -rrb- .
he predicts a dire future for the country and he blames it above all on islam and the uncontrolled immigration of muslims .
most muslims have different values than the germans , he writes .
they ostensibly hold god higher than the constitutional state and democracy .
this is the reason , he claims , why germany will gradually do away with itself if it does n't carry out an active immigration and integration debate .
sarrazin 's arguments are meeting with a great deal of support .
but he is also encountering opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book has sparked much of the recent debate michael bommes , a sociologist teaching at the university of osnabrueck , notes that the current debate about islam shows that most people have still to grasp the fact that germany has long since become a country of immigrants , with a correspondingly complex diversity of values and viewpoints .
" through modern international immigration , world religions such as islam have now arrived in europe , " says bommes .
he argues that muslims have to adjust to this situation , as do the citizens of other european nations .
the relationships between politics , law and religion have to be rethought , he says .
people have always had to find compromises over these three elements .
and islam is making this necessary once more in today 's world .
fear of headscarves and mosques many germans are worried because they see their way of life being called into question by the presence of islam .
they find the headscarves and veils worn by muslim women particularly offensive .
they raise the possibility that these women are being oppressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic headwear is viewed with suspicion by many europeans such concerns are also evident in the results of a study recently published by the friedrich ebert foundation .
oliver decker , who led the study , speaks of a " very distinct increase from 34 percent to over half the population who agree with statements hostile to islam . "
many germans are also skeptical with regard to the building of new mosques , he says .
where do these negative appraisals of islam come from ?
islam scholar navid kermani believes that germans see their identity being threatened .
identity , he explains , is formed when we distinguish ourselves from other groups .
every social group defines itself by how it differs from other groups .
that 's why , he argues , it seems logical to keep one 's distance from islam .
after all , westerners tend to be unfamiliar with islamic symbols , making the religion seem especially alien .
the process of differentiation itself is then only natural .
but it becomes problematic when those who are different are declared to be the enemy .
a sometimes superficial discussion seen in this light , there is nothing reprehensible about the debate on islam .
it seems to reflect primarily the struggle for a new german self-image and the difficulties connected with the fact that germany has indeed become a country of immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western impressions of islam may be too simplistic nevertheless , political scientist claus leggewie contends that the discussions about islam are often conducted on too superficial a level .
most people make little distinction between the various currents within islam .
nor do they make sufficient allowance for the differences between moderate and radical muslims .
" i believe that most europeans tend to develop a rather schematic image of islam , " says leggewie .
he finds it astounding that europeans , who do so much travelling and know the world so well , whose opinions on all other issues are so carefully formed and objective , are often so quick to make superficial judgments when it comes to islam .
but the debate on islam did n't exactly appear out of thin air , either .
it stems from the fact that religion has regained a great deal of power in the middle east itself .
of course people in germany have taken note of this resurgence , explains navid kermani .
the problem is that , in the muslim world as well , many issues are being viewed through a religious lens .
for many years , religion played no role on the political front there .
now all that has changed .
and germany feels threatened , fearing an increasing powerful cocktail of religion and politics here as well .
islam as a way of helping to define europe first and foremost , the battle about islam is an inner-german struggle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate may ultimately be about how international germany should be it 's about how open germany and the germans want to be .
since the end of the nazi dictatorship , germans have agonized about their history , and have developed a troubled relationship with their national identity .
whoever makes a statement about islam , says claus leggewie , is also indirectly speaking out on an entirely different issue - namely , how international germany should be .
" there are islamophobic tendencies on the one side and islamophile leanings on the other , " says leggewie .
" and , as we know , they have historically very frequently been interrelated , even when they seem on the outside to be diametrically opposed .
this very obviously means that islam continues to play an essential role in our construction of what europe means , i.e. in the collective identity of the europeans . "

the timetable means that the last british troops are set to leave 15 years earlier than originally planned . britain is to pull the last of its troops out of germany 15 years ahead of schedule as part of a wide-ranging program of defense cuts .
some 20,000 british service personnel are set to leave germany in the next decade .
the troops , originally stationed in the aftermath of the second world war , had previously been set to remain until 2035 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister cameron announced details of the military cuts " in terms of the return from germany , half our personnel should be back by 2015 and the remainder by 2020 , " prime minister david cameron said on tuesday , announcing details of the defense review .
a representative of the german army told the news agency reuters that the announcement had been unexpected . " we are all surprised , " spokeswoman helga heine said .
" we were not informed of this at all in advance . "
british soldiers are currently based at 12 sites in northern and western germany .
the review found that this was no longer necessary .
the united kingdom , france and the united states maintained troops in west germany throughout the cold war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 20.10.2010 new television show confronts men looking for underage relationships großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the online world can be a dangerous place for children critics say a new television show that catches men chatting with teens about sex and then meeting up with them is mob justice .
along for the ride is defense minister theodor zu guttenberg 's wife , who co-hosts the show . the man 's face and body is completely pixilated .
his voice is distorted .
but it 's easy enough to see what this guy wants .
he 's had the windows of his car tinted so no one can see inside .
no one will notice them when they 're out in the woods , anyway , he tells his companion , who he thinks is just 13 years old .
this is " tatort internet , " a new television show that uses fake chat usernames to trick men into thinking they 're talking with young girls or boys and set up a meeting .
then they secretly film the encounter and confront the man with his inappropriate messages , the inappropriate photos he 's sent and his inappropriate intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister says the show could put innocent people at risk the show is co-hosted by stephanie zu guttenberg , the wife of german defense minister theodor zu guttenberg .
that did n't stop fellow cabinet member and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from expressing her distaste for the show to the newspaper passauer neue presse .
" there 's the risk that innocent people are being publicly condemned , " she said .
" the german legal system does n't have to resort to mob justice . "
one man featured on the show was identified and then fired from his job where he worked with teens .
he subsequently went missing for several days and his colleagues and family said they feared he may have killed himself .
he has since resurfaced .
paula honkanen-schoberth , director of the german league for child protection , told deutsche welle that she was also worried about the vigilante aspect of the television show .
" of course we think that sexual abuse is a severe crime and must be prosecuted in all possible , but legal ways , " she said .
" but in germany we live under the rule of law , and that is why we regard the criminal prosecution as a matter for the police .
and television is not the police .
and should n't act like it is . "
getting the safety message to teens what needs to be done , honkanen-schoberth said , is to get parents talking with their kids about staying safe online .
they should tell them not to give out their name and address or to meet up with strangers alone .
they should let them know they can always come to them if someone is threatening them or pressuring them to do something they do n't want to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents must talk with their children about staying safe online , says honkanen-schoberth honkanen-schoberth said she would welcome a show that addressed these things .
but media expert jo groeber from the german digital institute says the show itself could be a revolutionary way to inform young people about the dangers of the internet and chatting with adult strangers .
" it 's entertaining , it 's even , i 'm afraid to say it , thrilling , " he said .
" it 's probably tasteless , but it reaches the audience . "
one concern he does have , he said , is whether the show 's producers know of potential abusers for months at time before informing the police .
the guttenberg image stephanie zu guttenberg 's presence on the show comes as her husband 's political star gets brighter and brighter .
there 's even been speculation that he could become the country 's next chancellor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephanie zu guttenberg 's role in the show could affect her husband 's career in a survey by the forsa research institute released on wednesday , 25 percent of those surveyed said the defense minister would make a better chancellor than his boss , chancellor angela merkel .
this new role for stephanie zu guttenberg will only enhance her husband 's image , according to groebel .
" let 's be honest , the partner of a high-ranking politician is usually on the safe side .
they 're involved in charity work , but they never take any risks , " he said .
" i think the fact that she 's taking a risk will strengthen his image , as the husband of a completely independent wife . "

in an attempt to get the uk back on track , the chancellor of the exchequer has announced new austerity measures , including half a million job cuts . british chancellor of the exchequer george osborne used a speech to the house of commons on wednesday to announce his country 's biggest public spending cuts since world war ii .
the chancellor outlined budget cuts to the tune of seven billion pounds -lrb- eight billion euros , $ 11 billion -rrb- as well as projected spending reductions of 81 billion pounds over four years .
" today is the day when britain steps back from the brink , when we confront the bills from a decade of debt , " osborne said , to cheers from the government benches in the house .
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- a day of rebuilding , when we set out a four-year plan to put our public services and welfare state on a sustainable footing for the long term , " he added .
slashing the budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans major spending cuts the conservative chancellor outlined wide-reaching austerity measures , including a drop in police budgets , a 24-percent cut in spending by the foreign office and an increase in the state pension age from 65 to 66 in 2020 - six years earlier than previously planned .
the government also intends to slash welfare spending by making changes to incapacity and housing benefits .
the opposition labour party meanwhile accused osborne of playing with people 's futures , with half a million public sector jobs expected to be lost .
while britain has remained true to its overseas aid pledges and increased spending on schools and the national health service , it will now make cuts to departmental budgets at an average of just under 20 percent .
job cuts ' reckless ' reining in spending means cutting some 490,000 public sector jobs , according to the office for budgetary responsibility .
the chancellor said he regretted that many would lose their jobs , but that it " is unavoidable when the country runs out of money . "
shadow chancellor alan johnson came out against the proposed job cuts , saying they were " reckless " and that the british people would suffer .
" today is the day that abstract figures and spread-sheets turn into people 's futures , people 's jobs , people 's services , their prospects for the future , " johnson said .
deficit triples disaster rates but the coalition government has laid blame for the cuts at the door of the previous labour administration for running up significant debts .
they insist that action must be taken now , and rapidly , if investor confidence in the british economy is to be restored .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the queen 's allowance will be affected by budget cuts the sheer size of britain 's debts makes cuts necessary , according to dr. andrew lilico , chief economist at right-of-center think tank policy exchange .
" running a deficit of around 10 percent of gdp is just way off the mark , " lilico said , adding that " within europe there are restrictions under treaty rules that say they should have deficits of no more than three percent of gdp . "
" we 're running a deficit well over three times as much as what was previously thought to be the absolute maximum that you should be running even in a disaster scenario , " lilico added .
unions plan to put up a fight trade unions , meanwhile , are promising to fight public sector job losses and have threatened widespread industrial action .
already on wednesday , protesters descended on westminster to express their disapproval of the austerity measures .
eighty-one billion pounds worth of cuts over four years represent an approximate halving of britain 's budget deficit .
the coalition government claims this will restore the economy to health , although opponents argue the measures may have the opposite effect , plunging britain back into recession .

his address had important messages for germans and turks , says baha gungor of dw 's turkish service . the omens for christian wulff 's third trip abroad as german president , this time to turkey , were unfavorable .
in germany , a debate on integration was raging , charged with emotions .
the weekly magazine " focus " published a cover with wulff 's face on it - distorted as an islamic prayer leader .
wulff had , however , merely pointed out in an october 3 speech that islam - in addition to christianity and judaism - is part of life in germany . public attention became focused on the first speech given by a german president to the turkish parliament .
wulff did not mince words .
for one , he repeated that islam has become an integral part of germany .
he also demanded that turkey acknowledge that christianity has a place in turkey , and that christians there should be free to worship as they wish .
that included priests being trained in turkey , he said , which is not possible now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha gungor , head of dw 's turkish department wulff did not avoid critical topics , such as turkey 's difficult relationship with cyprus and armenia .
not least , he affirmed israel 's right to exist while demanding an autonomous , viable and democratically ruled palestine .
that was an indirect request for turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to resume dialogue with israel . wulff refrained from making empty promises regarding turkey joining the european union .
shrewdly , clearly and unmistakably , wulff said that regardless of the democratic and economic progress turkey has indeed made , eu membership was not a foregone conclusion . the most distinct messages that wulff addressed to both germans and turks had to do with the need for people of turkish descent in germany to find a place in german society .
it was striking that wulff avoided using the loaded word " integration . "
his call for immigrants to learn the german language had been supported by the turkish president abdullah gul in the run-up to his visit .
and gul did not forget to mention in a joint press conference ahead of wulff 's speech that he was the president of all turkish citizens - those with armenian , jewish and greek roots included - and that all people in turkey should speak turkish . wulff 's five-day state visit will evidently help to minimize misunderstanding between berlin and ankara .
wulff 's manner has been well-received and his cautious words will not be ignored . whether a change of direction in germany 's out-of-control integration debate can be expected remains to be seen ; wulff does not have to win elections anymore . certain politicians , on the other hand , are not likely to pass on the strategy of pitting popular emotions against foreigners and migrants for their election campaigns . author : baha gungor -lrb- sst / rc -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

included in the resolution are 700 million euros to help educate poor children . the german cabinet on wednesday approved proposed legislation that would reform state benefits for the long-term unemployed .
the new policy would see the basic welfare payments , known as hartz iv , raised to 364 euros -lrb- $ 505 -rrb- per adult recipient per month - a five euro increase over the current rate .
in order to satisfy a constitutional court ruling , the bill must be passed into law by year 's end .
chancellor merkel 's center-right coalition government does n't have a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , and the opposition has said that it will only approve the bill if signifigant amendments are made .
merkel defends reforms against criticism since chancellor merkel 's center-right coalition government unveiled its proposals last month , opposition parties have criticized the increase as being too small .
" a failure to massively raise -lsb- welfare -rsb- rates will mean a permanent state of poverty and marginalization , " said gregor gysi , the head of the left party 's parliamentary group .
the chancellor meanwhile defended the welfare reforms .
" hartz iv is not a way of life , " merkel said in berlin on wednesday , adding that the payments were " meant as a bridge back to employment . "

yet opponents say the education package is not enough either .
gysi said it was " not enough to finance a sports club or a music school and certainly not remedial courses . "
chancellor merkel expressed some sympathy for welfare beneficiaries , saying , " i know that -lsb- these cuts -rsb- can be hard .
but there must be some motivation to go back to work . "
the new regulation needs to be passed into law before the end of the year , to satisfy a court ruling that deemed the way the payments have been calculated up until now to be unconstitutional . the government hopes to be able to implement the reforms on january 1 , 2011 .
labor minister ursula von der leyen called on all parties to work together in order to make the reform work , saying that the “ this tight deadline means we all have to take responsibility . ”

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen called on germany 's parties to work together to pass the reform more money for education the new measures , which are expected to cost an additional 900 million euros , include 700 million to improve education for children in welfare recipient households .
yet opponents say the education package is not enough either .
gysi said it was " not enough to finance a sports club or a music school and certainly not remedial courses . "
chancellor merkel expressed some sympathy for welfare beneficiaries , saying , " i know that -lsb- these cuts -rsb- can be hard .
but there must be some motivation to go back to work . "
the new regulation needs to be passed into law before the end of the year , to satisfy a court ruling that deemed the way the payments have been calculated up until now to be unconstitutional . the government hopes to be able to implement the reforms on january 1 , 2011 .
labor minister ursula von der leyen called on all parties to work together in order to make the reform work , saying that the “ this tight deadline means we all have to take responsibility . ”

his address had important messages for germans and turks , says baha gungor of dw 's turkish service . the omens for christian wulff 's third trip abroad as german president , this time to turkey , were unfavorable .
in germany , a debate on integration was raging , charged with emotions .
the weekly magazine " focus " published a cover with wulff 's face on it - distorted as an islamic prayer leader .
wulff had , however , merely pointed out in an october 3 speech that islam - in addition to christianity and judaism - is part of life in germany . public attention became focused on the first speech given by a german president to the turkish parliament .
wulff did not mince words .
for one , he repeated that islam has become an integral part of germany .
he also demanded that turkey acknowledge that christianity has a place in turkey , and that christians there should be free to worship as they wish .
that included priests being trained in turkey , he said , which is not possible now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha gungor , head of dw 's turkish department wulff did not avoid critical topics , such as turkey 's difficult relationship with cyprus and armenia .
not least , he affirmed israel 's right to exist while demanding an autonomous , viable and democratically ruled palestine .
that was an indirect request for turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to resume dialogue with israel . wulff refrained from making empty promises regarding turkey joining the european union .
shrewdly , clearly and unmistakably , wulff said that regardless of the democratic and economic progress turkey has indeed made , eu membership was not a foregone conclusion . the most distinct messages that wulff addressed to both germans and turks had to do with the need for people of turkish descent in germany to find a place in german society .
it was striking that wulff avoided using the loaded word " integration . "
his call for immigrants to learn the german language had been supported by the turkish president abdullah gul in the run-up to his visit .
and gul did not forget to mention in a joint press conference ahead of wulff 's speech that he was the president of all turkish citizens - those with armenian , jewish and greek roots included - and that all people in turkey should speak turkish . wulff 's five-day state visit will evidently help to minimize misunderstanding between berlin and ankara .
wulff 's manner has been well-received and his cautious words will not be ignored . whether a change of direction in germany 's out-of-control integration debate can be expected remains to be seen ; wulff does not have to win elections anymore . certain politicians , on the other hand , are not likely to pass on the strategy of pitting popular emotions against foreigners and migrants for their election campaigns . author : baha gungor -lrb- sst / rc -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 20.10.2010 debate about islam in germany heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has seen a rise in anti-islamic feeling germany 's top-selling non-fiction bestseller is a book that attacks islam - and the german president ca n't get the public to agree with him when he says that islam is part of germany . thilo sarrazin , former state finance minister in berlin and just a short time ago on the board of the german central bank , has written a bestseller : " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany is doing away with itself " -rrb- .
he predicts a dire future for the country and he blames it above all on islam and the uncontrolled immigration of muslims .
most muslims have different values than the germans , he writes .
they ostensibly hold god higher than the constitutional state and democracy .
this is the reason , he claims , why germany will gradually do away with itself if it does n't carry out an active immigration and integration debate .
sarrazin 's arguments are meeting with a great deal of support .
but he is also encountering opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book has sparked much of the recent debate michael bommes , a sociologist teaching at the university of osnabrueck , notes that the current debate about islam shows that most people have still to grasp the fact that germany has long since become a country of immigrants , with a correspondingly complex diversity of values and viewpoints .
" through modern international immigration , world religions such as islam have now arrived in europe , " says bommes .
he argues that muslims have to adjust to this situation , as do the citizens of other european nations .
the relationships between politics , law and religion have to be rethought , he says .
people have always had to find compromises over these three elements .
and islam is making this necessary once more in today 's world .
fear of headscarves and mosques many germans are worried because they see their way of life being called into question by the presence of islam .
they find the headscarves and veils worn by muslim women particularly offensive .
they raise the possibility that these women are being oppressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic headwear is viewed with suspicion by many europeans such concerns are also evident in the results of a study recently published by the friedrich ebert foundation .
oliver decker , who led the study , speaks of a " very distinct increase from 34 percent to over half the population who agree with statements hostile to islam . "
many germans are also skeptical with regard to the building of new mosques , he says .
where do these negative appraisals of islam come from ?
islam scholar navid kermani believes that germans see their identity being threatened .
identity , he explains , is formed when we distinguish ourselves from other groups .
every social group defines itself by how it differs from other groups .
that 's why , he argues , it seems logical to keep one 's distance from islam .
after all , westerners tend to be unfamiliar with islamic symbols , making the religion seem especially alien .
the process of differentiation itself is then only natural .
but it becomes problematic when those who are different are declared to be the enemy .
a sometimes superficial discussion seen in this light , there is nothing reprehensible about the debate on islam .
it seems to reflect primarily the struggle for a new german self-image and the difficulties connected with the fact that germany has indeed become a country of immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western impressions of islam may be too simplistic nevertheless , political scientist claus leggewie contends that the discussions about islam are often conducted on too superficial a level .
most people make little distinction between the various currents within islam .
nor do they make sufficient allowance for the differences between moderate and radical muslims .
" i believe that most europeans tend to develop a rather schematic image of islam , " says leggewie .
he finds it astounding that europeans , who do so much travelling and know the world so well , whose opinions on all other issues are so carefully formed and objective , are often so quick to make superficial judgments when it comes to islam .
but the debate on islam did n't exactly appear out of thin air , either .
it stems from the fact that religion has regained a great deal of power in the middle east itself .
of course people in germany have taken note of this resurgence , explains navid kermani .
the problem is that , in the muslim world as well , many issues are being viewed through a religious lens .
for many years , religion played no role on the political front there .
now all that has changed .

islam as a way of helping to define europe first and foremost , the battle about islam is an inner-german struggle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate may ultimately be about how international germany should be it 's about how open germany and the germans want to be .
since the end of the nazi dictatorship , germans have agonized about their history , and have developed a troubled relationship with their national identity .
whoever makes a statement about islam , says claus leggewie , is also indirectly speaking out on an entirely different issue - namely , how international germany should be .
" there are islamophobic tendencies on the one side and islamophile leanings on the other , " says leggewie .
" and , as we know , they have historically very frequently been interrelated , even when they seem on the outside to be diametrically opposed .
this very obviously means that islam continues to play an essential role in our construction of what europe means , i.e. in the collective identity of the europeans . "

included in the resolution are 700 million euros to help educate poor children . the german cabinet on wednesday approved proposed legislation that would reform state benefits for the long-term unemployed .
the new policy would see the basic welfare payments , known as hartz iv , raised to 364 euros -lrb- $ 505 -rrb- per adult recipient per month - a five euro increase over the current rate .
in order to satisfy a constitutional court ruling , the bill must be passed into law by year 's end .
chancellor merkel 's center-right coalition government does n't have a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , and the opposition has said that it will only approve the bill if signifigant amendments are made .
merkel defends reforms against criticism since chancellor merkel 's center-right coalition government unveiled its proposals last month , opposition parties have criticized the increase as being too small .
" a failure to massively raise -lsb- welfare -rsb- rates will mean a permanent state of poverty and marginalization , " said gregor gysi , the head of the left party 's parliamentary group .
the chancellor meanwhile defended the welfare reforms .
" hartz iv is not a way of life , " merkel said in berlin on wednesday , adding that the payments were " meant as a bridge back to employment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen called on germany 's parties to work together to pass the reform more money for education the new measures , which are expected to cost an additional 900 million euros , include 700 million to improve education for children in welfare recipient households .
yet opponents say the education package is not enough either .
gysi said it was " not enough to finance a sports club or a music school and certainly not remedial courses . "
chancellor merkel expressed some sympathy for welfare beneficiaries , saying , " i know that -lsb- these cuts -rsb- can be hard .
but there must be some motivation to go back to work . "
the new regulation needs to be passed into law before the end of the year , to satisfy a court ruling that deemed the way the payments have been calculated up until now to be unconstitutional . the government hopes to be able to implement the reforms on january 1 , 2011 .
labor minister ursula von der leyen called on all parties to work together in order to make the reform work , saying that the “ this tight deadline means we all have to take responsibility . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de caucasus -pipe- 20.10.2010 chechnya still a long way from stability , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya has been in a state of crisis since the fall of the soviet union tuesday 's dramatic raid on the chechen parliament was a blow to russian claims that chechnya has been pacified .
commentators believe that only a change of policy can end the long years of violence and unrest . the kremlin remained bullish after the separatist attack on the chechen parliament in grozny on tuesday , in which three people were killed .
" as always , they -lrb- the militants -rrb- failed , " russian interior minister rashid nurgaliyev said at a televized meeting at the local interior ministry .
the minister , by coincidence on a trip to grozny , said the chechen gunmen were intercepted by interior ministry troops , and that the operation by the security forces to free the deputies was a success .
he then claimed chechnya was " stable and safe . "
but since russia officially ended its " counter-terror " operation in the province in april 2009 , there have been plenty of signs that chechnya is far from pacified .
the double bombings carried out by two suicide bombers on the moscow metro in march , which killed 40 and wounded more than 100 , showed that separatist violence has the power to reach the russian capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chechen parliament was attacked tuesday uwe halbach , researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the violence has actually been increasing in the region since 2009 .
" what we have in chechnya is a trend that is also evident in other republics in the northern caucasus , such as kabardino-balkaria and dagestan , " halbach told deutsche welle .
" attacks are being very deliberately directed at security organizations and authorities , in this case the parliament . "
scars from two wars chechnya unilaterally declared independence from russia in 1991 , following the collapse of the soviet union .
in 1994 , the first russian troops marched in to put the separatist movement down .
the destruction and reoccupation of the capital city grozny in 1996 represented only a partial resolution , and the ceasefire remained fragile .
the russian soldiers returned in 1999 , starting what has become known as the second chechen war .
this military offensive lasted until the spring of 2000 and ended with russia 's military occupation of the province .
but the underlying conflict lingered , and chechen resistance has continued since then , mostly in the form of guerrilla attacks on civilian targets in chechnya , neighboring dagestan and russia itself .
chechnya has been governed by presidents loyal to moscow since 2003 .
achmat kadyrov was killed in a bomb attack in 2004 and succeeded by his son ramzan kadyrov , who has been criticized for using extra-legal measures .
divided separatists but while kadyrov 's government faces a violent front of rebels who want to turn chechnya into an independent islamic state , many chechens have actually come to support the president in recent years .
ivan sukhov , caucasus correspondent for the independent moscow newspaper vremya novostyey , told deutsche welle , " in the last few years , ramzan kadyrov has almost become a figure symbolic of the chechen idea - the man who defends ethnic chechen interests .
that 's why many who fought for chechen freedom and independence from russia have joined him .
now there is a division in the movement . "
gerhard mangott , russia expert with the innsbruck institute for political science , says that three leading chechen rebels have now declared themselves against the idea of turning the republic into a muslim emirate .
instead , they favor a nation state based on the chechen ethnicity .
but it is this group that is apparently responsible for this week 's attack on the parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzan kadyrov has won some support recently " this group has abandoned doku umarov , who leads the islamist movement , " he said .
" it is certainly probable that this group started -lrb- this week 's -rrb- attacks to show it is capable of executing a massive strike on the center of president kadyrov 's power . "
mangott also notes a significant increase in rebel activity in the region in the last few months , particularly in dagestan and ingushetia , another russian republic bordering chechnya .
he believes the russian government 's attempts to stabilize the region have all failed so far .
both the tactic of military invasion and the tactic of targeted attacks on rebel leaders using secret service intelligence have so far yielded little result .
even russian president dmitry medvedev is apparently opening up to the idea that the solution can not only be a military one .
fresh ideas needed halbach also believes that russia should rethink its strategy in the northern caucasus .
development strategies that focus on social and economic problems are also necessary , and halbach believes the european union should support such initiatives and actively encourage russia to seek alternatives to military action .
but russia continues to declare the troubles in the region a domestic issue , making intervention in the form of international development aid impossible .
" i think there needs to be dialogue between the eu and russia about the alarming security situation in this region , " halbach said .
" it is not just russia 's ' internal foreign country , ' not just a crisis region on russia 's periphery , it is also a region on the edge of europe , and it is certainly in europe 's interests to know whether we can expect a further escalation in violence there , or whether it will be possible to limit it .

german eurostar competitor completes first trip to london i have travelled on both the ice and tgv trains during visits to europe .
of course , the tgv was very exciting when it first came out .
the ice has always been a smooth ride before that .
so , i have no preference at this point but am glad to see competition between the two .
both ice and tgv are comfortable and reliable , so the passenger can then choose based on price and routes . - rome , us german , french rail companies on collision course over channel tunnel eurotunnel is underused by rail passengers .
it should be opened up to other operators in addition to eurostar , also , london is not the only city of high population in the uk to which there should be a high speed link .
other cities that could benefit include birmingham , manchester and glasgow . - roderick , oman its common knowledge that protectionism is rife in france , for example cars , aircraft etc . , but they must be made to realize that that behavior will not be tolerated any more .
eurostar has a perfect right to choose what is best for them - not france ! - richard , great britain french government says ' non ' to german eurostar trains at the moment , and for a while to come , france has enough on its plate vis-a-vis the never ending number of strikes , that make running any trains , a serious challenge .
the simple answer would be to increase the number of scheduled services , so that an increase in passenger volume would lead to more attractive prices in comparison to the alternative of air travel . - charles , great britain german train completes test trip under channel having had the enjoyment of riding with deutsche bahn in germany on many occasions , to be able to travel to , say , cologne without having to change at brussels , only to find the connecting train did n't wait for the late running eurostar service , is going to be great !
but i think db is going to have to sort out those pesky wheels once and for all before committing the ice 's to the tunnel . - tony , great britain deutsche bahn 's proposed high speed service from st. pancras is wonderful news and will most certainly be a great success for both the business and leisure sectors .

but it is facing an uphill battle to win support for the idea , with opposition being spearheaded by germany , france and britain . the european commission 's proposal to introduce a europe-wide value-added tax is being met with stiff resistance from the 27-member bloc 's economic powerhouses , germany , france and britain .
the commission wants to introduce direct taxation from brussels for the 2014-2020 budget due to fears that cash-strapped governments may want to reduce their contributions to the bloc .
" at times where public spending is under pressure , we suggest ways to achieve a european budget that is up to the challenges we are facing collectively , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso .
among the eu executive 's proposals are the creation of a separate value-added tax , an eu energy tax or an eu corporate income tax .
under the current system , the eu raises about three quarters of its budget from national government contributions .
" this is not such a bad system because the national governments have a strong incentive to press for fiscal discipline in brussels , " professor friedrich heinemann of the centre for european economic research in mannheim told deutsche welle fears of eu expansion heinemann thinks the move is aimed at expanding the eu 's budget .
" why has the european commission been pressing so hard for years and even decades for a european tax ? " he asked . " it 's about preparing a more aggressive expansion of the budget .
this is a central interest of the european commission and the idea is to let the eu budget grow . "
those in favor of the tax believe it will create more transparency and add value to european decisions by giving europe real power to pool its resources to work on special projects .
" i do n't want the eu to deal with the size and shape of bananas .
i would like the eu to create value added at the european level , with things like large research projects , " henrik enderlein , professor of political economy at the hertie school of governance in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the eu can only do if it has this autonomous spending and taxing capacity , " he added critics are worried about tax increases .
the recent recession and debt crisis has already forced national governments to cut budgets and raise taxes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european wide vat could hit consumers but enderlein does n't think this will necessarily lead to more taxation .
he says that germany knows exactly which proportion of its tax is sent to europe and the european parliament could effectively replace this .
he argues that the elected european parliament would provide adequate democratic controls .
" look at the united states : in every state there is a different value added tax and that works perfectly well and so there can be taxation at different levels and i do n't see why this would n't function in the european union , " he told deutsche welle . observers say it is unlikely that such a form of direct taxation will be passed by the eu anytime soon , but enderlein thinks that it 's inevitable that countries sharing a single currency will eventually want to have taxation at european level .
" the process of eu integration is a process of unlikely events ultimately taking place .
nobody thought the single currency would appear or that borders would be abolished , but we saw all of these happen , " enderlein told deutsche welle .
to be adopted , any proposal must be approved by the eu 's member states and the european parliament .
the european commission plans to present proposed legislation by july of next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.10.2010 merkel 's cabinet approves reform to unemployment benefits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have attacked minimal hikes to unemployment payments the german government has put forth a bill to increase unemployment payments by five euros a month - but critics say it 's not enough .
included in the resolution are 700 million euros to help educate poor children . the german cabinet on wednesday approved proposed legislation that would reform state benefits for the long-term unemployed .
the new policy would see the basic welfare payments , known as hartz iv , raised to 364 euros -lrb- $ 505 -rrb- per adult recipient per month - a five euro increase over the current rate .
in order to satisfy a constitutional court ruling , the bill must be passed into law by year 's end .
chancellor merkel 's center-right coalition government does n't have a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , and the opposition has said that it will only approve the bill if signifigant amendments are made .
merkel defends reforms against criticism since chancellor merkel 's center-right coalition government unveiled its proposals last month , opposition parties have criticized the increase as being too small .
" a failure to massively raise -lsb- welfare -rsb- rates will mean a permanent state of poverty and marginalization , " said gregor gysi , the head of the left party 's parliamentary group .
the chancellor meanwhile defended the welfare reforms .
" hartz iv is not a way of life , " merkel said in berlin on wednesday , adding that the payments were " meant as a bridge back to employment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen called on germany 's parties to work together to pass the reform more money for education the new measures , which are expected to cost an additional 900 million euros , include 700 million to improve education for children in welfare recipient households .
yet opponents say the education package is not enough either .
gysi said it was " not enough to finance a sports club or a music school and certainly not remedial courses . "
chancellor merkel expressed some sympathy for welfare beneficiaries , saying , " i know that -lsb- these cuts -rsb- can be hard .
but there must be some motivation to go back to work . "
the new regulation needs to be passed into law before the end of the year , to satisfy a court ruling that deemed the way the payments have been calculated up until now to be unconstitutional . the government hopes to be able to implement the reforms on january 1 , 2011 .

india is widely viewed as an emerging great power in asia .
the south asian sub-continent is on the rise politically as well as economically .
but india has to cope with several key issues to secure its new-found status . the crisis-torn region of kashmir has experienced one of its bloodiest summers ever .
after a teenager was allegedly killed by indian security forces violence erupted amongst young kashmiris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kashmir has been a bone of contention between india and pakistan for decades more than 100 people have died in the last couple of months in indian-administered kashmir .
the disputed region has been a bone of contention between india and pakistan for the past 60 years , with neither side willing to give an inch .
arch-rivals after the mumbai terror attacks of 2008 , which was planned on pakistani soil , diplomatic relations between the two sides cooled down .
the peace process between india and pakistan came to a standstill .
foreign policy expert raja mohan from delhi says pakistan has more than enough problems of its own .
" right now , pakistan is in a bad shape .
not only because of the floods .
the civilian government has problems , the military has gained a lot more power , " says mohan , " so you have a situation where you have no single authority to negotiate to within pakistan .
so i don ’ t see any prospects for any breakthrough .
unless pakistan itself stabilizes to some extent . "
bildunterschrift : arch-rivals armed to the teeth , also with nuclear weapons the other mighty neighbor and india has to solve its issues with pakistan , says raja mohan - not only because both nations are nuclear powers .
because " there are no great powers which have significant problems with their neighbors .
so therefore resolving the disputes with pakistan is an important one purely from an instrumental perspective , " he explains .
one might think that india has already enough issues to solve with pakistan .
but india also shares a border with china .
both are powerhouses in the region in terms of the size of their respective populations and economies .
as economic relations between the two intensify , political conflicts are on the rise , especially as china becomes more successful and dominant .
strategic game it is a rivalry and partnership .
" since today india ’ s power sector has been already dominated by chinese suppliers .
china is playing a big role in india ’ s telecom industry , " says mohan , " we might even invite chinese companies to build roads in india .
so , on the economic side you see an expansion of the partnership .
more on the political side , in terms of how we look at each other , more in terms of our boundaries our perspective role in asia and in the world there is a problem . "
china is also a close ally of pakistan .
and amidst all of this there is another player : the usa .
in recent years the united states has tried to court india ’ s partnership , also to balance china ’ s growing influence within asia .
india is happy to deepen its relationship with the us , and is even warming up its old ties with russia to fence china in .
and all the time indian policymakers are looking north , over the himalayas , to see what beijing will do next in the big strategic game in asia in the 21st century .

no one will notice them when they 're out in the woods , anyway , he tells his companion , who he thinks is just 13 years old .
this is " tatort internet , " a new television show that uses fake chat usernames to trick men into thinking they 're talking with young girls or boys and set up a meeting .
then they secretly film the encounter and confront the man with his inappropriate messages , the inappropriate photos he 's sent and his inappropriate intentions .

" there 's the risk that innocent people are being publicly condemned , " she said .
" the german legal system does n't have to resort to mob justice . "
one man featured on the show was identified and then fired from his job where he worked with teens .
he subsequently went missing for several days and his colleagues and family said they feared he may have killed himself .

paula honkanen-schoberth , director of the german league for child protection , told deutsche welle that she was also worried about the vigilante aspect of the television show .

" but in germany we live under the rule of law , and that is why we regard the criminal prosecution as a matter for the police .
and television is not the police .
and should n't act like it is . "
getting the safety message to teens what needs to be done , honkanen-schoberth said , is to get parents talking with their kids about staying safe online .
they should tell them not to give out their name and address or to meet up with strangers alone .
they should let them know they can always come to them if someone is threatening them or pressuring them to do something they do n't want to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents must talk with their children about staying safe online , says honkanen-schoberth honkanen-schoberth said she would welcome a show that addressed these things .
but media expert jo groeber from the german digital institute says the show itself could be a revolutionary way to inform young people about the dangers of the internet and chatting with adult strangers .
" it 's entertaining , it 's even , i 'm afraid to say it , thrilling , " he said .
" it 's probably tasteless , but it reaches the audience . "
one concern he does have , he said , is whether the show 's producers know of potential abusers for months at time before informing the police .
the guttenberg image stephanie zu guttenberg 's presence on the show comes as her husband 's political star gets brighter and brighter .
there 's even been speculation that he could become the country 's next chancellor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephanie zu guttenberg 's role in the show could affect her husband 's career in a survey by the forsa research institute released on wednesday , 25 percent of those surveyed said the defense minister would make a better chancellor than his boss , chancellor angela merkel .

" let 's be honest , the partner of a high-ranking politician is usually on the safe side .
they 're involved in charity work , but they never take any risks , " he said .
" i think the fact that she 's taking a risk will strengthen his image , as the husband of a completely independent wife . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kashmir has been a bone of contention between india and pakistan for decades more than 100 people have died in the last couple of months in indian-administered kashmir .
the disputed region has been a bone of contention between india and pakistan for the past 60 years , with neither side willing to give an inch .
arch-rivals after the mumbai terror attacks of 2008 , which was planned on pakistani soil , diplomatic relations between the two sides cooled down .
the peace process between india and pakistan came to a standstill .
foreign policy expert raja mohan from delhi says pakistan has more than enough problems of its own .
" right now , pakistan is in a bad shape .
not only because of the floods .
the civilian government has problems , the military has gained a lot more power , " says mohan , " so you have a situation where you have no single authority to negotiate to within pakistan .
so i don ’ t see any prospects for any breakthrough .
unless pakistan itself stabilizes to some extent . "
bildunterschrift : arch-rivals armed to the teeth , also with nuclear weapons the other mighty neighbor and india has to solve its issues with pakistan , says raja mohan - not only because both nations are nuclear powers .
because " there are no great powers which have significant problems with their neighbors .
so therefore resolving the disputes with pakistan is an important one purely from an instrumental perspective , " he explains .
one might think that india has already enough issues to solve with pakistan .
but india also shares a border with china .
both are powerhouses in the region in terms of the size of their respective populations and economies .
as economic relations between the two intensify , political conflicts are on the rise , especially as china becomes more successful and dominant .
strategic game it is a rivalry and partnership .
" since today india ’ s power sector has been already dominated by chinese suppliers .
china is playing a big role in india ’ s telecom industry , " says mohan , " we might even invite chinese companies to build roads in india .
so , on the economic side you see an expansion of the partnership .
more on the political side , in terms of how we look at each other , more in terms of our boundaries our perspective role in asia and in the world there is a problem . "
china is also a close ally of pakistan .
and amidst all of this there is another player : the usa .
in recent years the united states has tried to court india ’ s partnership , also to balance china ’ s growing influence within asia .
india is happy to deepen its relationship with the us , and is even warming up its old ties with russia to fence china in .
and all the time indian policymakers are looking north , over the himalayas , to see what beijing will do next in the big strategic game in asia in the 21st century .

in an attempt to get the uk back on track , the chancellor of the exchequer has announced new austerity measures , including half a million job cuts . british chancellor of the exchequer george osborne used a speech to the house of commons on wednesday to announce his country 's biggest public spending cuts since world war ii .
the chancellor outlined budget cuts to the tune of seven billion pounds -lrb- eight billion euros , $ 11 billion -rrb- as well as projected spending reductions of 81 billion pounds over four years .
" today is the day when britain steps back from the brink , when we confront the bills from a decade of debt , " osborne said , to cheers from the government benches in the house .
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- a day of rebuilding , when we set out a four-year plan to put our public services and welfare state on a sustainable footing for the long term , " he added .
slashing the budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans major spending cuts the conservative chancellor outlined wide-reaching austerity measures , including a drop in police budgets , a 24-percent cut in spending by the foreign office and an increase in the state pension age from 65 to 66 in 2020 - six years earlier than previously planned .
the government also intends to slash welfare spending by making changes to incapacity and housing benefits .
the opposition labour party meanwhile accused osborne of playing with people 's futures , with half a million public sector jobs expected to be lost .
while britain has remained true to its overseas aid pledges and increased spending on schools and the national health service , it will now make cuts to departmental budgets at an average of just under 20 percent .
job cuts ' reckless ' reining in spending means cutting some 490,000 public sector jobs , according to the office for budgetary responsibility .
the chancellor said he regretted that many would lose their jobs , but that it " is unavoidable when the country runs out of money . "
shadow chancellor alan johnson came out against the proposed job cuts , saying they were " reckless " and that the british people would suffer .
" today is the day that abstract figures and spread-sheets turn into people 's futures , people 's jobs , people 's services , their prospects for the future , " johnson said .
deficit triples disaster rates but the coalition government has laid blame for the cuts at the door of the previous labour administration for running up significant debts .

" running a deficit of around 10 percent of gdp is just way off the mark , " lilico said , adding that " within europe there are restrictions under treaty rules that say they should have deficits of no more than three percent of gdp . "
" we 're running a deficit well over three times as much as what was previously thought to be the absolute maximum that you should be running even in a disaster scenario , " lilico added .
unions plan to put up a fight trade unions , meanwhile , are promising to fight public sector job losses and have threatened widespread industrial action .

eighty-one billion pounds worth of cuts over four years represent an approximate halving of britain 's budget deficit .

the chancellor outlined budget cuts to the tune of seven billion pounds -lrb- eight billion euros , $ 11 billion -rrb- as well as projected spending reductions of 81 billion pounds over four years .
" today is the day when britain steps back from the brink , when we confront the bills from a decade of debt , " osborne said , to cheers from the government benches in the house .
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- a day of rebuilding , when we set out a four-year plan to put our public services and welfare state on a sustainable footing for the long term , " he added .
slashing the budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans major spending cuts the conservative chancellor outlined wide-reaching austerity measures , including a drop in police budgets , a 24-percent cut in spending by the foreign office and an increase in the state pension age from 65 to 66 in 2020 - six years earlier than previously planned .
the government also intends to slash welfare spending by making changes to incapacity and housing benefits .
the opposition labour party meanwhile accused osborne of playing with people 's futures , with half a million public sector jobs expected to be lost .
while britain has remained true to its overseas aid pledges and increased spending on schools and the national health service , it will now make cuts to departmental budgets at an average of just under 20 percent .
job cuts ' reckless ' reining in spending means cutting some 490,000 public sector jobs , according to the office for budgetary responsibility .
the chancellor said he regretted that many would lose their jobs , but that it " is unavoidable when the country runs out of money . "
shadow chancellor alan johnson came out against the proposed job cuts , saying they were " reckless " and that the british people would suffer .
" today is the day that abstract figures and spread-sheets turn into people 's futures , people 's jobs , people 's services , their prospects for the future , " johnson said .
deficit triples disaster rates but the coalition government has laid blame for the cuts at the door of the previous labour administration for running up significant debts .
they insist that action must be taken now , and rapidly , if investor confidence in the british economy is to be restored .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the queen 's allowance will be affected by budget cuts the sheer size of britain 's debts makes cuts necessary , according to dr. andrew lilico , chief economist at right-of-center think tank policy exchange .
" running a deficit of around 10 percent of gdp is just way off the mark , " lilico said , adding that " within europe there are restrictions under treaty rules that say they should have deficits of no more than three percent of gdp . "
" we 're running a deficit well over three times as much as what was previously thought to be the absolute maximum that you should be running even in a disaster scenario , " lilico added .
unions plan to put up a fight trade unions , meanwhile , are promising to fight public sector job losses and have threatened widespread industrial action .
already on wednesday , protesters descended on westminster to express their disapproval of the austerity measures .
eighty-one billion pounds worth of cuts over four years represent an approximate halving of britain 's budget deficit .
the coalition government claims this will restore the economy to health , although opponents argue the measures may have the opposite effect , plunging britain back into recession .

along for the ride is defense minister theodor zu guttenberg 's wife , who co-hosts the show . the man 's face and body is completely pixilated .
his voice is distorted .
but it 's easy enough to see what this guy wants .
he 's had the windows of his car tinted so no one can see inside .
no one will notice them when they 're out in the woods , anyway , he tells his companion , who he thinks is just 13 years old .
this is " tatort internet , " a new television show that uses fake chat usernames to trick men into thinking they 're talking with young girls or boys and set up a meeting .
then they secretly film the encounter and confront the man with his inappropriate messages , the inappropriate photos he 's sent and his inappropriate intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister says the show could put innocent people at risk the show is co-hosted by stephanie zu guttenberg , the wife of german defense minister theodor zu guttenberg .
that did n't stop fellow cabinet member and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from expressing her distaste for the show to the newspaper passauer neue presse .
" there 's the risk that innocent people are being publicly condemned , " she said .
" the german legal system does n't have to resort to mob justice . "
one man featured on the show was identified and then fired from his job where he worked with teens .
he subsequently went missing for several days and his colleagues and family said they feared he may have killed himself .
he has since resurfaced .
paula honkanen-schoberth , director of the german league for child protection , told deutsche welle that she was also worried about the vigilante aspect of the television show .
" of course we think that sexual abuse is a severe crime and must be prosecuted in all possible , but legal ways , " she said .
" but in germany we live under the rule of law , and that is why we regard the criminal prosecution as a matter for the police .
and television is not the police .
and should n't act like it is . "
getting the safety message to teens what needs to be done , honkanen-schoberth said , is to get parents talking with their kids about staying safe online .
they should tell them not to give out their name and address or to meet up with strangers alone .
they should let them know they can always come to them if someone is threatening them or pressuring them to do something they do n't want to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents must talk with their children about staying safe online , says honkanen-schoberth honkanen-schoberth said she would welcome a show that addressed these things .
but media expert jo groeber from the german digital institute says the show itself could be a revolutionary way to inform young people about the dangers of the internet and chatting with adult strangers .
" it 's entertaining , it 's even , i 'm afraid to say it , thrilling , " he said .
" it 's probably tasteless , but it reaches the audience . "
one concern he does have , he said , is whether the show 's producers know of potential abusers for months at time before informing the police .
the guttenberg image stephanie zu guttenberg 's presence on the show comes as her husband 's political star gets brighter and brighter .
there 's even been speculation that he could become the country 's next chancellor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephanie zu guttenberg 's role in the show could affect her husband 's career in a survey by the forsa research institute released on wednesday , 25 percent of those surveyed said the defense minister would make a better chancellor than his boss , chancellor angela merkel .
this new role for stephanie zu guttenberg will only enhance her husband 's image , according to groebel .
" let 's be honest , the partner of a high-ranking politician is usually on the safe side .
they 're involved in charity work , but they never take any risks , " he said .
" i think the fact that she 's taking a risk will strengthen his image , as the husband of a completely independent wife . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.10.2010 merkel 's cabinet approves reform to unemployment benefits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have attacked minimal hikes to unemployment payments the german government has put forth a bill to increase unemployment payments by five euros a month - but critics say it 's not enough .
included in the resolution are 700 million euros to help educate poor children . the german cabinet on wednesday approved proposed legislation that would reform state benefits for the long-term unemployed .
the new policy would see the basic welfare payments , known as hartz iv , raised to 364 euros -lrb- $ 505 -rrb- per adult recipient per month - a five euro increase over the current rate .
in order to satisfy a constitutional court ruling , the bill must be passed into law by year 's end .
chancellor merkel 's center-right coalition government does n't have a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , and the opposition has said that it will only approve the bill if signifigant amendments are made .
merkel defends reforms against criticism since chancellor merkel 's center-right coalition government unveiled its proposals last month , opposition parties have criticized the increase as being too small .
" a failure to massively raise -lsb- welfare -rsb- rates will mean a permanent state of poverty and marginalization , " said gregor gysi , the head of the left party 's parliamentary group .
the chancellor meanwhile defended the welfare reforms .
" hartz iv is not a way of life , " merkel said in berlin on wednesday , adding that the payments were " meant as a bridge back to employment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen called on germany 's parties to work together to pass the reform more money for education the new measures , which are expected to cost an additional 900 million euros , include 700 million to improve education for children in welfare recipient households .
yet opponents say the education package is not enough either .
gysi said it was " not enough to finance a sports club or a music school and certainly not remedial courses . "
chancellor merkel expressed some sympathy for welfare beneficiaries , saying , " i know that -lsb- these cuts -rsb- can be hard .
but there must be some motivation to go back to work . "
the new regulation needs to be passed into law before the end of the year , to satisfy a court ruling that deemed the way the payments have been calculated up until now to be unconstitutional . the government hopes to be able to implement the reforms on january 1 , 2011 .
labor minister ursula von der leyen called on all parties to work together in order to make the reform work , saying that the “ this tight deadline means we all have to take responsibility . ”

now the eu 's executive is considering a ban of the drug called meow meow . the european commission on wednesday called for a ban of the party drug , mephedrone , also known as " meow meow , " which has hallucinogenic effects similar to ecstasy . while the drug is illegal in 15 of the european union 's 27-memberbloc , including germany , estonia and romania , it remains legal in others , including spain , portugal , and greece . " mephedrone is a dangerous drug that is available online and on the street corner , " viviane reding , the eu 's justice commissioner , said in a statement .
" we have a responsibility to protect young people against dangerous new psychoactive substances like mephedrone , " she said . the drug has been linked to 37 deaths in britain and ireland and the commission 's proposal would make it an offense to manufacture or sell mephedrone .
before it could go into effect , the proposal would have to be approved by the eu 's member states . predominantly a ' youth phenomenon ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding called to ban mephedrone across the eu mephedrone hydrochloride salt , as the drug is scientifically known , is a white powder and is commercially available from chemical suppliers on the internet .

" the center 's report added that its use is " predominantly a youth phenomenon , in particular of 15 to 24-year-olds , with rates of drug use higher in males than in females , predominantly from urban areas , who frequent clubs , discos and dance events . " while the proposed ban may not have an immediate effect on the drug 's user base , it may deter newcomers . " i think it might have an effect on people who do n't have a history of other drug taking , " karen mcelrath , an expert in criminology and drug use at queen 's university in belfast , northern ireland , said in an interview with deutsche welle . " if somebody had tried cannabis , alcohol and then they got into mephedrone , i think a ban might have an effect on those people , " she added . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is facing an uphill battle to win support for the idea , with opposition being spearheaded by germany , france and britain . the european commission 's proposal to introduce a europe-wide value-added tax is being met with stiff resistance from the 27-member bloc 's economic powerhouses , germany , france and britain .
the commission wants to introduce direct taxation from brussels for the 2014-2020 budget due to fears that cash-strapped governments may want to reduce their contributions to the bloc .
" at times where public spending is under pressure , we suggest ways to achieve a european budget that is up to the challenges we are facing collectively , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso .
among the eu executive 's proposals are the creation of a separate value-added tax , an eu energy tax or an eu corporate income tax .
under the current system , the eu raises about three quarters of its budget from national government contributions .
" this is not such a bad system because the national governments have a strong incentive to press for fiscal discipline in brussels , " professor friedrich heinemann of the centre for european economic research in mannheim told deutsche welle fears of eu expansion heinemann thinks the move is aimed at expanding the eu 's budget .
" why has the european commission been pressing so hard for years and even decades for a european tax ? " he asked . " it 's about preparing a more aggressive expansion of the budget .
this is a central interest of the european commission and the idea is to let the eu budget grow . "
those in favor of the tax believe it will create more transparency and add value to european decisions by giving europe real power to pool its resources to work on special projects .
" i do n't want the eu to deal with the size and shape of bananas .
i would like the eu to create value added at the european level , with things like large research projects , " henrik enderlein , professor of political economy at the hertie school of governance in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the eu can only do if it has this autonomous spending and taxing capacity , " he added critics are worried about tax increases .
the recent recession and debt crisis has already forced national governments to cut budgets and raise taxes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european wide vat could hit consumers but enderlein does n't think this will necessarily lead to more taxation .
he says that germany knows exactly which proportion of its tax is sent to europe and the european parliament could effectively replace this .
he argues that the elected european parliament would provide adequate democratic controls .
" look at the united states : in every state there is a different value added tax and that works perfectly well and so there can be taxation at different levels and i do n't see why this would n't function in the european union , " he told deutsche welle . observers say it is unlikely that such a form of direct taxation will be passed by the eu anytime soon , but enderlein thinks that it 's inevitable that countries sharing a single currency will eventually want to have taxation at european level .
" the process of eu integration is a process of unlikely events ultimately taking place .
nobody thought the single currency would appear or that borders would be abolished , but we saw all of these happen , " enderlein told deutsche welle .
to be adopted , any proposal must be approved by the eu 's member states and the european parliament .
the european commission plans to present proposed legislation by july of next year .

india is widely viewed as an emerging great power in asia .
the south asian sub-continent is on the rise politically as well as economically .
but india has to cope with several key issues to secure its new-found status . the crisis-torn region of kashmir has experienced one of its bloodiest summers ever .
after a teenager was allegedly killed by indian security forces violence erupted amongst young kashmiris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kashmir has been a bone of contention between india and pakistan for decades more than 100 people have died in the last couple of months in indian-administered kashmir .
the disputed region has been a bone of contention between india and pakistan for the past 60 years , with neither side willing to give an inch .
arch-rivals after the mumbai terror attacks of 2008 , which was planned on pakistani soil , diplomatic relations between the two sides cooled down .
the peace process between india and pakistan came to a standstill .
foreign policy expert raja mohan from delhi says pakistan has more than enough problems of its own .
" right now , pakistan is in a bad shape .
not only because of the floods .
the civilian government has problems , the military has gained a lot more power , " says mohan , " so you have a situation where you have no single authority to negotiate to within pakistan .
so i don ’ t see any prospects for any breakthrough .
unless pakistan itself stabilizes to some extent . "
bildunterschrift : arch-rivals armed to the teeth , also with nuclear weapons the other mighty neighbor and india has to solve its issues with pakistan , says raja mohan - not only because both nations are nuclear powers .
because " there are no great powers which have significant problems with their neighbors .
so therefore resolving the disputes with pakistan is an important one purely from an instrumental perspective , " he explains .
one might think that india has already enough issues to solve with pakistan .
but india also shares a border with china .
both are powerhouses in the region in terms of the size of their respective populations and economies .
as economic relations between the two intensify , political conflicts are on the rise , especially as china becomes more successful and dominant .
strategic game it is a rivalry and partnership .
" since today india ’ s power sector has been already dominated by chinese suppliers .
china is playing a big role in india ’ s telecom industry , " says mohan , " we might even invite chinese companies to build roads in india .
so , on the economic side you see an expansion of the partnership .
more on the political side , in terms of how we look at each other , more in terms of our boundaries our perspective role in asia and in the world there is a problem . "
china is also a close ally of pakistan .
and amidst all of this there is another player : the usa .
in recent years the united states has tried to court india ’ s partnership , also to balance china ’ s growing influence within asia .
india is happy to deepen its relationship with the us , and is even warming up its old ties with russia to fence china in .
and all the time indian policymakers are looking north , over the himalayas , to see what beijing will do next in the big strategic game in asia in the 21st century .

included in the resolution are 700 million euros to help educate poor children . the german cabinet on wednesday approved proposed legislation that would reform state benefits for the long-term unemployed .
the new policy would see the basic welfare payments , known as hartz iv , raised to 364 euros -lrb- $ 505 -rrb- per adult recipient per month - a five euro increase over the current rate .
in order to satisfy a constitutional court ruling , the bill must be passed into law by year 's end .
chancellor merkel 's center-right coalition government does n't have a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , and the opposition has said that it will only approve the bill if signifigant amendments are made .
merkel defends reforms against criticism since chancellor merkel 's center-right coalition government unveiled its proposals last month , opposition parties have criticized the increase as being too small .
" a failure to massively raise -lsb- welfare -rsb- rates will mean a permanent state of poverty and marginalization , " said gregor gysi , the head of the left party 's parliamentary group .
the chancellor meanwhile defended the welfare reforms .
" hartz iv is not a way of life , " merkel said in berlin on wednesday , adding that the payments were " meant as a bridge back to employment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen called on germany 's parties to work together to pass the reform more money for education the new measures , which are expected to cost an additional 900 million euros , include 700 million to improve education for children in welfare recipient households .
yet opponents say the education package is not enough either .
gysi said it was " not enough to finance a sports club or a music school and certainly not remedial courses . "
chancellor merkel expressed some sympathy for welfare beneficiaries , saying , " i know that -lsb- these cuts -rsb- can be hard .
but there must be some motivation to go back to work . "
the new regulation needs to be passed into law before the end of the year , to satisfy a court ruling that deemed the way the payments have been calculated up until now to be unconstitutional . the government hopes to be able to implement the reforms on january 1 , 2011 .
labor minister ursula von der leyen called on all parties to work together in order to make the reform work , saying that the “ this tight deadline means we all have to take responsibility . ”

his address had important messages for germans and turks , says baha gungor of dw 's turkish service . the omens for christian wulff 's third trip abroad as german president , this time to turkey , were unfavorable .
in germany , a debate on integration was raging , charged with emotions .
the weekly magazine " focus " published a cover with wulff 's face on it - distorted as an islamic prayer leader .
wulff had , however , merely pointed out in an october 3 speech that islam - in addition to christianity and judaism - is part of life in germany . public attention became focused on the first speech given by a german president to the turkish parliament .
wulff did not mince words .
for one , he repeated that islam has become an integral part of germany .
he also demanded that turkey acknowledge that christianity has a place in turkey , and that christians there should be free to worship as they wish .
that included priests being trained in turkey , he said , which is not possible now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha gungor , head of dw 's turkish department wulff did not avoid critical topics , such as turkey 's difficult relationship with cyprus and armenia .
not least , he affirmed israel 's right to exist while demanding an autonomous , viable and democratically ruled palestine .
that was an indirect request for turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to resume dialogue with israel . wulff refrained from making empty promises regarding turkey joining the european union .
shrewdly , clearly and unmistakably , wulff said that regardless of the democratic and economic progress turkey has indeed made , eu membership was not a foregone conclusion . the most distinct messages that wulff addressed to both germans and turks had to do with the need for people of turkish descent in germany to find a place in german society .
it was striking that wulff avoided using the loaded word " integration . "
his call for immigrants to learn the german language had been supported by the turkish president abdullah gul in the run-up to his visit .
and gul did not forget to mention in a joint press conference ahead of wulff 's speech that he was the president of all turkish citizens - those with armenian , jewish and greek roots included - and that all people in turkey should speak turkish . wulff 's five-day state visit will evidently help to minimize misunderstanding between berlin and ankara .
wulff 's manner has been well-received and his cautious words will not be ignored . whether a change of direction in germany 's out-of-control integration debate can be expected remains to be seen ; wulff does not have to win elections anymore . certain politicians , on the other hand , are not likely to pass on the strategy of pitting popular emotions against foreigners and migrants for their election campaigns . author : baha gungor -lrb- sst / rc -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 20.10.2010 invasive species deserve greater attention , experts warn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiger mosquito is benefiting from global warming species that are n't native to europe are costing the eu billions of euros and threating the continent 's biodiversity .
the eu admits there is a policy gap - scientists want them to close it . as governments meet in nagoya , japan , to discuss ways to halt the declining variety of the world 's plants and animals , some german scientists are calling for more action against one of the threats to biodiversity in particular - invasive alien species .
these are plants and animals brought to new habitats either on purpose or as unseen stowaways .
when these alien arrivals come into contact with new ecosystems , the results can be devastating .
carsten nowak from the senckenberg research institute in germany is worried that globalization may be leading to a gradual homogenization of species across the continents .
" if we want to maintain regional differences , we have to somehow stop -lrb- current rates of -rrb- species invasions , " he told deutsche welle .
europe now has 10,000 alien species .
some 10 percent of these are considered invasive , meaning that when they arrive , they tend to eradicate native plants and animals .
the european union acknowledges that this is a problem for the bloc : these invaders are costing european economies 12 billion euros every year in agricultural losses and health care costs , as well as impoverishing the diversity of local ecosystems .
however , " there is no consistent horizontal coordination at eu level " for tackling this problem , a spokesperson for the eu 's environment policy chief told deutsche welle . so for the time being the bloc is " studying different policy options and can not come up with a more detailed plan of action and measures just yet , " she added . japanese weeds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese knotweed can take over whole riverbanks in germany , one of the most harmful invasive plants is the japanese knotweed .
" in many areas they occupy the whole riverbank and they outcompete the whole native plant community , " nowak said .
the japanese knotweed was deliberately introduced to europe as a decorative plant around 200 years ago .
since then , it has expanded extensively , making it difficult for other plants to grow .
japanese knotweed is almost impossible to get rid of , because its roots can dig up to three meters into the ground and broken roots can grow to become new plants .
in many cases , scientists do n't actually know what the long-term impact of invasive species , like the japanese knotweed will be , but worst-case-scenarios include the extinction of local competitors , with a cascading effect on other plants and animals in the food chain . this can be a slow process , or it can be rapid .
nowak says , for example , that the egyptian goose has been particularly aggressive in its conquest of the rhine , pushing out other duck species in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballast water can take aquatic life to new habitats a globalized problem increasing deliveries of goods across the globe has made it a lot easier for insects , fungi , bacteria and other pests to travel as stowaways on planes , trucks and boats .
for example , major problems can be caused just through ballast water .
when a ship takes on water as ballast it also sucks up organisms , which it may dump later at a destination far away .
it is feared that this is how the " killer shrimp " could cross the atlantic to north america , after already having made its way from eastern to western europe .
" the killer shrimps have few natural predators , so they 're found in absolutely huge population sizes .
they feed on other species , even on other closely related shrimps , so shortly after their arrival , they eradicated a lot of native species , " nowak said .
other invasive species prefer to fly .
with flight times getting shorter in recent decades , and more freight being flown around the world , the threat from the skies has increased dramatically in the last 50 years .
at frankfurt international airport , a team of inspectors has just three hours to check incoming goods like fruit and flowers for fungi , insects and plants .
" certain goods , like basil , mangos , egg plants and celery have to be inspected for pests like leaf miner flies and fruit flies when they arrive at the airport " , hans-juergen hess , manager of the plant protection service at frankfurt international airport , told deutsche welle .
yet it 's not just the contents of the boxes which pose a threat .
wooden pallets accompanying the boxes can harbor the asian long-horned beetle .
it 's the forester 's worst nightmare because the beetle lays its eggs inside trees and when they hatch , they basically eat their way out .
to tackle this threat , hess checks that pallets have had a heat treatment which kills the beetles and their larvae .
climate change and new frontiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian geese have successfully colonized the rhine valley at the same time that climate change is shutting down habitats for some species , it is opening up new areas for others , like the tiger mosquito , one of europe 's more recent arrivals from the tropical climate of southeast asia .
" with global warming , it 's just a question of time before tiger mosquitoes cross the alps from italy , " christian melaun from the biodiversity and climate research center in frankfurt told deutsche welle .
tiger mosquitoes were originally transported to albania in a batch of tires in 1979 .
from there they made their way to italy .
they are a serious cause for concern , because they carry diseases like dengue fever .
border controls can only do so much against flying insects like tiger mosquitoes .
the job of dealing with pesky intruders once they 've arrived is taken up by scientists all over europe , like christian melaun .
melaun believes it 's crucial to identify and eradicate new invasive species quickly , but he thinks this research is n't coordinated enough at the moment .
" there are really no first warning systems in germany and no european-wide plans to control invasive species .
this is a big problem not only to human health , but also to biodiversity and the economy . "

instead of recreating pre-crisis life , they should stimulate economies so people are n't forced to live off foreign aid . dr. peter walker , the founder of the world disasters report , advocated professionalizing the disaster response business , developing both the global code of conduct for disaster workers and the sphere humanitarian standards .
he is the director of the feinstein international center at tufts university in the united states , and is involved in research into possible future global drivers of humanitarian crises , and the effectiveness of the international humanitarian system . he told deutsche welle about the changes in mentality that he thinks would make development aid more effective over the long-term . deutsche welle : you have put forward the premise that responding to humanitarian crises is becoming more problematic .
what is the problem ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development aid groups need to rethink their strategies , walker said dr. peter walker : i think what 's becoming problematic is the model we use .
the traditional model is that disasters are abnormal .
they knock you down , then you have response , and the response puts people back in a position to carry on with normal life .
just like the way we would recover after a car accident .
but what the research is showing is that as you have more processes that affect the way our economies work - like climate change , globalization , the increase in organized crime - there is a stress on society , and when there 's a crisis it 's much larger than it was in the past and it is much more pervasive .
it actually changes the direction of development and the way society moves forward .
that 's very different from what happened in the past . you almost need to think it 's no longer a temporary thing .
these crises permanently affect large populations and large parts of the economy , so we need to respond differently .
it 's not a sideshow anymore .
it 's actually an integral part of the economies .
that means aid agencies have to change the way they think about disaster response : how they work with local governments , how they can do a lot of work beforehand to try and influence the way governments look at risk reduction in their community . what needs to change ? the analysis that we 've done is that the old notion of quick crisis and long-term development is not quite right .
you have this body of people in the middle who essentially live off what is tantamount to an international social welfare system - in refugee camps , in internally displaced persons camps .
many of the pastoralist populations around the world are in this state , people who are living on the margins of cities and shanty towns , where there 's no obvious way forward in development terms , levels of violence are very high and effectively the main source of livelihood they have is humanitarian assistance .
but that 's just like being drip-fed in a hospital ward .
people do n't want to be in that position .
people are the same the world over .
they want to build a better future for their kids , and so they want to have economic opportunities . you advocate stimulating the economies of conflict-ridden states even as the conflict unfolds .
is that feasible ? i think we have really got to look again at how we work in these crisis situations .
you ca n't wait for stability before you start development .
somalia has n't been stable for 20 years ; it is not going to be stable .
that 's the reality .
so do you do development there ?
that 's really what agencies should be focusing on – how do you stimulate an economy in high levels of violence so that people have an opportunity . can you really stimulate an economy in times of violence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enabling trade would help those suffering in darfur the answer is yes , you can stimulate economies in crisis situations .
for instance , we are doing research in darfur , and one of the things that is obvious in darfur is that as a region it basically works by trading networks .
different agro-ecological zones , the desert in the north to tropics in the south , you need to trade .
everybody in darfur knows that , and conflict disrupts that trade .
re-establishing trade and the ability to move is in most people 's best interests .
even those who control armed groups , the money has to come from somewhere , and trade is a good thing .
you can establish trading networks and get the economy moving again .
it takes a bit of lateral thinking about how you 're going to do it , but it 's possible . do you see development agencies thinking on these lines ? i think there 's a certain inertia within aid agencies to approach crises in this fashion .
it 's still easier essentially just to provide social welfare services , and that 's absolutely necessary where the alternative is starvation , death from disease or lack of shelter .
but how do you build on that to go further ?
essentially what our research is showing is that just doing life-saving humanitarian assistance is necessary but not sufficient in these crises . who 's going to nudge the system in the direction you 're suggesting ? what works is trying to change the standards that people expect and the approaches they take .
that 's actually how most of our systems in the west work .
they are not through command and control .
they are through ratcheting up people 's expectations .
the way a health system improves in a country is because as a consumer you expect a certain higher level .
you become educated , you know what 's available and that moves the system in a certain direction .
i think that 's the approach : how do you change the expectations within aid agencies of what is good aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone use will let more people 's voices be heard to be honest , it 's also going to change because you 're going to find that the survivor populations in these areas have the ability to have a say .
the influence mobile phones have had in many of these crises in the last few years has been stunning because it enables people to have a voice .
that is going to change things dramatically in the next 10 years .
the populations that you 're serving will not be passive . you are critical of military humanitarianism , in afghanistan for instance , suggesting it 's a " weapons system " that is not attuned to the people 's real concerns . the purpose of any military system is to try and improve security .
you can think of things like money being a weapons system because you can use money to stimulate an economy , to improve security and to bribe people to improve security . from research we 've carried out in our center in afghanistan recently , when you really started to talk to afghans about what they thought caused insecurity what really angered them was n't really poverty .
it was the failure of governance .
the fact that they felt they did n't have leaders who represented them anymore , that they could n't trust leadership .
everywhere they turned , they saw corruption and people benefitting from the aid business but not them .
one of the things we 've realized is that if you 're running an aid project where you 're trying to spend a lot of money very quickly , in an area you do n't know , maybe in a field you have n't worked in very often , it fuels corruption and effectively makes it less secure . interview : ranjitha balasubramanyam editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his address had important messages for germans and turks , says baha gungor of dw 's turkish service . the omens for christian wulff 's third trip abroad as german president , this time to turkey , were unfavorable .
in germany , a debate on integration was raging , charged with emotions .
the weekly magazine " focus " published a cover with wulff 's face on it - distorted as an islamic prayer leader .
wulff had , however , merely pointed out in an october 3 speech that islam - in addition to christianity and judaism - is part of life in germany . public attention became focused on the first speech given by a german president to the turkish parliament .
wulff did not mince words .
for one , he repeated that islam has become an integral part of germany .
he also demanded that turkey acknowledge that christianity has a place in turkey , and that christians there should be free to worship as they wish .
that included priests being trained in turkey , he said , which is not possible now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha gungor , head of dw 's turkish department wulff did not avoid critical topics , such as turkey 's difficult relationship with cyprus and armenia .
not least , he affirmed israel 's right to exist while demanding an autonomous , viable and democratically ruled palestine .
that was an indirect request for turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to resume dialogue with israel . wulff refrained from making empty promises regarding turkey joining the european union .
shrewdly , clearly and unmistakably , wulff said that regardless of the democratic and economic progress turkey has indeed made , eu membership was not a foregone conclusion . the most distinct messages that wulff addressed to both germans and turks had to do with the need for people of turkish descent in germany to find a place in german society .
it was striking that wulff avoided using the loaded word " integration . "
his call for immigrants to learn the german language had been supported by the turkish president abdullah gul in the run-up to his visit .
and gul did not forget to mention in a joint press conference ahead of wulff 's speech that he was the president of all turkish citizens - those with armenian , jewish and greek roots included - and that all people in turkey should speak turkish . wulff 's five-day state visit will evidently help to minimize misunderstanding between berlin and ankara .
wulff 's manner has been well-received and his cautious words will not be ignored . whether a change of direction in germany 's out-of-control integration debate can be expected remains to be seen ; wulff does not have to win elections anymore . certain politicians , on the other hand , are not likely to pass on the strategy of pitting popular emotions against foreigners and migrants for their election campaigns . author : baha gungor -lrb- sst / rc -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 20.10.2010 invasive species deserve greater attention , experts warn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiger mosquito is benefiting from global warming species that are n't native to europe are costing the eu billions of euros and threating the continent 's biodiversity .
the eu admits there is a policy gap - scientists want them to close it . as governments meet in nagoya , japan , to discuss ways to halt the declining variety of the world 's plants and animals , some german scientists are calling for more action against one of the threats to biodiversity in particular - invasive alien species .
these are plants and animals brought to new habitats either on purpose or as unseen stowaways .
when these alien arrivals come into contact with new ecosystems , the results can be devastating .
carsten nowak from the senckenberg research institute in germany is worried that globalization may be leading to a gradual homogenization of species across the continents .
" if we want to maintain regional differences , we have to somehow stop -lrb- current rates of -rrb- species invasions , " he told deutsche welle .
europe now has 10,000 alien species .
some 10 percent of these are considered invasive , meaning that when they arrive , they tend to eradicate native plants and animals .
the european union acknowledges that this is a problem for the bloc : these invaders are costing european economies 12 billion euros every year in agricultural losses and health care costs , as well as impoverishing the diversity of local ecosystems .
however , " there is no consistent horizontal coordination at eu level " for tackling this problem , a spokesperson for the eu 's environment policy chief told deutsche welle . so for the time being the bloc is " studying different policy options and can not come up with a more detailed plan of action and measures just yet , " she added . japanese weeds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese knotweed can take over whole riverbanks in germany , one of the most harmful invasive plants is the japanese knotweed .
" in many areas they occupy the whole riverbank and they outcompete the whole native plant community , " nowak said .
the japanese knotweed was deliberately introduced to europe as a decorative plant around 200 years ago .
since then , it has expanded extensively , making it difficult for other plants to grow .
japanese knotweed is almost impossible to get rid of , because its roots can dig up to three meters into the ground and broken roots can grow to become new plants .
in many cases , scientists do n't actually know what the long-term impact of invasive species , like the japanese knotweed will be , but worst-case-scenarios include the extinction of local competitors , with a cascading effect on other plants and animals in the food chain . this can be a slow process , or it can be rapid .
nowak says , for example , that the egyptian goose has been particularly aggressive in its conquest of the rhine , pushing out other duck species in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballast water can take aquatic life to new habitats a globalized problem increasing deliveries of goods across the globe has made it a lot easier for insects , fungi , bacteria and other pests to travel as stowaways on planes , trucks and boats .
for example , major problems can be caused just through ballast water .
when a ship takes on water as ballast it also sucks up organisms , which it may dump later at a destination far away .
it is feared that this is how the " killer shrimp " could cross the atlantic to north america , after already having made its way from eastern to western europe .
" the killer shrimps have few natural predators , so they 're found in absolutely huge population sizes .
they feed on other species , even on other closely related shrimps , so shortly after their arrival , they eradicated a lot of native species , " nowak said .
other invasive species prefer to fly .
with flight times getting shorter in recent decades , and more freight being flown around the world , the threat from the skies has increased dramatically in the last 50 years .
at frankfurt international airport , a team of inspectors has just three hours to check incoming goods like fruit and flowers for fungi , insects and plants .
" certain goods , like basil , mangos , egg plants and celery have to be inspected for pests like leaf miner flies and fruit flies when they arrive at the airport " , hans-juergen hess , manager of the plant protection service at frankfurt international airport , told deutsche welle .
yet it 's not just the contents of the boxes which pose a threat .
wooden pallets accompanying the boxes can harbor the asian long-horned beetle .
it 's the forester 's worst nightmare because the beetle lays its eggs inside trees and when they hatch , they basically eat their way out .
to tackle this threat , hess checks that pallets have had a heat treatment which kills the beetles and their larvae .
climate change and new frontiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian geese have successfully colonized the rhine valley at the same time that climate change is shutting down habitats for some species , it is opening up new areas for others , like the tiger mosquito , one of europe 's more recent arrivals from the tropical climate of southeast asia .
" with global warming , it 's just a question of time before tiger mosquitoes cross the alps from italy , " christian melaun from the biodiversity and climate research center in frankfurt told deutsche welle .
tiger mosquitoes were originally transported to albania in a batch of tires in 1979 .
from there they made their way to italy .
they are a serious cause for concern , because they carry diseases like dengue fever .
border controls can only do so much against flying insects like tiger mosquitoes .
the job of dealing with pesky intruders once they 've arrived is taken up by scientists all over europe , like christian melaun .
melaun believes it 's crucial to identify and eradicate new invasive species quickly , but he thinks this research is n't coordinated enough at the moment .
" there are really no first warning systems in germany and no european-wide plans to control invasive species .
this is a big problem not only to human health , but also to biodiversity and the economy . "

the move comes as his unpopular government is poised to implement painful austerity measures to combat a huge budget deficit . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has announced his biggest cabinet shuffle since taking office in 2004 .
in a nationally televised speech zapatero said that spain needed “ a politically strong ” and experienced government to manage the country ’ s difficult economic situation .
the cabinet shuffle is being seen as an effort to tackle the government ’ s widespread unpopularity in face of painful austerity measures .
zapatero 's government is poised to implement major spending cuts while at the same time raising taxes in an effort to reduce the country 's gaping public deficit and avoid a greek-style debt crisis .
the country ’ s unemployment rate stands at 20 percent - the highest in the european union .
recent opinion polls indicate that the opposition conservative popular party has the most support among the electorate , with a lead of around 15 percentage points over zapatero ’ s socialists . the prime minister 's approval rate has sunk to below 30 percent , the worst since his re-election in 2008 .
unexpected changes the extent of the shuffle came as a surprise as initially the prime minister ’ s office had only announced that labor minister celestine corbacho would be replaced .
his successor is the secretary general for employment , valeriano gomez .
interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba is to replace deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega .
rubalcaba , who is widely seen as a potential successor to zapatero , will however retain his old portfolio . the changes will also see foreign minister miguel angel moratinos be replaced by current health minister trinidad jimenez .
both moratinos and vega have been in office since the socialists won the 2004 elections .
the shuffle will also affect the health and the environment ministries .
the portfolio for housing and equality is being dissolved as part of the efforts to cut government spending .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 20.10.2010 debate about islam in germany heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has seen a rise in anti-islamic feeling germany 's top-selling non-fiction bestseller is a book that attacks islam - and the german president ca n't get the public to agree with him when he says that islam is part of germany . thilo sarrazin , former state finance minister in berlin and just a short time ago on the board of the german central bank , has written a bestseller : " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany is doing away with itself " -rrb- .
he predicts a dire future for the country and he blames it above all on islam and the uncontrolled immigration of muslims .
most muslims have different values than the germans , he writes .
they ostensibly hold god higher than the constitutional state and democracy .
this is the reason , he claims , why germany will gradually do away with itself if it does n't carry out an active immigration and integration debate .
sarrazin 's arguments are meeting with a great deal of support .
but he is also encountering opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book has sparked much of the recent debate michael bommes , a sociologist teaching at the university of osnabrueck , notes that the current debate about islam shows that most people have still to grasp the fact that germany has long since become a country of immigrants , with a correspondingly complex diversity of values and viewpoints .
" through modern international immigration , world religions such as islam have now arrived in europe , " says bommes .
he argues that muslims have to adjust to this situation , as do the citizens of other european nations .
the relationships between politics , law and religion have to be rethought , he says .
people have always had to find compromises over these three elements .
and islam is making this necessary once more in today 's world .
fear of headscarves and mosques many germans are worried because they see their way of life being called into question by the presence of islam .
they find the headscarves and veils worn by muslim women particularly offensive .
they raise the possibility that these women are being oppressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic headwear is viewed with suspicion by many europeans such concerns are also evident in the results of a study recently published by the friedrich ebert foundation .
oliver decker , who led the study , speaks of a " very distinct increase from 34 percent to over half the population who agree with statements hostile to islam . "
many germans are also skeptical with regard to the building of new mosques , he says .
where do these negative appraisals of islam come from ?
islam scholar navid kermani believes that germans see their identity being threatened .
identity , he explains , is formed when we distinguish ourselves from other groups .
every social group defines itself by how it differs from other groups .
that 's why , he argues , it seems logical to keep one 's distance from islam .
after all , westerners tend to be unfamiliar with islamic symbols , making the religion seem especially alien .
the process of differentiation itself is then only natural .
but it becomes problematic when those who are different are declared to be the enemy .
a sometimes superficial discussion seen in this light , there is nothing reprehensible about the debate on islam .
it seems to reflect primarily the struggle for a new german self-image and the difficulties connected with the fact that germany has indeed become a country of immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western impressions of islam may be too simplistic nevertheless , political scientist claus leggewie contends that the discussions about islam are often conducted on too superficial a level .
most people make little distinction between the various currents within islam .
nor do they make sufficient allowance for the differences between moderate and radical muslims .
" i believe that most europeans tend to develop a rather schematic image of islam , " says leggewie .
he finds it astounding that europeans , who do so much travelling and know the world so well , whose opinions on all other issues are so carefully formed and objective , are often so quick to make superficial judgments when it comes to islam .
but the debate on islam did n't exactly appear out of thin air , either .
it stems from the fact that religion has regained a great deal of power in the middle east itself .
of course people in germany have taken note of this resurgence , explains navid kermani .
the problem is that , in the muslim world as well , many issues are being viewed through a religious lens .
for many years , religion played no role on the political front there .
now all that has changed .
and germany feels threatened , fearing an increasing powerful cocktail of religion and politics here as well .
islam as a way of helping to define europe first and foremost , the battle about islam is an inner-german struggle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate may ultimately be about how international germany should be it 's about how open germany and the germans want to be .
since the end of the nazi dictatorship , germans have agonized about their history , and have developed a troubled relationship with their national identity .
whoever makes a statement about islam , says claus leggewie , is also indirectly speaking out on an entirely different issue - namely , how international germany should be .
" there are islamophobic tendencies on the one side and islamophile leanings on the other , " says leggewie .
" and , as we know , they have historically very frequently been interrelated , even when they seem on the outside to be diametrically opposed .
this very obviously means that islam continues to play an essential role in our construction of what europe means , i.e. in the collective identity of the europeans . "

identity , he explains , is formed when we distinguish ourselves from other groups .
every social group defines itself by how it differs from other groups .
that 's why , he argues , it seems logical to keep one 's distance from islam .
after all , westerners tend to be unfamiliar with islamic symbols , making the religion seem especially alien .
the process of differentiation itself is then only natural .
but it becomes problematic when those who are different are declared to be the enemy .
a sometimes superficial discussion seen in this light , there is nothing reprehensible about the debate on islam .
it seems to reflect primarily the struggle for a new german self-image and the difficulties connected with the fact that germany has indeed become a country of immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western impressions of islam may be too simplistic nevertheless , political scientist claus leggewie contends that the discussions about islam are often conducted on too superficial a level .
most people make little distinction between the various currents within islam .
nor do they make sufficient allowance for the differences between moderate and radical muslims .
" i believe that most europeans tend to develop a rather schematic image of islam , " says leggewie .
he finds it astounding that europeans , who do so much travelling and know the world so well , whose opinions on all other issues are so carefully formed and objective , are often so quick to make superficial judgments when it comes to islam .
but the debate on islam did n't exactly appear out of thin air , either .
it stems from the fact that religion has regained a great deal of power in the middle east itself .
of course people in germany have taken note of this resurgence , explains navid kermani .
the problem is that , in the muslim world as well , many issues are being viewed through a religious lens .
for many years , religion played no role on the political front there .
now all that has changed .
and germany feels threatened , fearing an increasing powerful cocktail of religion and politics here as well .
islam as a way of helping to define europe first and foremost , the battle about islam is an inner-german struggle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate may ultimately be about how international germany should be it 's about how open germany and the germans want to be .
since the end of the nazi dictatorship , germans have agonized about their history , and have developed a troubled relationship with their national identity .
whoever makes a statement about islam , says claus leggewie , is also indirectly speaking out on an entirely different issue - namely , how international germany should be .
" there are islamophobic tendencies on the one side and islamophile leanings on the other , " says leggewie .
" and , as we know , they have historically very frequently been interrelated , even when they seem on the outside to be diametrically opposed .
this very obviously means that islam continues to play an essential role in our construction of what europe means , i.e. in the collective identity of the europeans . "

the timetable means that the last british troops are set to leave 15 years earlier than originally planned . britain is to pull the last of its troops out of germany 15 years ahead of schedule as part of a wide-ranging program of defense cuts .
some 20,000 british service personnel are set to leave germany in the next decade .
the troops , originally stationed in the aftermath of the second world war , had previously been set to remain until 2035 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister cameron announced details of the military cuts " in terms of the return from germany , half our personnel should be back by 2015 and the remainder by 2020 , " prime minister david cameron said on tuesday , announcing details of the defense review .
a representative of the german army told the news agency reuters that the announcement had been unexpected . " we are all surprised , " spokeswoman helga heine said .
" we were not informed of this at all in advance . "
british soldiers are currently based at 12 sites in northern and western germany .
the review found that this was no longer necessary .
the united kingdom , france and the united states maintained troops in west germany throughout the cold war .
" the presence of the british military has played an important role in demonstrating alliance solidarity , and has also been a symbol of steadfast uk-german friendship , " the security review said .
but , it added , " there is no longer any operational requirement for uk forces to be based there . "

some 17,000 service personnel will be cut from the british forces ' payroll . cameron promised that the defense budget would remain the fourth-largest in the world and would meet a nato requirement for members to spend two percent of gross domestic product on defense . the defense cuts are part of a wider raft of measures being introduced by the government to cut spending by some 95 billion euros by 2015 , with the majority of cuts to be announced on wednesday afternoon .

he predicts a dire future for the country and he blames it above all on islam and the uncontrolled immigration of muslims .
most muslims have different values than the germans , he writes .
they ostensibly hold god higher than the constitutional state and democracy .
this is the reason , he claims , why germany will gradually do away with itself if it does n't carry out an active immigration and integration debate .
sarrazin 's arguments are meeting with a great deal of support .
but he is also encountering opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book has sparked much of the recent debate michael bommes , a sociologist teaching at the university of osnabrueck , notes that the current debate about islam shows that most people have still to grasp the fact that germany has long since become a country of immigrants , with a correspondingly complex diversity of values and viewpoints .
" through modern international immigration , world religions such as islam have now arrived in europe , " says bommes .
he argues that muslims have to adjust to this situation , as do the citizens of other european nations .
the relationships between politics , law and religion have to be rethought , he says .
people have always had to find compromises over these three elements .
and islam is making this necessary once more in today 's world .
fear of headscarves and mosques many germans are worried because they see their way of life being called into question by the presence of islam .
they find the headscarves and veils worn by muslim women particularly offensive .
they raise the possibility that these women are being oppressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic headwear is viewed with suspicion by many europeans such concerns are also evident in the results of a study recently published by the friedrich ebert foundation .
oliver decker , who led the study , speaks of a " very distinct increase from 34 percent to over half the population who agree with statements hostile to islam . "
many germans are also skeptical with regard to the building of new mosques , he says .
where do these negative appraisals of islam come from ?

the move comes as his unpopular government is poised to implement painful austerity measures to combat a huge budget deficit . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has announced his biggest cabinet shuffle since taking office in 2004 .
in a nationally televised speech zapatero said that spain needed “ a politically strong ” and experienced government to manage the country ’ s difficult economic situation .
the cabinet shuffle is being seen as an effort to tackle the government ’ s widespread unpopularity in face of painful austerity measures .
zapatero 's government is poised to implement major spending cuts while at the same time raising taxes in an effort to reduce the country 's gaping public deficit and avoid a greek-style debt crisis .
the country ’ s unemployment rate stands at 20 percent - the highest in the european union .
recent opinion polls indicate that the opposition conservative popular party has the most support among the electorate , with a lead of around 15 percentage points over zapatero ’ s socialists . the prime minister 's approval rate has sunk to below 30 percent , the worst since his re-election in 2008 .
unexpected changes the extent of the shuffle came as a surprise as initially the prime minister ’ s office had only announced that labor minister celestine corbacho would be replaced .
his successor is the secretary general for employment , valeriano gomez .
interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba is to replace deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega .
rubalcaba , who is widely seen as a potential successor to zapatero , will however retain his old portfolio . the changes will also see foreign minister miguel angel moratinos be replaced by current health minister trinidad jimenez .
both moratinos and vega have been in office since the socialists won the 2004 elections .
the shuffle will also affect the health and the environment ministries .
the portfolio for housing and equality is being dissolved as part of the efforts to cut government spending .

instead of recreating pre-crisis life , they should stimulate economies so people are n't forced to live off foreign aid . dr. peter walker , the founder of the world disasters report , advocated professionalizing the disaster response business , developing both the global code of conduct for disaster workers and the sphere humanitarian standards .
he is the director of the feinstein international center at tufts university in the united states , and is involved in research into possible future global drivers of humanitarian crises , and the effectiveness of the international humanitarian system . he told deutsche welle about the changes in mentality that he thinks would make development aid more effective over the long-term . deutsche welle : you have put forward the premise that responding to humanitarian crises is becoming more problematic .
what is the problem ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development aid groups need to rethink their strategies , walker said dr. peter walker : i think what 's becoming problematic is the model we use .
the traditional model is that disasters are abnormal .
they knock you down , then you have response , and the response puts people back in a position to carry on with normal life .
just like the way we would recover after a car accident .
but what the research is showing is that as you have more processes that affect the way our economies work - like climate change , globalization , the increase in organized crime - there is a stress on society , and when there 's a crisis it 's much larger than it was in the past and it is much more pervasive .
it actually changes the direction of development and the way society moves forward .
that 's very different from what happened in the past . you almost need to think it 's no longer a temporary thing .
these crises permanently affect large populations and large parts of the economy , so we need to respond differently .
it 's not a sideshow anymore .
it 's actually an integral part of the economies .
that means aid agencies have to change the way they think about disaster response : how they work with local governments , how they can do a lot of work beforehand to try and influence the way governments look at risk reduction in their community . what needs to change ? the analysis that we 've done is that the old notion of quick crisis and long-term development is not quite right .
you have this body of people in the middle who essentially live off what is tantamount to an international social welfare system - in refugee camps , in internally displaced persons camps .
many of the pastoralist populations around the world are in this state , people who are living on the margins of cities and shanty towns , where there 's no obvious way forward in development terms , levels of violence are very high and effectively the main source of livelihood they have is humanitarian assistance .
but that 's just like being drip-fed in a hospital ward .
people do n't want to be in that position .
people are the same the world over .
they want to build a better future for their kids , and so they want to have economic opportunities . you advocate stimulating the economies of conflict-ridden states even as the conflict unfolds .
is that feasible ? i think we have really got to look again at how we work in these crisis situations .
you ca n't wait for stability before you start development .
somalia has n't been stable for 20 years ; it is not going to be stable .
that 's the reality .
so do you do development there ?
that 's really what agencies should be focusing on – how do you stimulate an economy in high levels of violence so that people have an opportunity . can you really stimulate an economy in times of violence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enabling trade would help those suffering in darfur the answer is yes , you can stimulate economies in crisis situations .
for instance , we are doing research in darfur , and one of the things that is obvious in darfur is that as a region it basically works by trading networks .
different agro-ecological zones , the desert in the north to tropics in the south , you need to trade .
everybody in darfur knows that , and conflict disrupts that trade .
re-establishing trade and the ability to move is in most people 's best interests .
even those who control armed groups , the money has to come from somewhere , and trade is a good thing .
you can establish trading networks and get the economy moving again .
it takes a bit of lateral thinking about how you 're going to do it , but it 's possible . do you see development agencies thinking on these lines ? i think there 's a certain inertia within aid agencies to approach crises in this fashion .
it 's still easier essentially just to provide social welfare services , and that 's absolutely necessary where the alternative is starvation , death from disease or lack of shelter .
but how do you build on that to go further ?
essentially what our research is showing is that just doing life-saving humanitarian assistance is necessary but not sufficient in these crises . who 's going to nudge the system in the direction you 're suggesting ? what works is trying to change the standards that people expect and the approaches they take .
that 's actually how most of our systems in the west work .
they are not through command and control .
they are through ratcheting up people 's expectations .
the way a health system improves in a country is because as a consumer you expect a certain higher level .
you become educated , you know what 's available and that moves the system in a certain direction .
i think that 's the approach : how do you change the expectations within aid agencies of what is good aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone use will let more people 's voices be heard to be honest , it 's also going to change because you 're going to find that the survivor populations in these areas have the ability to have a say .
the influence mobile phones have had in many of these crises in the last few years has been stunning because it enables people to have a voice .
that is going to change things dramatically in the next 10 years .
the populations that you 're serving will not be passive . you are critical of military humanitarianism , in afghanistan for instance , suggesting it 's a " weapons system " that is not attuned to the people 's real concerns . the purpose of any military system is to try and improve security .
you can think of things like money being a weapons system because you can use money to stimulate an economy , to improve security and to bribe people to improve security . from research we 've carried out in our center in afghanistan recently , when you really started to talk to afghans about what they thought caused insecurity what really angered them was n't really poverty .
it was the failure of governance .
the fact that they felt they did n't have leaders who represented them anymore , that they could n't trust leadership .
everywhere they turned , they saw corruption and people benefitting from the aid business but not them .
one of the things we 've realized is that if you 're running an aid project where you 're trying to spend a lot of money very quickly , in an area you do n't know , maybe in a field you have n't worked in very often , it fuels corruption and effectively makes it less secure . interview : ranjitha balasubramanyam editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.10.2010 spain 's zapatero shuffles cabinet as government popularity slumps großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's austerity measures are widely unpopular in a surprise decision , spanish prime minister zapatero has announced a major cabinet shuffle .
the move comes as his unpopular government is poised to implement painful austerity measures to combat a huge budget deficit . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has announced his biggest cabinet shuffle since taking office in 2004 .
in a nationally televised speech zapatero said that spain needed “ a politically strong ” and experienced government to manage the country ’ s difficult economic situation .
the cabinet shuffle is being seen as an effort to tackle the government ’ s widespread unpopularity in face of painful austerity measures .
zapatero 's government is poised to implement major spending cuts while at the same time raising taxes in an effort to reduce the country 's gaping public deficit and avoid a greek-style debt crisis .
the country ’ s unemployment rate stands at 20 percent - the highest in the european union .
recent opinion polls indicate that the opposition conservative popular party has the most support among the electorate , with a lead of around 15 percentage points over zapatero ’ s socialists . the prime minister 's approval rate has sunk to below 30 percent , the worst since his re-election in 2008 .
unexpected changes the extent of the shuffle came as a surprise as initially the prime minister ’ s office had only announced that labor minister celestine corbacho would be replaced .
his successor is the secretary general for employment , valeriano gomez .
interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba is to replace deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega .
rubalcaba , who is widely seen as a potential successor to zapatero , will however retain his old portfolio . the changes will also see foreign minister miguel angel moratinos be replaced by current health minister trinidad jimenez .
both moratinos and vega have been in office since the socialists won the 2004 elections .
the shuffle will also affect the health and the environment ministries .
the portfolio for housing and equality is being dissolved as part of the efforts to cut government spending .

the timetable means that the last british troops are set to leave 15 years earlier than originally planned . britain is to pull the last of its troops out of germany 15 years ahead of schedule as part of a wide-ranging program of defense cuts .
some 20,000 british service personnel are set to leave germany in the next decade .
the troops , originally stationed in the aftermath of the second world war , had previously been set to remain until 2035 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister cameron announced details of the military cuts " in terms of the return from germany , half our personnel should be back by 2015 and the remainder by 2020 , " prime minister david cameron said on tuesday , announcing details of the defense review .
a representative of the german army told the news agency reuters that the announcement had been unexpected . " we are all surprised , " spokeswoman helga heine said .
" we were not informed of this at all in advance . "
british soldiers are currently based at 12 sites in northern and western germany .
the review found that this was no longer necessary .
the united kingdom , france and the united states maintained troops in west germany throughout the cold war .
" the presence of the british military has played an important role in demonstrating alliance solidarity , and has also been a symbol of steadfast uk-german friendship , " the security review said .
but , it added , " there is no longer any operational requirement for uk forces to be based there . "
substantial reduction since end of cold war the former british army of the rhine - now british forces germany - had 58,000 soldiers stationed in germany in the 1980s .

some 17,000 service personnel will be cut from the british forces ' payroll . cameron promised that the defense budget would remain the fourth-largest in the world and would meet a nato requirement for members to spend two percent of gross domestic product on defense . the defense cuts are part of a wider raft of measures being introduced by the government to cut spending by some 95 billion euros by 2015 , with the majority of cuts to be announced on wednesday afternoon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 20.10.2010 debate about islam in germany heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has seen a rise in anti-islamic feeling germany 's top-selling non-fiction bestseller is a book that attacks islam - and the german president ca n't get the public to agree with him when he says that islam is part of germany . thilo sarrazin , former state finance minister in berlin and just a short time ago on the board of the german central bank , has written a bestseller : " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany is doing away with itself " -rrb- .
he predicts a dire future for the country and he blames it above all on islam and the uncontrolled immigration of muslims .
most muslims have different values than the germans , he writes .
they ostensibly hold god higher than the constitutional state and democracy .
this is the reason , he claims , why germany will gradually do away with itself if it does n't carry out an active immigration and integration debate .
sarrazin 's arguments are meeting with a great deal of support .
but he is also encountering opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book has sparked much of the recent debate michael bommes , a sociologist teaching at the university of osnabrueck , notes that the current debate about islam shows that most people have still to grasp the fact that germany has long since become a country of immigrants , with a correspondingly complex diversity of values and viewpoints .
" through modern international immigration , world religions such as islam have now arrived in europe , " says bommes .
he argues that muslims have to adjust to this situation , as do the citizens of other european nations .
the relationships between politics , law and religion have to be rethought , he says .
people have always had to find compromises over these three elements .
and islam is making this necessary once more in today 's world .
fear of headscarves and mosques many germans are worried because they see their way of life being called into question by the presence of islam .
they find the headscarves and veils worn by muslim women particularly offensive .
they raise the possibility that these women are being oppressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic headwear is viewed with suspicion by many europeans such concerns are also evident in the results of a study recently published by the friedrich ebert foundation .
oliver decker , who led the study , speaks of a " very distinct increase from 34 percent to over half the population who agree with statements hostile to islam . "
many germans are also skeptical with regard to the building of new mosques , he says .
where do these negative appraisals of islam come from ?
islam scholar navid kermani believes that germans see their identity being threatened .
identity , he explains , is formed when we distinguish ourselves from other groups .
every social group defines itself by how it differs from other groups .
that 's why , he argues , it seems logical to keep one 's distance from islam .
after all , westerners tend to be unfamiliar with islamic symbols , making the religion seem especially alien .
the process of differentiation itself is then only natural .
but it becomes problematic when those who are different are declared to be the enemy .
a sometimes superficial discussion seen in this light , there is nothing reprehensible about the debate on islam .
it seems to reflect primarily the struggle for a new german self-image and the difficulties connected with the fact that germany has indeed become a country of immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western impressions of islam may be too simplistic nevertheless , political scientist claus leggewie contends that the discussions about islam are often conducted on too superficial a level .
most people make little distinction between the various currents within islam .
nor do they make sufficient allowance for the differences between moderate and radical muslims .
" i believe that most europeans tend to develop a rather schematic image of islam , " says leggewie .
he finds it astounding that europeans , who do so much travelling and know the world so well , whose opinions on all other issues are so carefully formed and objective , are often so quick to make superficial judgments when it comes to islam .
but the debate on islam did n't exactly appear out of thin air , either .
it stems from the fact that religion has regained a great deal of power in the middle east itself .
of course people in germany have taken note of this resurgence , explains navid kermani .
the problem is that , in the muslim world as well , many issues are being viewed through a religious lens .
for many years , religion played no role on the political front there .
now all that has changed .
and germany feels threatened , fearing an increasing powerful cocktail of religion and politics here as well .
islam as a way of helping to define europe first and foremost , the battle about islam is an inner-german struggle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate may ultimately be about how international germany should be it 's about how open germany and the germans want to be .
since the end of the nazi dictatorship , germans have agonized about their history , and have developed a troubled relationship with their national identity .
whoever makes a statement about islam , says claus leggewie , is also indirectly speaking out on an entirely different issue - namely , how international germany should be .
" there are islamophobic tendencies on the one side and islamophile leanings on the other , " says leggewie .
" and , as we know , they have historically very frequently been interrelated , even when they seem on the outside to be diametrically opposed .
this very obviously means that islam continues to play an essential role in our construction of what europe means , i.e. in the collective identity of the europeans . "

included in the resolution are 700 million euros to help educate poor children . the german cabinet on wednesday approved proposed legislation that would reform state benefits for the long-term unemployed .
the new policy would see the basic welfare payments , known as hartz iv , raised to 364 euros -lrb- $ 505 -rrb- per adult recipient per month - a five euro increase over the current rate .
in order to satisfy a constitutional court ruling , the bill must be passed into law by year 's end .
chancellor merkel 's center-right coalition government does n't have a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , and the opposition has said that it will only approve the bill if signifigant amendments are made .
merkel defends reforms against criticism since chancellor merkel 's center-right coalition government unveiled its proposals last month , opposition parties have criticized the increase as being too small .
" a failure to massively raise -lsb- welfare -rsb- rates will mean a permanent state of poverty and marginalization , " said gregor gysi , the head of the left party 's parliamentary group .
the chancellor meanwhile defended the welfare reforms .
" hartz iv is not a way of life , " merkel said in berlin on wednesday , adding that the payments were " meant as a bridge back to employment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen called on germany 's parties to work together to pass the reform more money for education the new measures , which are expected to cost an additional 900 million euros , include 700 million to improve education for children in welfare recipient households .
yet opponents say the education package is not enough either .
gysi said it was " not enough to finance a sports club or a music school and certainly not remedial courses . "
chancellor merkel expressed some sympathy for welfare beneficiaries , saying , " i know that -lsb- these cuts -rsb- can be hard .
but there must be some motivation to go back to work . "
the new regulation needs to be passed into law before the end of the year , to satisfy a court ruling that deemed the way the payments have been calculated up until now to be unconstitutional . the government hopes to be able to implement the reforms on january 1 , 2011 .
labor minister ursula von der leyen called on all parties to work together in order to make the reform work , saying that the “ this tight deadline means we all have to take responsibility . ”

included in the resolution are 700 million euros to help educate poor children . the german cabinet on wednesday approved proposed legislation that would reform state benefits for the long-term unemployed .
the new policy would see the basic welfare payments , known as hartz iv , raised to 364 euros -lrb- $ 505 -rrb- per adult recipient per month - a five euro increase over the current rate .
in order to satisfy a constitutional court ruling , the bill must be passed into law by year 's end .
chancellor merkel 's center-right coalition government does n't have a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , and the opposition has said that it will only approve the bill if signifigant amendments are made .
merkel defends reforms against criticism since chancellor merkel 's center-right coalition government unveiled its proposals last month , opposition parties have criticized the increase as being too small .
" a failure to massively raise -lsb- welfare -rsb- rates will mean a permanent state of poverty and marginalization , " said gregor gysi , the head of the left party 's parliamentary group .
the chancellor meanwhile defended the welfare reforms .
" hartz iv is not a way of life , " merkel said in berlin on wednesday , adding that the payments were " meant as a bridge back to employment . "

yet opponents say the education package is not enough either .
gysi said it was " not enough to finance a sports club or a music school and certainly not remedial courses . "
chancellor merkel expressed some sympathy for welfare beneficiaries , saying , " i know that -lsb- these cuts -rsb- can be hard .
but there must be some motivation to go back to work . "
the new regulation needs to be passed into law before the end of the year , to satisfy a court ruling that deemed the way the payments have been calculated up until now to be unconstitutional . the government hopes to be able to implement the reforms on january 1 , 2011 .
labor minister ursula von der leyen called on all parties to work together in order to make the reform work , saying that the “ this tight deadline means we all have to take responsibility . ”

india is widely viewed as an emerging great power in asia .
the south asian sub-continent is on the rise politically as well as economically .
but india has to cope with several key issues to secure its new-found status . the crisis-torn region of kashmir has experienced one of its bloodiest summers ever .
after a teenager was allegedly killed by indian security forces violence erupted amongst young kashmiris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kashmir has been a bone of contention between india and pakistan for decades more than 100 people have died in the last couple of months in indian-administered kashmir .
the disputed region has been a bone of contention between india and pakistan for the past 60 years , with neither side willing to give an inch .
arch-rivals after the mumbai terror attacks of 2008 , which was planned on pakistani soil , diplomatic relations between the two sides cooled down .
the peace process between india and pakistan came to a standstill .
foreign policy expert raja mohan from delhi says pakistan has more than enough problems of its own .
" right now , pakistan is in a bad shape .
not only because of the floods .
the civilian government has problems , the military has gained a lot more power , " says mohan , " so you have a situation where you have no single authority to negotiate to within pakistan .
so i don ’ t see any prospects for any breakthrough .
unless pakistan itself stabilizes to some extent . "

because " there are no great powers which have significant problems with their neighbors .
so therefore resolving the disputes with pakistan is an important one purely from an instrumental perspective , " he explains .
one might think that india has already enough issues to solve with pakistan .
but india also shares a border with china .
both are powerhouses in the region in terms of the size of their respective populations and economies .
as economic relations between the two intensify , political conflicts are on the rise , especially as china becomes more successful and dominant .
strategic game it is a rivalry and partnership .
" since today india ’ s power sector has been already dominated by chinese suppliers .
china is playing a big role in india ’ s telecom industry , " says mohan , " we might even invite chinese companies to build roads in india .
so , on the economic side you see an expansion of the partnership .
more on the political side , in terms of how we look at each other , more in terms of our boundaries our perspective role in asia and in the world there is a problem . "
china is also a close ally of pakistan .
and amidst all of this there is another player : the usa .
in recent years the united states has tried to court india ’ s partnership , also to balance china ’ s growing influence within asia .
india is happy to deepen its relationship with the us , and is even warming up its old ties with russia to fence china in .

included in the resolution are 700 million euros to help educate poor children . the german cabinet on wednesday approved proposed legislation that would reform state benefits for the long-term unemployed .
the new policy would see the basic welfare payments , known as hartz iv , raised to 364 euros -lrb- $ 505 -rrb- per adult recipient per month - a five euro increase over the current rate .
in order to satisfy a constitutional court ruling , the bill must be passed into law by year 's end .
chancellor merkel 's center-right coalition government does n't have a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , and the opposition has said that it will only approve the bill if signifigant amendments are made .
merkel defends reforms against criticism since chancellor merkel 's center-right coalition government unveiled its proposals last month , opposition parties have criticized the increase as being too small .
" a failure to massively raise -lsb- welfare -rsb- rates will mean a permanent state of poverty and marginalization , " said gregor gysi , the head of the left party 's parliamentary group .
the chancellor meanwhile defended the welfare reforms .
" hartz iv is not a way of life , " merkel said in berlin on wednesday , adding that the payments were " meant as a bridge back to employment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen called on germany 's parties to work together to pass the reform more money for education the new measures , which are expected to cost an additional 900 million euros , include 700 million to improve education for children in welfare recipient households .
yet opponents say the education package is not enough either .
gysi said it was " not enough to finance a sports club or a music school and certainly not remedial courses . "
chancellor merkel expressed some sympathy for welfare beneficiaries , saying , " i know that -lsb- these cuts -rsb- can be hard .
but there must be some motivation to go back to work . "
the new regulation needs to be passed into law before the end of the year , to satisfy a court ruling that deemed the way the payments have been calculated up until now to be unconstitutional . the government hopes to be able to implement the reforms on january 1 , 2011 .
labor minister ursula von der leyen called on all parties to work together in order to make the reform work , saying that the “ this tight deadline means we all have to take responsibility . ”

along for the ride is defense minister theodor zu guttenberg 's wife , who co-hosts the show . the man 's face and body is completely pixilated .
his voice is distorted .
but it 's easy enough to see what this guy wants .
he 's had the windows of his car tinted so no one can see inside .
no one will notice them when they 're out in the woods , anyway , he tells his companion , who he thinks is just 13 years old .
this is " tatort internet , " a new television show that uses fake chat usernames to trick men into thinking they 're talking with young girls or boys and set up a meeting .
then they secretly film the encounter and confront the man with his inappropriate messages , the inappropriate photos he 's sent and his inappropriate intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister says the show could put innocent people at risk the show is co-hosted by stephanie zu guttenberg , the wife of german defense minister theodor zu guttenberg .
that did n't stop fellow cabinet member and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from expressing her distaste for the show to the newspaper passauer neue presse .
" there 's the risk that innocent people are being publicly condemned , " she said .
" the german legal system does n't have to resort to mob justice . "
one man featured on the show was identified and then fired from his job where he worked with teens .
he subsequently went missing for several days and his colleagues and family said they feared he may have killed himself .
he has since resurfaced .
paula honkanen-schoberth , director of the german league for child protection , told deutsche welle that she was also worried about the vigilante aspect of the television show .
" of course we think that sexual abuse is a severe crime and must be prosecuted in all possible , but legal ways , " she said .
" but in germany we live under the rule of law , and that is why we regard the criminal prosecution as a matter for the police .
and television is not the police .
and should n't act like it is . "
getting the safety message to teens what needs to be done , honkanen-schoberth said , is to get parents talking with their kids about staying safe online .
they should tell them not to give out their name and address or to meet up with strangers alone .
they should let them know they can always come to them if someone is threatening them or pressuring them to do something they do n't want to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents must talk with their children about staying safe online , says honkanen-schoberth honkanen-schoberth said she would welcome a show that addressed these things .
but media expert jo groeber from the german digital institute says the show itself could be a revolutionary way to inform young people about the dangers of the internet and chatting with adult strangers .
" it 's entertaining , it 's even , i 'm afraid to say it , thrilling , " he said .
" it 's probably tasteless , but it reaches the audience . "
one concern he does have , he said , is whether the show 's producers know of potential abusers for months at time before informing the police .
the guttenberg image stephanie zu guttenberg 's presence on the show comes as her husband 's political star gets brighter and brighter .
there 's even been speculation that he could become the country 's next chancellor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephanie zu guttenberg 's role in the show could affect her husband 's career in a survey by the forsa research institute released on wednesday , 25 percent of those surveyed said the defense minister would make a better chancellor than his boss , chancellor angela merkel .
this new role for stephanie zu guttenberg will only enhance her husband 's image , according to groebel .
" let 's be honest , the partner of a high-ranking politician is usually on the safe side .
they 're involved in charity work , but they never take any risks , " he said .
" i think the fact that she 's taking a risk will strengthen his image , as the husband of a completely independent wife . "

and should n't act like it is . "
getting the safety message to teens what needs to be done , honkanen-schoberth said , is to get parents talking with their kids about staying safe online .
they should tell them not to give out their name and address or to meet up with strangers alone .
they should let them know they can always come to them if someone is threatening them or pressuring them to do something they do n't want to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents must talk with their children about staying safe online , says honkanen-schoberth honkanen-schoberth said she would welcome a show that addressed these things .
but media expert jo groeber from the german digital institute says the show itself could be a revolutionary way to inform young people about the dangers of the internet and chatting with adult strangers .
" it 's entertaining , it 's even , i 'm afraid to say it , thrilling , " he said .
" it 's probably tasteless , but it reaches the audience . "
one concern he does have , he said , is whether the show 's producers know of potential abusers for months at time before informing the police .
the guttenberg image stephanie zu guttenberg 's presence on the show comes as her husband 's political star gets brighter and brighter .
there 's even been speculation that he could become the country 's next chancellor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephanie zu guttenberg 's role in the show could affect her husband 's career in a survey by the forsa research institute released on wednesday , 25 percent of those surveyed said the defense minister would make a better chancellor than his boss , chancellor angela merkel .
this new role for stephanie zu guttenberg will only enhance her husband 's image , according to groebel .
" let 's be honest , the partner of a high-ranking politician is usually on the safe side .
they 're involved in charity work , but they never take any risks , " he said .
" i think the fact that she 's taking a risk will strengthen his image , as the husband of a completely independent wife . "

along for the ride is defense minister theodor zu guttenberg 's wife , who co-hosts the show . the man 's face and body is completely pixilated .
his voice is distorted .
but it 's easy enough to see what this guy wants .
he 's had the windows of his car tinted so no one can see inside .
no one will notice them when they 're out in the woods , anyway , he tells his companion , who he thinks is just 13 years old .
this is " tatort internet , " a new television show that uses fake chat usernames to trick men into thinking they 're talking with young girls or boys and set up a meeting .
then they secretly film the encounter and confront the man with his inappropriate messages , the inappropriate photos he 's sent and his inappropriate intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister says the show could put innocent people at risk the show is co-hosted by stephanie zu guttenberg , the wife of german defense minister theodor zu guttenberg .
that did n't stop fellow cabinet member and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from expressing her distaste for the show to the newspaper passauer neue presse .
" there 's the risk that innocent people are being publicly condemned , " she said .
" the german legal system does n't have to resort to mob justice . "
one man featured on the show was identified and then fired from his job where he worked with teens .
he subsequently went missing for several days and his colleagues and family said they feared he may have killed himself .
he has since resurfaced .
paula honkanen-schoberth , director of the german league for child protection , told deutsche welle that she was also worried about the vigilante aspect of the television show .
" of course we think that sexual abuse is a severe crime and must be prosecuted in all possible , but legal ways , " she said .
" but in germany we live under the rule of law , and that is why we regard the criminal prosecution as a matter for the police .
and television is not the police .
and should n't act like it is . "
getting the safety message to teens what needs to be done , honkanen-schoberth said , is to get parents talking with their kids about staying safe online .
they should tell them not to give out their name and address or to meet up with strangers alone .
they should let them know they can always come to them if someone is threatening them or pressuring them to do something they do n't want to do .

commentators believe that only a change of policy can end the long years of violence and unrest . the kremlin remained bullish after the separatist attack on the chechen parliament in grozny on tuesday , in which three people were killed .
" as always , they -lrb- the militants -rrb- failed , " russian interior minister rashid nurgaliyev said at a televized meeting at the local interior ministry .
the minister , by coincidence on a trip to grozny , said the chechen gunmen were intercepted by interior ministry troops , and that the operation by the security forces to free the deputies was a success .
he then claimed chechnya was " stable and safe . "
but since russia officially ended its " counter-terror " operation in the province in april 2009 , there have been plenty of signs that chechnya is far from pacified .
the double bombings carried out by two suicide bombers on the moscow metro in march , which killed 40 and wounded more than 100 , showed that separatist violence has the power to reach the russian capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chechen parliament was attacked tuesday uwe halbach , researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the violence has actually been increasing in the region since 2009 .
" what we have in chechnya is a trend that is also evident in other republics in the northern caucasus , such as kabardino-balkaria and dagestan , " halbach told deutsche welle .
" attacks are being very deliberately directed at security organizations and authorities , in this case the parliament . "
scars from two wars chechnya unilaterally declared independence from russia in 1991 , following the collapse of the soviet union .
in 1994 , the first russian troops marched in to put the separatist movement down .
the destruction and reoccupation of the capital city grozny in 1996 represented only a partial resolution , and the ceasefire remained fragile .
the russian soldiers returned in 1999 , starting what has become known as the second chechen war .
this military offensive lasted until the spring of 2000 and ended with russia 's military occupation of the province .
but the underlying conflict lingered , and chechen resistance has continued since then , mostly in the form of guerrilla attacks on civilian targets in chechnya , neighboring dagestan and russia itself .
chechnya has been governed by presidents loyal to moscow since 2003 .
achmat kadyrov was killed in a bomb attack in 2004 and succeeded by his son ramzan kadyrov , who has been criticized for using extra-legal measures .
divided separatists but while kadyrov 's government faces a violent front of rebels who want to turn chechnya into an independent islamic state , many chechens have actually come to support the president in recent years .
ivan sukhov , caucasus correspondent for the independent moscow newspaper vremya novostyey , told deutsche welle , " in the last few years , ramzan kadyrov has almost become a figure symbolic of the chechen idea - the man who defends ethnic chechen interests .
that 's why many who fought for chechen freedom and independence from russia have joined him .
now there is a division in the movement . "
gerhard mangott , russia expert with the innsbruck institute for political science , says that three leading chechen rebels have now declared themselves against the idea of turning the republic into a muslim emirate .
instead , they favor a nation state based on the chechen ethnicity .
but it is this group that is apparently responsible for this week 's attack on the parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzan kadyrov has won some support recently " this group has abandoned doku umarov , who leads the islamist movement , " he said .
" it is certainly probable that this group started -lrb- this week 's -rrb- attacks to show it is capable of executing a massive strike on the center of president kadyrov 's power . "
mangott also notes a significant increase in rebel activity in the region in the last few months , particularly in dagestan and ingushetia , another russian republic bordering chechnya .
he believes the russian government 's attempts to stabilize the region have all failed so far .
both the tactic of military invasion and the tactic of targeted attacks on rebel leaders using secret service intelligence have so far yielded little result .
even russian president dmitry medvedev is apparently opening up to the idea that the solution can not only be a military one .
fresh ideas needed halbach also believes that russia should rethink its strategy in the northern caucasus .
development strategies that focus on social and economic problems are also necessary , and halbach believes the european union should support such initiatives and actively encourage russia to seek alternatives to military action .
but russia continues to declare the troubles in the region a domestic issue , making intervention in the form of international development aid impossible .
" i think there needs to be dialogue between the eu and russia about the alarming security situation in this region , " halbach said .
" it is not just russia 's ' internal foreign country , ' not just a crisis region on russia 's periphery , it is also a region on the edge of europe , and it is certainly in europe 's interests to know whether we can expect a further escalation in violence there , or whether it will be possible to limit it . "

in an attempt to get the uk back on track , the chancellor of the exchequer has announced new austerity measures , including half a million job cuts . british chancellor of the exchequer george osborne used a speech to the house of commons on wednesday to announce his country 's biggest public spending cuts since world war ii .
the chancellor outlined budget cuts to the tune of seven billion pounds -lrb- eight billion euros , $ 11 billion -rrb- as well as projected spending reductions of 81 billion pounds over four years .
" today is the day when britain steps back from the brink , when we confront the bills from a decade of debt , " osborne said , to cheers from the government benches in the house .
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- a day of rebuilding , when we set out a four-year plan to put our public services and welfare state on a sustainable footing for the long term , " he added .
slashing the budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans major spending cuts the conservative chancellor outlined wide-reaching austerity measures , including a drop in police budgets , a 24-percent cut in spending by the foreign office and an increase in the state pension age from 65 to 66 in 2020 - six years earlier than previously planned .
the government also intends to slash welfare spending by making changes to incapacity and housing benefits .
the opposition labour party meanwhile accused osborne of playing with people 's futures , with half a million public sector jobs expected to be lost .
while britain has remained true to its overseas aid pledges and increased spending on schools and the national health service , it will now make cuts to departmental budgets at an average of just under 20 percent .
job cuts ' reckless ' reining in spending means cutting some 490,000 public sector jobs , according to the office for budgetary responsibility .
the chancellor said he regretted that many would lose their jobs , but that it " is unavoidable when the country runs out of money . "
shadow chancellor alan johnson came out against the proposed job cuts , saying they were " reckless " and that the british people would suffer .
" today is the day that abstract figures and spread-sheets turn into people 's futures , people 's jobs , people 's services , their prospects for the future , " johnson said .
deficit triples disaster rates but the coalition government has laid blame for the cuts at the door of the previous labour administration for running up significant debts .

" running a deficit of around 10 percent of gdp is just way off the mark , " lilico said , adding that " within europe there are restrictions under treaty rules that say they should have deficits of no more than three percent of gdp . "
" we 're running a deficit well over three times as much as what was previously thought to be the absolute maximum that you should be running even in a disaster scenario , " lilico added .
unions plan to put up a fight trade unions , meanwhile , are promising to fight public sector job losses and have threatened widespread industrial action .
already on wednesday , protesters descended on westminster to express their disapproval of the austerity measures .
eighty-one billion pounds worth of cuts over four years represent an approximate halving of britain 's budget deficit .
the coalition government claims this will restore the economy to health , although opponents argue the measures may have the opposite effect , plunging britain back into recession .

" we were not informed of this at all in advance . "
british soldiers are currently based at 12 sites in northern and western germany .
the review found that this was no longer necessary .
the united kingdom , france and the united states maintained troops in west germany throughout the cold war .
" the presence of the british military has played an important role in demonstrating alliance solidarity , and has also been a symbol of steadfast uk-german friendship , " the security review said .

some 17,000 service personnel will be cut from the british forces ' payroll . cameron promised that the defense budget would remain the fourth-largest in the world and would meet a nato requirement for members to spend two percent of gross domestic product on defense . the defense cuts are part of a wider raft of measures being introduced by the government to cut spending by some 95 billion euros by 2015 , with the majority of cuts to be announced on wednesday afternoon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 20.10.2010 luxury group recruits puma boss for sports expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma enjoyed a comeback under jochen zeitz french luxury goods producer ppr , which owns gucci and yves saint laurent , bought german sports brand puma in 2007 .
now ppr wants puma 's unconventional ceo jochen zeitz to build a new sports and leisure empire . french luxury goods producer ppr has big plans for german sports brand puma , as well as that company 's unconventional ceo , jochen zeitz .
zeitz – who reportedly divides his time between puma 's headquarters in herzogenaurach and his farm in kenya – took charge of puma in 1993 , when he was just 30 years old .
he quickly gained a reputation as a mover and shaker as he transformed the struggling company into a successful brand with a global presence .
ppr acquired puma in 2007 , and has since purchased other sports brands including the cobra golf label .
it wants zeitz , now 47 , to head up a new sporting goods and leisure division with puma as its centerpiece .
ppr chief francois-henri pinault said in a statement that " the reinforcement of the puma management team under jochen zeitz is a decisive factor in the implementation of our strategy , which aims to make puma the core brand of ppr 's second pillar -lrb- sporting goods and leisure -rrb- . "
logical conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois-henri pinault 's ppr bought zeitz 's puma in 2007 antoine belge , a luxury and sporting goods analyst for hsbc , said zeitz has been involved in ppr 's strategic development for some time now .
" it 's just a sort of formalization of something that already existed ... effectively he was already in charge of doing acquisition , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's just a sign that expansion may accelerate . "
to facilitate change , puma will be restructured from a german ag corporation to a european se corporation .
analysts expect a senior puma manager will be appointed ceo , while zeitz himself is stays on as executive chairman until a replacement is found .
" that is why they want to have a specific ceo for the puma brand , because jochen zeitz will probably spend more time finding other brands to integrate into that division , " belge said .
tighter branding control ppr is expected to sell a number of subsidiaries – including electronics and entertainment retailer fnac , furniture seller conforama and redcats mail order- to finance the acquisition of further high-end brands .
john horan , publisher of industry newsletter sporting goods intelligence , said it makes sense for ppr to shed its multi-brand retail chains and concentrate on developing its own labels .
he described this as ' vertical retail , ' in which brands maintain stores exclusively to sell their products .
" if you look at where all the real strength in retail is recently , it 's been with vertical retailers of one kind or another , " horan told deutsche welle .
" they see it as a way to really make a brand statement that is very difficult to make when you 're selling through a retailer . "

but it is facing an uphill battle to win support for the idea , with opposition being spearheaded by germany , france and britain . the european commission 's proposal to introduce a europe-wide value-added tax is being met with stiff resistance from the 27-member bloc 's economic powerhouses , germany , france and britain .
the commission wants to introduce direct taxation from brussels for the 2014-2020 budget due to fears that cash-strapped governments may want to reduce their contributions to the bloc .
" at times where public spending is under pressure , we suggest ways to achieve a european budget that is up to the challenges we are facing collectively , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso .
among the eu executive 's proposals are the creation of a separate value-added tax , an eu energy tax or an eu corporate income tax .
under the current system , the eu raises about three quarters of its budget from national government contributions .
" this is not such a bad system because the national governments have a strong incentive to press for fiscal discipline in brussels , " professor friedrich heinemann of the centre for european economic research in mannheim told deutsche welle fears of eu expansion heinemann thinks the move is aimed at expanding the eu 's budget .
" why has the european commission been pressing so hard for years and even decades for a european tax ? " he asked . " it 's about preparing a more aggressive expansion of the budget .
this is a central interest of the european commission and the idea is to let the eu budget grow . "
those in favor of the tax believe it will create more transparency and add value to european decisions by giving europe real power to pool its resources to work on special projects .
" i do n't want the eu to deal with the size and shape of bananas .
i would like the eu to create value added at the european level , with things like large research projects , " henrik enderlein , professor of political economy at the hertie school of governance in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the eu can only do if it has this autonomous spending and taxing capacity , " he added critics are worried about tax increases .
the recent recession and debt crisis has already forced national governments to cut budgets and raise taxes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european wide vat could hit consumers but enderlein does n't think this will necessarily lead to more taxation .
he says that germany knows exactly which proportion of its tax is sent to europe and the european parliament could effectively replace this .
he argues that the elected european parliament would provide adequate democratic controls .
" look at the united states : in every state there is a different value added tax and that works perfectly well and so there can be taxation at different levels and i do n't see why this would n't function in the european union , " he told deutsche welle . observers say it is unlikely that such a form of direct taxation will be passed by the eu anytime soon , but enderlein thinks that it 's inevitable that countries sharing a single currency will eventually want to have taxation at european level .
" the process of eu integration is a process of unlikely events ultimately taking place .
nobody thought the single currency would appear or that borders would be abolished , but we saw all of these happen , " enderlein told deutsche welle .
to be adopted , any proposal must be approved by the eu 's member states and the european parliament .
the european commission plans to present proposed legislation by july of next year .

german eurostar competitor completes first trip to london i have travelled on both the ice and tgv trains during visits to europe .
of course , the tgv was very exciting when it first came out .
the ice has always been a smooth ride before that .
so , i have no preference at this point but am glad to see competition between the two .
both ice and tgv are comfortable and reliable , so the passenger can then choose based on price and routes . - rome , us german , french rail companies on collision course over channel tunnel eurotunnel is underused by rail passengers .
it should be opened up to other operators in addition to eurostar , also , london is not the only city of high population in the uk to which there should be a high speed link .
other cities that could benefit include birmingham , manchester and glasgow . - roderick , oman its common knowledge that protectionism is rife in france , for example cars , aircraft etc . , but they must be made to realize that that behavior will not be tolerated any more .
eurostar has a perfect right to choose what is best for them - not france ! - richard , great britain french government says ' non ' to german eurostar trains at the moment , and for a while to come , france has enough on its plate vis-a-vis the never ending number of strikes , that make running any trains , a serious challenge .
the simple answer would be to increase the number of scheduled services , so that an increase in passenger volume would lead to more attractive prices in comparison to the alternative of air travel . - charles , great britain german train completes test trip under channel having had the enjoyment of riding with deutsche bahn in germany on many occasions , to be able to travel to , say , cologne without having to change at brussels , only to find the connecting train did n't wait for the late running eurostar service , is going to be great !
but i think db is going to have to sort out those pesky wheels once and for all before committing the ice 's to the tunnel . - tony , great britain deutsche bahn 's proposed high speed service from st. pancras is wonderful news and will most certainly be a great success for both the business and leisure sectors .

etna was the first location to be imaged four months after the second of the two satellites was launched , a satellite tandem is in position and has begun its mission of taking high-resolution photographs of the earth 's surface . the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- announced tuesday that its two satellites currently flying in tight formation around the earth have acquired their first detailed image of the earth 's surface .
the new image details mt .
etna , on the eastern coast of sicily , in italy 's southern island province . the satellites , tandem-x and terrasar-x launched in june 2010 and june 2007 , respectively , are currently flying just 350 meters -lrb- 1,100 feet -rrb- apart on a mission to photograph the surface of the planet in unprecedented detail . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the satellite measure the same points from two angles using a process called bistatic radar , the satellites send microwave pulses from their approximate 500-kilometer orbits to earth and measure how long it takes for pulses to bounce back from the earth .
then the satellites ' on-board computers determine the height of the ground surveyed .
german space authorities said the level of accuracy this method produces is unprecedented . " processing the bistatic pairs of data is a big challenge , " thomas fritz , a dlr processing engineer , said in a statement .
" everything must match up exactly in order to reach this level of precision .
all sorts of data can affect the algorithms , from synchronization signals to millimeter-accurate orbital calculations . " prior to this new german project , the best digital elevation survey came from the us shuttle radar topography mission -lrb- srtm -rrb- completed in 2000 , however it only imaged 60 percent of the earth 's surface and was not nearly as accurate as the new survey . survey will take years to finish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the satellites fly in a formation similar to a double-helix dlr officials have said previously that the project will take four years to complete the survey and to process its corresponding data .
they expect the final amount of data collected to reach around 15 terabytes , or approximately 60 computer hard drives . the raw data will be processed by three ground stations in sweden , canada and antarctica and then will be sent for final processing to the german remote exploration data center -lrb- dfd -rrb- in oberpfaffenhofen , just outside of munich , in southern germany . the new three-dimensional map will be made available to planetary scientists and to the private sector , with potential applications in mobile phone network construction , flight plan creation and urban planning . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his address had important messages for germans and turks , says baha gungor of dw 's turkish service . the omens for christian wulff 's third trip abroad as german president , this time to turkey , were unfavorable .
in germany , a debate on integration was raging , charged with emotions .
the weekly magazine " focus " published a cover with wulff 's face on it - distorted as an islamic prayer leader .
wulff had , however , merely pointed out in an october 3 speech that islam - in addition to christianity and judaism - is part of life in germany . public attention became focused on the first speech given by a german president to the turkish parliament .
wulff did not mince words .
for one , he repeated that islam has become an integral part of germany .
he also demanded that turkey acknowledge that christianity has a place in turkey , and that christians there should be free to worship as they wish .
that included priests being trained in turkey , he said , which is not possible now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha gungor , head of dw 's turkish department wulff did not avoid critical topics , such as turkey 's difficult relationship with cyprus and armenia .
not least , he affirmed israel 's right to exist while demanding an autonomous , viable and democratically ruled palestine .
that was an indirect request for turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to resume dialogue with israel . wulff refrained from making empty promises regarding turkey joining the european union .
shrewdly , clearly and unmistakably , wulff said that regardless of the democratic and economic progress turkey has indeed made , eu membership was not a foregone conclusion . the most distinct messages that wulff addressed to both germans and turks had to do with the need for people of turkish descent in germany to find a place in german society .
it was striking that wulff avoided using the loaded word " integration . "
his call for immigrants to learn the german language had been supported by the turkish president abdullah gul in the run-up to his visit .
and gul did not forget to mention in a joint press conference ahead of wulff 's speech that he was the president of all turkish citizens - those with armenian , jewish and greek roots included - and that all people in turkey should speak turkish . wulff 's five-day state visit will evidently help to minimize misunderstanding between berlin and ankara .
wulff 's manner has been well-received and his cautious words will not be ignored . whether a change of direction in germany 's out-of-control integration debate can be expected remains to be seen ; wulff does not have to win elections anymore . certain politicians , on the other hand , are not likely to pass on the strategy of pitting popular emotions against foreigners and migrants for their election campaigns . author : baha gungor -lrb- sst / rc -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his address had important messages for germans and turks , says baha gungor of dw 's turkish service . the omens for christian wulff 's third trip abroad as german president , this time to turkey , were unfavorable .
in germany , a debate on integration was raging , charged with emotions .
the weekly magazine " focus " published a cover with wulff 's face on it - distorted as an islamic prayer leader .
wulff had , however , merely pointed out in an october 3 speech that islam - in addition to christianity and judaism - is part of life in germany . public attention became focused on the first speech given by a german president to the turkish parliament .
wulff did not mince words .
for one , he repeated that islam has become an integral part of germany .
he also demanded that turkey acknowledge that christianity has a place in turkey , and that christians there should be free to worship as they wish .
that included priests being trained in turkey , he said , which is not possible now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha gungor , head of dw 's turkish department wulff did not avoid critical topics , such as turkey 's difficult relationship with cyprus and armenia .
not least , he affirmed israel 's right to exist while demanding an autonomous , viable and democratically ruled palestine .
that was an indirect request for turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to resume dialogue with israel . wulff refrained from making empty promises regarding turkey joining the european union .
shrewdly , clearly and unmistakably , wulff said that regardless of the democratic and economic progress turkey has indeed made , eu membership was not a foregone conclusion . the most distinct messages that wulff addressed to both germans and turks had to do with the need for people of turkish descent in germany to find a place in german society .
it was striking that wulff avoided using the loaded word " integration . "
his call for immigrants to learn the german language had been supported by the turkish president abdullah gul in the run-up to his visit .
and gul did not forget to mention in a joint press conference ahead of wulff 's speech that he was the president of all turkish citizens - those with armenian , jewish and greek roots included - and that all people in turkey should speak turkish . wulff 's five-day state visit will evidently help to minimize misunderstanding between berlin and ankara .
wulff 's manner has been well-received and his cautious words will not be ignored . whether a change of direction in germany 's out-of-control integration debate can be expected remains to be seen ; wulff does not have to win elections anymore . certain politicians , on the other hand , are not likely to pass on the strategy of pitting popular emotions against foreigners and migrants for their election campaigns . author : baha gungor -lrb- sst / rc -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.10.2010 spain 's zapatero shuffles cabinet as government popularity slumps großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's austerity measures are widely unpopular in a surprise decision , spanish prime minister zapatero has announced a major cabinet shuffle .
the move comes as his unpopular government is poised to implement painful austerity measures to combat a huge budget deficit . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has announced his biggest cabinet shuffle since taking office in 2004 .
in a nationally televised speech zapatero said that spain needed “ a politically strong ” and experienced government to manage the country ’ s difficult economic situation .
the cabinet shuffle is being seen as an effort to tackle the government ’ s widespread unpopularity in face of painful austerity measures .
zapatero 's government is poised to implement major spending cuts while at the same time raising taxes in an effort to reduce the country 's gaping public deficit and avoid a greek-style debt crisis .
the country ’ s unemployment rate stands at 20 percent - the highest in the european union .
recent opinion polls indicate that the opposition conservative popular party has the most support among the electorate , with a lead of around 15 percentage points over zapatero ’ s socialists . the prime minister 's approval rate has sunk to below 30 percent , the worst since his re-election in 2008 .
unexpected changes the extent of the shuffle came as a surprise as initially the prime minister ’ s office had only announced that labor minister celestine corbacho would be replaced .
his successor is the secretary general for employment , valeriano gomez .
interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba is to replace deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega .
rubalcaba , who is widely seen as a potential successor to zapatero , will however retain his old portfolio . the changes will also see foreign minister miguel angel moratinos be replaced by current health minister trinidad jimenez .
both moratinos and vega have been in office since the socialists won the 2004 elections .
the shuffle will also affect the health and the environment ministries .
the portfolio for housing and equality is being dissolved as part of the efforts to cut government spending .

india is widely viewed as an emerging great power in asia .
the south asian sub-continent is on the rise politically as well as economically .
but india has to cope with several key issues to secure its new-found status . the crisis-torn region of kashmir has experienced one of its bloodiest summers ever .
after a teenager was allegedly killed by indian security forces violence erupted amongst young kashmiris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kashmir has been a bone of contention between india and pakistan for decades more than 100 people have died in the last couple of months in indian-administered kashmir .
the disputed region has been a bone of contention between india and pakistan for the past 60 years , with neither side willing to give an inch .
arch-rivals after the mumbai terror attacks of 2008 , which was planned on pakistani soil , diplomatic relations between the two sides cooled down .
the peace process between india and pakistan came to a standstill .
foreign policy expert raja mohan from delhi says pakistan has more than enough problems of its own .
" right now , pakistan is in a bad shape .
not only because of the floods .
the civilian government has problems , the military has gained a lot more power , " says mohan , " so you have a situation where you have no single authority to negotiate to within pakistan .
so i don ’ t see any prospects for any breakthrough .
unless pakistan itself stabilizes to some extent . "
bildunterschrift : arch-rivals armed to the teeth , also with nuclear weapons the other mighty neighbor and india has to solve its issues with pakistan , says raja mohan - not only because both nations are nuclear powers .
because " there are no great powers which have significant problems with their neighbors .
so therefore resolving the disputes with pakistan is an important one purely from an instrumental perspective , " he explains .
one might think that india has already enough issues to solve with pakistan .
but india also shares a border with china .
both are powerhouses in the region in terms of the size of their respective populations and economies .
as economic relations between the two intensify , political conflicts are on the rise , especially as china becomes more successful and dominant .
strategic game it is a rivalry and partnership .
" since today india ’ s power sector has been already dominated by chinese suppliers .
china is playing a big role in india ’ s telecom industry , " says mohan , " we might even invite chinese companies to build roads in india .
so , on the economic side you see an expansion of the partnership .
more on the political side , in terms of how we look at each other , more in terms of our boundaries our perspective role in asia and in the world there is a problem . "
china is also a close ally of pakistan .
and amidst all of this there is another player : the usa .
in recent years the united states has tried to court india ’ s partnership , also to balance china ’ s growing influence within asia .
india is happy to deepen its relationship with the us , and is even warming up its old ties with russia to fence china in .
and all the time indian policymakers are looking north , over the himalayas , to see what beijing will do next in the big strategic game in asia in the 21st century .

his voice is distorted .
but it 's easy enough to see what this guy wants .
he 's had the windows of his car tinted so no one can see inside .
no one will notice them when they 're out in the woods , anyway , he tells his companion , who he thinks is just 13 years old .
this is " tatort internet , " a new television show that uses fake chat usernames to trick men into thinking they 're talking with young girls or boys and set up a meeting .

" there 's the risk that innocent people are being publicly condemned , " she said .
" the german legal system does n't have to resort to mob justice . "

" of course we think that sexual abuse is a severe crime and must be prosecuted in all possible , but legal ways , " she said .
" but in germany we live under the rule of law , and that is why we regard the criminal prosecution as a matter for the police .
and television is not the police .
and should n't act like it is . "
getting the safety message to teens what needs to be done , honkanen-schoberth said , is to get parents talking with their kids about staying safe online .
they should tell them not to give out their name and address or to meet up with strangers alone .
they should let them know they can always come to them if someone is threatening them or pressuring them to do something they do n't want to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents must talk with their children about staying safe online , says honkanen-schoberth honkanen-schoberth said she would welcome a show that addressed these things .

" it 's entertaining , it 's even , i 'm afraid to say it , thrilling , " he said .
" it 's probably tasteless , but it reaches the audience . "
one concern he does have , he said , is whether the show 's producers know of potential abusers for months at time before informing the police .
the guttenberg image stephanie zu guttenberg 's presence on the show comes as her husband 's political star gets brighter and brighter .
there 's even been speculation that he could become the country 's next chancellor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephanie zu guttenberg 's role in the show could affect her husband 's career in a survey by the forsa research institute released on wednesday , 25 percent of those surveyed said the defense minister would make a better chancellor than his boss , chancellor angela merkel .
this new role for stephanie zu guttenberg will only enhance her husband 's image , according to groebel .
" let 's be honest , the partner of a high-ranking politician is usually on the safe side .
they 're involved in charity work , but they never take any risks , " he said .
" i think the fact that she 's taking a risk will strengthen his image , as the husband of a completely independent wife . "

now the eu 's executive is considering a ban of the drug called meow meow . the european commission on wednesday called for a ban of the party drug , mephedrone , also known as " meow meow , " which has hallucinogenic effects similar to ecstasy . while the drug is illegal in 15 of the european union 's 27-memberbloc , including germany , estonia and romania , it remains legal in others , including spain , portugal , and greece . " mephedrone is a dangerous drug that is available online and on the street corner , " viviane reding , the eu 's justice commissioner , said in a statement .
" we have a responsibility to protect young people against dangerous new psychoactive substances like mephedrone , " she said . the drug has been linked to 37 deaths in britain and ireland and the commission 's proposal would make it an offense to manufacture or sell mephedrone .
before it could go into effect , the proposal would have to be approved by the eu 's member states . predominantly a ' youth phenomenon ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding called to ban mephedrone across the eu mephedrone hydrochloride salt , as the drug is scientifically known , is a white powder and is commercially available from chemical suppliers on the internet .

" while the proposed ban may not have an immediate effect on the drug 's user base , it may deter newcomers . " i think it might have an effect on people who do n't have a history of other drug taking , " karen mcelrath , an expert in criminology and drug use at queen 's university in belfast , northern ireland , said in an interview with deutsche welle .

in an attempt to get the uk back on track , the chancellor of the exchequer has announced new austerity measures , including half a million job cuts . british chancellor of the exchequer george osborne used a speech to the house of commons on wednesday to announce his country 's biggest public spending cuts since world war ii .
the chancellor outlined budget cuts to the tune of seven billion pounds -lrb- eight billion euros , $ 11 billion -rrb- as well as projected spending reductions of 81 billion pounds over four years .
" today is the day when britain steps back from the brink , when we confront the bills from a decade of debt , " osborne said , to cheers from the government benches in the house .
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- a day of rebuilding , when we set out a four-year plan to put our public services and welfare state on a sustainable footing for the long term , " he added .
slashing the budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans major spending cuts the conservative chancellor outlined wide-reaching austerity measures , including a drop in police budgets , a 24-percent cut in spending by the foreign office and an increase in the state pension age from 65 to 66 in 2020 - six years earlier than previously planned .
the government also intends to slash welfare spending by making changes to incapacity and housing benefits .
the opposition labour party meanwhile accused osborne of playing with people 's futures , with half a million public sector jobs expected to be lost .
while britain has remained true to its overseas aid pledges and increased spending on schools and the national health service , it will now make cuts to departmental budgets at an average of just under 20 percent .
job cuts ' reckless ' reining in spending means cutting some 490,000 public sector jobs , according to the office for budgetary responsibility .
the chancellor said he regretted that many would lose their jobs , but that it " is unavoidable when the country runs out of money . "
shadow chancellor alan johnson came out against the proposed job cuts , saying they were " reckless " and that the british people would suffer .
" today is the day that abstract figures and spread-sheets turn into people 's futures , people 's jobs , people 's services , their prospects for the future , " johnson said .
deficit triples disaster rates but the coalition government has laid blame for the cuts at the door of the previous labour administration for running up significant debts .
they insist that action must be taken now , and rapidly , if investor confidence in the british economy is to be restored .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the queen 's allowance will be affected by budget cuts the sheer size of britain 's debts makes cuts necessary , according to dr. andrew lilico , chief economist at right-of-center think tank policy exchange .
" running a deficit of around 10 percent of gdp is just way off the mark , " lilico said , adding that " within europe there are restrictions under treaty rules that say they should have deficits of no more than three percent of gdp . "
" we 're running a deficit well over three times as much as what was previously thought to be the absolute maximum that you should be running even in a disaster scenario , " lilico added .
unions plan to put up a fight trade unions , meanwhile , are promising to fight public sector job losses and have threatened widespread industrial action .
already on wednesday , protesters descended on westminster to express their disapproval of the austerity measures .
eighty-one billion pounds worth of cuts over four years represent an approximate halving of britain 's budget deficit .
the coalition government claims this will restore the economy to health , although opponents argue the measures may have the opposite effect , plunging britain back into recession .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 20.10.2010 british government unveils plans to slash the deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osborne 's speech was cheered from the government benches britain 's deficit is alarmingly high - at over 10 percent of gdp .
in an attempt to get the uk back on track , the chancellor of the exchequer has announced new austerity measures , including half a million job cuts . british chancellor of the exchequer george osborne used a speech to the house of commons on wednesday to announce his country 's biggest public spending cuts since world war ii .
the chancellor outlined budget cuts to the tune of seven billion pounds -lrb- eight billion euros , $ 11 billion -rrb- as well as projected spending reductions of 81 billion pounds over four years .
" today is the day when britain steps back from the brink , when we confront the bills from a decade of debt , " osborne said , to cheers from the government benches in the house .
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- a day of rebuilding , when we set out a four-year plan to put our public services and welfare state on a sustainable footing for the long term , " he added .
slashing the budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans major spending cuts the conservative chancellor outlined wide-reaching austerity measures , including a drop in police budgets , a 24-percent cut in spending by the foreign office and an increase in the state pension age from 65 to 66 in 2020 - six years earlier than previously planned .
the government also intends to slash welfare spending by making changes to incapacity and housing benefits .
the opposition labour party meanwhile accused osborne of playing with people 's futures , with half a million public sector jobs expected to be lost .
while britain has remained true to its overseas aid pledges and increased spending on schools and the national health service , it will now make cuts to departmental budgets at an average of just under 20 percent .
job cuts ' reckless ' reining in spending means cutting some 490,000 public sector jobs , according to the office for budgetary responsibility .
the chancellor said he regretted that many would lose their jobs , but that it " is unavoidable when the country runs out of money . "
shadow chancellor alan johnson came out against the proposed job cuts , saying they were " reckless " and that the british people would suffer .
" today is the day that abstract figures and spread-sheets turn into people 's futures , people 's jobs , people 's services , their prospects for the future , " johnson said .
deficit triples disaster rates but the coalition government has laid blame for the cuts at the door of the previous labour administration for running up significant debts .
they insist that action must be taken now , and rapidly , if investor confidence in the british economy is to be restored .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the queen 's allowance will be affected by budget cuts the sheer size of britain 's debts makes cuts necessary , according to dr. andrew lilico , chief economist at right-of-center think tank policy exchange .
" running a deficit of around 10 percent of gdp is just way off the mark , " lilico said , adding that " within europe there are restrictions under treaty rules that say they should have deficits of no more than three percent of gdp . "
" we 're running a deficit well over three times as much as what was previously thought to be the absolute maximum that you should be running even in a disaster scenario , " lilico added .
unions plan to put up a fight trade unions , meanwhile , are promising to fight public sector job losses and have threatened widespread industrial action .
already on wednesday , protesters descended on westminster to express their disapproval of the austerity measures .
eighty-one billion pounds worth of cuts over four years represent an approximate halving of britain 's budget deficit .
the coalition government claims this will restore the economy to health , although opponents argue the measures may have the opposite effect , plunging britain back into recession .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 20.10.2010 opinion : german president pulls no punches in turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff was the first german president to make a speech in front of the turkish parliament .
his address had important messages for germans and turks , says baha gungor of dw 's turkish service . the omens for christian wulff 's third trip abroad as german president , this time to turkey , were unfavorable .
in germany , a debate on integration was raging , charged with emotions .
the weekly magazine " focus " published a cover with wulff 's face on it - distorted as an islamic prayer leader .
wulff had , however , merely pointed out in an october 3 speech that islam - in addition to christianity and judaism - is part of life in germany . public attention became focused on the first speech given by a german president to the turkish parliament .
wulff did not mince words .
for one , he repeated that islam has become an integral part of germany .
he also demanded that turkey acknowledge that christianity has a place in turkey , and that christians there should be free to worship as they wish .
that included priests being trained in turkey , he said , which is not possible now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha gungor , head of dw 's turkish department wulff did not avoid critical topics , such as turkey 's difficult relationship with cyprus and armenia .
not least , he affirmed israel 's right to exist while demanding an autonomous , viable and democratically ruled palestine .
that was an indirect request for turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to resume dialogue with israel . wulff refrained from making empty promises regarding turkey joining the european union .
shrewdly , clearly and unmistakably , wulff said that regardless of the democratic and economic progress turkey has indeed made , eu membership was not a foregone conclusion . the most distinct messages that wulff addressed to both germans and turks had to do with the need for people of turkish descent in germany to find a place in german society .
it was striking that wulff avoided using the loaded word " integration . "
his call for immigrants to learn the german language had been supported by the turkish president abdullah gul in the run-up to his visit .
and gul did not forget to mention in a joint press conference ahead of wulff 's speech that he was the president of all turkish citizens - those with armenian , jewish and greek roots included - and that all people in turkey should speak turkish . wulff 's five-day state visit will evidently help to minimize misunderstanding between berlin and ankara .
wulff 's manner has been well-received and his cautious words will not be ignored . whether a change of direction in germany 's out-of-control integration debate can be expected remains to be seen ; wulff does not have to win elections anymore . certain politicians , on the other hand , are not likely to pass on the strategy of pitting popular emotions against foreigners and migrants for their election campaigns . author : baha gungor -lrb- sst / rc -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de president wulff urges turks to ' actively integrate ' in germany in an unprecedented speech to the turkish parliament , german president christian wulff said immigrants in germany should take part fully in society .
he also stressed that german values and culture must be respected .
-lrb- 19.10.2010 -rrb- german president criticizes ' sweeping statements ' on integration germany 's president , christian wulff , has warned that blanket generalizations about muslim immigrants are wrong .
the comments come as he begins a tour of turkey , with the debate about integration rumbling on in germany .

his address had important messages for germans and turks , says baha gungor of dw 's turkish service . the omens for christian wulff 's third trip abroad as german president , this time to turkey , were unfavorable .
in germany , a debate on integration was raging , charged with emotions .
the weekly magazine " focus " published a cover with wulff 's face on it - distorted as an islamic prayer leader .
wulff had , however , merely pointed out in an october 3 speech that islam - in addition to christianity and judaism - is part of life in germany . public attention became focused on the first speech given by a german president to the turkish parliament .
wulff did not mince words .
for one , he repeated that islam has become an integral part of germany .
he also demanded that turkey acknowledge that christianity has a place in turkey , and that christians there should be free to worship as they wish .
that included priests being trained in turkey , he said , which is not possible now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha gungor , head of dw 's turkish department wulff did not avoid critical topics , such as turkey 's difficult relationship with cyprus and armenia .
not least , he affirmed israel 's right to exist while demanding an autonomous , viable and democratically ruled palestine .
that was an indirect request for turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to resume dialogue with israel . wulff refrained from making empty promises regarding turkey joining the european union .
shrewdly , clearly and unmistakably , wulff said that regardless of the democratic and economic progress turkey has indeed made , eu membership was not a foregone conclusion . the most distinct messages that wulff addressed to both germans and turks had to do with the need for people of turkish descent in germany to find a place in german society .
it was striking that wulff avoided using the loaded word " integration . "
his call for immigrants to learn the german language had been supported by the turkish president abdullah gul in the run-up to his visit .
and gul did not forget to mention in a joint press conference ahead of wulff 's speech that he was the president of all turkish citizens - those with armenian , jewish and greek roots included - and that all people in turkey should speak turkish . wulff 's five-day state visit will evidently help to minimize misunderstanding between berlin and ankara .
wulff 's manner has been well-received and his cautious words will not be ignored . whether a change of direction in germany 's out-of-control integration debate can be expected remains to be seen ; wulff does not have to win elections anymore . certain politicians , on the other hand , are not likely to pass on the strategy of pitting popular emotions against foreigners and migrants for their election campaigns . author : baha gungor -lrb- sst / rc -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes as his unpopular government is poised to implement painful austerity measures to combat a huge budget deficit . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has announced his biggest cabinet shuffle since taking office in 2004 .
in a nationally televised speech zapatero said that spain needed “ a politically strong ” and experienced government to manage the country ’ s difficult economic situation .
the cabinet shuffle is being seen as an effort to tackle the government ’ s widespread unpopularity in face of painful austerity measures .
zapatero 's government is poised to implement major spending cuts while at the same time raising taxes in an effort to reduce the country 's gaping public deficit and avoid a greek-style debt crisis .
the country ’ s unemployment rate stands at 20 percent - the highest in the european union .
recent opinion polls indicate that the opposition conservative popular party has the most support among the electorate , with a lead of around 15 percentage points over zapatero ’ s socialists . the prime minister 's approval rate has sunk to below 30 percent , the worst since his re-election in 2008 .
unexpected changes the extent of the shuffle came as a surprise as initially the prime minister ’ s office had only announced that labor minister celestine corbacho would be replaced .
his successor is the secretary general for employment , valeriano gomez .
interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba is to replace deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega .
rubalcaba , who is widely seen as a potential successor to zapatero , will however retain his old portfolio . the changes will also see foreign minister miguel angel moratinos be replaced by current health minister trinidad jimenez .
both moratinos and vega have been in office since the socialists won the 2004 elections .
the shuffle will also affect the health and the environment ministries .
the portfolio for housing and equality is being dissolved as part of the efforts to cut government spending .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 20.10.2010 development agencies need to move beyond life-saving aid , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making sure people survive is critical , but aid ca n't stop there development agencies need to rethink how they deal with disaster situations , an expert told dw .
instead of recreating pre-crisis life , they should stimulate economies so people are n't forced to live off foreign aid . dr. peter walker , the founder of the world disasters report , advocated professionalizing the disaster response business , developing both the global code of conduct for disaster workers and the sphere humanitarian standards .
he is the director of the feinstein international center at tufts university in the united states , and is involved in research into possible future global drivers of humanitarian crises , and the effectiveness of the international humanitarian system . he told deutsche welle about the changes in mentality that he thinks would make development aid more effective over the long-term . deutsche welle : you have put forward the premise that responding to humanitarian crises is becoming more problematic .
what is the problem ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development aid groups need to rethink their strategies , walker said dr. peter walker : i think what 's becoming problematic is the model we use .
the traditional model is that disasters are abnormal .
they knock you down , then you have response , and the response puts people back in a position to carry on with normal life .
just like the way we would recover after a car accident .
but what the research is showing is that as you have more processes that affect the way our economies work - like climate change , globalization , the increase in organized crime - there is a stress on society , and when there 's a crisis it 's much larger than it was in the past and it is much more pervasive .
it actually changes the direction of development and the way society moves forward .
that 's very different from what happened in the past . you almost need to think it 's no longer a temporary thing .
these crises permanently affect large populations and large parts of the economy , so we need to respond differently .
it 's not a sideshow anymore .
it 's actually an integral part of the economies .
that means aid agencies have to change the way they think about disaster response : how they work with local governments , how they can do a lot of work beforehand to try and influence the way governments look at risk reduction in their community . what needs to change ? the analysis that we 've done is that the old notion of quick crisis and long-term development is not quite right .
you have this body of people in the middle who essentially live off what is tantamount to an international social welfare system - in refugee camps , in internally displaced persons camps .
many of the pastoralist populations around the world are in this state , people who are living on the margins of cities and shanty towns , where there 's no obvious way forward in development terms , levels of violence are very high and effectively the main source of livelihood they have is humanitarian assistance .
but that 's just like being drip-fed in a hospital ward .
people do n't want to be in that position .
people are the same the world over .
they want to build a better future for their kids , and so they want to have economic opportunities . you advocate stimulating the economies of conflict-ridden states even as the conflict unfolds .
is that feasible ? i think we have really got to look again at how we work in these crisis situations .
you ca n't wait for stability before you start development .
somalia has n't been stable for 20 years ; it is not going to be stable .
that 's the reality .
so do you do development there ?
that 's really what agencies should be focusing on – how do you stimulate an economy in high levels of violence so that people have an opportunity . can you really stimulate an economy in times of violence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enabling trade would help those suffering in darfur the answer is yes , you can stimulate economies in crisis situations .
for instance , we are doing research in darfur , and one of the things that is obvious in darfur is that as a region it basically works by trading networks .
different agro-ecological zones , the desert in the north to tropics in the south , you need to trade .
everybody in darfur knows that , and conflict disrupts that trade .
re-establishing trade and the ability to move is in most people 's best interests .
even those who control armed groups , the money has to come from somewhere , and trade is a good thing .
you can establish trading networks and get the economy moving again .
it takes a bit of lateral thinking about how you 're going to do it , but it 's possible . do you see development agencies thinking on these lines ? i think there 's a certain inertia within aid agencies to approach crises in this fashion .
it 's still easier essentially just to provide social welfare services , and that 's absolutely necessary where the alternative is starvation , death from disease or lack of shelter .
but how do you build on that to go further ?
essentially what our research is showing is that just doing life-saving humanitarian assistance is necessary but not sufficient in these crises . who 's going to nudge the system in the direction you 're suggesting ? what works is trying to change the standards that people expect and the approaches they take .
that 's actually how most of our systems in the west work .
they are not through command and control .
they are through ratcheting up people 's expectations .
the way a health system improves in a country is because as a consumer you expect a certain higher level .
you become educated , you know what 's available and that moves the system in a certain direction .
i think that 's the approach : how do you change the expectations within aid agencies of what is good aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone use will let more people 's voices be heard to be honest , it 's also going to change because you 're going to find that the survivor populations in these areas have the ability to have a say .
the influence mobile phones have had in many of these crises in the last few years has been stunning because it enables people to have a voice .
that is going to change things dramatically in the next 10 years .
the populations that you 're serving will not be passive . you are critical of military humanitarianism , in afghanistan for instance , suggesting it 's a " weapons system " that is not attuned to the people 's real concerns . the purpose of any military system is to try and improve security .
you can think of things like money being a weapons system because you can use money to stimulate an economy , to improve security and to bribe people to improve security . from research we 've carried out in our center in afghanistan recently , when you really started to talk to afghans about what they thought caused insecurity what really angered them was n't really poverty .
it was the failure of governance .
the fact that they felt they did n't have leaders who represented them anymore , that they could n't trust leadership .
everywhere they turned , they saw corruption and people benefitting from the aid business but not them .
one of the things we 've realized is that if you 're running an aid project where you 're trying to spend a lot of money very quickly , in an area you do n't know , maybe in a field you have n't worked in very often , it fuels corruption and effectively makes it less secure . interview : ranjitha balasubramanyam editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de caucasus -pipe- 20.10.2010 chechnya still a long way from stability , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya has been in a state of crisis since the fall of the soviet union tuesday 's dramatic raid on the chechen parliament was a blow to russian claims that chechnya has been pacified .
commentators believe that only a change of policy can end the long years of violence and unrest . the kremlin remained bullish after the separatist attack on the chechen parliament in grozny on tuesday , in which three people were killed .
" as always , they -lrb- the militants -rrb- failed , " russian interior minister rashid nurgaliyev said at a televized meeting at the local interior ministry .
the minister , by coincidence on a trip to grozny , said the chechen gunmen were intercepted by interior ministry troops , and that the operation by the security forces to free the deputies was a success .
he then claimed chechnya was " stable and safe . "
but since russia officially ended its " counter-terror " operation in the province in april 2009 , there have been plenty of signs that chechnya is far from pacified .
the double bombings carried out by two suicide bombers on the moscow metro in march , which killed 40 and wounded more than 100 , showed that separatist violence has the power to reach the russian capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chechen parliament was attacked tuesday uwe halbach , researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the violence has actually been increasing in the region since 2009 .
" what we have in chechnya is a trend that is also evident in other republics in the northern caucasus , such as kabardino-balkaria and dagestan , " halbach told deutsche welle .
" attacks are being very deliberately directed at security organizations and authorities , in this case the parliament . "
scars from two wars chechnya unilaterally declared independence from russia in 1991 , following the collapse of the soviet union .
in 1994 , the first russian troops marched in to put the separatist movement down .
the destruction and reoccupation of the capital city grozny in 1996 represented only a partial resolution , and the ceasefire remained fragile .
the russian soldiers returned in 1999 , starting what has become known as the second chechen war .
this military offensive lasted until the spring of 2000 and ended with russia 's military occupation of the province .
but the underlying conflict lingered , and chechen resistance has continued since then , mostly in the form of guerrilla attacks on civilian targets in chechnya , neighboring dagestan and russia itself .
chechnya has been governed by presidents loyal to moscow since 2003 .
achmat kadyrov was killed in a bomb attack in 2004 and succeeded by his son ramzan kadyrov , who has been criticized for using extra-legal measures .
divided separatists but while kadyrov 's government faces a violent front of rebels who want to turn chechnya into an independent islamic state , many chechens have actually come to support the president in recent years .
ivan sukhov , caucasus correspondent for the independent moscow newspaper vremya novostyey , told deutsche welle , " in the last few years , ramzan kadyrov has almost become a figure symbolic of the chechen idea - the man who defends ethnic chechen interests .
that 's why many who fought for chechen freedom and independence from russia have joined him .
now there is a division in the movement . "
gerhard mangott , russia expert with the innsbruck institute for political science , says that three leading chechen rebels have now declared themselves against the idea of turning the republic into a muslim emirate .
instead , they favor a nation state based on the chechen ethnicity .
but it is this group that is apparently responsible for this week 's attack on the parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzan kadyrov has won some support recently " this group has abandoned doku umarov , who leads the islamist movement , " he said .
" it is certainly probable that this group started -lrb- this week 's -rrb- attacks to show it is capable of executing a massive strike on the center of president kadyrov 's power . "
mangott also notes a significant increase in rebel activity in the region in the last few months , particularly in dagestan and ingushetia , another russian republic bordering chechnya .
he believes the russian government 's attempts to stabilize the region have all failed so far .
both the tactic of military invasion and the tactic of targeted attacks on rebel leaders using secret service intelligence have so far yielded little result .
even russian president dmitry medvedev is apparently opening up to the idea that the solution can not only be a military one .
fresh ideas needed halbach also believes that russia should rethink its strategy in the northern caucasus .
development strategies that focus on social and economic problems are also necessary , and halbach believes the european union should support such initiatives and actively encourage russia to seek alternatives to military action .
but russia continues to declare the troubles in the region a domestic issue , making intervention in the form of international development aid impossible .
" i think there needs to be dialogue between the eu and russia about the alarming security situation in this region , " halbach said .
" it is not just russia 's ' internal foreign country , ' not just a crisis region on russia 's periphery , it is also a region on the edge of europe , and it is certainly in europe 's interests to know whether we can expect a further escalation in violence there , or whether it will be possible to limit it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 20.10.2010 opinion : german president pulls no punches in turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff was the first german president to make a speech in front of the turkish parliament .
his address had important messages for germans and turks , says baha gungor of dw 's turkish service . the omens for christian wulff 's third trip abroad as german president , this time to turkey , were unfavorable .
in germany , a debate on integration was raging , charged with emotions .
the weekly magazine " focus " published a cover with wulff 's face on it - distorted as an islamic prayer leader .
wulff had , however , merely pointed out in an october 3 speech that islam - in addition to christianity and judaism - is part of life in germany . public attention became focused on the first speech given by a german president to the turkish parliament .
wulff did not mince words .
for one , he repeated that islam has become an integral part of germany .
he also demanded that turkey acknowledge that christianity has a place in turkey , and that christians there should be free to worship as they wish .
that included priests being trained in turkey , he said , which is not possible now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha gungor , head of dw 's turkish department wulff did not avoid critical topics , such as turkey 's difficult relationship with cyprus and armenia .
not least , he affirmed israel 's right to exist while demanding an autonomous , viable and democratically ruled palestine .
that was an indirect request for turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to resume dialogue with israel . wulff refrained from making empty promises regarding turkey joining the european union .
shrewdly , clearly and unmistakably , wulff said that regardless of the democratic and economic progress turkey has indeed made , eu membership was not a foregone conclusion . the most distinct messages that wulff addressed to both germans and turks had to do with the need for people of turkish descent in germany to find a place in german society .
it was striking that wulff avoided using the loaded word " integration . "
his call for immigrants to learn the german language had been supported by the turkish president abdullah gul in the run-up to his visit .
and gul did not forget to mention in a joint press conference ahead of wulff 's speech that he was the president of all turkish citizens - those with armenian , jewish and greek roots included - and that all people in turkey should speak turkish . wulff 's five-day state visit will evidently help to minimize misunderstanding between berlin and ankara .
wulff 's manner has been well-received and his cautious words will not be ignored . whether a change of direction in germany 's out-of-control integration debate can be expected remains to be seen ; wulff does not have to win elections anymore . certain politicians , on the other hand , are not likely to pass on the strategy of pitting popular emotions against foreigners and migrants for their election campaigns . author : baha gungor -lrb- sst / rc -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de president wulff urges turks to ' actively integrate ' in germany in an unprecedented speech to the turkish parliament , german president christian wulff said immigrants in germany should take part fully in society .
he also stressed that german values and culture must be respected .
-lrb- 19.10.2010 -rrb- german president criticizes ' sweeping statements ' on integration germany 's president , christian wulff , has warned that blanket generalizations about muslim immigrants are wrong .
the comments come as he begins a tour of turkey , with the debate about integration rumbling on in germany .

werder bremen only managed a draw , failing to turn around a poor european campaign start . spanish striker raul scored twice as schalke clinched a win in their champions league group stage encounter against israeli side hapoel tel aviv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul 's compatriot jorado put the game out of reach for hapoel the first goal for schalke came after only three minutes , when a pass from dutchman klaas-jan huntelaar put raul one-on-one with tel aviv keeper vincent enyeama .
raul made no mistake and went on to double his tally after 58 minutes , rolling the ball across the line after an exchange of passes between huntelaar and substitute ivan rakitic .
raul 's fellow spaniard jose manuel jurado secured the win , controlling a high ball into the box to expertly curl the ball into goal .
there was a consolation for hapoel in the final minute of injury time , when forward etey schachter took advantage of a mistake in the schalke defense to score from a simple tap-in , brining the final tally to 3-1 for schalke .

but it is facing an uphill battle to win support for the idea , with opposition being spearheaded by germany , france and britain . the european commission 's proposal to introduce a europe-wide value-added tax is being met with stiff resistance from the 27-member bloc 's economic powerhouses , germany , france and britain .
the commission wants to introduce direct taxation from brussels for the 2014-2020 budget due to fears that cash-strapped governments may want to reduce their contributions to the bloc .
" at times where public spending is under pressure , we suggest ways to achieve a european budget that is up to the challenges we are facing collectively , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso .
among the eu executive 's proposals are the creation of a separate value-added tax , an eu energy tax or an eu corporate income tax .
under the current system , the eu raises about three quarters of its budget from national government contributions .
" this is not such a bad system because the national governments have a strong incentive to press for fiscal discipline in brussels , " professor friedrich heinemann of the centre for european economic research in mannheim told deutsche welle fears of eu expansion heinemann thinks the move is aimed at expanding the eu 's budget .
" why has the european commission been pressing so hard for years and even decades for a european tax ? " he asked . " it 's about preparing a more aggressive expansion of the budget .
this is a central interest of the european commission and the idea is to let the eu budget grow . "
those in favor of the tax believe it will create more transparency and add value to european decisions by giving europe real power to pool its resources to work on special projects .
" i do n't want the eu to deal with the size and shape of bananas .
i would like the eu to create value added at the european level , with things like large research projects , " henrik enderlein , professor of political economy at the hertie school of governance in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the eu can only do if it has this autonomous spending and taxing capacity , " he added critics are worried about tax increases .
the recent recession and debt crisis has already forced national governments to cut budgets and raise taxes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european wide vat could hit consumers but enderlein does n't think this will necessarily lead to more taxation .
he says that germany knows exactly which proportion of its tax is sent to europe and the european parliament could effectively replace this .
he argues that the elected european parliament would provide adequate democratic controls .
" look at the united states : in every state there is a different value added tax and that works perfectly well and so there can be taxation at different levels and i do n't see why this would n't function in the european union , " he told deutsche welle . observers say it is unlikely that such a form of direct taxation will be passed by the eu anytime soon , but enderlein thinks that it 's inevitable that countries sharing a single currency will eventually want to have taxation at european level .
" the process of eu integration is a process of unlikely events ultimately taking place .
nobody thought the single currency would appear or that borders would be abolished , but we saw all of these happen , " enderlein told deutsche welle .
to be adopted , any proposal must be approved by the eu 's member states and the european parliament .
the european commission plans to present proposed legislation by july of next year .

included in the resolution are 700 million euros to help educate poor children . the german cabinet on wednesday approved proposed legislation that would reform state benefits for the long-term unemployed .
the new policy would see the basic welfare payments , known as hartz iv , raised to 364 euros -lrb- $ 505 -rrb- per adult recipient per month - a five euro increase over the current rate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 20.10.2010 new television show confronts men looking for underage relationships großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the online world can be a dangerous place for children critics say a new television show that catches men chatting with teens about sex and then meeting up with them is mob justice .
along for the ride is defense minister theodor zu guttenberg 's wife , who co-hosts the show . the man 's face and body is completely pixilated .
his voice is distorted .
but it 's easy enough to see what this guy wants .
he 's had the windows of his car tinted so no one can see inside .
no one will notice them when they 're out in the woods , anyway , he tells his companion , who he thinks is just 13 years old .
this is " tatort internet , " a new television show that uses fake chat usernames to trick men into thinking they 're talking with young girls or boys and set up a meeting .
then they secretly film the encounter and confront the man with his inappropriate messages , the inappropriate photos he 's sent and his inappropriate intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister says the show could put innocent people at risk the show is co-hosted by stephanie zu guttenberg , the wife of german defense minister theodor zu guttenberg .
that did n't stop fellow cabinet member and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from expressing her distaste for the show to the newspaper passauer neue presse .
" there 's the risk that innocent people are being publicly condemned , " she said .
" the german legal system does n't have to resort to mob justice . "
one man featured on the show was identified and then fired from his job where he worked with teens .
he subsequently went missing for several days and his colleagues and family said they feared he may have killed himself .
he has since resurfaced .
paula honkanen-schoberth , director of the german league for child protection , told deutsche welle that she was also worried about the vigilante aspect of the television show .
" of course we think that sexual abuse is a severe crime and must be prosecuted in all possible , but legal ways , " she said .
" but in germany we live under the rule of law , and that is why we regard the criminal prosecution as a matter for the police .
and television is not the police .
and should n't act like it is . "
getting the safety message to teens what needs to be done , honkanen-schoberth said , is to get parents talking with their kids about staying safe online .
they should tell them not to give out their name and address or to meet up with strangers alone .
they should let them know they can always come to them if someone is threatening them or pressuring them to do something they do n't want to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents must talk with their children about staying safe online , says honkanen-schoberth honkanen-schoberth said she would welcome a show that addressed these things .
but media expert jo groeber from the german digital institute says the show itself could be a revolutionary way to inform young people about the dangers of the internet and chatting with adult strangers .
" it 's entertaining , it 's even , i 'm afraid to say it , thrilling , " he said .
" it 's probably tasteless , but it reaches the audience . "
one concern he does have , he said , is whether the show 's producers know of potential abusers for months at time before informing the police .
the guttenberg image stephanie zu guttenberg 's presence on the show comes as her husband 's political star gets brighter and brighter .
there 's even been speculation that he could become the country 's next chancellor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephanie zu guttenberg 's role in the show could affect her husband 's career in a survey by the forsa research institute released on wednesday , 25 percent of those surveyed said the defense minister would make a better chancellor than his boss , chancellor angela merkel .
this new role for stephanie zu guttenberg will only enhance her husband 's image , according to groebel .
" let 's be honest , the partner of a high-ranking politician is usually on the safe side .
they 're involved in charity work , but they never take any risks , " he said .
" i think the fact that she 's taking a risk will strengthen his image , as the husband of a completely independent wife . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 20.10.2010 opinion : german president pulls no punches in turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff was the first german president to make a speech in front of the turkish parliament .
his address had important messages for germans and turks , says baha gungor of dw 's turkish service . the omens for christian wulff 's third trip abroad as german president , this time to turkey , were unfavorable .
in germany , a debate on integration was raging , charged with emotions .
the weekly magazine " focus " published a cover with wulff 's face on it - distorted as an islamic prayer leader .
wulff had , however , merely pointed out in an october 3 speech that islam - in addition to christianity and judaism - is part of life in germany . public attention became focused on the first speech given by a german president to the turkish parliament .
wulff did not mince words .
for one , he repeated that islam has become an integral part of germany .
he also demanded that turkey acknowledge that christianity has a place in turkey , and that christians there should be free to worship as they wish .
that included priests being trained in turkey , he said , which is not possible now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha gungor , head of dw 's turkish department wulff did not avoid critical topics , such as turkey 's difficult relationship with cyprus and armenia .
not least , he affirmed israel 's right to exist while demanding an autonomous , viable and democratically ruled palestine .
that was an indirect request for turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to resume dialogue with israel . wulff refrained from making empty promises regarding turkey joining the european union .
shrewdly , clearly and unmistakably , wulff said that regardless of the democratic and economic progress turkey has indeed made , eu membership was not a foregone conclusion . the most distinct messages that wulff addressed to both germans and turks had to do with the need for people of turkish descent in germany to find a place in german society .
it was striking that wulff avoided using the loaded word " integration . "
his call for immigrants to learn the german language had been supported by the turkish president abdullah gul in the run-up to his visit .
and gul did not forget to mention in a joint press conference ahead of wulff 's speech that he was the president of all turkish citizens - those with armenian , jewish and greek roots included - and that all people in turkey should speak turkish . wulff 's five-day state visit will evidently help to minimize misunderstanding between berlin and ankara .
wulff 's manner has been well-received and his cautious words will not be ignored . whether a change of direction in germany 's out-of-control integration debate can be expected remains to be seen ; wulff does not have to win elections anymore . certain politicians , on the other hand , are not likely to pass on the strategy of pitting popular emotions against foreigners and migrants for their election campaigns . author : baha gungor -lrb- sst / rc -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de president wulff urges turks to ' actively integrate ' in germany in an unprecedented speech to the turkish parliament , german president christian wulff said immigrants in germany should take part fully in society .
he also stressed that german values and culture must be respected .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 20.10.2010 opinion : german president pulls no punches in turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff was the first german president to make a speech in front of the turkish parliament .
his address had important messages for germans and turks , says baha gungor of dw 's turkish service . the omens for christian wulff 's third trip abroad as german president , this time to turkey , were unfavorable .
in germany , a debate on integration was raging , charged with emotions .
the weekly magazine " focus " published a cover with wulff 's face on it - distorted as an islamic prayer leader .
wulff had , however , merely pointed out in an october 3 speech that islam - in addition to christianity and judaism - is part of life in germany . public attention became focused on the first speech given by a german president to the turkish parliament .
wulff did not mince words .
for one , he repeated that islam has become an integral part of germany .
he also demanded that turkey acknowledge that christianity has a place in turkey , and that christians there should be free to worship as they wish .
that included priests being trained in turkey , he said , which is not possible now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha gungor , head of dw 's turkish department wulff did not avoid critical topics , such as turkey 's difficult relationship with cyprus and armenia .
not least , he affirmed israel 's right to exist while demanding an autonomous , viable and democratically ruled palestine .
that was an indirect request for turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to resume dialogue with israel . wulff refrained from making empty promises regarding turkey joining the european union .
shrewdly , clearly and unmistakably , wulff said that regardless of the democratic and economic progress turkey has indeed made , eu membership was not a foregone conclusion . the most distinct messages that wulff addressed to both germans and turks had to do with the need for people of turkish descent in germany to find a place in german society .
it was striking that wulff avoided using the loaded word " integration . "
his call for immigrants to learn the german language had been supported by the turkish president abdullah gul in the run-up to his visit .
and gul did not forget to mention in a joint press conference ahead of wulff 's speech that he was the president of all turkish citizens - those with armenian , jewish and greek roots included - and that all people in turkey should speak turkish . wulff 's five-day state visit will evidently help to minimize misunderstanding between berlin and ankara .
wulff 's manner has been well-received and his cautious words will not be ignored . whether a change of direction in germany 's out-of-control integration debate can be expected remains to be seen ; wulff does not have to win elections anymore . certain politicians , on the other hand , are not likely to pass on the strategy of pitting popular emotions against foreigners and migrants for their election campaigns . author : baha gungor -lrb- sst / rc -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

along for the ride is defense minister theodor zu guttenberg 's wife , who co-hosts the show . the man 's face and body is completely pixilated .
his voice is distorted .
but it 's easy enough to see what this guy wants .
he 's had the windows of his car tinted so no one can see inside .
no one will notice them when they 're out in the woods , anyway , he tells his companion , who he thinks is just 13 years old .
this is " tatort internet , " a new television show that uses fake chat usernames to trick men into thinking they 're talking with young girls or boys and set up a meeting .
then they secretly film the encounter and confront the man with his inappropriate messages , the inappropriate photos he 's sent and his inappropriate intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister says the show could put innocent people at risk the show is co-hosted by stephanie zu guttenberg , the wife of german defense minister theodor zu guttenberg .
that did n't stop fellow cabinet member and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from expressing her distaste for the show to the newspaper passauer neue presse .
" there 's the risk that innocent people are being publicly condemned , " she said .
" the german legal system does n't have to resort to mob justice . "
one man featured on the show was identified and then fired from his job where he worked with teens .
he subsequently went missing for several days and his colleagues and family said they feared he may have killed himself .
he has since resurfaced .
paula honkanen-schoberth , director of the german league for child protection , told deutsche welle that she was also worried about the vigilante aspect of the television show .
" of course we think that sexual abuse is a severe crime and must be prosecuted in all possible , but legal ways , " she said .
" but in germany we live under the rule of law , and that is why we regard the criminal prosecution as a matter for the police .
and television is not the police .
and should n't act like it is . "
getting the safety message to teens what needs to be done , honkanen-schoberth said , is to get parents talking with their kids about staying safe online .
they should tell them not to give out their name and address or to meet up with strangers alone .
they should let them know they can always come to them if someone is threatening them or pressuring them to do something they do n't want to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents must talk with their children about staying safe online , says honkanen-schoberth honkanen-schoberth said she would welcome a show that addressed these things .
but media expert jo groeber from the german digital institute says the show itself could be a revolutionary way to inform young people about the dangers of the internet and chatting with adult strangers .
" it 's entertaining , it 's even , i 'm afraid to say it , thrilling , " he said .
" it 's probably tasteless , but it reaches the audience . "
one concern he does have , he said , is whether the show 's producers know of potential abusers for months at time before informing the police .
the guttenberg image stephanie zu guttenberg 's presence on the show comes as her husband 's political star gets brighter and brighter .
there 's even been speculation that he could become the country 's next chancellor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephanie zu guttenberg 's role in the show could affect her husband 's career in a survey by the forsa research institute released on wednesday , 25 percent of those surveyed said the defense minister would make a better chancellor than his boss , chancellor angela merkel .
this new role for stephanie zu guttenberg will only enhance her husband 's image , according to groebel .
" let 's be honest , the partner of a high-ranking politician is usually on the safe side .
they 're involved in charity work , but they never take any risks , " he said .
" i think the fact that she 's taking a risk will strengthen his image , as the husband of a completely independent wife . "

now the eu 's executive is considering a ban of the drug called meow meow . the european commission on wednesday called for a ban of the party drug , mephedrone , also known as " meow meow , " which has hallucinogenic effects similar to ecstasy . while the drug is illegal in 15 of the european union 's 27-memberbloc , including germany , estonia and romania , it remains legal in others , including spain , portugal , and greece . " mephedrone is a dangerous drug that is available online and on the street corner , " viviane reding , the eu 's justice commissioner , said in a statement .
" we have a responsibility to protect young people against dangerous new psychoactive substances like mephedrone , " she said . the drug has been linked to 37 deaths in britain and ireland and the commission 's proposal would make it an offense to manufacture or sell mephedrone .

included in the resolution are 700 million euros to help educate poor children . the german cabinet on wednesday approved proposed legislation that would reform state benefits for the long-term unemployed .

" we were not informed of this at all in advance . "
british soldiers are currently based at 12 sites in northern and western germany .

some 17,000 service personnel will be cut from the british forces ' payroll . cameron promised that the defense budget would remain the fourth-largest in the world and would meet a nato requirement for members to spend two percent of gross domestic product on defense . the defense cuts are part of a wider raft of measures being introduced by the government to cut spending by some 95 billion euros by 2015 , with the majority of cuts to be announced on wednesday afternoon .

the timetable means that the last british troops are set to leave 15 years earlier than originally planned . britain is to pull the last of its troops out of germany 15 years ahead of schedule as part of a wide-ranging program of defense cuts .
some 20,000 british service personnel are set to leave germany in the next decade .
the troops , originally stationed in the aftermath of the second world war , had previously been set to remain until 2035 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister cameron announced details of the military cuts " in terms of the return from germany , half our personnel should be back by 2015 and the remainder by 2020 , " prime minister david cameron said on tuesday , announcing details of the defense review .
a representative of the german army told the news agency reuters that the announcement had been unexpected . " we are all surprised , " spokeswoman helga heine said .
" we were not informed of this at all in advance . "
british soldiers are currently based at 12 sites in northern and western germany .
the review found that this was no longer necessary .
the united kingdom , france and the united states maintained troops in west germany throughout the cold war .
" the presence of the british military has played an important role in demonstrating alliance solidarity , and has also been a symbol of steadfast uk-german friendship , " the security review said .
but , it added , " there is no longer any operational requirement for uk forces to be based there . "
substantial reduction since end of cold war the former british army of the rhine - now british forces germany - had 58,000 soldiers stationed in germany in the 1980s .
that number was reduced substantially following the end of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osnabrueck was the largest british base outside the uk the last british troops left their base in osnabrueck , at one time home to the largest british garrison outside the united kingdom , in 2008 . britain 's defense budget , which totals 37 billion pounds -lrb- 42 billion euro , $ 58 billion -rrb- , is to be slashed by eight percent .
some 17,000 service personnel will be cut from the british forces ' payroll . cameron promised that the defense budget would remain the fourth-largest in the world and would meet a nato requirement for members to spend two percent of gross domestic product on defense . the defense cuts are part of a wider raft of measures being introduced by the government to cut spending by some 95 billion euros by 2015 , with the majority of cuts to be announced on wednesday afternoon .

but it is facing an uphill battle to win support for the idea , with opposition being spearheaded by germany , france and britain . the european commission 's proposal to introduce a europe-wide value-added tax is being met with stiff resistance from the 27-member bloc 's economic powerhouses , germany , france and britain .
the commission wants to introduce direct taxation from brussels for the 2014-2020 budget due to fears that cash-strapped governments may want to reduce their contributions to the bloc .
" at times where public spending is under pressure , we suggest ways to achieve a european budget that is up to the challenges we are facing collectively , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso .
among the eu executive 's proposals are the creation of a separate value-added tax , an eu energy tax or an eu corporate income tax .
under the current system , the eu raises about three quarters of its budget from national government contributions .
" this is not such a bad system because the national governments have a strong incentive to press for fiscal discipline in brussels , " professor friedrich heinemann of the centre for european economic research in mannheim told deutsche welle fears of eu expansion heinemann thinks the move is aimed at expanding the eu 's budget .
" why has the european commission been pressing so hard for years and even decades for a european tax ? " he asked . " it 's about preparing a more aggressive expansion of the budget .
this is a central interest of the european commission and the idea is to let the eu budget grow . "
those in favor of the tax believe it will create more transparency and add value to european decisions by giving europe real power to pool its resources to work on special projects .
" i do n't want the eu to deal with the size and shape of bananas .
i would like the eu to create value added at the european level , with things like large research projects , " henrik enderlein , professor of political economy at the hertie school of governance in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the eu can only do if it has this autonomous spending and taxing capacity , " he added critics are worried about tax increases .
the recent recession and debt crisis has already forced national governments to cut budgets and raise taxes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european wide vat could hit consumers but enderlein does n't think this will necessarily lead to more taxation .
he says that germany knows exactly which proportion of its tax is sent to europe and the european parliament could effectively replace this .

" look at the united states : in every state there is a different value added tax and that works perfectly well and so there can be taxation at different levels and i do n't see why this would n't function in the european union , " he told deutsche welle . observers say it is unlikely that such a form of direct taxation will be passed by the eu anytime soon , but enderlein thinks that it 's inevitable that countries sharing a single currency will eventually want to have taxation at european level .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de caucasus -pipe- 20.10.2010 chechnya still a long way from stability , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya has been in a state of crisis since the fall of the soviet union tuesday 's dramatic raid on the chechen parliament was a blow to russian claims that chechnya has been pacified .
commentators believe that only a change of policy can end the long years of violence and unrest . the kremlin remained bullish after the separatist attack on the chechen parliament in grozny on tuesday , in which three people were killed .
" as always , they -lrb- the militants -rrb- failed , " russian interior minister rashid nurgaliyev said at a televized meeting at the local interior ministry .
the minister , by coincidence on a trip to grozny , said the chechen gunmen were intercepted by interior ministry troops , and that the operation by the security forces to free the deputies was a success .
he then claimed chechnya was " stable and safe . "
but since russia officially ended its " counter-terror " operation in the province in april 2009 , there have been plenty of signs that chechnya is far from pacified .
the double bombings carried out by two suicide bombers on the moscow metro in march , which killed 40 and wounded more than 100 , showed that separatist violence has the power to reach the russian capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chechen parliament was attacked tuesday uwe halbach , researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the violence has actually been increasing in the region since 2009 .
" what we have in chechnya is a trend that is also evident in other republics in the northern caucasus , such as kabardino-balkaria and dagestan , " halbach told deutsche welle .
" attacks are being very deliberately directed at security organizations and authorities , in this case the parliament . "
scars from two wars chechnya unilaterally declared independence from russia in 1991 , following the collapse of the soviet union .
in 1994 , the first russian troops marched in to put the separatist movement down .
the destruction and reoccupation of the capital city grozny in 1996 represented only a partial resolution , and the ceasefire remained fragile .
the russian soldiers returned in 1999 , starting what has become known as the second chechen war .
this military offensive lasted until the spring of 2000 and ended with russia 's military occupation of the province .
but the underlying conflict lingered , and chechen resistance has continued since then , mostly in the form of guerrilla attacks on civilian targets in chechnya , neighboring dagestan and russia itself .
chechnya has been governed by presidents loyal to moscow since 2003 .
achmat kadyrov was killed in a bomb attack in 2004 and succeeded by his son ramzan kadyrov , who has been criticized for using extra-legal measures .
divided separatists but while kadyrov 's government faces a violent front of rebels who want to turn chechnya into an independent islamic state , many chechens have actually come to support the president in recent years .
ivan sukhov , caucasus correspondent for the independent moscow newspaper vremya novostyey , told deutsche welle , " in the last few years , ramzan kadyrov has almost become a figure symbolic of the chechen idea - the man who defends ethnic chechen interests .
that 's why many who fought for chechen freedom and independence from russia have joined him .
now there is a division in the movement . "
gerhard mangott , russia expert with the innsbruck institute for political science , says that three leading chechen rebels have now declared themselves against the idea of turning the republic into a muslim emirate .
instead , they favor a nation state based on the chechen ethnicity .
but it is this group that is apparently responsible for this week 's attack on the parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzan kadyrov has won some support recently " this group has abandoned doku umarov , who leads the islamist movement , " he said .
" it is certainly probable that this group started -lrb- this week 's -rrb- attacks to show it is capable of executing a massive strike on the center of president kadyrov 's power . "
mangott also notes a significant increase in rebel activity in the region in the last few months , particularly in dagestan and ingushetia , another russian republic bordering chechnya .
he believes the russian government 's attempts to stabilize the region have all failed so far .
both the tactic of military invasion and the tactic of targeted attacks on rebel leaders using secret service intelligence have so far yielded little result .
even russian president dmitry medvedev is apparently opening up to the idea that the solution can not only be a military one .
fresh ideas needed halbach also believes that russia should rethink its strategy in the northern caucasus .
development strategies that focus on social and economic problems are also necessary , and halbach believes the european union should support such initiatives and actively encourage russia to seek alternatives to military action .
but russia continues to declare the troubles in the region a domestic issue , making intervention in the form of international development aid impossible .
" i think there needs to be dialogue between the eu and russia about the alarming security situation in this region , " halbach said .
" it is not just russia 's ' internal foreign country , ' not just a crisis region on russia 's periphery , it is also a region on the edge of europe , and it is certainly in europe 's interests to know whether we can expect a further escalation in violence there , or whether it will be possible to limit it . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 20.10.2010 debate about islam in germany heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has seen a rise in anti-islamic feeling germany 's top-selling non-fiction bestseller is a book that attacks islam - and the german president ca n't get the public to agree with him when he says that islam is part of germany . thilo sarrazin , former state finance minister in berlin and just a short time ago on the board of the german central bank , has written a bestseller : " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany is doing away with itself " -rrb- .
he predicts a dire future for the country and he blames it above all on islam and the uncontrolled immigration of muslims .
most muslims have different values than the germans , he writes .
they ostensibly hold god higher than the constitutional state and democracy .
this is the reason , he claims , why germany will gradually do away with itself if it does n't carry out an active immigration and integration debate .
sarrazin 's arguments are meeting with a great deal of support .
but he is also encountering opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book has sparked much of the recent debate michael bommes , a sociologist teaching at the university of osnabrueck , notes that the current debate about islam shows that most people have still to grasp the fact that germany has long since become a country of immigrants , with a correspondingly complex diversity of values and viewpoints .
" through modern international immigration , world religions such as islam have now arrived in europe , " says bommes .
he argues that muslims have to adjust to this situation , as do the citizens of other european nations .
the relationships between politics , law and religion have to be rethought , he says .
people have always had to find compromises over these three elements .
and islam is making this necessary once more in today 's world .
fear of headscarves and mosques many germans are worried because they see their way of life being called into question by the presence of islam .
they find the headscarves and veils worn by muslim women particularly offensive .
they raise the possibility that these women are being oppressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic headwear is viewed with suspicion by many europeans such concerns are also evident in the results of a study recently published by the friedrich ebert foundation .
oliver decker , who led the study , speaks of a " very distinct increase from 34 percent to over half the population who agree with statements hostile to islam . "
many germans are also skeptical with regard to the building of new mosques , he says .
where do these negative appraisals of islam come from ?
islam scholar navid kermani believes that germans see their identity being threatened .
identity , he explains , is formed when we distinguish ourselves from other groups .
every social group defines itself by how it differs from other groups .
that 's why , he argues , it seems logical to keep one 's distance from islam .
after all , westerners tend to be unfamiliar with islamic symbols , making the religion seem especially alien .
the process of differentiation itself is then only natural .
but it becomes problematic when those who are different are declared to be the enemy .
a sometimes superficial discussion seen in this light , there is nothing reprehensible about the debate on islam .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de tourism -pipe- 20.10.2010 is goa still a safe place ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goa is one of the most popular tourist destinations in india with sand , beach and sun , goa is one of the most sought after tourist destinations in the world .
but india ’ s beach tourism capital that attracts millions of people every year is getting overcrowded . crimes against foreign tourists in the last couple of years have hit goa ’ s reputation as a holiday destination hard .
goa , which attracts half a million foreign tourists annually , has seen a string of crimes including rapes , murders and mysterious deaths involving foreign nationals .
over 40 per cent of the visitors are british followed by the russians and the isrealis .
reeling under the spate of crimes , the goa government was forced to look at novel security mechanisms , one of which involves setting up a tourist police force , manned by former servicemen .
media hype however tony frank , a hotelier blames the media for playing up the crimes .
" goa ’ s image is not being tarnished exactly .
it is just that the media at times creates all this hype , " he complains , " and all these problems are created by the media so that politicians are targeted in all these issues to run them down .
that is the end point of all the criticism and the problems that are taking place . "
bildunterschrift : tourism industry is booming in goa dominque fernandes who runs a holiday shack on utorda beach in south goa says the place is safe but discretion is important . he doesn ’ t think goa ’ s image has taken a beating .
for him goa is a safe place .
" it depends on how you behave and how you act with other people .
they should have their self-respect .. if you have your self-respect , no such things like rape or killing is going to happen .
and don ’ t ever go for drugs , " he says .
overcrowded but it is just not this side of goa that has recently been on display to the international community .
goa ’ s tourism belt is getting overcrowded .
some of its most scenic spots are being deprived of water resources , choked by sewage and inundated by humans .
pranab mukhopadhyay who teaches at goa university explains : " one needs to remember that in the last few years the tourist inflow exceeds the size of the domestic population .
and the pressure this puts on the resources of the state is fairly large and in the long run can impact quite cruelly on the state ’ s future earning capability .
i think a better managed tourism industry would not only be beneficial for the stakeholders of the industry but to those who come to the state to enjoy its pristine natural beauty . "
soaring real estate prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goa is famous for its white , sandy beaches in the last few years there has been rapid commercialization of the picturesque beaches that has prompted businessmen and realtors from other major cities to invest in goa .
this , in turn , has sharply pushed up land prices .
villages now have to contend with mega housing projects and the consequences are serious and solutions a long way off .
nascimento de souza , a retired professional blames the state authorities for the disorganized planning .
the party goes on " the trouble is that they have no plan .
i mean they talk of having a plan but it is a plan that is being produced by certain vested interests but not for the broader interests of goans or the future of goa , " he says .
but for some the problems seem far away too .
the party goes on .
just a stone ’ s throw from the sands of baga beach in the northern part of goa , mario runs the popular resort of cavala .
only time will tell whether commercial expansion and crime will harm goa 's pristine image and beauty and thus ruin it as a tourist destination .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 20.10.2010 debate about islam in germany heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has seen a rise in anti-islamic feeling germany 's top-selling non-fiction bestseller is a book that attacks islam - and the german president ca n't get the public to agree with him when he says that islam is part of germany . thilo sarrazin , former state finance minister in berlin and just a short time ago on the board of the german central bank , has written a bestseller : " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany is doing away with itself " -rrb- .
he predicts a dire future for the country and he blames it above all on islam and the uncontrolled immigration of muslims .
most muslims have different values than the germans , he writes .
they ostensibly hold god higher than the constitutional state and democracy .
this is the reason , he claims , why germany will gradually do away with itself if it does n't carry out an active immigration and integration debate .
sarrazin 's arguments are meeting with a great deal of support .
but he is also encountering opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book has sparked much of the recent debate michael bommes , a sociologist teaching at the university of osnabrueck , notes that the current debate about islam shows that most people have still to grasp the fact that germany has long since become a country of immigrants , with a correspondingly complex diversity of values and viewpoints .
" through modern international immigration , world religions such as islam have now arrived in europe , " says bommes .
he argues that muslims have to adjust to this situation , as do the citizens of other european nations .
the relationships between politics , law and religion have to be rethought , he says .
people have always had to find compromises over these three elements .
and islam is making this necessary once more in today 's world .
fear of headscarves and mosques many germans are worried because they see their way of life being called into question by the presence of islam .
they find the headscarves and veils worn by muslim women particularly offensive .
they raise the possibility that these women are being oppressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic headwear is viewed with suspicion by many europeans such concerns are also evident in the results of a study recently published by the friedrich ebert foundation .
oliver decker , who led the study , speaks of a " very distinct increase from 34 percent to over half the population who agree with statements hostile to islam . "
many germans are also skeptical with regard to the building of new mosques , he says .
where do these negative appraisals of islam come from ?
islam scholar navid kermani believes that germans see their identity being threatened .
identity , he explains , is formed when we distinguish ourselves from other groups .
every social group defines itself by how it differs from other groups .
that 's why , he argues , it seems logical to keep one 's distance from islam .
after all , westerners tend to be unfamiliar with islamic symbols , making the religion seem especially alien .
the process of differentiation itself is then only natural .
but it becomes problematic when those who are different are declared to be the enemy .
a sometimes superficial discussion seen in this light , there is nothing reprehensible about the debate on islam .
it seems to reflect primarily the struggle for a new german self-image and the difficulties connected with the fact that germany has indeed become a country of immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western impressions of islam may be too simplistic nevertheless , political scientist claus leggewie contends that the discussions about islam are often conducted on too superficial a level .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.10.2010 merkel 's cabinet approves reform to unemployment benefits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics have attacked minimal hikes to unemployment payments the german government has put forth a bill to increase unemployment payments by five euros a month - but critics say it 's not enough .
included in the resolution are 700 million euros to help educate poor children . the german cabinet on wednesday approved proposed legislation that would reform state benefits for the long-term unemployed .
the new policy would see the basic welfare payments , known as hartz iv , raised to 364 euros -lrb- $ 505 -rrb- per adult recipient per month - a five euro increase over the current rate .
in order to satisfy a constitutional court ruling , the bill must be passed into law by year 's end .
chancellor merkel 's center-right coalition government does n't have a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , and the opposition has said that it will only approve the bill if signifigant amendments are made .
merkel defends reforms against criticism since chancellor merkel 's center-right coalition government unveiled its proposals last month , opposition parties have criticized the increase as being too small .
" a failure to massively raise -lsb- welfare -rsb- rates will mean a permanent state of poverty and marginalization , " said gregor gysi , the head of the left party 's parliamentary group .
the chancellor meanwhile defended the welfare reforms .
" hartz iv is not a way of life , " merkel said in berlin on wednesday , adding that the payments were " meant as a bridge back to employment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen called on germany 's parties to work together to pass the reform more money for education the new measures , which are expected to cost an additional 900 million euros , include 700 million to improve education for children in welfare recipient households .
yet opponents say the education package is not enough either .
gysi said it was " not enough to finance a sports club or a music school and certainly not remedial courses . "
chancellor merkel expressed some sympathy for welfare beneficiaries , saying , " i know that -lsb- these cuts -rsb- can be hard .
but there must be some motivation to go back to work . "
the new regulation needs to be passed into law before the end of the year , to satisfy a court ruling that deemed the way the payments have been calculated up until now to be unconstitutional . the government hopes to be able to implement the reforms on january 1 , 2011 .
labor minister ursula von der leyen called on all parties to work together in order to make the reform work , saying that the “ this tight deadline means we all have to take responsibility . ”

india is widely viewed as an emerging great power in asia .
the south asian sub-continent is on the rise politically as well as economically .
but india has to cope with several key issues to secure its new-found status . the crisis-torn region of kashmir has experienced one of its bloodiest summers ever .
after a teenager was allegedly killed by indian security forces violence erupted amongst young kashmiris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kashmir has been a bone of contention between india and pakistan for decades more than 100 people have died in the last couple of months in indian-administered kashmir .
the disputed region has been a bone of contention between india and pakistan for the past 60 years , with neither side willing to give an inch .
arch-rivals after the mumbai terror attacks of 2008 , which was planned on pakistani soil , diplomatic relations between the two sides cooled down .
the peace process between india and pakistan came to a standstill .
foreign policy expert raja mohan from delhi says pakistan has more than enough problems of its own .
" right now , pakistan is in a bad shape .
not only because of the floods .
the civilian government has problems , the military has gained a lot more power , " says mohan , " so you have a situation where you have no single authority to negotiate to within pakistan .
so i don ’ t see any prospects for any breakthrough .

because " there are no great powers which have significant problems with their neighbors .
so therefore resolving the disputes with pakistan is an important one purely from an instrumental perspective , " he explains .
one might think that india has already enough issues to solve with pakistan .

both are powerhouses in the region in terms of the size of their respective populations and economies .
as economic relations between the two intensify , political conflicts are on the rise , especially as china becomes more successful and dominant .
strategic game it is a rivalry and partnership .
" since today india ’ s power sector has been already dominated by chinese suppliers .
china is playing a big role in india ’ s telecom industry , " says mohan , " we might even invite chinese companies to build roads in india .
so , on the economic side you see an expansion of the partnership .
more on the political side , in terms of how we look at each other , more in terms of our boundaries our perspective role in asia and in the world there is a problem . "
china is also a close ally of pakistan .

india is happy to deepen its relationship with the us , and is even warming up its old ties with russia to fence china in .

german eurostar competitor completes first trip to london i have travelled on both the ice and tgv trains during visits to europe .
of course , the tgv was very exciting when it first came out .
the ice has always been a smooth ride before that .
so , i have no preference at this point but am glad to see competition between the two .
both ice and tgv are comfortable and reliable , so the passenger can then choose based on price and routes . - rome , us german , french rail companies on collision course over channel tunnel eurotunnel is underused by rail passengers .
it should be opened up to other operators in addition to eurostar , also , london is not the only city of high population in the uk to which there should be a high speed link .
other cities that could benefit include birmingham , manchester and glasgow . - roderick , oman its common knowledge that protectionism is rife in france , for example cars , aircraft etc . , but they must be made to realize that that behavior will not be tolerated any more .
eurostar has a perfect right to choose what is best for them - not france ! - richard , great britain french government says ' non ' to german eurostar trains at the moment , and for a while to come , france has enough on its plate vis-a-vis the never ending number of strikes , that make running any trains , a serious challenge .
the simple answer would be to increase the number of scheduled services , so that an increase in passenger volume would lead to more attractive prices in comparison to the alternative of air travel . - charles , great britain german train completes test trip under channel having had the enjoyment of riding with deutsche bahn in germany on many occasions , to be able to travel to , say , cologne without having to change at brussels , only to find the connecting train did n't wait for the late running eurostar service , is going to be great !
but i think db is going to have to sort out those pesky wheels once and for all before committing the ice 's to the tunnel . - tony , great britain deutsche bahn 's proposed high speed service from st. pancras is wonderful news and will most certainly be a great success for both the business and leisure sectors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 20.10.2010 development agencies need to move beyond life-saving aid , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making sure people survive is critical , but aid ca n't stop there development agencies need to rethink how they deal with disaster situations , an expert told dw .
instead of recreating pre-crisis life , they should stimulate economies so people are n't forced to live off foreign aid . dr. peter walker , the founder of the world disasters report , advocated professionalizing the disaster response business , developing both the global code of conduct for disaster workers and the sphere humanitarian standards .
he is the director of the feinstein international center at tufts university in the united states , and is involved in research into possible future global drivers of humanitarian crises , and the effectiveness of the international humanitarian system . he told deutsche welle about the changes in mentality that he thinks would make development aid more effective over the long-term . deutsche welle : you have put forward the premise that responding to humanitarian crises is becoming more problematic .
what is the problem ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development aid groups need to rethink their strategies , walker said dr. peter walker : i think what 's becoming problematic is the model we use .
the traditional model is that disasters are abnormal .
they knock you down , then you have response , and the response puts people back in a position to carry on with normal life .
just like the way we would recover after a car accident .
but what the research is showing is that as you have more processes that affect the way our economies work - like climate change , globalization , the increase in organized crime - there is a stress on society , and when there 's a crisis it 's much larger than it was in the past and it is much more pervasive .
it actually changes the direction of development and the way society moves forward .
that 's very different from what happened in the past . you almost need to think it 's no longer a temporary thing .
these crises permanently affect large populations and large parts of the economy , so we need to respond differently .
it 's not a sideshow anymore .
it 's actually an integral part of the economies .
that means aid agencies have to change the way they think about disaster response : how they work with local governments , how they can do a lot of work beforehand to try and influence the way governments look at risk reduction in their community . what needs to change ? the analysis that we 've done is that the old notion of quick crisis and long-term development is not quite right .
you have this body of people in the middle who essentially live off what is tantamount to an international social welfare system - in refugee camps , in internally displaced persons camps .
many of the pastoralist populations around the world are in this state , people who are living on the margins of cities and shanty towns , where there 's no obvious way forward in development terms , levels of violence are very high and effectively the main source of livelihood they have is humanitarian assistance .
but that 's just like being drip-fed in a hospital ward .
people do n't want to be in that position .
people are the same the world over .
they want to build a better future for their kids , and so they want to have economic opportunities . you advocate stimulating the economies of conflict-ridden states even as the conflict unfolds .
is that feasible ? i think we have really got to look again at how we work in these crisis situations .
you ca n't wait for stability before you start development .
somalia has n't been stable for 20 years ; it is not going to be stable .
that 's the reality .
so do you do development there ?
that 's really what agencies should be focusing on – how do you stimulate an economy in high levels of violence so that people have an opportunity . can you really stimulate an economy in times of violence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enabling trade would help those suffering in darfur the answer is yes , you can stimulate economies in crisis situations .
for instance , we are doing research in darfur , and one of the things that is obvious in darfur is that as a region it basically works by trading networks .
different agro-ecological zones , the desert in the north to tropics in the south , you need to trade .
everybody in darfur knows that , and conflict disrupts that trade .
re-establishing trade and the ability to move is in most people 's best interests .
even those who control armed groups , the money has to come from somewhere , and trade is a good thing .
you can establish trading networks and get the economy moving again .
it takes a bit of lateral thinking about how you 're going to do it , but it 's possible . do you see development agencies thinking on these lines ? i think there 's a certain inertia within aid agencies to approach crises in this fashion .
it 's still easier essentially just to provide social welfare services , and that 's absolutely necessary where the alternative is starvation , death from disease or lack of shelter .
but how do you build on that to go further ?
essentially what our research is showing is that just doing life-saving humanitarian assistance is necessary but not sufficient in these crises . who 's going to nudge the system in the direction you 're suggesting ? what works is trying to change the standards that people expect and the approaches they take .
that 's actually how most of our systems in the west work .
they are not through command and control .
they are through ratcheting up people 's expectations .
the way a health system improves in a country is because as a consumer you expect a certain higher level .
you become educated , you know what 's available and that moves the system in a certain direction .
i think that 's the approach : how do you change the expectations within aid agencies of what is good aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone use will let more people 's voices be heard to be honest , it 's also going to change because you 're going to find that the survivor populations in these areas have the ability to have a say .
the influence mobile phones have had in many of these crises in the last few years has been stunning because it enables people to have a voice .
that is going to change things dramatically in the next 10 years .
the populations that you 're serving will not be passive . you are critical of military humanitarianism , in afghanistan for instance , suggesting it 's a " weapons system " that is not attuned to the people 's real concerns . the purpose of any military system is to try and improve security .
you can think of things like money being a weapons system because you can use money to stimulate an economy , to improve security and to bribe people to improve security . from research we 've carried out in our center in afghanistan recently , when you really started to talk to afghans about what they thought caused insecurity what really angered them was n't really poverty .
it was the failure of governance .
the fact that they felt they did n't have leaders who represented them anymore , that they could n't trust leadership .
everywhere they turned , they saw corruption and people benefitting from the aid business but not them .
one of the things we 've realized is that if you 're running an aid project where you 're trying to spend a lot of money very quickly , in an area you do n't know , maybe in a field you have n't worked in very often , it fuels corruption and effectively makes it less secure . interview : ranjitha balasubramanyam editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an attempt to get the uk back on track , the chancellor of the exchequer has announced new austerity measures , including half a million job cuts . british chancellor of the exchequer george osborne used a speech to the house of commons on wednesday to announce his country 's biggest public spending cuts since world war ii .
the chancellor outlined budget cuts to the tune of seven billion pounds -lrb- eight billion euros , $ 11 billion -rrb- as well as projected spending reductions of 81 billion pounds over four years .
" today is the day when britain steps back from the brink , when we confront the bills from a decade of debt , " osborne said , to cheers from the government benches in the house .
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- a day of rebuilding , when we set out a four-year plan to put our public services and welfare state on a sustainable footing for the long term , " he added .
slashing the budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans major spending cuts the conservative chancellor outlined wide-reaching austerity measures , including a drop in police budgets , a 24-percent cut in spending by the foreign office and an increase in the state pension age from 65 to 66 in 2020 - six years earlier than previously planned .
the government also intends to slash welfare spending by making changes to incapacity and housing benefits .
the opposition labour party meanwhile accused osborne of playing with people 's futures , with half a million public sector jobs expected to be lost .
while britain has remained true to its overseas aid pledges and increased spending on schools and the national health service , it will now make cuts to departmental budgets at an average of just under 20 percent .
job cuts ' reckless ' reining in spending means cutting some 490,000 public sector jobs , according to the office for budgetary responsibility .
the chancellor said he regretted that many would lose their jobs , but that it " is unavoidable when the country runs out of money . "
shadow chancellor alan johnson came out against the proposed job cuts , saying they were " reckless " and that the british people would suffer .
" today is the day that abstract figures and spread-sheets turn into people 's futures , people 's jobs , people 's services , their prospects for the future , " johnson said .
deficit triples disaster rates but the coalition government has laid blame for the cuts at the door of the previous labour administration for running up significant debts .
they insist that action must be taken now , and rapidly , if investor confidence in the british economy is to be restored .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the queen 's allowance will be affected by budget cuts the sheer size of britain 's debts makes cuts necessary , according to dr. andrew lilico , chief economist at right-of-center think tank policy exchange .
" running a deficit of around 10 percent of gdp is just way off the mark , " lilico said , adding that " within europe there are restrictions under treaty rules that say they should have deficits of no more than three percent of gdp . "
" we 're running a deficit well over three times as much as what was previously thought to be the absolute maximum that you should be running even in a disaster scenario , " lilico added .
unions plan to put up a fight trade unions , meanwhile , are promising to fight public sector job losses and have threatened widespread industrial action .
already on wednesday , protesters descended on westminster to express their disapproval of the austerity measures .
eighty-one billion pounds worth of cuts over four years represent an approximate halving of britain 's budget deficit .
the coalition government claims this will restore the economy to health , although opponents argue the measures may have the opposite effect , plunging britain back into recession .

in an attempt to get the uk back on track , the chancellor of the exchequer has announced new austerity measures , including half a million job cuts . british chancellor of the exchequer george osborne used a speech to the house of commons on wednesday to announce his country 's biggest public spending cuts since world war ii .
the chancellor outlined budget cuts to the tune of seven billion pounds -lrb- eight billion euros , $ 11 billion -rrb- as well as projected spending reductions of 81 billion pounds over four years .
" today is the day when britain steps back from the brink , when we confront the bills from a decade of debt , " osborne said , to cheers from the government benches in the house .
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- a day of rebuilding , when we set out a four-year plan to put our public services and welfare state on a sustainable footing for the long term , " he added .
slashing the budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans major spending cuts the conservative chancellor outlined wide-reaching austerity measures , including a drop in police budgets , a 24-percent cut in spending by the foreign office and an increase in the state pension age from 65 to 66 in 2020 - six years earlier than previously planned .
the government also intends to slash welfare spending by making changes to incapacity and housing benefits .
the opposition labour party meanwhile accused osborne of playing with people 's futures , with half a million public sector jobs expected to be lost .
while britain has remained true to its overseas aid pledges and increased spending on schools and the national health service , it will now make cuts to departmental budgets at an average of just under 20 percent .
job cuts ' reckless ' reining in spending means cutting some 490,000 public sector jobs , according to the office for budgetary responsibility .
the chancellor said he regretted that many would lose their jobs , but that it " is unavoidable when the country runs out of money . "
shadow chancellor alan johnson came out against the proposed job cuts , saying they were " reckless " and that the british people would suffer .
" today is the day that abstract figures and spread-sheets turn into people 's futures , people 's jobs , people 's services , their prospects for the future , " johnson said .
deficit triples disaster rates but the coalition government has laid blame for the cuts at the door of the previous labour administration for running up significant debts .
they insist that action must be taken now , and rapidly , if investor confidence in the british economy is to be restored .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the queen 's allowance will be affected by budget cuts the sheer size of britain 's debts makes cuts necessary , according to dr. andrew lilico , chief economist at right-of-center think tank policy exchange .
" running a deficit of around 10 percent of gdp is just way off the mark , " lilico said , adding that " within europe there are restrictions under treaty rules that say they should have deficits of no more than three percent of gdp . "
" we 're running a deficit well over three times as much as what was previously thought to be the absolute maximum that you should be running even in a disaster scenario , " lilico added .
unions plan to put up a fight trade unions , meanwhile , are promising to fight public sector job losses and have threatened widespread industrial action .
already on wednesday , protesters descended on westminster to express their disapproval of the austerity measures .
eighty-one billion pounds worth of cuts over four years represent an approximate halving of britain 's budget deficit .
the coalition government claims this will restore the economy to health , although opponents argue the measures may have the opposite effect , plunging britain back into recession .

india is widely viewed as an emerging great power in asia .
the south asian sub-continent is on the rise politically as well as economically .
but india has to cope with several key issues to secure its new-found status . the crisis-torn region of kashmir has experienced one of its bloodiest summers ever .
after a teenager was allegedly killed by indian security forces violence erupted amongst young kashmiris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kashmir has been a bone of contention between india and pakistan for decades more than 100 people have died in the last couple of months in indian-administered kashmir .
the disputed region has been a bone of contention between india and pakistan for the past 60 years , with neither side willing to give an inch .
arch-rivals after the mumbai terror attacks of 2008 , which was planned on pakistani soil , diplomatic relations between the two sides cooled down .
the peace process between india and pakistan came to a standstill .
foreign policy expert raja mohan from delhi says pakistan has more than enough problems of its own .
" right now , pakistan is in a bad shape .
not only because of the floods .
the civilian government has problems , the military has gained a lot more power , " says mohan , " so you have a situation where you have no single authority to negotiate to within pakistan .
so i don ’ t see any prospects for any breakthrough .
unless pakistan itself stabilizes to some extent . "
bildunterschrift : arch-rivals armed to the teeth , also with nuclear weapons the other mighty neighbor and india has to solve its issues with pakistan , says raja mohan - not only because both nations are nuclear powers .
because " there are no great powers which have significant problems with their neighbors .
so therefore resolving the disputes with pakistan is an important one purely from an instrumental perspective , " he explains .
one might think that india has already enough issues to solve with pakistan .
but india also shares a border with china .
both are powerhouses in the region in terms of the size of their respective populations and economies .
as economic relations between the two intensify , political conflicts are on the rise , especially as china becomes more successful and dominant .
strategic game it is a rivalry and partnership .
" since today india ’ s power sector has been already dominated by chinese suppliers .
china is playing a big role in india ’ s telecom industry , " says mohan , " we might even invite chinese companies to build roads in india .
so , on the economic side you see an expansion of the partnership .
more on the political side , in terms of how we look at each other , more in terms of our boundaries our perspective role in asia and in the world there is a problem . "
china is also a close ally of pakistan .
and amidst all of this there is another player : the usa .
in recent years the united states has tried to court india ’ s partnership , also to balance china ’ s growing influence within asia .
india is happy to deepen its relationship with the us , and is even warming up its old ties with russia to fence china in .
and all the time indian policymakers are looking north , over the himalayas , to see what beijing will do next in the big strategic game in asia in the 21st century .

the timetable means that the last british troops are set to leave 15 years earlier than originally planned . britain is to pull the last of its troops out of germany 15 years ahead of schedule as part of a wide-ranging program of defense cuts .
some 20,000 british service personnel are set to leave germany in the next decade .
the troops , originally stationed in the aftermath of the second world war , had previously been set to remain until 2035 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister cameron announced details of the military cuts " in terms of the return from germany , half our personnel should be back by 2015 and the remainder by 2020 , " prime minister david cameron said on tuesday , announcing details of the defense review .
a representative of the german army told the news agency reuters that the announcement had been unexpected . " we are all surprised , " spokeswoman helga heine said .
" we were not informed of this at all in advance . "
british soldiers are currently based at 12 sites in northern and western germany .
the review found that this was no longer necessary .
the united kingdom , france and the united states maintained troops in west germany throughout the cold war .
" the presence of the british military has played an important role in demonstrating alliance solidarity , and has also been a symbol of steadfast uk-german friendship , " the security review said .
but , it added , " there is no longer any operational requirement for uk forces to be based there . "
substantial reduction since end of cold war the former british army of the rhine - now british forces germany - had 58,000 soldiers stationed in germany in the 1980s .
that number was reduced substantially following the end of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osnabrueck was the largest british base outside the uk the last british troops left their base in osnabrueck , at one time home to the largest british garrison outside the united kingdom , in 2008 . britain 's defense budget , which totals 37 billion pounds -lrb- 42 billion euro , $ 58 billion -rrb- , is to be slashed by eight percent .
some 17,000 service personnel will be cut from the british forces ' payroll . cameron promised that the defense budget would remain the fourth-largest in the world and would meet a nato requirement for members to spend two percent of gross domestic product on defense . the defense cuts are part of a wider raft of measures being introduced by the government to cut spending by some 95 billion euros by 2015 , with the majority of cuts to be announced on wednesday afternoon .

but it is facing an uphill battle to win support for the idea , with opposition being spearheaded by germany , france and britain . the european commission 's proposal to introduce a europe-wide value-added tax is being met with stiff resistance from the 27-member bloc 's economic powerhouses , germany , france and britain .
the commission wants to introduce direct taxation from brussels for the 2014-2020 budget due to fears that cash-strapped governments may want to reduce their contributions to the bloc .
" at times where public spending is under pressure , we suggest ways to achieve a european budget that is up to the challenges we are facing collectively , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso .
among the eu executive 's proposals are the creation of a separate value-added tax , an eu energy tax or an eu corporate income tax .
under the current system , the eu raises about three quarters of its budget from national government contributions .
" this is not such a bad system because the national governments have a strong incentive to press for fiscal discipline in brussels , " professor friedrich heinemann of the centre for european economic research in mannheim told deutsche welle fears of eu expansion heinemann thinks the move is aimed at expanding the eu 's budget .
" why has the european commission been pressing so hard for years and even decades for a european tax ? " he asked . " it 's about preparing a more aggressive expansion of the budget .
this is a central interest of the european commission and the idea is to let the eu budget grow . "
those in favor of the tax believe it will create more transparency and add value to european decisions by giving europe real power to pool its resources to work on special projects .
" i do n't want the eu to deal with the size and shape of bananas .
i would like the eu to create value added at the european level , with things like large research projects , " henrik enderlein , professor of political economy at the hertie school of governance in berlin told deutsche welle .
" the eu can only do if it has this autonomous spending and taxing capacity , " he added critics are worried about tax increases .
the recent recession and debt crisis has already forced national governments to cut budgets and raise taxes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european wide vat could hit consumers but enderlein does n't think this will necessarily lead to more taxation .
he says that germany knows exactly which proportion of its tax is sent to europe and the european parliament could effectively replace this .
he argues that the elected european parliament would provide adequate democratic controls .
" look at the united states : in every state there is a different value added tax and that works perfectly well and so there can be taxation at different levels and i do n't see why this would n't function in the european union , " he told deutsche welle . observers say it is unlikely that such a form of direct taxation will be passed by the eu anytime soon , but enderlein thinks that it 's inevitable that countries sharing a single currency will eventually want to have taxation at european level .
" the process of eu integration is a process of unlikely events ultimately taking place .
nobody thought the single currency would appear or that borders would be abolished , but we saw all of these happen , " enderlein told deutsche welle .
to be adopted , any proposal must be approved by the eu 's member states and the european parliament .
the european commission plans to present proposed legislation by july of next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 20.10.2010 opinion : german president pulls no punches in turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff was the first german president to make a speech in front of the turkish parliament .
his address had important messages for germans and turks , says baha gungor of dw 's turkish service . the omens for christian wulff 's third trip abroad as german president , this time to turkey , were unfavorable .
in germany , a debate on integration was raging , charged with emotions .
the weekly magazine " focus " published a cover with wulff 's face on it - distorted as an islamic prayer leader .
wulff had , however , merely pointed out in an october 3 speech that islam - in addition to christianity and judaism - is part of life in germany . public attention became focused on the first speech given by a german president to the turkish parliament .
wulff did not mince words .
for one , he repeated that islam has become an integral part of germany .
he also demanded that turkey acknowledge that christianity has a place in turkey , and that christians there should be free to worship as they wish .
that included priests being trained in turkey , he said , which is not possible now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha gungor , head of dw 's turkish department wulff did not avoid critical topics , such as turkey 's difficult relationship with cyprus and armenia .
not least , he affirmed israel 's right to exist while demanding an autonomous , viable and democratically ruled palestine .
that was an indirect request for turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to resume dialogue with israel . wulff refrained from making empty promises regarding turkey joining the european union .
shrewdly , clearly and unmistakably , wulff said that regardless of the democratic and economic progress turkey has indeed made , eu membership was not a foregone conclusion . the most distinct messages that wulff addressed to both germans and turks had to do with the need for people of turkish descent in germany to find a place in german society .
it was striking that wulff avoided using the loaded word " integration . "
his call for immigrants to learn the german language had been supported by the turkish president abdullah gul in the run-up to his visit .
and gul did not forget to mention in a joint press conference ahead of wulff 's speech that he was the president of all turkish citizens - those with armenian , jewish and greek roots included - and that all people in turkey should speak turkish . wulff 's five-day state visit will evidently help to minimize misunderstanding between berlin and ankara .
wulff 's manner has been well-received and his cautious words will not be ignored . whether a change of direction in germany 's out-of-control integration debate can be expected remains to be seen ; wulff does not have to win elections anymore . certain politicians , on the other hand , are not likely to pass on the strategy of pitting popular emotions against foreigners and migrants for their election campaigns . author : baha gungor -lrb- sst / rc -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de president wulff urges turks to ' actively integrate ' in germany in an unprecedented speech to the turkish parliament , german president christian wulff said immigrants in germany should take part fully in society .

in an attempt to get the uk back on track , the chancellor of the exchequer has announced new austerity measures , including half a million job cuts . british chancellor of the exchequer george osborne used a speech to the house of commons on wednesday to announce his country 's biggest public spending cuts since world war ii .
the chancellor outlined budget cuts to the tune of seven billion pounds -lrb- eight billion euros , $ 11 billion -rrb- as well as projected spending reductions of 81 billion pounds over four years .
" today is the day when britain steps back from the brink , when we confront the bills from a decade of debt , " osborne said , to cheers from the government benches in the house .
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- a day of rebuilding , when we set out a four-year plan to put our public services and welfare state on a sustainable footing for the long term , " he added .
slashing the budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans major spending cuts the conservative chancellor outlined wide-reaching austerity measures , including a drop in police budgets , a 24-percent cut in spending by the foreign office and an increase in the state pension age from 65 to 66 in 2020 - six years earlier than previously planned .
the government also intends to slash welfare spending by making changes to incapacity and housing benefits .
the opposition labour party meanwhile accused osborne of playing with people 's futures , with half a million public sector jobs expected to be lost .
while britain has remained true to its overseas aid pledges and increased spending on schools and the national health service , it will now make cuts to departmental budgets at an average of just under 20 percent .
job cuts ' reckless ' reining in spending means cutting some 490,000 public sector jobs , according to the office for budgetary responsibility .
the chancellor said he regretted that many would lose their jobs , but that it " is unavoidable when the country runs out of money . "
shadow chancellor alan johnson came out against the proposed job cuts , saying they were " reckless " and that the british people would suffer .
" today is the day that abstract figures and spread-sheets turn into people 's futures , people 's jobs , people 's services , their prospects for the future , " johnson said .
deficit triples disaster rates but the coalition government has laid blame for the cuts at the door of the previous labour administration for running up significant debts .
they insist that action must be taken now , and rapidly , if investor confidence in the british economy is to be restored .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the queen 's allowance will be affected by budget cuts the sheer size of britain 's debts makes cuts necessary , according to dr. andrew lilico , chief economist at right-of-center think tank policy exchange .
" running a deficit of around 10 percent of gdp is just way off the mark , " lilico said , adding that " within europe there are restrictions under treaty rules that say they should have deficits of no more than three percent of gdp . "
" we 're running a deficit well over three times as much as what was previously thought to be the absolute maximum that you should be running even in a disaster scenario , " lilico added .
unions plan to put up a fight trade unions , meanwhile , are promising to fight public sector job losses and have threatened widespread industrial action .
already on wednesday , protesters descended on westminster to express their disapproval of the austerity measures .
eighty-one billion pounds worth of cuts over four years represent an approximate halving of britain 's budget deficit .
the coalition government claims this will restore the economy to health , although opponents argue the measures may have the opposite effect , plunging britain back into recession .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 20.10.2010 new television show confronts men looking for underage relationships großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the online world can be a dangerous place for children critics say a new television show that catches men chatting with teens about sex and then meeting up with them is mob justice .
along for the ride is defense minister theodor zu guttenberg 's wife , who co-hosts the show . the man 's face and body is completely pixilated .
his voice is distorted .
but it 's easy enough to see what this guy wants .
he 's had the windows of his car tinted so no one can see inside .
no one will notice them when they 're out in the woods , anyway , he tells his companion , who he thinks is just 13 years old .
this is " tatort internet , " a new television show that uses fake chat usernames to trick men into thinking they 're talking with young girls or boys and set up a meeting .
then they secretly film the encounter and confront the man with his inappropriate messages , the inappropriate photos he 's sent and his inappropriate intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister says the show could put innocent people at risk the show is co-hosted by stephanie zu guttenberg , the wife of german defense minister theodor zu guttenberg .
that did n't stop fellow cabinet member and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from expressing her distaste for the show to the newspaper passauer neue presse .
" there 's the risk that innocent people are being publicly condemned , " she said .
" the german legal system does n't have to resort to mob justice . "
one man featured on the show was identified and then fired from his job where he worked with teens .
he subsequently went missing for several days and his colleagues and family said they feared he may have killed himself .
he has since resurfaced .
paula honkanen-schoberth , director of the german league for child protection , told deutsche welle that she was also worried about the vigilante aspect of the television show .
" of course we think that sexual abuse is a severe crime and must be prosecuted in all possible , but legal ways , " she said .
" but in germany we live under the rule of law , and that is why we regard the criminal prosecution as a matter for the police .
and television is not the police .
and should n't act like it is . "
getting the safety message to teens what needs to be done , honkanen-schoberth said , is to get parents talking with their kids about staying safe online .
they should tell them not to give out their name and address or to meet up with strangers alone .
they should let them know they can always come to them if someone is threatening them or pressuring them to do something they do n't want to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents must talk with their children about staying safe online , says honkanen-schoberth honkanen-schoberth said she would welcome a show that addressed these things .
but media expert jo groeber from the german digital institute says the show itself could be a revolutionary way to inform young people about the dangers of the internet and chatting with adult strangers .
" it 's entertaining , it 's even , i 'm afraid to say it , thrilling , " he said .
" it 's probably tasteless , but it reaches the audience . "
one concern he does have , he said , is whether the show 's producers know of potential abusers for months at time before informing the police .
the guttenberg image stephanie zu guttenberg 's presence on the show comes as her husband 's political star gets brighter and brighter .
there 's even been speculation that he could become the country 's next chancellor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephanie zu guttenberg 's role in the show could affect her husband 's career in a survey by the forsa research institute released on wednesday , 25 percent of those surveyed said the defense minister would make a better chancellor than his boss , chancellor angela merkel .
this new role for stephanie zu guttenberg will only enhance her husband 's image , according to groebel .
" let 's be honest , the partner of a high-ranking politician is usually on the safe side .
they 're involved in charity work , but they never take any risks , " he said .
" i think the fact that she 's taking a risk will strengthen his image , as the husband of a completely independent wife . "

then the satellites ' on-board computers determine the height of the ground surveyed .
german space authorities said the level of accuracy this method produces is unprecedented . " processing the bistatic pairs of data is a big challenge , " thomas fritz , a dlr processing engineer , said in a statement .
" everything must match up exactly in order to reach this level of precision .
all sorts of data can affect the algorithms , from synchronization signals to millimeter-accurate orbital calculations . " prior to this new german project , the best digital elevation survey came from the us shuttle radar topography mission -lrb- srtm -rrb- completed in 2000 , however it only imaged 60 percent of the earth 's surface and was not nearly as accurate as the new survey . survey will take years to finish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the satellites fly in a formation similar to a double-helix dlr officials have said previously that the project will take four years to complete the survey and to process its corresponding data .

the timetable means that the last british troops are set to leave 15 years earlier than originally planned . britain is to pull the last of its troops out of germany 15 years ahead of schedule as part of a wide-ranging program of defense cuts .
some 20,000 british service personnel are set to leave germany in the next decade .
the troops , originally stationed in the aftermath of the second world war , had previously been set to remain until 2035 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister cameron announced details of the military cuts " in terms of the return from germany , half our personnel should be back by 2015 and the remainder by 2020 , " prime minister david cameron said on tuesday , announcing details of the defense review .
a representative of the german army told the news agency reuters that the announcement had been unexpected . " we are all surprised , " spokeswoman helga heine said .
" we were not informed of this at all in advance . "
british soldiers are currently based at 12 sites in northern and western germany .
the review found that this was no longer necessary .
the united kingdom , france and the united states maintained troops in west germany throughout the cold war .
" the presence of the british military has played an important role in demonstrating alliance solidarity , and has also been a symbol of steadfast uk-german friendship , " the security review said .
but , it added , " there is no longer any operational requirement for uk forces to be based there . "

some 17,000 service personnel will be cut from the british forces ' payroll . cameron promised that the defense budget would remain the fourth-largest in the world and would meet a nato requirement for members to spend two percent of gross domestic product on defense . the defense cuts are part of a wider raft of measures being introduced by the government to cut spending by some 95 billion euros by 2015 , with the majority of cuts to be announced on wednesday afternoon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 20.10.2010 luxury group recruits puma boss for sports expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma enjoyed a comeback under jochen zeitz french luxury goods producer ppr , which owns gucci and yves saint laurent , bought german sports brand puma in 2007 .
now ppr wants puma 's unconventional ceo jochen zeitz to build a new sports and leisure empire . french luxury goods producer ppr has big plans for german sports brand puma , as well as that company 's unconventional ceo , jochen zeitz .
zeitz – who reportedly divides his time between puma 's headquarters in herzogenaurach and his farm in kenya – took charge of puma in 1993 , when he was just 30 years old .
he quickly gained a reputation as a mover and shaker as he transformed the struggling company into a successful brand with a global presence .
ppr acquired puma in 2007 , and has since purchased other sports brands including the cobra golf label .
it wants zeitz , now 47 , to head up a new sporting goods and leisure division with puma as its centerpiece .
ppr chief francois-henri pinault said in a statement that " the reinforcement of the puma management team under jochen zeitz is a decisive factor in the implementation of our strategy , which aims to make puma the core brand of ppr 's second pillar -lrb- sporting goods and leisure -rrb- . "
logical conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois-henri pinault 's ppr bought zeitz 's puma in 2007 antoine belge , a luxury and sporting goods analyst for hsbc , said zeitz has been involved in ppr 's strategic development for some time now .
" it 's just a sort of formalization of something that already existed ... effectively he was already in charge of doing acquisition , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's just a sign that expansion may accelerate . "
to facilitate change , puma will be restructured from a german ag corporation to a european se corporation .
analysts expect a senior puma manager will be appointed ceo , while zeitz himself is stays on as executive chairman until a replacement is found .
" that is why they want to have a specific ceo for the puma brand , because jochen zeitz will probably spend more time finding other brands to integrate into that division , " belge said .
tighter branding control ppr is expected to sell a number of subsidiaries – including electronics and entertainment retailer fnac , furniture seller conforama and redcats mail order- to finance the acquisition of further high-end brands .
john horan , publisher of industry newsletter sporting goods intelligence , said it makes sense for ppr to shed its multi-brand retail chains and concentrate on developing its own labels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 20.10.2010 luxury group recruits puma boss for sports expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma enjoyed a comeback under jochen zeitz french luxury goods producer ppr , which owns gucci and yves saint laurent , bought german sports brand puma in 2007 .
now ppr wants puma 's unconventional ceo jochen zeitz to build a new sports and leisure empire . french luxury goods producer ppr has big plans for german sports brand puma , as well as that company 's unconventional ceo , jochen zeitz .
zeitz – who reportedly divides his time between puma 's headquarters in herzogenaurach and his farm in kenya – took charge of puma in 1993 , when he was just 30 years old .
he quickly gained a reputation as a mover and shaker as he transformed the struggling company into a successful brand with a global presence .
ppr acquired puma in 2007 , and has since purchased other sports brands including the cobra golf label .
it wants zeitz , now 47 , to head up a new sporting goods and leisure division with puma as its centerpiece .
ppr chief francois-henri pinault said in a statement that " the reinforcement of the puma management team under jochen zeitz is a decisive factor in the implementation of our strategy , which aims to make puma the core brand of ppr 's second pillar -lrb- sporting goods and leisure -rrb- . "
logical conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois-henri pinault 's ppr bought zeitz 's puma in 2007 antoine belge , a luxury and sporting goods analyst for hsbc , said zeitz has been involved in ppr 's strategic development for some time now .
" it 's just a sort of formalization of something that already existed ... effectively he was already in charge of doing acquisition , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's just a sign that expansion may accelerate . "
to facilitate change , puma will be restructured from a german ag corporation to a european se corporation .
analysts expect a senior puma manager will be appointed ceo , while zeitz himself is stays on as executive chairman until a replacement is found .
" that is why they want to have a specific ceo for the puma brand , because jochen zeitz will probably spend more time finding other brands to integrate into that division , " belge said .
tighter branding control ppr is expected to sell a number of subsidiaries – including electronics and entertainment retailer fnac , furniture seller conforama and redcats mail order- to finance the acquisition of further high-end brands .
john horan , publisher of industry newsletter sporting goods intelligence , said it makes sense for ppr to shed its multi-brand retail chains and concentrate on developing its own labels .
he described this as ' vertical retail , ' in which brands maintain stores exclusively to sell their products .
" if you look at where all the real strength in retail is recently , it 's been with vertical retailers of one kind or another , " horan told deutsche welle .
" they see it as a way to really make a brand statement that is very difficult to make when you 're selling through a retailer . "

his address had important messages for germans and turks , says baha gungor of dw 's turkish service . the omens for christian wulff 's third trip abroad as german president , this time to turkey , were unfavorable .
in germany , a debate on integration was raging , charged with emotions .
the weekly magazine " focus " published a cover with wulff 's face on it - distorted as an islamic prayer leader .
wulff had , however , merely pointed out in an october 3 speech that islam - in addition to christianity and judaism - is part of life in germany . public attention became focused on the first speech given by a german president to the turkish parliament .
wulff did not mince words .
for one , he repeated that islam has become an integral part of germany .
he also demanded that turkey acknowledge that christianity has a place in turkey , and that christians there should be free to worship as they wish .
that included priests being trained in turkey , he said , which is not possible now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha gungor , head of dw 's turkish department wulff did not avoid critical topics , such as turkey 's difficult relationship with cyprus and armenia .
not least , he affirmed israel 's right to exist while demanding an autonomous , viable and democratically ruled palestine .
that was an indirect request for turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to resume dialogue with israel . wulff refrained from making empty promises regarding turkey joining the european union .
shrewdly , clearly and unmistakably , wulff said that regardless of the democratic and economic progress turkey has indeed made , eu membership was not a foregone conclusion . the most distinct messages that wulff addressed to both germans and turks had to do with the need for people of turkish descent in germany to find a place in german society .
it was striking that wulff avoided using the loaded word " integration . "
his call for immigrants to learn the german language had been supported by the turkish president abdullah gul in the run-up to his visit .
and gul did not forget to mention in a joint press conference ahead of wulff 's speech that he was the president of all turkish citizens - those with armenian , jewish and greek roots included - and that all people in turkey should speak turkish . wulff 's five-day state visit will evidently help to minimize misunderstanding between berlin and ankara .
wulff 's manner has been well-received and his cautious words will not be ignored . whether a change of direction in germany 's out-of-control integration debate can be expected remains to be seen ; wulff does not have to win elections anymore . certain politicians , on the other hand , are not likely to pass on the strategy of pitting popular emotions against foreigners and migrants for their election campaigns . author : baha gungor -lrb- sst / rc -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 20.10.2010 opinion : german president pulls no punches in turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff was the first german president to make a speech in front of the turkish parliament .
his address had important messages for germans and turks , says baha gungor of dw 's turkish service . the omens for christian wulff 's third trip abroad as german president , this time to turkey , were unfavorable .
in germany , a debate on integration was raging , charged with emotions .
the weekly magazine " focus " published a cover with wulff 's face on it - distorted as an islamic prayer leader .
wulff had , however , merely pointed out in an october 3 speech that islam - in addition to christianity and judaism - is part of life in germany . public attention became focused on the first speech given by a german president to the turkish parliament .
wulff did not mince words .
for one , he repeated that islam has become an integral part of germany .
he also demanded that turkey acknowledge that christianity has a place in turkey , and that christians there should be free to worship as they wish .
that included priests being trained in turkey , he said , which is not possible now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha gungor , head of dw 's turkish department wulff did not avoid critical topics , such as turkey 's difficult relationship with cyprus and armenia .
not least , he affirmed israel 's right to exist while demanding an autonomous , viable and democratically ruled palestine .
that was an indirect request for turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to resume dialogue with israel . wulff refrained from making empty promises regarding turkey joining the european union .
shrewdly , clearly and unmistakably , wulff said that regardless of the democratic and economic progress turkey has indeed made , eu membership was not a foregone conclusion . the most distinct messages that wulff addressed to both germans and turks had to do with the need for people of turkish descent in germany to find a place in german society .
it was striking that wulff avoided using the loaded word " integration . "
his call for immigrants to learn the german language had been supported by the turkish president abdullah gul in the run-up to his visit .
and gul did not forget to mention in a joint press conference ahead of wulff 's speech that he was the president of all turkish citizens - those with armenian , jewish and greek roots included - and that all people in turkey should speak turkish . wulff 's five-day state visit will evidently help to minimize misunderstanding between berlin and ankara .
wulff 's manner has been well-received and his cautious words will not be ignored . whether a change of direction in germany 's out-of-control integration debate can be expected remains to be seen ; wulff does not have to win elections anymore . certain politicians , on the other hand , are not likely to pass on the strategy of pitting popular emotions against foreigners and migrants for their election campaigns . author : baha gungor -lrb- sst / rc -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de president wulff urges turks to ' actively integrate ' in germany in an unprecedented speech to the turkish parliament , german president christian wulff said immigrants in germany should take part fully in society .
he also stressed that german values and culture must be respected .
-lrb- 19.10.2010 -rrb- german president criticizes ' sweeping statements ' on integration germany 's president , christian wulff , has warned that blanket generalizations about muslim immigrants are wrong .
the comments come as he begins a tour of turkey , with the debate about integration rumbling on in germany .

among them was the integration of muslims in germany , a much-debated topic in recent weeks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 20.10.2010 debate about islam in germany heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has seen a rise in anti-islamic feeling germany 's top-selling non-fiction bestseller is a book that attacks islam - and the german president ca n't get the public to agree with him when he says that islam is part of germany . thilo sarrazin , former state finance minister in berlin and just a short time ago on the board of the german central bank , has written a bestseller : " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany is doing away with itself " -rrb- .
he predicts a dire future for the country and he blames it above all on islam and the uncontrolled immigration of muslims .
most muslims have different values than the germans , he writes .
they ostensibly hold god higher than the constitutional state and democracy .
this is the reason , he claims , why germany will gradually do away with itself if it does n't carry out an active immigration and integration debate .
sarrazin 's arguments are meeting with a great deal of support .
but he is also encountering opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book has sparked much of the recent debate michael bommes , a sociologist teaching at the university of osnabrueck , notes that the current debate about islam shows that most people have still to grasp the fact that germany has long since become a country of immigrants , with a correspondingly complex diversity of values and viewpoints .
" through modern international immigration , world religions such as islam have now arrived in europe , " says bommes .
he argues that muslims have to adjust to this situation , as do the citizens of other european nations .
the relationships between politics , law and religion have to be rethought , he says .
people have always had to find compromises over these three elements .
and islam is making this necessary once more in today 's world .
fear of headscarves and mosques many germans are worried because they see their way of life being called into question by the presence of islam .
they find the headscarves and veils worn by muslim women particularly offensive .
they raise the possibility that these women are being oppressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic headwear is viewed with suspicion by many europeans such concerns are also evident in the results of a study recently published by the friedrich ebert foundation .
oliver decker , who led the study , speaks of a " very distinct increase from 34 percent to over half the population who agree with statements hostile to islam . "
many germans are also skeptical with regard to the building of new mosques , he says .
where do these negative appraisals of islam come from ?
islam scholar navid kermani believes that germans see their identity being threatened .
identity , he explains , is formed when we distinguish ourselves from other groups .
every social group defines itself by how it differs from other groups .
that 's why , he argues , it seems logical to keep one 's distance from islam .
after all , westerners tend to be unfamiliar with islamic symbols , making the religion seem especially alien .
the process of differentiation itself is then only natural .
but it becomes problematic when those who are different are declared to be the enemy .
a sometimes superficial discussion seen in this light , there is nothing reprehensible about the debate on islam .
it seems to reflect primarily the struggle for a new german self-image and the difficulties connected with the fact that germany has indeed become a country of immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western impressions of islam may be too simplistic nevertheless , political scientist claus leggewie contends that the discussions about islam are often conducted on too superficial a level .
most people make little distinction between the various currents within islam .
nor do they make sufficient allowance for the differences between moderate and radical muslims .
" i believe that most europeans tend to develop a rather schematic image of islam , " says leggewie .
he finds it astounding that europeans , who do so much travelling and know the world so well , whose opinions on all other issues are so carefully formed and objective , are often so quick to make superficial judgments when it comes to islam .
but the debate on islam did n't exactly appear out of thin air , either .
it stems from the fact that religion has regained a great deal of power in the middle east itself .
of course people in germany have taken note of this resurgence , explains navid kermani .
the problem is that , in the muslim world as well , many issues are being viewed through a religious lens .
for many years , religion played no role on the political front there .
now all that has changed .
and germany feels threatened , fearing an increasing powerful cocktail of religion and politics here as well .
islam as a way of helping to define europe first and foremost , the battle about islam is an inner-german struggle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate may ultimately be about how international germany should be it 's about how open germany and the germans want to be .
since the end of the nazi dictatorship , germans have agonized about their history , and have developed a troubled relationship with their national identity .
whoever makes a statement about islam , says claus leggewie , is also indirectly speaking out on an entirely different issue - namely , how international germany should be .
" there are islamophobic tendencies on the one side and islamophile leanings on the other , " says leggewie .
" and , as we know , they have historically very frequently been interrelated , even when they seem on the outside to be diametrically opposed .
this very obviously means that islam continues to play an essential role in our construction of what europe means , i.e. in the collective identity of the europeans . "

he predicts a dire future for the country and he blames it above all on islam and the uncontrolled immigration of muslims .
most muslims have different values than the germans , he writes .
they ostensibly hold god higher than the constitutional state and democracy .
this is the reason , he claims , why germany will gradually do away with itself if it does n't carry out an active immigration and integration debate .
sarrazin 's arguments are meeting with a great deal of support .
but he is also encountering opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book has sparked much of the recent debate michael bommes , a sociologist teaching at the university of osnabrueck , notes that the current debate about islam shows that most people have still to grasp the fact that germany has long since become a country of immigrants , with a correspondingly complex diversity of values and viewpoints .
" through modern international immigration , world religions such as islam have now arrived in europe , " says bommes .
he argues that muslims have to adjust to this situation , as do the citizens of other european nations .
the relationships between politics , law and religion have to be rethought , he says .
people have always had to find compromises over these three elements .
and islam is making this necessary once more in today 's world .
fear of headscarves and mosques many germans are worried because they see their way of life being called into question by the presence of islam .
they find the headscarves and veils worn by muslim women particularly offensive .
they raise the possibility that these women are being oppressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic headwear is viewed with suspicion by many europeans such concerns are also evident in the results of a study recently published by the friedrich ebert foundation .
oliver decker , who led the study , speaks of a " very distinct increase from 34 percent to over half the population who agree with statements hostile to islam . "
many germans are also skeptical with regard to the building of new mosques , he says .
where do these negative appraisals of islam come from ?
islam scholar navid kermani believes that germans see their identity being threatened .
identity , he explains , is formed when we distinguish ourselves from other groups .
every social group defines itself by how it differs from other groups .
that 's why , he argues , it seems logical to keep one 's distance from islam .
after all , westerners tend to be unfamiliar with islamic symbols , making the religion seem especially alien .
the process of differentiation itself is then only natural .
but it becomes problematic when those who are different are declared to be the enemy .
a sometimes superficial discussion seen in this light , there is nothing reprehensible about the debate on islam .
it seems to reflect primarily the struggle for a new german self-image and the difficulties connected with the fact that germany has indeed become a country of immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western impressions of islam may be too simplistic nevertheless , political scientist claus leggewie contends that the discussions about islam are often conducted on too superficial a level .
most people make little distinction between the various currents within islam .
nor do they make sufficient allowance for the differences between moderate and radical muslims .
" i believe that most europeans tend to develop a rather schematic image of islam , " says leggewie .
he finds it astounding that europeans , who do so much travelling and know the world so well , whose opinions on all other issues are so carefully formed and objective , are often so quick to make superficial judgments when it comes to islam .
but the debate on islam did n't exactly appear out of thin air , either .
it stems from the fact that religion has regained a great deal of power in the middle east itself .
of course people in germany have taken note of this resurgence , explains navid kermani .
the problem is that , in the muslim world as well , many issues are being viewed through a religious lens .
for many years , religion played no role on the political front there .
now all that has changed .
and germany feels threatened , fearing an increasing powerful cocktail of religion and politics here as well .
islam as a way of helping to define europe first and foremost , the battle about islam is an inner-german struggle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate may ultimately be about how international germany should be it 's about how open germany and the germans want to be .
since the end of the nazi dictatorship , germans have agonized about their history , and have developed a troubled relationship with their national identity .
whoever makes a statement about islam , says claus leggewie , is also indirectly speaking out on an entirely different issue - namely , how international germany should be .
" there are islamophobic tendencies on the one side and islamophile leanings on the other , " says leggewie .
" and , as we know , they have historically very frequently been interrelated , even when they seem on the outside to be diametrically opposed .
this very obviously means that islam continues to play an essential role in our construction of what europe means , i.e. in the collective identity of the europeans . "

" there are islamophobic tendencies on the one side and islamophile leanings on the other , " says leggewie .
" and , as we know , they have historically very frequently been interrelated , even when they seem on the outside to be diametrically opposed .
this very obviously means that islam continues to play an essential role in our construction of what europe means , i.e. in the collective identity of the europeans . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 20.10.2010 development agencies need to move beyond life-saving aid , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making sure people survive is critical , but aid ca n't stop there development agencies need to rethink how they deal with disaster situations , an expert told dw .
instead of recreating pre-crisis life , they should stimulate economies so people are n't forced to live off foreign aid . dr. peter walker , the founder of the world disasters report , advocated professionalizing the disaster response business , developing both the global code of conduct for disaster workers and the sphere humanitarian standards .
he is the director of the feinstein international center at tufts university in the united states , and is involved in research into possible future global drivers of humanitarian crises , and the effectiveness of the international humanitarian system . he told deutsche welle about the changes in mentality that he thinks would make development aid more effective over the long-term . deutsche welle : you have put forward the premise that responding to humanitarian crises is becoming more problematic .
what is the problem ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development aid groups need to rethink their strategies , walker said dr. peter walker : i think what 's becoming problematic is the model we use .
the traditional model is that disasters are abnormal .
they knock you down , then you have response , and the response puts people back in a position to carry on with normal life .
just like the way we would recover after a car accident .
but what the research is showing is that as you have more processes that affect the way our economies work - like climate change , globalization , the increase in organized crime - there is a stress on society , and when there 's a crisis it 's much larger than it was in the past and it is much more pervasive .
it actually changes the direction of development and the way society moves forward .
that 's very different from what happened in the past . you almost need to think it 's no longer a temporary thing .
these crises permanently affect large populations and large parts of the economy , so we need to respond differently .
it 's not a sideshow anymore .
it 's actually an integral part of the economies .
that means aid agencies have to change the way they think about disaster response : how they work with local governments , how they can do a lot of work beforehand to try and influence the way governments look at risk reduction in their community . what needs to change ? the analysis that we 've done is that the old notion of quick crisis and long-term development is not quite right .
you have this body of people in the middle who essentially live off what is tantamount to an international social welfare system - in refugee camps , in internally displaced persons camps .
many of the pastoralist populations around the world are in this state , people who are living on the margins of cities and shanty towns , where there 's no obvious way forward in development terms , levels of violence are very high and effectively the main source of livelihood they have is humanitarian assistance .
but that 's just like being drip-fed in a hospital ward .
people do n't want to be in that position .
people are the same the world over .
they want to build a better future for their kids , and so they want to have economic opportunities . you advocate stimulating the economies of conflict-ridden states even as the conflict unfolds .
is that feasible ? i think we have really got to look again at how we work in these crisis situations .
you ca n't wait for stability before you start development .
somalia has n't been stable for 20 years ; it is not going to be stable .
that 's the reality .
so do you do development there ?
that 's really what agencies should be focusing on – how do you stimulate an economy in high levels of violence so that people have an opportunity . can you really stimulate an economy in times of violence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enabling trade would help those suffering in darfur the answer is yes , you can stimulate economies in crisis situations .
for instance , we are doing research in darfur , and one of the things that is obvious in darfur is that as a region it basically works by trading networks .
different agro-ecological zones , the desert in the north to tropics in the south , you need to trade .
everybody in darfur knows that , and conflict disrupts that trade .
re-establishing trade and the ability to move is in most people 's best interests .
even those who control armed groups , the money has to come from somewhere , and trade is a good thing .
you can establish trading networks and get the economy moving again .
it takes a bit of lateral thinking about how you 're going to do it , but it 's possible . do you see development agencies thinking on these lines ? i think there 's a certain inertia within aid agencies to approach crises in this fashion .
it 's still easier essentially just to provide social welfare services , and that 's absolutely necessary where the alternative is starvation , death from disease or lack of shelter .
but how do you build on that to go further ?
essentially what our research is showing is that just doing life-saving humanitarian assistance is necessary but not sufficient in these crises . who 's going to nudge the system in the direction you 're suggesting ? what works is trying to change the standards that people expect and the approaches they take .
that 's actually how most of our systems in the west work .
they are not through command and control .
they are through ratcheting up people 's expectations .
the way a health system improves in a country is because as a consumer you expect a certain higher level .
you become educated , you know what 's available and that moves the system in a certain direction .
i think that 's the approach : how do you change the expectations within aid agencies of what is good aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone use will let more people 's voices be heard to be honest , it 's also going to change because you 're going to find that the survivor populations in these areas have the ability to have a say .
the influence mobile phones have had in many of these crises in the last few years has been stunning because it enables people to have a voice .
that is going to change things dramatically in the next 10 years .
the populations that you 're serving will not be passive . you are critical of military humanitarianism , in afghanistan for instance , suggesting it 's a " weapons system " that is not attuned to the people 's real concerns . the purpose of any military system is to try and improve security .
you can think of things like money being a weapons system because you can use money to stimulate an economy , to improve security and to bribe people to improve security . from research we 've carried out in our center in afghanistan recently , when you really started to talk to afghans about what they thought caused insecurity what really angered them was n't really poverty .
it was the failure of governance .
the fact that they felt they did n't have leaders who represented them anymore , that they could n't trust leadership .
everywhere they turned , they saw corruption and people benefitting from the aid business but not them .
one of the things we 've realized is that if you 're running an aid project where you 're trying to spend a lot of money very quickly , in an area you do n't know , maybe in a field you have n't worked in very often , it fuels corruption and effectively makes it less secure . interview : ranjitha balasubramanyam editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes as his unpopular government is poised to implement painful austerity measures to combat a huge budget deficit . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has announced his biggest cabinet shuffle since taking office in 2004 .
in a nationally televised speech zapatero said that spain needed “ a politically strong ” and experienced government to manage the country ’ s difficult economic situation .
the cabinet shuffle is being seen as an effort to tackle the government ’ s widespread unpopularity in face of painful austerity measures .
zapatero 's government is poised to implement major spending cuts while at the same time raising taxes in an effort to reduce the country 's gaping public deficit and avoid a greek-style debt crisis .
the country ’ s unemployment rate stands at 20 percent - the highest in the european union .
recent opinion polls indicate that the opposition conservative popular party has the most support among the electorate , with a lead of around 15 percentage points over zapatero ’ s socialists . the prime minister 's approval rate has sunk to below 30 percent , the worst since his re-election in 2008 .

rubalcaba , who is widely seen as a potential successor to zapatero , will however retain his old portfolio . the changes will also see foreign minister miguel angel moratinos be replaced by current health minister trinidad jimenez .
both moratinos and vega have been in office since the socialists won the 2004 elections .
the shuffle will also affect the health and the environment ministries .
the portfolio for housing and equality is being dissolved as part of the efforts to cut government spending .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 20.10.2010 debate about islam in germany heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has seen a rise in anti-islamic feeling germany 's top-selling non-fiction bestseller is a book that attacks islam - and the german president ca n't get the public to agree with him when he says that islam is part of germany . thilo sarrazin , former state finance minister in berlin and just a short time ago on the board of the german central bank , has written a bestseller : " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany is doing away with itself " -rrb- .
he predicts a dire future for the country and he blames it above all on islam and the uncontrolled immigration of muslims .
most muslims have different values than the germans , he writes .
they ostensibly hold god higher than the constitutional state and democracy .
this is the reason , he claims , why germany will gradually do away with itself if it does n't carry out an active immigration and integration debate .
sarrazin 's arguments are meeting with a great deal of support .
but he is also encountering opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book has sparked much of the recent debate michael bommes , a sociologist teaching at the university of osnabrueck , notes that the current debate about islam shows that most people have still to grasp the fact that germany has long since become a country of immigrants , with a correspondingly complex diversity of values and viewpoints .
" through modern international immigration , world religions such as islam have now arrived in europe , " says bommes .
he argues that muslims have to adjust to this situation , as do the citizens of other european nations .
the relationships between politics , law and religion have to be rethought , he says .
people have always had to find compromises over these three elements .
and islam is making this necessary once more in today 's world .
fear of headscarves and mosques many germans are worried because they see their way of life being called into question by the presence of islam .
they find the headscarves and veils worn by muslim women particularly offensive .
they raise the possibility that these women are being oppressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic headwear is viewed with suspicion by many europeans such concerns are also evident in the results of a study recently published by the friedrich ebert foundation .
oliver decker , who led the study , speaks of a " very distinct increase from 34 percent to over half the population who agree with statements hostile to islam . "
many germans are also skeptical with regard to the building of new mosques , he says .
where do these negative appraisals of islam come from ?
islam scholar navid kermani believes that germans see their identity being threatened .
identity , he explains , is formed when we distinguish ourselves from other groups .
every social group defines itself by how it differs from other groups .
that 's why , he argues , it seems logical to keep one 's distance from islam .
after all , westerners tend to be unfamiliar with islamic symbols , making the religion seem especially alien .
the process of differentiation itself is then only natural .
but it becomes problematic when those who are different are declared to be the enemy .
a sometimes superficial discussion seen in this light , there is nothing reprehensible about the debate on islam .
it seems to reflect primarily the struggle for a new german self-image and the difficulties connected with the fact that germany has indeed become a country of immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western impressions of islam may be too simplistic nevertheless , political scientist claus leggewie contends that the discussions about islam are often conducted on too superficial a level .
most people make little distinction between the various currents within islam .
nor do they make sufficient allowance for the differences between moderate and radical muslims .
" i believe that most europeans tend to develop a rather schematic image of islam , " says leggewie .
he finds it astounding that europeans , who do so much travelling and know the world so well , whose opinions on all other issues are so carefully formed and objective , are often so quick to make superficial judgments when it comes to islam .
but the debate on islam did n't exactly appear out of thin air , either .
it stems from the fact that religion has regained a great deal of power in the middle east itself .
of course people in germany have taken note of this resurgence , explains navid kermani .
the problem is that , in the muslim world as well , many issues are being viewed through a religious lens .
for many years , religion played no role on the political front there .
now all that has changed .
and germany feels threatened , fearing an increasing powerful cocktail of religion and politics here as well .
islam as a way of helping to define europe first and foremost , the battle about islam is an inner-german struggle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate may ultimately be about how international germany should be it 's about how open germany and the germans want to be .
since the end of the nazi dictatorship , germans have agonized about their history , and have developed a troubled relationship with their national identity .
whoever makes a statement about islam , says claus leggewie , is also indirectly speaking out on an entirely different issue - namely , how international germany should be .
" there are islamophobic tendencies on the one side and islamophile leanings on the other , " says leggewie .
" and , as we know , they have historically very frequently been interrelated , even when they seem on the outside to be diametrically opposed .
this very obviously means that islam continues to play an essential role in our construction of what europe means , i.e. in the collective identity of the europeans . "

wulff did not mince words .
for one , he repeated that islam has become an integral part of germany .

that was an indirect request for turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to resume dialogue with israel . wulff refrained from making empty promises regarding turkey joining the european union .
shrewdly , clearly and unmistakably , wulff said that regardless of the democratic and economic progress turkey has indeed made , eu membership was not a foregone conclusion . the most distinct messages that wulff addressed to both germans and turks had to do with the need for people of turkish descent in germany to find a place in german society .
it was striking that wulff avoided using the loaded word " integration . "

wulff 's manner has been well-received and his cautious words will not be ignored . whether a change of direction in germany 's out-of-control integration debate can be expected remains to be seen ; wulff does not have to win elections anymore . certain politicians , on the other hand , are not likely to pass on the strategy of pitting popular emotions against foreigners and migrants for their election campaigns . author : baha gungor -lrb- sst / rc -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.10.2010 spain 's zapatero shuffles cabinet as government popularity slumps großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's austerity measures are widely unpopular in a surprise decision , spanish prime minister zapatero has announced a major cabinet shuffle .
the move comes as his unpopular government is poised to implement painful austerity measures to combat a huge budget deficit . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has announced his biggest cabinet shuffle since taking office in 2004 .
in a nationally televised speech zapatero said that spain needed “ a politically strong ” and experienced government to manage the country ’ s difficult economic situation .
the cabinet shuffle is being seen as an effort to tackle the government ’ s widespread unpopularity in face of painful austerity measures .
zapatero 's government is poised to implement major spending cuts while at the same time raising taxes in an effort to reduce the country 's gaping public deficit and avoid a greek-style debt crisis .
the country ’ s unemployment rate stands at 20 percent - the highest in the european union .
recent opinion polls indicate that the opposition conservative popular party has the most support among the electorate , with a lead of around 15 percentage points over zapatero ’ s socialists . the prime minister 's approval rate has sunk to below 30 percent , the worst since his re-election in 2008 .
unexpected changes the extent of the shuffle came as a surprise as initially the prime minister ’ s office had only announced that labor minister celestine corbacho would be replaced .
his successor is the secretary general for employment , valeriano gomez .
interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba is to replace deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega .
rubalcaba , who is widely seen as a potential successor to zapatero , will however retain his old portfolio . the changes will also see foreign minister miguel angel moratinos be replaced by current health minister trinidad jimenez .
both moratinos and vega have been in office since the socialists won the 2004 elections .
the shuffle will also affect the health and the environment ministries .
the portfolio for housing and equality is being dissolved as part of the efforts to cut government spending .

in an attempt to get the uk back on track , the chancellor of the exchequer has announced new austerity measures , including half a million job cuts . british chancellor of the exchequer george osborne used a speech to the house of commons on wednesday to announce his country 's biggest public spending cuts since world war ii .
the chancellor outlined budget cuts to the tune of seven billion pounds -lrb- eight billion euros , $ 11 billion -rrb- as well as projected spending reductions of 81 billion pounds over four years .
" today is the day when britain steps back from the brink , when we confront the bills from a decade of debt , " osborne said , to cheers from the government benches in the house .
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- a day of rebuilding , when we set out a four-year plan to put our public services and welfare state on a sustainable footing for the long term , " he added .
slashing the budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans major spending cuts the conservative chancellor outlined wide-reaching austerity measures , including a drop in police budgets , a 24-percent cut in spending by the foreign office and an increase in the state pension age from 65 to 66 in 2020 - six years earlier than previously planned .
the government also intends to slash welfare spending by making changes to incapacity and housing benefits .
the opposition labour party meanwhile accused osborne of playing with people 's futures , with half a million public sector jobs expected to be lost .
while britain has remained true to its overseas aid pledges and increased spending on schools and the national health service , it will now make cuts to departmental budgets at an average of just under 20 percent .
job cuts ' reckless ' reining in spending means cutting some 490,000 public sector jobs , according to the office for budgetary responsibility .
the chancellor said he regretted that many would lose their jobs , but that it " is unavoidable when the country runs out of money . "
shadow chancellor alan johnson came out against the proposed job cuts , saying they were " reckless " and that the british people would suffer .
" today is the day that abstract figures and spread-sheets turn into people 's futures , people 's jobs , people 's services , their prospects for the future , " johnson said .
deficit triples disaster rates but the coalition government has laid blame for the cuts at the door of the previous labour administration for running up significant debts .
they insist that action must be taken now , and rapidly , if investor confidence in the british economy is to be restored .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the queen 's allowance will be affected by budget cuts the sheer size of britain 's debts makes cuts necessary , according to dr. andrew lilico , chief economist at right-of-center think tank policy exchange .
" running a deficit of around 10 percent of gdp is just way off the mark , " lilico said , adding that " within europe there are restrictions under treaty rules that say they should have deficits of no more than three percent of gdp . "
" we 're running a deficit well over three times as much as what was previously thought to be the absolute maximum that you should be running even in a disaster scenario , " lilico added .
unions plan to put up a fight trade unions , meanwhile , are promising to fight public sector job losses and have threatened widespread industrial action .
already on wednesday , protesters descended on westminster to express their disapproval of the austerity measures .
eighty-one billion pounds worth of cuts over four years represent an approximate halving of britain 's budget deficit .
the coalition government claims this will restore the economy to health , although opponents argue the measures may have the opposite effect , plunging britain back into recession .

in an attempt to get the uk back on track , the chancellor of the exchequer has announced new austerity measures , including half a million job cuts . british chancellor of the exchequer george osborne used a speech to the house of commons on wednesday to announce his country 's biggest public spending cuts since world war ii .
the chancellor outlined budget cuts to the tune of seven billion pounds -lrb- eight billion euros , $ 11 billion -rrb- as well as projected spending reductions of 81 billion pounds over four years .
" today is the day when britain steps back from the brink , when we confront the bills from a decade of debt , " osborne said , to cheers from the government benches in the house .
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- a day of rebuilding , when we set out a four-year plan to put our public services and welfare state on a sustainable footing for the long term , " he added .
slashing the budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans major spending cuts the conservative chancellor outlined wide-reaching austerity measures , including a drop in police budgets , a 24-percent cut in spending by the foreign office and an increase in the state pension age from 65 to 66 in 2020 - six years earlier than previously planned .
the government also intends to slash welfare spending by making changes to incapacity and housing benefits .
the opposition labour party meanwhile accused osborne of playing with people 's futures , with half a million public sector jobs expected to be lost .
while britain has remained true to its overseas aid pledges and increased spending on schools and the national health service , it will now make cuts to departmental budgets at an average of just under 20 percent .
job cuts ' reckless ' reining in spending means cutting some 490,000 public sector jobs , according to the office for budgetary responsibility .
the chancellor said he regretted that many would lose their jobs , but that it " is unavoidable when the country runs out of money . "
shadow chancellor alan johnson came out against the proposed job cuts , saying they were " reckless " and that the british people would suffer .
" today is the day that abstract figures and spread-sheets turn into people 's futures , people 's jobs , people 's services , their prospects for the future , " johnson said .
deficit triples disaster rates but the coalition government has laid blame for the cuts at the door of the previous labour administration for running up significant debts .
they insist that action must be taken now , and rapidly , if investor confidence in the british economy is to be restored .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the queen 's allowance will be affected by budget cuts the sheer size of britain 's debts makes cuts necessary , according to dr. andrew lilico , chief economist at right-of-center think tank policy exchange .
" running a deficit of around 10 percent of gdp is just way off the mark , " lilico said , adding that " within europe there are restrictions under treaty rules that say they should have deficits of no more than three percent of gdp . "
" we 're running a deficit well over three times as much as what was previously thought to be the absolute maximum that you should be running even in a disaster scenario , " lilico added .
unions plan to put up a fight trade unions , meanwhile , are promising to fight public sector job losses and have threatened widespread industrial action .
already on wednesday , protesters descended on westminster to express their disapproval of the austerity measures .
eighty-one billion pounds worth of cuts over four years represent an approximate halving of britain 's budget deficit .
the coalition government claims this will restore the economy to health , although opponents argue the measures may have the opposite effect , plunging britain back into recession .

" right now , pakistan is in a bad shape .

one might think that india has already enough issues to solve with pakistan .
but india also shares a border with china .
both are powerhouses in the region in terms of the size of their respective populations and economies .
as economic relations between the two intensify , political conflicts are on the rise , especially as china becomes more successful and dominant .
strategic game it is a rivalry and partnership .
" since today india ’ s power sector has been already dominated by chinese suppliers .
china is playing a big role in india ’ s telecom industry , " says mohan , " we might even invite chinese companies to build roads in india .
so , on the economic side you see an expansion of the partnership .
more on the political side , in terms of how we look at each other , more in terms of our boundaries our perspective role in asia and in the world there is a problem . "
china is also a close ally of pakistan .
and amidst all of this there is another player : the usa .
in recent years the united states has tried to court india ’ s partnership , also to balance china ’ s growing influence within asia .
india is happy to deepen its relationship with the us , and is even warming up its old ties with russia to fence china in .

but india ’ s beach tourism capital that attracts millions of people every year is getting overcrowded . crimes against foreign tourists in the last couple of years have hit goa ’ s reputation as a holiday destination hard .
goa , which attracts half a million foreign tourists annually , has seen a string of crimes including rapes , murders and mysterious deaths involving foreign nationals .
over 40 per cent of the visitors are british followed by the russians and the isrealis .
reeling under the spate of crimes , the goa government was forced to look at novel security mechanisms , one of which involves setting up a tourist police force , manned by former servicemen .
media hype however tony frank , a hotelier blames the media for playing up the crimes .
" goa ’ s image is not being tarnished exactly .
it is just that the media at times creates all this hype , " he complains , " and all these problems are created by the media so that politicians are targeted in all these issues to run them down .
that is the end point of all the criticism and the problems that are taking place . "
bildunterschrift : tourism industry is booming in goa dominque fernandes who runs a holiday shack on utorda beach in south goa says the place is safe but discretion is important . he doesn ’ t think goa ’ s image has taken a beating .
for him goa is a safe place .
" it depends on how you behave and how you act with other people .
they should have their self-respect .. if you have your self-respect , no such things like rape or killing is going to happen .
and don ’ t ever go for drugs , " he says .
overcrowded but it is just not this side of goa that has recently been on display to the international community .
goa ’ s tourism belt is getting overcrowded .

pranab mukhopadhyay who teaches at goa university explains : " one needs to remember that in the last few years the tourist inflow exceeds the size of the domestic population .
and the pressure this puts on the resources of the state is fairly large and in the long run can impact quite cruelly on the state ’ s future earning capability .
i think a better managed tourism industry would not only be beneficial for the stakeholders of the industry but to those who come to the state to enjoy its pristine natural beauty . "
soaring real estate prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goa is famous for its white , sandy beaches in the last few years there has been rapid commercialization of the picturesque beaches that has prompted businessmen and realtors from other major cities to invest in goa .
this , in turn , has sharply pushed up land prices .
villages now have to contend with mega housing projects and the consequences are serious and solutions a long way off .
nascimento de souza , a retired professional blames the state authorities for the disorganized planning .
the party goes on " the trouble is that they have no plan .
i mean they talk of having a plan but it is a plan that is being produced by certain vested interests but not for the broader interests of goans or the future of goa , " he says .
but for some the problems seem far away too .
the party goes on .
just a stone ’ s throw from the sands of baga beach in the northern part of goa , mario runs the popular resort of cavala .
only time will tell whether commercial expansion and crime will harm goa 's pristine image and beauty and thus ruin it as a tourist destination .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 20.10.2010 debate about islam in germany heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has seen a rise in anti-islamic feeling germany 's top-selling non-fiction bestseller is a book that attacks islam - and the german president ca n't get the public to agree with him when he says that islam is part of germany . thilo sarrazin , former state finance minister in berlin and just a short time ago on the board of the german central bank , has written a bestseller : " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany is doing away with itself " -rrb- .
he predicts a dire future for the country and he blames it above all on islam and the uncontrolled immigration of muslims .
most muslims have different values than the germans , he writes .
they ostensibly hold god higher than the constitutional state and democracy .
this is the reason , he claims , why germany will gradually do away with itself if it does n't carry out an active immigration and integration debate .
sarrazin 's arguments are meeting with a great deal of support .
but he is also encountering opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book has sparked much of the recent debate michael bommes , a sociologist teaching at the university of osnabrueck , notes that the current debate about islam shows that most people have still to grasp the fact that germany has long since become a country of immigrants , with a correspondingly complex diversity of values and viewpoints .
" through modern international immigration , world religions such as islam have now arrived in europe , " says bommes .
he argues that muslims have to adjust to this situation , as do the citizens of other european nations .
the relationships between politics , law and religion have to be rethought , he says .
people have always had to find compromises over these three elements .
and islam is making this necessary once more in today 's world .
fear of headscarves and mosques many germans are worried because they see their way of life being called into question by the presence of islam .
they find the headscarves and veils worn by muslim women particularly offensive .
they raise the possibility that these women are being oppressed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic headwear is viewed with suspicion by many europeans such concerns are also evident in the results of a study recently published by the friedrich ebert foundation .
oliver decker , who led the study , speaks of a " very distinct increase from 34 percent to over half the population who agree with statements hostile to islam . "
many germans are also skeptical with regard to the building of new mosques , he says .
where do these negative appraisals of islam come from ?
islam scholar navid kermani believes that germans see their identity being threatened .
identity , he explains , is formed when we distinguish ourselves from other groups .
every social group defines itself by how it differs from other groups .
that 's why , he argues , it seems logical to keep one 's distance from islam .
after all , westerners tend to be unfamiliar with islamic symbols , making the religion seem especially alien .
the process of differentiation itself is then only natural .
but it becomes problematic when those who are different are declared to be the enemy .
a sometimes superficial discussion seen in this light , there is nothing reprehensible about the debate on islam .
it seems to reflect primarily the struggle for a new german self-image and the difficulties connected with the fact that germany has indeed become a country of immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western impressions of islam may be too simplistic nevertheless , political scientist claus leggewie contends that the discussions about islam are often conducted on too superficial a level .
most people make little distinction between the various currents within islam .
nor do they make sufficient allowance for the differences between moderate and radical muslims .
" i believe that most europeans tend to develop a rather schematic image of islam , " says leggewie .
he finds it astounding that europeans , who do so much travelling and know the world so well , whose opinions on all other issues are so carefully formed and objective , are often so quick to make superficial judgments when it comes to islam .
but the debate on islam did n't exactly appear out of thin air , either .
it stems from the fact that religion has regained a great deal of power in the middle east itself .
of course people in germany have taken note of this resurgence , explains navid kermani .
the problem is that , in the muslim world as well , many issues are being viewed through a religious lens .
for many years , religion played no role on the political front there .
now all that has changed .
and germany feels threatened , fearing an increasing powerful cocktail of religion and politics here as well .
islam as a way of helping to define europe first and foremost , the battle about islam is an inner-german struggle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate may ultimately be about how international germany should be it 's about how open germany and the germans want to be .
since the end of the nazi dictatorship , germans have agonized about their history , and have developed a troubled relationship with their national identity .
whoever makes a statement about islam , says claus leggewie , is also indirectly speaking out on an entirely different issue - namely , how international germany should be .
" there are islamophobic tendencies on the one side and islamophile leanings on the other , " says leggewie .
" and , as we know , they have historically very frequently been interrelated , even when they seem on the outside to be diametrically opposed .
this very obviously means that islam continues to play an essential role in our construction of what europe means , i.e. in the collective identity of the europeans . "

along for the ride is defense minister theodor zu guttenberg 's wife , who co-hosts the show . the man 's face and body is completely pixilated .
his voice is distorted .
but it 's easy enough to see what this guy wants .
he 's had the windows of his car tinted so no one can see inside .
no one will notice them when they 're out in the woods , anyway , he tells his companion , who he thinks is just 13 years old .
this is " tatort internet , " a new television show that uses fake chat usernames to trick men into thinking they 're talking with young girls or boys and set up a meeting .
then they secretly film the encounter and confront the man with his inappropriate messages , the inappropriate photos he 's sent and his inappropriate intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister says the show could put innocent people at risk the show is co-hosted by stephanie zu guttenberg , the wife of german defense minister theodor zu guttenberg .
that did n't stop fellow cabinet member and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from expressing her distaste for the show to the newspaper passauer neue presse .
" there 's the risk that innocent people are being publicly condemned , " she said .
" the german legal system does n't have to resort to mob justice . "
one man featured on the show was identified and then fired from his job where he worked with teens .
he subsequently went missing for several days and his colleagues and family said they feared he may have killed himself .
he has since resurfaced .
paula honkanen-schoberth , director of the german league for child protection , told deutsche welle that she was also worried about the vigilante aspect of the television show .
" of course we think that sexual abuse is a severe crime and must be prosecuted in all possible , but legal ways , " she said .
" but in germany we live under the rule of law , and that is why we regard the criminal prosecution as a matter for the police .
and television is not the police .
and should n't act like it is . "
getting the safety message to teens what needs to be done , honkanen-schoberth said , is to get parents talking with their kids about staying safe online .
they should tell them not to give out their name and address or to meet up with strangers alone .
they should let them know they can always come to them if someone is threatening them or pressuring them to do something they do n't want to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents must talk with their children about staying safe online , says honkanen-schoberth honkanen-schoberth said she would welcome a show that addressed these things .
but media expert jo groeber from the german digital institute says the show itself could be a revolutionary way to inform young people about the dangers of the internet and chatting with adult strangers .
" it 's entertaining , it 's even , i 'm afraid to say it , thrilling , " he said .
" it 's probably tasteless , but it reaches the audience . "
one concern he does have , he said , is whether the show 's producers know of potential abusers for months at time before informing the police .
the guttenberg image stephanie zu guttenberg 's presence on the show comes as her husband 's political star gets brighter and brighter .
there 's even been speculation that he could become the country 's next chancellor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephanie zu guttenberg 's role in the show could affect her husband 's career in a survey by the forsa research institute released on wednesday , 25 percent of those surveyed said the defense minister would make a better chancellor than his boss , chancellor angela merkel .
this new role for stephanie zu guttenberg will only enhance her husband 's image , according to groebel .
" let 's be honest , the partner of a high-ranking politician is usually on the safe side .
they 're involved in charity work , but they never take any risks , " he said .
" i think the fact that she 's taking a risk will strengthen his image , as the husband of a completely independent wife . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de caucasus -pipe- 20.10.2010 chechnya still a long way from stability , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya has been in a state of crisis since the fall of the soviet union tuesday 's dramatic raid on the chechen parliament was a blow to russian claims that chechnya has been pacified .
commentators believe that only a change of policy can end the long years of violence and unrest . the kremlin remained bullish after the separatist attack on the chechen parliament in grozny on tuesday , in which three people were killed .
" as always , they -lrb- the militants -rrb- failed , " russian interior minister rashid nurgaliyev said at a televized meeting at the local interior ministry .
the minister , by coincidence on a trip to grozny , said the chechen gunmen were intercepted by interior ministry troops , and that the operation by the security forces to free the deputies was a success .
he then claimed chechnya was " stable and safe . "
but since russia officially ended its " counter-terror " operation in the province in april 2009 , there have been plenty of signs that chechnya is far from pacified .
the double bombings carried out by two suicide bombers on the moscow metro in march , which killed 40 and wounded more than 100 , showed that separatist violence has the power to reach the russian capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chechen parliament was attacked tuesday uwe halbach , researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the violence has actually been increasing in the region since 2009 .
" what we have in chechnya is a trend that is also evident in other republics in the northern caucasus , such as kabardino-balkaria and dagestan , " halbach told deutsche welle .
" attacks are being very deliberately directed at security organizations and authorities , in this case the parliament . "
scars from two wars chechnya unilaterally declared independence from russia in 1991 , following the collapse of the soviet union .
in 1994 , the first russian troops marched in to put the separatist movement down .
the destruction and reoccupation of the capital city grozny in 1996 represented only a partial resolution , and the ceasefire remained fragile .
the russian soldiers returned in 1999 , starting what has become known as the second chechen war .
this military offensive lasted until the spring of 2000 and ended with russia 's military occupation of the province .
but the underlying conflict lingered , and chechen resistance has continued since then , mostly in the form of guerrilla attacks on civilian targets in chechnya , neighboring dagestan and russia itself .
chechnya has been governed by presidents loyal to moscow since 2003 .
achmat kadyrov was killed in a bomb attack in 2004 and succeeded by his son ramzan kadyrov , who has been criticized for using extra-legal measures .
divided separatists but while kadyrov 's government faces a violent front of rebels who want to turn chechnya into an independent islamic state , many chechens have actually come to support the president in recent years .
ivan sukhov , caucasus correspondent for the independent moscow newspaper vremya novostyey , told deutsche welle , " in the last few years , ramzan kadyrov has almost become a figure symbolic of the chechen idea - the man who defends ethnic chechen interests .
that 's why many who fought for chechen freedom and independence from russia have joined him .
now there is a division in the movement . "
gerhard mangott , russia expert with the innsbruck institute for political science , says that three leading chechen rebels have now declared themselves against the idea of turning the republic into a muslim emirate .
instead , they favor a nation state based on the chechen ethnicity .
but it is this group that is apparently responsible for this week 's attack on the parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzan kadyrov has won some support recently " this group has abandoned doku umarov , who leads the islamist movement , " he said .
" it is certainly probable that this group started -lrb- this week 's -rrb- attacks to show it is capable of executing a massive strike on the center of president kadyrov 's power . "
mangott also notes a significant increase in rebel activity in the region in the last few months , particularly in dagestan and ingushetia , another russian republic bordering chechnya .
he believes the russian government 's attempts to stabilize the region have all failed so far .
both the tactic of military invasion and the tactic of targeted attacks on rebel leaders using secret service intelligence have so far yielded little result .
even russian president dmitry medvedev is apparently opening up to the idea that the solution can not only be a military one .
fresh ideas needed halbach also believes that russia should rethink its strategy in the northern caucasus .
development strategies that focus on social and economic problems are also necessary , and halbach believes the european union should support such initiatives and actively encourage russia to seek alternatives to military action .
but russia continues to declare the troubles in the region a domestic issue , making intervention in the form of international development aid impossible .
" i think there needs to be dialogue between the eu and russia about the alarming security situation in this region , " halbach said .
" it is not just russia 's ' internal foreign country , ' not just a crisis region on russia 's periphery , it is also a region on the edge of europe , and it is certainly in europe 's interests to know whether we can expect a further escalation in violence there , or whether it will be possible to limit it .

now the eu 's executive is considering a ban of the drug called meow meow . the european commission on wednesday called for a ban of the party drug , mephedrone , also known as " meow meow , " which has hallucinogenic effects similar to ecstasy . while the drug is illegal in 15 of the european union 's 27-memberbloc , including germany , estonia and romania , it remains legal in others , including spain , portugal , and greece . " mephedrone is a dangerous drug that is available online and on the street corner , " viviane reding , the eu 's justice commissioner , said in a statement .
" we have a responsibility to protect young people against dangerous new psychoactive substances like mephedrone , " she said . the drug has been linked to 37 deaths in britain and ireland and the commission 's proposal would make it an offense to manufacture or sell mephedrone .
before it could go into effect , the proposal would have to be approved by the eu 's member states . predominantly a ' youth phenomenon ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding called to ban mephedrone across the eu mephedrone hydrochloride salt , as the drug is scientifically known , is a white powder and is commercially available from chemical suppliers on the internet .

" the center 's report added that its use is " predominantly a youth phenomenon , in particular of 15 to 24-year-olds , with rates of drug use higher in males than in females , predominantly from urban areas , who frequent clubs , discos and dance events . " while the proposed ban may not have an immediate effect on the drug 's user base , it may deter newcomers . " i think it might have an effect on people who do n't have a history of other drug taking , " karen mcelrath , an expert in criminology and drug use at queen 's university in belfast , northern ireland , said in an interview with deutsche welle . " if somebody had tried cannabis , alcohol and then they got into mephedrone , i think a ban might have an effect on those people , " she added . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

along for the ride is defense minister theodor zu guttenberg 's wife , who co-hosts the show . the man 's face and body is completely pixilated .
his voice is distorted .
but it 's easy enough to see what this guy wants .
he 's had the windows of his car tinted so no one can see inside .
no one will notice them when they 're out in the woods , anyway , he tells his companion , who he thinks is just 13 years old .
this is " tatort internet , " a new television show that uses fake chat usernames to trick men into thinking they 're talking with young girls or boys and set up a meeting .
then they secretly film the encounter and confront the man with his inappropriate messages , the inappropriate photos he 's sent and his inappropriate intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister says the show could put innocent people at risk the show is co-hosted by stephanie zu guttenberg , the wife of german defense minister theodor zu guttenberg .
that did n't stop fellow cabinet member and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from expressing her distaste for the show to the newspaper passauer neue presse .
" there 's the risk that innocent people are being publicly condemned , " she said .
" the german legal system does n't have to resort to mob justice . "
one man featured on the show was identified and then fired from his job where he worked with teens .
he subsequently went missing for several days and his colleagues and family said they feared he may have killed himself .
he has since resurfaced .
paula honkanen-schoberth , director of the german league for child protection , told deutsche welle that she was also worried about the vigilante aspect of the television show .
" of course we think that sexual abuse is a severe crime and must be prosecuted in all possible , but legal ways , " she said .
" but in germany we live under the rule of law , and that is why we regard the criminal prosecution as a matter for the police .
and television is not the police .
and should n't act like it is . "
getting the safety message to teens what needs to be done , honkanen-schoberth said , is to get parents talking with their kids about staying safe online .
they should tell them not to give out their name and address or to meet up with strangers alone .
they should let them know they can always come to them if someone is threatening them or pressuring them to do something they do n't want to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents must talk with their children about staying safe online , says honkanen-schoberth honkanen-schoberth said she would welcome a show that addressed these things .
but media expert jo groeber from the german digital institute says the show itself could be a revolutionary way to inform young people about the dangers of the internet and chatting with adult strangers .
" it 's entertaining , it 's even , i 'm afraid to say it , thrilling , " he said .
" it 's probably tasteless , but it reaches the audience . "
one concern he does have , he said , is whether the show 's producers know of potential abusers for months at time before informing the police .
the guttenberg image stephanie zu guttenberg 's presence on the show comes as her husband 's political star gets brighter and brighter .
there 's even been speculation that he could become the country 's next chancellor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephanie zu guttenberg 's role in the show could affect her husband 's career in a survey by the forsa research institute released on wednesday , 25 percent of those surveyed said the defense minister would make a better chancellor than his boss , chancellor angela merkel .
this new role for stephanie zu guttenberg will only enhance her husband 's image , according to groebel .
" let 's be honest , the partner of a high-ranking politician is usually on the safe side .
they 're involved in charity work , but they never take any risks , " he said .
" i think the fact that she 's taking a risk will strengthen his image , as the husband of a completely independent wife . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 20.10.2010 invasive species deserve greater attention , experts warn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiger mosquito is benefiting from global warming species that are n't native to europe are costing the eu billions of euros and threating the continent 's biodiversity .
the eu admits there is a policy gap - scientists want them to close it . as governments meet in nagoya , japan , to discuss ways to halt the declining variety of the world 's plants and animals , some german scientists are calling for more action against one of the threats to biodiversity in particular - invasive alien species .
these are plants and animals brought to new habitats either on purpose or as unseen stowaways .
when these alien arrivals come into contact with new ecosystems , the results can be devastating .
carsten nowak from the senckenberg research institute in germany is worried that globalization may be leading to a gradual homogenization of species across the continents .
" if we want to maintain regional differences , we have to somehow stop -lrb- current rates of -rrb- species invasions , " he told deutsche welle .
europe now has 10,000 alien species .
some 10 percent of these are considered invasive , meaning that when they arrive , they tend to eradicate native plants and animals .
the european union acknowledges that this is a problem for the bloc : these invaders are costing european economies 12 billion euros every year in agricultural losses and health care costs , as well as impoverishing the diversity of local ecosystems .
however , " there is no consistent horizontal coordination at eu level " for tackling this problem , a spokesperson for the eu 's environment policy chief told deutsche welle . so for the time being the bloc is " studying different policy options and can not come up with a more detailed plan of action and measures just yet , " she added . japanese weeds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese knotweed can take over whole riverbanks in germany , one of the most harmful invasive plants is the japanese knotweed .
" in many areas they occupy the whole riverbank and they outcompete the whole native plant community , " nowak said .
the japanese knotweed was deliberately introduced to europe as a decorative plant around 200 years ago .
since then , it has expanded extensively , making it difficult for other plants to grow .
japanese knotweed is almost impossible to get rid of , because its roots can dig up to three meters into the ground and broken roots can grow to become new plants .
in many cases , scientists do n't actually know what the long-term impact of invasive species , like the japanese knotweed will be , but worst-case-scenarios include the extinction of local competitors , with a cascading effect on other plants and animals in the food chain . this can be a slow process , or it can be rapid .
nowak says , for example , that the egyptian goose has been particularly aggressive in its conquest of the rhine , pushing out other duck species in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballast water can take aquatic life to new habitats a globalized problem increasing deliveries of goods across the globe has made it a lot easier for insects , fungi , bacteria and other pests to travel as stowaways on planes , trucks and boats .
for example , major problems can be caused just through ballast water .
when a ship takes on water as ballast it also sucks up organisms , which it may dump later at a destination far away .
it is feared that this is how the " killer shrimp " could cross the atlantic to north america , after already having made its way from eastern to western europe .
" the killer shrimps have few natural predators , so they 're found in absolutely huge population sizes .
they feed on other species , even on other closely related shrimps , so shortly after their arrival , they eradicated a lot of native species , " nowak said .
other invasive species prefer to fly .
with flight times getting shorter in recent decades , and more freight being flown around the world , the threat from the skies has increased dramatically in the last 50 years .
at frankfurt international airport , a team of inspectors has just three hours to check incoming goods like fruit and flowers for fungi , insects and plants .
" certain goods , like basil , mangos , egg plants and celery have to be inspected for pests like leaf miner flies and fruit flies when they arrive at the airport " , hans-juergen hess , manager of the plant protection service at frankfurt international airport , told deutsche welle .
yet it 's not just the contents of the boxes which pose a threat .
wooden pallets accompanying the boxes can harbor the asian long-horned beetle .

tiger mosquitoes were originally transported to albania in a batch of tires in 1979 .
from there they made their way to italy .
they are a serious cause for concern , because they carry diseases like dengue fever .
border controls can only do so much against flying insects like tiger mosquitoes .

this is a big problem not only to human health , but also to biodiversity and the economy . "

the eu admits there is a policy gap - scientists want them to close it . as governments meet in nagoya , japan , to discuss ways to halt the declining variety of the world 's plants and animals , some german scientists are calling for more action against one of the threats to biodiversity in particular - invasive alien species .
these are plants and animals brought to new habitats either on purpose or as unseen stowaways .
when these alien arrivals come into contact with new ecosystems , the results can be devastating .
carsten nowak from the senckenberg research institute in germany is worried that globalization may be leading to a gradual homogenization of species across the continents .
" if we want to maintain regional differences , we have to somehow stop -lrb- current rates of -rrb- species invasions , " he told deutsche welle .
europe now has 10,000 alien species .
some 10 percent of these are considered invasive , meaning that when they arrive , they tend to eradicate native plants and animals .
the european union acknowledges that this is a problem for the bloc : these invaders are costing european economies 12 billion euros every year in agricultural losses and health care costs , as well as impoverishing the diversity of local ecosystems .
however , " there is no consistent horizontal coordination at eu level " for tackling this problem , a spokesperson for the eu 's environment policy chief told deutsche welle . so for the time being the bloc is " studying different policy options and can not come up with a more detailed plan of action and measures just yet , " she added . japanese weeds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese knotweed can take over whole riverbanks in germany , one of the most harmful invasive plants is the japanese knotweed .
" in many areas they occupy the whole riverbank and they outcompete the whole native plant community , " nowak said .
the japanese knotweed was deliberately introduced to europe as a decorative plant around 200 years ago .
since then , it has expanded extensively , making it difficult for other plants to grow .
japanese knotweed is almost impossible to get rid of , because its roots can dig up to three meters into the ground and broken roots can grow to become new plants .
in many cases , scientists do n't actually know what the long-term impact of invasive species , like the japanese knotweed will be , but worst-case-scenarios include the extinction of local competitors , with a cascading effect on other plants and animals in the food chain . this can be a slow process , or it can be rapid .
nowak says , for example , that the egyptian goose has been particularly aggressive in its conquest of the rhine , pushing out other duck species in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballast water can take aquatic life to new habitats a globalized problem increasing deliveries of goods across the globe has made it a lot easier for insects , fungi , bacteria and other pests to travel as stowaways on planes , trucks and boats .
for example , major problems can be caused just through ballast water .
when a ship takes on water as ballast it also sucks up organisms , which it may dump later at a destination far away .
it is feared that this is how the " killer shrimp " could cross the atlantic to north america , after already having made its way from eastern to western europe .
" the killer shrimps have few natural predators , so they 're found in absolutely huge population sizes .
they feed on other species , even on other closely related shrimps , so shortly after their arrival , they eradicated a lot of native species , " nowak said .
other invasive species prefer to fly .
with flight times getting shorter in recent decades , and more freight being flown around the world , the threat from the skies has increased dramatically in the last 50 years .
at frankfurt international airport , a team of inspectors has just three hours to check incoming goods like fruit and flowers for fungi , insects and plants .
" certain goods , like basil , mangos , egg plants and celery have to be inspected for pests like leaf miner flies and fruit flies when they arrive at the airport " , hans-juergen hess , manager of the plant protection service at frankfurt international airport , told deutsche welle .
yet it 's not just the contents of the boxes which pose a threat .
wooden pallets accompanying the boxes can harbor the asian long-horned beetle .
it 's the forester 's worst nightmare because the beetle lays its eggs inside trees and when they hatch , they basically eat their way out .
to tackle this threat , hess checks that pallets have had a heat treatment which kills the beetles and their larvae .

along for the ride is defense minister theodor zu guttenberg 's wife , who co-hosts the show . the man 's face and body is completely pixilated .
his voice is distorted .
but it 's easy enough to see what this guy wants .
he 's had the windows of his car tinted so no one can see inside .
no one will notice them when they 're out in the woods , anyway , he tells his companion , who he thinks is just 13 years old .
this is " tatort internet , " a new television show that uses fake chat usernames to trick men into thinking they 're talking with young girls or boys and set up a meeting .
then they secretly film the encounter and confront the man with his inappropriate messages , the inappropriate photos he 's sent and his inappropriate intentions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the justice minister says the show could put innocent people at risk the show is co-hosted by stephanie zu guttenberg , the wife of german defense minister theodor zu guttenberg .
that did n't stop fellow cabinet member and justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger from expressing her distaste for the show to the newspaper passauer neue presse .
" there 's the risk that innocent people are being publicly condemned , " she said .
" the german legal system does n't have to resort to mob justice . "
one man featured on the show was identified and then fired from his job where he worked with teens .
he subsequently went missing for several days and his colleagues and family said they feared he may have killed himself .
he has since resurfaced .
paula honkanen-schoberth , director of the german league for child protection , told deutsche welle that she was also worried about the vigilante aspect of the television show .
" of course we think that sexual abuse is a severe crime and must be prosecuted in all possible , but legal ways , " she said .
" but in germany we live under the rule of law , and that is why we regard the criminal prosecution as a matter for the police .
and television is not the police .
and should n't act like it is . "
getting the safety message to teens what needs to be done , honkanen-schoberth said , is to get parents talking with their kids about staying safe online .
they should tell them not to give out their name and address or to meet up with strangers alone .
they should let them know they can always come to them if someone is threatening them or pressuring them to do something they do n't want to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents must talk with their children about staying safe online , says honkanen-schoberth honkanen-schoberth said she would welcome a show that addressed these things .
but media expert jo groeber from the german digital institute says the show itself could be a revolutionary way to inform young people about the dangers of the internet and chatting with adult strangers .
" it 's entertaining , it 's even , i 'm afraid to say it , thrilling , " he said .
" it 's probably tasteless , but it reaches the audience . "
one concern he does have , he said , is whether the show 's producers know of potential abusers for months at time before informing the police .
the guttenberg image stephanie zu guttenberg 's presence on the show comes as her husband 's political star gets brighter and brighter .
there 's even been speculation that he could become the country 's next chancellor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephanie zu guttenberg 's role in the show could affect her husband 's career in a survey by the forsa research institute released on wednesday , 25 percent of those surveyed said the defense minister would make a better chancellor than his boss , chancellor angela merkel .
this new role for stephanie zu guttenberg will only enhance her husband 's image , according to groebel .
" let 's be honest , the partner of a high-ranking politician is usually on the safe side .
they 're involved in charity work , but they never take any risks , " he said .
" i think the fact that she 's taking a risk will strengthen his image , as the husband of a completely independent wife . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.10.2010 spain 's zapatero shuffles cabinet as government popularity slumps großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's austerity measures are widely unpopular in a surprise decision , spanish prime minister zapatero has announced a major cabinet shuffle .
the move comes as his unpopular government is poised to implement painful austerity measures to combat a huge budget deficit . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has announced his biggest cabinet shuffle since taking office in 2004 .
in a nationally televised speech zapatero said that spain needed “ a politically strong ” and experienced government to manage the country ’ s difficult economic situation .
the cabinet shuffle is being seen as an effort to tackle the government ’ s widespread unpopularity in face of painful austerity measures .
zapatero 's government is poised to implement major spending cuts while at the same time raising taxes in an effort to reduce the country 's gaping public deficit and avoid a greek-style debt crisis .
the country ’ s unemployment rate stands at 20 percent - the highest in the european union .
recent opinion polls indicate that the opposition conservative popular party has the most support among the electorate , with a lead of around 15 percentage points over zapatero ’ s socialists . the prime minister 's approval rate has sunk to below 30 percent , the worst since his re-election in 2008 .
unexpected changes the extent of the shuffle came as a surprise as initially the prime minister ’ s office had only announced that labor minister celestine corbacho would be replaced .
his successor is the secretary general for employment , valeriano gomez .
interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba is to replace deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega .
rubalcaba , who is widely seen as a potential successor to zapatero , will however retain his old portfolio . the changes will also see foreign minister miguel angel moratinos be replaced by current health minister trinidad jimenez .
both moratinos and vega have been in office since the socialists won the 2004 elections .
the shuffle will also affect the health and the environment ministries .
the portfolio for housing and equality is being dissolved as part of the efforts to cut government spending .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.10.2010 spain 's zapatero shuffles cabinet as government popularity slumps großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's austerity measures are widely unpopular in a surprise decision , spanish prime minister zapatero has announced a major cabinet shuffle .
the move comes as his unpopular government is poised to implement painful austerity measures to combat a huge budget deficit . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has announced his biggest cabinet shuffle since taking office in 2004 .
in a nationally televised speech zapatero said that spain needed “ a politically strong ” and experienced government to manage the country ’ s difficult economic situation .
the cabinet shuffle is being seen as an effort to tackle the government ’ s widespread unpopularity in face of painful austerity measures .
zapatero 's government is poised to implement major spending cuts while at the same time raising taxes in an effort to reduce the country 's gaping public deficit and avoid a greek-style debt crisis .
the country ’ s unemployment rate stands at 20 percent - the highest in the european union .
recent opinion polls indicate that the opposition conservative popular party has the most support among the electorate , with a lead of around 15 percentage points over zapatero ’ s socialists . the prime minister 's approval rate has sunk to below 30 percent , the worst since his re-election in 2008 .
unexpected changes the extent of the shuffle came as a surprise as initially the prime minister ’ s office had only announced that labor minister celestine corbacho would be replaced .
his successor is the secretary general for employment , valeriano gomez .
interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba is to replace deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega .
rubalcaba , who is widely seen as a potential successor to zapatero , will however retain his old portfolio . the changes will also see foreign minister miguel angel moratinos be replaced by current health minister trinidad jimenez .
both moratinos and vega have been in office since the socialists won the 2004 elections .
the shuffle will also affect the health and the environment ministries .
the portfolio for housing and equality is being dissolved as part of the efforts to cut government spending .

his address had important messages for germans and turks , says baha gungor of dw 's turkish service . the omens for christian wulff 's third trip abroad as german president , this time to turkey , were unfavorable .
in germany , a debate on integration was raging , charged with emotions .
the weekly magazine " focus " published a cover with wulff 's face on it - distorted as an islamic prayer leader .
wulff had , however , merely pointed out in an october 3 speech that islam - in addition to christianity and judaism - is part of life in germany . public attention became focused on the first speech given by a german president to the turkish parliament .
wulff did not mince words .
for one , he repeated that islam has become an integral part of germany .
he also demanded that turkey acknowledge that christianity has a place in turkey , and that christians there should be free to worship as they wish .
that included priests being trained in turkey , he said , which is not possible now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha gungor , head of dw 's turkish department wulff did not avoid critical topics , such as turkey 's difficult relationship with cyprus and armenia .
not least , he affirmed israel 's right to exist while demanding an autonomous , viable and democratically ruled palestine .
that was an indirect request for turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to resume dialogue with israel . wulff refrained from making empty promises regarding turkey joining the european union .
shrewdly , clearly and unmistakably , wulff said that regardless of the democratic and economic progress turkey has indeed made , eu membership was not a foregone conclusion . the most distinct messages that wulff addressed to both germans and turks had to do with the need for people of turkish descent in germany to find a place in german society .
it was striking that wulff avoided using the loaded word " integration . "
his call for immigrants to learn the german language had been supported by the turkish president abdullah gul in the run-up to his visit .
and gul did not forget to mention in a joint press conference ahead of wulff 's speech that he was the president of all turkish citizens - those with armenian , jewish and greek roots included - and that all people in turkey should speak turkish . wulff 's five-day state visit will evidently help to minimize misunderstanding between berlin and ankara .
wulff 's manner has been well-received and his cautious words will not be ignored . whether a change of direction in germany 's out-of-control integration debate can be expected remains to be seen ; wulff does not have to win elections anymore . certain politicians , on the other hand , are not likely to pass on the strategy of pitting popular emotions against foreigners and migrants for their election campaigns . author : baha gungor -lrb- sst / rc -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german eurostar competitor completes first trip to london i have travelled on both the ice and tgv trains during visits to europe .
of course , the tgv was very exciting when it first came out .
the ice has always been a smooth ride before that .
so , i have no preference at this point but am glad to see competition between the two .
both ice and tgv are comfortable and reliable , so the passenger can then choose based on price and routes . - rome , us german , french rail companies on collision course over channel tunnel eurotunnel is underused by rail passengers .
it should be opened up to other operators in addition to eurostar , also , london is not the only city of high population in the uk to which there should be a high speed link .
other cities that could benefit include birmingham , manchester and glasgow . - roderick , oman its common knowledge that protectionism is rife in france , for example cars , aircraft etc . , but they must be made to realize that that behavior will not be tolerated any more .
eurostar has a perfect right to choose what is best for them - not france ! - richard , great britain french government says ' non ' to german eurostar trains at the moment , and for a while to come , france has enough on its plate vis-a-vis the never ending number of strikes , that make running any trains , a serious challenge .
the simple answer would be to increase the number of scheduled services , so that an increase in passenger volume would lead to more attractive prices in comparison to the alternative of air travel . - charles , great britain german train completes test trip under channel having had the enjoyment of riding with deutsche bahn in germany on many occasions , to be able to travel to , say , cologne without having to change at brussels , only to find the connecting train did n't wait for the late running eurostar service , is going to be great !
but i think db is going to have to sort out those pesky wheels once and for all before committing the ice 's to the tunnel . - tony , great britain deutsche bahn 's proposed high speed service from st. pancras is wonderful news and will most certainly be a great success for both the business and leisure sectors .

german space authorities said the level of accuracy this method produces is unprecedented . " processing the bistatic pairs of data is a big challenge , " thomas fritz , a dlr processing engineer , said in a statement .
" everything must match up exactly in order to reach this level of precision .
all sorts of data can affect the algorithms , from synchronization signals to millimeter-accurate orbital calculations . " prior to this new german project , the best digital elevation survey came from the us shuttle radar topography mission -lrb- srtm -rrb- completed in 2000 , however it only imaged 60 percent of the earth 's surface and was not nearly as accurate as the new survey . survey will take years to finish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the satellites fly in a formation similar to a double-helix dlr officials have said previously that the project will take four years to complete the survey and to process its corresponding data .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 20.10.2010 luxury group recruits puma boss for sports expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma enjoyed a comeback under jochen zeitz french luxury goods producer ppr , which owns gucci and yves saint laurent , bought german sports brand puma in 2007 .
now ppr wants puma 's unconventional ceo jochen zeitz to build a new sports and leisure empire . french luxury goods producer ppr has big plans for german sports brand puma , as well as that company 's unconventional ceo , jochen zeitz .
zeitz – who reportedly divides his time between puma 's headquarters in herzogenaurach and his farm in kenya – took charge of puma in 1993 , when he was just 30 years old .
he quickly gained a reputation as a mover and shaker as he transformed the struggling company into a successful brand with a global presence .
ppr acquired puma in 2007 , and has since purchased other sports brands including the cobra golf label .
it wants zeitz , now 47 , to head up a new sporting goods and leisure division with puma as its centerpiece .
ppr chief francois-henri pinault said in a statement that " the reinforcement of the puma management team under jochen zeitz is a decisive factor in the implementation of our strategy , which aims to make puma the core brand of ppr 's second pillar -lrb- sporting goods and leisure -rrb- . "
logical conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois-henri pinault 's ppr bought zeitz 's puma in 2007 antoine belge , a luxury and sporting goods analyst for hsbc , said zeitz has been involved in ppr 's strategic development for some time now .
" it 's just a sort of formalization of something that already existed ... effectively he was already in charge of doing acquisition , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's just a sign that expansion may accelerate . "
to facilitate change , puma will be restructured from a german ag corporation to a european se corporation .
analysts expect a senior puma manager will be appointed ceo , while zeitz himself is stays on as executive chairman until a replacement is found .
" that is why they want to have a specific ceo for the puma brand , because jochen zeitz will probably spend more time finding other brands to integrate into that division , " belge said .
tighter branding control ppr is expected to sell a number of subsidiaries – including electronics and entertainment retailer fnac , furniture seller conforama and redcats mail order- to finance the acquisition of further high-end brands .
john horan , publisher of industry newsletter sporting goods intelligence , said it makes sense for ppr to shed its multi-brand retail chains and concentrate on developing its own labels .
he described this as ' vertical retail , ' in which brands maintain stores exclusively to sell their products .
" if you look at where all the real strength in retail is recently , it 's been with vertical retailers of one kind or another , " horan told deutsche welle .
" they see it as a way to really make a brand statement that is very difficult to make when you 're selling through a retailer . "

his address had important messages for germans and turks , says baha gungor of dw 's turkish service . the omens for christian wulff 's third trip abroad as german president , this time to turkey , were unfavorable .
in germany , a debate on integration was raging , charged with emotions .
the weekly magazine " focus " published a cover with wulff 's face on it - distorted as an islamic prayer leader .
wulff had , however , merely pointed out in an october 3 speech that islam - in addition to christianity and judaism - is part of life in germany . public attention became focused on the first speech given by a german president to the turkish parliament .
wulff did not mince words .
for one , he repeated that islam has become an integral part of germany .
he also demanded that turkey acknowledge that christianity has a place in turkey , and that christians there should be free to worship as they wish .
that included priests being trained in turkey , he said , which is not possible now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha gungor , head of dw 's turkish department wulff did not avoid critical topics , such as turkey 's difficult relationship with cyprus and armenia .
not least , he affirmed israel 's right to exist while demanding an autonomous , viable and democratically ruled palestine .
that was an indirect request for turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to resume dialogue with israel . wulff refrained from making empty promises regarding turkey joining the european union .
shrewdly , clearly and unmistakably , wulff said that regardless of the democratic and economic progress turkey has indeed made , eu membership was not a foregone conclusion . the most distinct messages that wulff addressed to both germans and turks had to do with the need for people of turkish descent in germany to find a place in german society .
it was striking that wulff avoided using the loaded word " integration . "
his call for immigrants to learn the german language had been supported by the turkish president abdullah gul in the run-up to his visit .
and gul did not forget to mention in a joint press conference ahead of wulff 's speech that he was the president of all turkish citizens - those with armenian , jewish and greek roots included - and that all people in turkey should speak turkish . wulff 's five-day state visit will evidently help to minimize misunderstanding between berlin and ankara .
wulff 's manner has been well-received and his cautious words will not be ignored . whether a change of direction in germany 's out-of-control integration debate can be expected remains to be seen ; wulff does not have to win elections anymore . certain politicians , on the other hand , are not likely to pass on the strategy of pitting popular emotions against foreigners and migrants for their election campaigns . author : baha gungor -lrb- sst / rc -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
