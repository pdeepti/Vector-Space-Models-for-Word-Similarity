the squad has roots in eight different countries - nine when germany 's included . the role of sport in incorporating ethnic minorities into society is one of the olympic movement 's central leitmotifs . " sport is a fantastic instrument of social integration , " said jacques rogge , president of the international olympic committee , at a recent lecture in darmstadt . germany 's favorite sport is a working-class game , but not exclusively so .
soccer is cheap to take up but promises great riches at the top , and so offers the chance to advance and climb the social ladder .
these opportunities are keenly seized by youngsters from lower-earning , ethnically-diverse backgrounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the national team is redefining what it means to be german according to the most up-to-date figures from the federal statistics office , one in five people living in germany in 2008 was of foreign descent .
from the total of 15.9 million with roots abroad , 2.9 million were from turkey .
two likely starters for the national team at the world cup - serdar tasci and mesut oezil - both have turkish parents .
" a gift for german football , " was how joachim loew described oezil . it works both ways .
the sport plays a leading role in a successfully multicultural society today .
germany hopes to reap the rewards with its ethnically-diverse team on the pitch in south africa . helmut from sau paulo lukas podolski , miroslav klose and piotr trochowski were born in poland , and moved across the border as children .
all have been part of germany 's international set-up for years .
youngster marko marin was born in war-struck bosnia-herzegovina .
his parents moved to frankfurt when he was two , and , when he came of age , marin decided on a german passport .
mario gomez was born in baden-wuerttemberg , but his father comes from spain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cacau had to work his way to the top of german football gomez is likely to miss out on a place in germany 's attack , in favor of an in-form brazilian-born striker nicknamed " helmut . "
more commonly known as cacau , he was born in sao paulo province , and moved to german lower-league football ten years ago .
he gradually rose through the ranks to become a bundesliga winner with stuttgart in 2007 .
he 's just extended his contract at the club until 2013 . cacau became a german citizen in 2009 , and the call from joachim loew came quickly .
" i am glad that germany has adopted me , " he said .
" my whole mindset is german . " " never mind where you come from " the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is not afraid of celebrating its eclectic new generation of players .
since 2007 , the dfb and its general sponsor mercedes-benz have given an integration prize under the label " football : many cultures - but a single passion . "
they also put on a spectrum of projects and activities to promote the integration of youngsters from different backgrounds into society , both by playing soccer and using it as an example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira completes a trio of players with african roots but an impression of a complete acceptance of ethnic diversity in german soccer would not be fair .
far-right groups were reprimanded in court for racist publications attacking black german national players gerald asamoah and patrick owomoyela only four years ago , in the build-up to germany 's world cup . included in germany 's 2010 squad are dennis aogo , whose father is nigerian , and jerome boateng , born in berlin to a ghanaian father .
sami khedira is set to play an important role after captain michael ballack was ruled out through injury .
ballack was notable for being born in the former east germany when he made his national team debut in 1999 .
his replacement has a tunisian father , and is well-versed on the collective goals of a diverse group of players . " we are a team , " says khedira .
" we all want success at the world cup , never mind where you come from . " author : srecko matic / tms editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hugely experienced australians were expected to provide a stern test for this new breed and no-one would have blamed joachim loew for going with a cautious approach in germany 's opening game . instead , the germany coach threw holger badstuber into his back four , sami khedira into the empty midfield shoes of the absent michael ballack while the exciting creative duo of mesut oezil and thomas mueller were charged with opening up the australian defense .
keeping goal was the equally youthful manuel neuer - germany 's new no.1.
loew also had marcel jansen , toni kroos , marko marin and jerome boateng on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sami khedira was outstanding in germany 's midfield neuer looked nervous at kick-off , unsurprisingly given the 22-year-old 's experience only stretched to six games , but an early , safely-gathered ball seemed to settle his nerves . just how much he had settled was obvious just three minutes later when australia had the first clear chance .
the schalke keeper stood up well to block the close-range shot and philipp lahm cleared .
australia 's subsequent sorties found the young schalke stopper in even more confident form , punching clear and smothering at feet like an old pro .
his distribution was also considered and clever . khedira raises the question : michael who ? sami khedira looked to have understood what loew wanted from him in his role as a protector of the back four , which was important as the australians had flown out of the blocks with a surprisingly high-tempo attacking game . young holger badstuber appeared a little shell-shocked when faced with a marauding brett emerson so khedira 's intelligence was a godsend on the left flank on a number of occasions .
as the game wore on , badstuber may have seemed quiet but only because khedira had the left side sewn up in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller -lrb- no.13 -rrb- performed like a seasoned international equally impressive was the stuttgart man 's willingness to play as box-to-box midfielder , popping up regularly in the australian penalty area in support of the attack .
he could have had at least two goals himself .
such was his dynamism that it will not come as a surprise if khedira permanently replaces the fading ballack . germany 's breakthrough had the stamp of youth all over it .
mesut oezil drifted through the midfield and poked a ball beyond the australian defense for thomas mueller to sprint onto .
the bayern munich youngster 's cut back looked too deep but it was inch perfect for lukas podolski to hammer home from the edge of the box . mueller 's performance beyond his years mueller and oezil seemed to be everywhere , one always offering the other an option when the germans attacked .
mueller , playing effectively as a winger at times , was shredding the socceroos left back and delivering the kind of crosses that forwards dream of . his inclusion was being constantly justified as the 20-year-old not only proved to be an integral link in the attacking chain but on more than one occasion he had the chance to put his name on the score sheet .
when he finally hit the net with a goal of his won , it was only what he deserved after a performance beyond his years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose rolled back the years with a goal-scoring return oezil was also constant threat , dancing through tackles at will and showing intelligent movement .
he nearly had a cheeky goal to his name on the half-hour mark but his chip over keeper mark schwarzer was cleared off the line by socceroos captain lucas neill .
ten minutes later the werder bremen star saw another chance go begging after stripping neill for pace . germany 2010 could be a vintage team while a lot of the attacking intent was coming from the youngsters , the execution was coming from the old guard , even if podolski and philipp lahm – the provider for miroslav klose 's goal to make it 2-0 , could hardly be called pensioners . the promised offensive formation and style was truly in evidence and paying off in spades .
the first two goals may have come from the 2006 strike force but the vim and vitality which had proved too much for the aussies was of the 2010 vintage . when cacau came on and made it four after mueller 's goal had put the game out of sight , no-one could say that this was a typical germany performance .
australia had n't been worn down in style of german sides of the past - they had been torn apart by a new approach . germany , with its young stars and experienced heads had delivered on its promise .

during a 30-minute telephone conversation , obama , who said last week he wants to know " whose ass to kick " , reaffirmed america 's " deep commitment to the special and historic relationship " between the us and the uk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron has been under pressure to defend bp but , obama also made it clear that he expects bp to pay for the clean-up costs and meet economic claims from the spill .
bp under pressure cameron , who described the conversation as " warm and constructive " , stressed the importance of bp to the british and other economies , after he came under pressure at home to defend the economic heavyweight .
on friday he said that " it is in everyone 's interests that bp continues to be a financially strong and stable company " .
bp is a staple in british pension funds and accounts for 12 percent of all dividends paid by uk companies .
its share price has plunged by 40 percent since the offshore oil rig blast in the gulf of mexico on april 20 killed 11 people and triggered an environmental disaster , with up to 40,000 barrels of oil a day spilling into the sea and washing up along coastal areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp has been told its plans to cap the oil well are insufficient some us lawmakers are demanding that bp suspend its dividend payments until the crisis is resolved .
bp 's chairman carl-henric svanberg has been summoned to a meeting in the white house next wednesday .
48 hours to improve containment plans meanwhile , bp has been ordered by the us coast guard to come up with an improved containment plan within the next two days , as bp 's plans do not go far enough to have backup resources in place , according to the us military .
us government data released on thursday suggests that the oil flow from the leak is higher than previously thought and could be upwards of 40,000 barrels a day .

joachim loew 's blend of youth and experience opens its world cup campaign against australia in durban on sunday . the proof of the pudding , they say , is in the eating .
germany begin their world cup 2010 campaign against australia on sunday with coach joachim loew remaining true to his pledge that youth will lead the way .
loew experimented with his youth policy throughout qualification with a number of exciting youngsters blooded along the road to south africa but the real test awaits them in durban .
germany will hope that jogi has blended the right ingredients and that his mix of youth and experience does n't sink in the heat of competition like a failed soufflé .
with an average age of around 25 , germany 's likely starting line-up in the moses mabidha stadium will be die mannschaft 's youngest team in over 70 years .
but what it may be lacking in years , it certainly makes up for in excitement and quality .
germany are expected to play in an offensively minded 4-2-3-1 formation , which could include lukas podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either thomas mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either miroslav klose or cacau .
youth at the heart of germany 's creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german young guns kroos , mueller and badstuber much has been written about the wisdom of charging the likes of oezil , mueller and kroos with the job of conducting germany 's attacks , given the fact that these fresh-faced starlets are all short of their 23rd birthdays .
what is mostly forgotten in this analysis is that both oezil and mueller have spent the past season playing against some of the top teams in europe while holding down first-team places in two of germany 's best teams , werder bremen and bayern munich respectively .
kroos , meanwhile , was an instrumental component in bayer leverkusen 's best season in many a year .
germany should therefore have few concerns that these youngsters will be over-awed by the occasion .
and if there are a few jitters , loew has maintained enough of the experienced guard in the side to calm the nerves and help repel what is expected to be a robust socceroos team .
experienced back-up bildunterschrift : loew 's plan to play new stars with experienced players aims to bring germany new energy new captain philipp lahm will command fellow stalwarts per mertesacker and arne friedrich in the back four , all of which will give one of the two talented youngsters holger badstuber or jerome boateng the confidence to take his place in germany 's defensive quartet , safe in the knowledge that his fellow stoppers have been here before .
ahead of them , the increasingly mature and influential bastian schweinsteiger will shepherd the midfield with newcomer sami khedira by his side .
ahead of the creative trio of podolski , oezil and mueller -lrb- or kroos -rrb- - who is likely to get the nod ahead of piotr trochowski - germany may have the old head of miroslav klose to aim for as the chosen lone striker .
while klose has been off the boil for bayern this season , he is still a proven world cup striker who always seems to rise to such an occasion .
germany will hope this is the case again this year as his deputies all come with question marks .
mario gomez and stefan kiessling have never proved convincing at this level , and while cacau has looked good in recent friendlies he has had few appearances in competitive matches in a germany shirt .
" we watched a video of australia on friday and they made a big impression , " said oliver bierhoff , the germany team manager .
" they have not conceded a goal in 17 of their last 27 games , they are sturdy and they will be very focused , " he warned .
socceroos play the waiting game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia were no push-overs in germany in 2006 the australian team will be full of experience with an average age over 30 and are expected to face this young , attacking germany with defense in mind .
a strong defensive game and organization was the key to australia 's strong showing in the 2006 world cup which saw them through to the knockout stage where they were felled by a very debatable penalty decision in extra time against italy - the side who went on to become champions .
the socceroos will send out a team charged with soaking up german pressure , hoping to sap the strength of germany 's youngsters while hoping that star midfielder tim cahill can unlock the defense on the counter-attack .
australia 's dutch coach pim verbeek was hoping that striker harry kewell would be fit enough to spearhead those attacks but the galatasaray forward is unlikely to start after missing all the socceroos ' warm-up games due to injury .
while kewell could well be back to face ghana in the next game , joshua kennedy will continue to fill in for the time being as australia 's lone striker against the germans .

germany are expected to play in an offensively minded 4-2-3-1 formation , which could include lukas podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either thomas mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either miroslav klose or cacau .
youth at the heart of germany 's creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german young guns kroos , mueller and badstuber much has been written about the wisdom of charging the likes of oezil , mueller and kroos with the job of conducting germany 's attacks , given the fact that these fresh-faced starlets are all short of their 23rd birthdays .
what is mostly forgotten in this analysis is that both oezil and mueller have spent the past season playing against some of the top teams in europe while holding down first-team places in two of germany 's best teams , werder bremen and bayern munich respectively .
kroos , meanwhile , was an instrumental component in bayer leverkusen 's best season in many a year .
germany should therefore have few concerns that these youngsters will be over-awed by the occasion .
and if there are a few jitters , loew has maintained enough of the experienced guard in the side to calm the nerves and help repel what is expected to be a robust socceroos team .
experienced back-up bildunterschrift : loew 's plan to play new stars with experienced players aims to bring germany new energy new captain philipp lahm will command fellow stalwarts per mertesacker and arne friedrich in the back four , all of which will give one of the two talented youngsters holger badstuber or jerome boateng the confidence to take his place in germany 's defensive quartet , safe in the knowledge that his fellow stoppers have been here before .
ahead of them , the increasingly mature and influential bastian schweinsteiger will shepherd the midfield with newcomer sami khedira by his side .
ahead of the creative trio of podolski , oezil and mueller -lrb- or kroos -rrb- - who is likely to get the nod ahead of piotr trochowski - germany may have the old head of miroslav klose to aim for as the chosen lone striker .
while klose has been off the boil for bayern this season , he is still a proven world cup striker who always seems to rise to such an occasion .
germany will hope this is the case again this year as his deputies all come with question marks .
mario gomez and stefan kiessling have never proved convincing at this level , and while cacau has looked good in recent friendlies he has had few appearances in competitive matches in a germany shirt .
" we watched a video of australia on friday and they made a big impression , " said oliver bierhoff , the germany team manager .
" they have not conceded a goal in 17 of their last 27 games , they are sturdy and they will be very focused , " he warned .
socceroos play the waiting game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia were no push-overs in germany in 2006 the australian team will be full of experience with an average age over 30 and are expected to face this young , attacking germany with defense in mind .
a strong defensive game and organization was the key to australia 's strong showing in the 2006 world cup which saw them through to the knockout stage where they were felled by a very debatable penalty decision in extra time against italy - the side who went on to become champions .
the socceroos will send out a team charged with soaking up german pressure , hoping to sap the strength of germany 's youngsters while hoping that star midfielder tim cahill can unlock the defense on the counter-attack .
australia 's dutch coach pim verbeek was hoping that striker harry kewell would be fit enough to spearhead those attacks but the galatasaray forward is unlikely to start after missing all the socceroos ' warm-up games due to injury .
while kewell could well be back to face ghana in the next game , joshua kennedy will continue to fill in for the time being as australia 's lone striker against the germans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 13.06.2010 no doubt of german dominance in 2010 world cup debut großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski opened germany 's scoring early in the match germany kept up a relentless attack against australia in the team 's debut at the 2010 world cup and came away with the most convincing win of the tournament so far . germany 's first match of the 2010 world cup against australia in group d turned into a display of the goal-scoring prowess of coach joachim loew 's squad .
germany kept up constant pressure on the socceroos and convincingly won 4-0 in what is the world cup 's highest scoring match so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose headed the german side to a comfortable 2-0 halftime lead the attack on the australian goal began early , with lukas podolski firing an absolute strike at australian keeper mark schwarzer in the 8th minute .
schwarzer managed to get a glove on the ball but could not stop it from going into the goal . striker misoslav klose was in good form early on , but could n't seem to find the net as the game got going .
he sent a nearly wide-open chance just wide of the goal in the 24th minute , but had a chance to redeem himself two minutes later . captain phillip lahm brought the ball up the right side and launched a curling cross from distance toward klose in the area , who leapt just a bit higher than schwarzer to get a head on the ball and put germany ahead 2-0 .
the goal was the seventh header scored by klose in a world cup , giving him the most goals via header by any player in world cup history . right decisions in the second half , germany did not take its foot off the gas and continued to press the australian defense .
the australians were reduced to 10 men in the 56th minute after forward tim cahill was sent off for a hard tackle on bastian schweinsteiger , setting the stage for even more german goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans loved their team 's high-scoring debut twenty-year-old thomas mueller scored his first goal for the german team in the 68th minute , followed shortly after by a strike from cacau , who had just been subbed in for klose . coach joachim loew 's decision to start klose over the brazilian-born cacau proved to be a good one .

a majority of germans think her ruling center-right coalition will not last . german chancellor angela merkel reprimanded members of her center-right governing coalition on sunday , calling on them to end their public dispute in order to win back voter trust . insults have been flying back and forth within merkel 's coalition government , exposing a level of vitriol usually seen in exchanges between the government and the opposition , not among members on the same team .
the tenor has forced the german chancellor to speak out to maintain discipline as talk of a coalition on the skids and even new elections fill the air . " we have to show people that we can be relied upon at this difficult time , " she said in an interview in the weekly bild am sonntag newspaper .
" that 's the only way to win back trust . " strong differences of opinion on policy have emerged within merkel 's coalition of conservatives and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on a variety of issues and sharp tongues have not been held . a government spokesman was forced to deny reports that merkel 's chief of staff had described defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg as " rumpelstiltskin , " a fairy tale dwarf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center-right coalition has been plagued by infighting an fdp lawmaker accused bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- of acting like a destructive " wild sow " over health-reform plans .
a senior csu politician retaliated , calling the fdp a " bunch of clowns . " in an uncharacteristically direct appeal , merkel urged her colleagues to restrain themselves . " i assume those involved realize that this behavior is not acceptable , " she said in the bild am sonntag . " this should not and will not set a precedent . " merkel denied that her authority as chancellor has suffered because of the row . polls show drop in confidence but the infighting has caused some experts to predict the downfall of merkel 's coalition government . " the current level of conflict between the conservatives and fdp certainly goes beyond what is normal and some commentators have started to question the stability of the government , " goldman sachs economist dirk schumacher told the reuters news agency . more than half of german citizens do not expect merkel 's coalition government to survive for the next three years .
according to a survey for the bild am sonntag paper , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the coalition would collapse before the end of its legislative period . a survey conducted for the german broadcaster ard also showed that only 40 percent of germans expect the coalition to last its full term . merkel is under pressure to seize the political initiative and boost her party 's support , which is languishing at four-year lows according to recent polls . all eyes on the presidential election the is one immediate hurdle that analysts say merkel must overcome to ensure her coalition 's future .
she faces an unexpected battle to get christian wulff , the conservative leader of the state lower saxony , elected president on june 30 by the federal council , a 1,200-strong body convened to elect the head of state .
the previous president , horst koehler , resigned suddenly last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coalition hopes are pinned on presidential candidate christian wulff the candidate put forward by the opposition social democrats and greens , joachim gauck , poses a strong challenge and is being widely praised in the german media as the better choice . some provincial leaders of the fdp have even suggested they might try to obstruct wulff 's election if merkel tries to raise taxes on the wealthy . " the failure of chancellor merkel 's candidate wulff to get a majority could easily be the beginning of the end of the coalition , " said schumacher . author : joanna impey -lrb- apn / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the tenor has forced the german chancellor to speak out to maintain discipline as talk of a coalition on the skids and even new elections fill the air . " we have to show people that we can be relied upon at this difficult time , " she said in an interview in the weekly bild am sonntag newspaper .
" that 's the only way to win back trust .

according to a survey for the bild am sonntag paper , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the coalition would collapse before the end of its legislative period . a survey conducted for the german broadcaster ard also showed that only 40 percent of germans expect the coalition to last its full term . merkel is under pressure to seize the political initiative and boost her party 's support , which is languishing at four-year lows according to recent polls . all eyes on the presidential election the is one immediate hurdle that analysts say merkel must overcome to ensure her coalition 's future .
she faces an unexpected battle to get christian wulff , the conservative leader of the state lower saxony , elected president on june 30 by the federal council , a 1,200-strong body convened to elect the head of state .

nevertheless , the ' socceroos ' still hope to take points off germany on sunday . in germany in 2006 , australia was playing in its first world cup in 32 years and was able to draw upon the hype and euphoria associated with finally breaking such a long drought .
the team was young and represented a genuine surprise package in the tournament - and surprise they did , reaching the round of 16 and losing in controversial circumstances to eventual champions italy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injury has kept kewell from training ahead of the cup but with a starting xi nearly identical to the one that overwhelmed japan 3-1 in the opening match of 2006 , many pundits are wondering whether australia is now four years more experienced , or just four years slower .
the first xi in south africa is expected to mirror the 2006 equivalent , with the exception of striker mark viduka , who has n't played international football since 2007 .
the team played exciting football in 2006 , but the 2010 version of the " socceroos " has not evolved , and there are fears the unit now lacks that crucial blend of youth and experience , of pace and steadiness .
worries galore significant injury clouds have hung over key attacking players harry kewell , who plays his club football at galatasaray , and midfielder brett emerton of blackburn rovers - both of whom only resumed training with the national squad a week before their group d opener against germany .
the likes of midfielders vince grella , also of blackburn , and mark bresciano , whose palermo contract has just expired , have also battled injury in recent months and have played limited first-team football in their respective leagues .
defender craig moore , formerly of glasgow rangers , is also without a club - and at the age of 34 has been fending off concerns he may have lost the speed necessary to match it with the likes of a bastian schweinsteiger , marko marin or mesut oezil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socceroos captain neill is a rock in defense at the back , australia 's great hope lies with veteran goalkeeper mark schwarzer , who , at the age of 37 , has returned to career-best form with europa league finalists fulham .
captain lucas neill is also still considered a rock in defense , but endured an up-and-down season himself , switching from everton to galatasaray in january .
national coach dutchman pim verbeek has sought to dispel the concerns over injuries and lack of game time , insisting a week out from australia 's clash with germany that all his players were now fit and ready to take on the world .
defensive unit but it remains to be seen whether this will equate to match fitness , and whether the socceroos will be in-tune enough to keep up with a youthful germany team displaying at times a mesmerizing brand of attacking football .
moreover , the socceroos are being billed as a team that will offer little in the way of genuine attacking threats of their own , instead presenting themselves as a difficult team to break down in their defensive third - and indeed verbeek 's preferred 4-2-3-1 formation attests to this .
several attack-minded teams play 4-2-3-1 , of course - germany and brazil to name but two - but australia has often lacked the speed and technical proficiency to use the formation in the same way they do .
in its world cup warm-up matches the socceroos struggled to shift the ball quickly enough from the back , through the midfield and up to the lone striker in order to effectively hit teams on the counter-attack .
australia can boast a highly organized team , though no more than most other countries that made it to south africa .
at this level , possessing a tight , well-organized team is the lowest common denominator .
happily underdogs so what does australia have going in its favor ?
the first two words that come to mind are tim cahill , who has enjoyed a solid season with his club everton , and who is without doubt the socceroos ' primary attacking threat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cahill is one aussie making the germans nervous despite his height , or lack thereof , cahill is remarkably good with his head , and has a knack for slipping into the right place at the right time .
he 'll certainly be a handful for the german defense , with national team defender per mertesacker commenting recently that cahill was " one of australia 's most dangerous players and will be their midfield maestro . "
luke wilkshire of dynamo moscow will also be one to keep an eye on .
wilkshire 's crosses and free kicks from the right were a source of several goals during world cup qualifying for the likes of beanpole striker joshua kennedy .
also in australia 's corner will be the knowledge that they 've been written off as also-rans by the other two teams in group d , serbia and ghana .
ghana midfielder sulley muntari commented as recently as thursday that his team would be focusing its attention on games against serbia and germany , with victory against australia all but considered a fait accompli .
this perceived dismissiveness will undoubtedly work in the socceroos ' favor .
never lie down australians see as central to their sporting mentality the ability to rise to an occasion , to thrive against all odds .
australians love an underdog and cherish a squad full of fierce competitors .
australia is also a young country , and sporting success is a big part of its national mythology .
they do n't give up without a fight .
australia is also known as a physical team , with the national squad having been subject to a fitness regime many in the socceroos camp feel is superior to those of other countries .
lucas neill may have stated recently that australia would be happy with a draw against the much-fancied germans come sunday , but do n't take this to mean the socceroos feel they do n't have a chance .
' ' -lsb- germany 's -rsb- record suggests they are the most consistent team in world football , and the pressure is on them to win , " neill said earlier in the week .
" nobody in the world , apart from our team , expects us to beat them .
if we manage to win , we will shock the world . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cahill is one aussie making the germans nervous despite his height , or lack thereof , cahill is remarkably good with his head , and has a knack for slipping into the right place at the right time .
he 'll certainly be a handful for the german defense , with national team defender per mertesacker commenting recently that cahill was " one of australia 's most dangerous players and will be their midfield maestro . "
luke wilkshire of dynamo moscow will also be one to keep an eye on .
wilkshire 's crosses and free kicks from the right were a source of several goals during world cup qualifying for the likes of beanpole striker joshua kennedy .
also in australia 's corner will be the knowledge that they 've been written off as also-rans by the other two teams in group d , serbia and ghana .
ghana midfielder sulley muntari commented as recently as thursday that his team would be focusing its attention on games against serbia and germany , with victory against australia all but considered a fait accompli .
this perceived dismissiveness will undoubtedly work in the socceroos ' favor .
never lie down australians see as central to their sporting mentality the ability to rise to an occasion , to thrive against all odds .
australians love an underdog and cherish a squad full of fierce competitors .
australia is also a young country , and sporting success is a big part of its national mythology .
they do n't give up without a fight .
australia is also known as a physical team , with the national squad having been subject to a fitness regime many in the socceroos camp feel is superior to those of other countries .
lucas neill may have stated recently that australia would be happy with a draw against the much-fancied germans come sunday , but do n't take this to mean the socceroos feel they do n't have a chance .
' ' -lsb- germany 's -rsb- record suggests they are the most consistent team in world football , and the pressure is on them to win , " neill said earlier in the week .
" nobody in the world , apart from our team , expects us to beat them .
if we manage to win , we will shock the world . "

nevertheless , the ' socceroos ' still hope to take points off germany on sunday . in germany in 2006 , australia was playing in its first world cup in 32 years and was able to draw upon the hype and euphoria associated with finally breaking such a long drought .
the team was young and represented a genuine surprise package in the tournament - and surprise they did , reaching the round of 16 and losing in controversial circumstances to eventual champions italy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injury has kept kewell from training ahead of the cup but with a starting xi nearly identical to the one that overwhelmed japan 3-1 in the opening match of 2006 , many pundits are wondering whether australia is now four years more experienced , or just four years slower .
the first xi in south africa is expected to mirror the 2006 equivalent , with the exception of striker mark viduka , who has n't played international football since 2007 .
the team played exciting football in 2006 , but the 2010 version of the " socceroos " has not evolved , and there are fears the unit now lacks that crucial blend of youth and experience , of pace and steadiness .
worries galore significant injury clouds have hung over key attacking players harry kewell , who plays his club football at galatasaray , and midfielder brett emerton of blackburn rovers - both of whom only resumed training with the national squad a week before their group d opener against germany .
the likes of midfielders vince grella , also of blackburn , and mark bresciano , whose palermo contract has just expired , have also battled injury in recent months and have played limited first-team football in their respective leagues .
defender craig moore , formerly of glasgow rangers , is also without a club - and at the age of 34 has been fending off concerns he may have lost the speed necessary to match it with the likes of a bastian schweinsteiger , marko marin or mesut oezil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socceroos captain neill is a rock in defense at the back , australia 's great hope lies with veteran goalkeeper mark schwarzer , who , at the age of 37 , has returned to career-best form with europa league finalists fulham .
captain lucas neill is also still considered a rock in defense , but endured an up-and-down season himself , switching from everton to galatasaray in january .
national coach dutchman pim verbeek has sought to dispel the concerns over injuries and lack of game time , insisting a week out from australia 's clash with germany that all his players were now fit and ready to take on the world .
defensive unit but it remains to be seen whether this will equate to match fitness , and whether the socceroos will be in-tune enough to keep up with a youthful germany team displaying at times a mesmerizing brand of attacking football .
moreover , the socceroos are being billed as a team that will offer little in the way of genuine attacking threats of their own , instead presenting themselves as a difficult team to break down in their defensive third - and indeed verbeek 's preferred 4-2-3-1 formation attests to this .
several attack-minded teams play 4-2-3-1 , of course - germany and brazil to name but two - but australia has often lacked the speed and technical proficiency to use the formation in the same way they do .
in its world cup warm-up matches the socceroos struggled to shift the ball quickly enough from the back , through the midfield and up to the lone striker in order to effectively hit teams on the counter-attack .
australia can boast a highly organized team , though no more than most other countries that made it to south africa .
at this level , possessing a tight , well-organized team is the lowest common denominator .
happily underdogs so what does australia have going in its favor ?
the first two words that come to mind are tim cahill , who has enjoyed a solid season with his club everton , and who is without doubt the socceroos ' primary attacking threat .

max goeldi was at the center of a diplomatic spat between the two countries , which have now signed an agreement to cool tensions . after spending almost two years in a libyan jail for visa offenses , swiss businessman max goeldi is heading back home to switzerland .
it will be the end , many hope , of a fierce diplomatic dispute between bern and tripoli .
goeldi was released from the prison three days ago , and swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey has confirmed that he will be leaving libya sunday .
the conflict dates back to the arrest of a son of libyan leader moammar gadhafi .
the son , hannibal , was arrested for allegedly beating his domestic servants in geneva in july 2008 .
the charges against him were later dropped , but it was the start of a row that the two countries now hope to put behind them .
a few days after hannibal 's arrest , goeldi was detained and not allowed to leave libya .
goeldi has spent the last four months in prison after being convicted of violating immigration rules .
the situation has hurt relations between switzerland and libya , but the two nations have now signed what calmy-rey calls an " action plan " to help repair diplomatic ties .
" goeldi will return to switzerland and this is the start of the normalization of relations between the two countries , " she said .
the price for goeldi 's return home appeared to be a swiss apology for the publication of a leaked police photo of hannibal gadhafi taken while he was under arrest .
libya says the leak was an invasion of his privacy and hurt his reputation .
the swiss foreign minister said her country acknowledged the publication was unlawful , gave an apology and promised to pay hannibal gadhafi compensation if a criminal investigation fails to find who was responsible for the leak .
spain , which currently holds the european union 's rotating presidency , was part of the negotiations in tripoli and the agreement was also signed by a german mediator .

max goeldi was at the center of a diplomatic spat between the two countries , which have now signed an agreement to cool tensions . after spending almost two years in a libyan jail for visa offenses , swiss businessman max goeldi is heading back home to switzerland .
it will be the end , many hope , of a fierce diplomatic dispute between bern and tripoli .
goeldi was released from the prison three days ago , and swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey has confirmed that he will be leaving libya sunday .
the conflict dates back to the arrest of a son of libyan leader moammar gadhafi .
the son , hannibal , was arrested for allegedly beating his domestic servants in geneva in july 2008 .
the charges against him were later dropped , but it was the start of a row that the two countries now hope to put behind them .
a few days after hannibal 's arrest , goeldi was detained and not allowed to leave libya .
goeldi has spent the last four months in prison after being convicted of violating immigration rules .
the situation has hurt relations between switzerland and libya , but the two nations have now signed what calmy-rey calls an " action plan " to help repair diplomatic ties .
" goeldi will return to switzerland and this is the start of the normalization of relations between the two countries , " she said .
the price for goeldi 's return home appeared to be a swiss apology for the publication of a leaked police photo of hannibal gadhafi taken while he was under arrest .
libya says the leak was an invasion of his privacy and hurt his reputation .
the swiss foreign minister said her country acknowledged the publication was unlawful , gave an apology and promised to pay hannibal gadhafi compensation if a criminal investigation fails to find who was responsible for the leak .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 13.06.2010 happy as underdogs , aussies looking for germany upset großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the socceroos want to spring a surprise the big question hanging over australia 's world cup first xi is whether it 's lost the youthful spark that propelled it in 2006 .
nevertheless , the ' socceroos ' still hope to take points off germany on sunday . in germany in 2006 , australia was playing in its first world cup in 32 years and was able to draw upon the hype and euphoria associated with finally breaking such a long drought .
the team was young and represented a genuine surprise package in the tournament - and surprise they did , reaching the round of 16 and losing in controversial circumstances to eventual champions italy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injury has kept kewell from training ahead of the cup but with a starting xi nearly identical to the one that overwhelmed japan 3-1 in the opening match of 2006 , many pundits are wondering whether australia is now four years more experienced , or just four years slower .
the first xi in south africa is expected to mirror the 2006 equivalent , with the exception of striker mark viduka , who has n't played international football since 2007 .
the team played exciting football in 2006 , but the 2010 version of the " socceroos " has not evolved , and there are fears the unit now lacks that crucial blend of youth and experience , of pace and steadiness .
worries galore significant injury clouds have hung over key attacking players harry kewell , who plays his club football at galatasaray , and midfielder brett emerton of blackburn rovers - both of whom only resumed training with the national squad a week before their group d opener against germany .
the likes of midfielders vince grella , also of blackburn , and mark bresciano , whose palermo contract has just expired , have also battled injury in recent months and have played limited first-team football in their respective leagues .
defender craig moore , formerly of glasgow rangers , is also without a club - and at the age of 34 has been fending off concerns he may have lost the speed necessary to match it with the likes of a bastian schweinsteiger , marko marin or mesut oezil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socceroos captain neill is a rock in defense at the back , australia 's great hope lies with veteran goalkeeper mark schwarzer , who , at the age of 37 , has returned to career-best form with europa league finalists fulham .
captain lucas neill is also still considered a rock in defense , but endured an up-and-down season himself , switching from everton to galatasaray in january .
national coach dutchman pim verbeek has sought to dispel the concerns over injuries and lack of game time , insisting a week out from australia 's clash with germany that all his players were now fit and ready to take on the world .
defensive unit but it remains to be seen whether this will equate to match fitness , and whether the socceroos will be in-tune enough to keep up with a youthful germany team displaying at times a mesmerizing brand of attacking football .
moreover , the socceroos are being billed as a team that will offer little in the way of genuine attacking threats of their own , instead presenting themselves as a difficult team to break down in their defensive third - and indeed verbeek 's preferred 4-2-3-1 formation attests to this .
several attack-minded teams play 4-2-3-1 , of course - germany and brazil to name but two - but australia has often lacked the speed and technical proficiency to use the formation in the same way they do .
in its world cup warm-up matches the socceroos struggled to shift the ball quickly enough from the back , through the midfield and up to the lone striker in order to effectively hit teams on the counter-attack .
australia can boast a highly organized team , though no more than most other countries that made it to south africa .
at this level , possessing a tight , well-organized team is the lowest common denominator .
happily underdogs so what does australia have going in its favor ?
the first two words that come to mind are tim cahill , who has enjoyed a solid season with his club everton , and who is without doubt the socceroos ' primary attacking threat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cahill is one aussie making the germans nervous despite his height , or lack thereof , cahill is remarkably good with his head , and has a knack for slipping into the right place at the right time .
he 'll certainly be a handful for the german defense , with national team defender per mertesacker commenting recently that cahill was " one of australia 's most dangerous players and will be their midfield maestro . "
luke wilkshire of dynamo moscow will also be one to keep an eye on .
wilkshire 's crosses and free kicks from the right were a source of several goals during world cup qualifying for the likes of beanpole striker joshua kennedy .
also in australia 's corner will be the knowledge that they 've been written off as also-rans by the other two teams in group d , serbia and ghana .
ghana midfielder sulley muntari commented as recently as thursday that his team would be focusing its attention on games against serbia and germany , with victory against australia all but considered a fait accompli .
this perceived dismissiveness will undoubtedly work in the socceroos ' favor .
never lie down australians see as central to their sporting mentality the ability to rise to an occasion , to thrive against all odds .
australians love an underdog and cherish a squad full of fierce competitors .
australia is also a young country , and sporting success is a big part of its national mythology .
they do n't give up without a fight .
australia is also known as a physical team , with the national squad having been subject to a fitness regime many in the socceroos camp feel is superior to those of other countries .
lucas neill may have stated recently that australia would be happy with a draw against the much-fancied germans come sunday , but do n't take this to mean the socceroos feel they do n't have a chance .
' ' -lsb- germany 's -rsb- record suggests they are the most consistent team in world football , and the pressure is on them to win , " neill said earlier in the week .
" nobody in the world , apart from our team , expects us to beat them .
if we manage to win , we will shock the world . "

however it was another asamoah - kwadwo asamoah – who ran the game for ghana from the middle of the pitch , conducting play and pushing his team 's attacks forward from deep .
the black stars ' midfielder was certainly a strong candidate for man-of-the-match .
germany 's coaching staff and players will have been watching asamoah 's contribution with interest and may well single him out for special treatment as the most dangerous player in the ghana midfield when they face each other in their final game of group d on june 23 .

but on this performance against serbia , it is likely that asamoah will be the man who links ghana 's defense to its attack against the germans .
ghana defended very deeply throughout the match and fell back in large numbers whenever the serbians broke .
as soon as the threat had been neutralized , usually by some desperate defending and bodies being thrown in front of the ball , the play was immediately fed out to asamoah .
from his central position , the udinese midfielder would then run at the retreating serbs .
throughout the game , ghana would stretch the play to the very by-lines with asamoah feeding either prince tagoe on the right or andre ayew on the left .
serbia were dragged out of position by this tactic which allowed gyan and kevin-prince boateng to exploit the vacuum created in front of the serbian defense .

per mertesacker and arne friedrich are both tall players and accomplished in aerial battles .
ghana lacked initiative when running directly at the serbian defense and often headed straight into danger or chose to shoot from distance , which will also play into germany 's hands .
should the tactic of stretching play to the wings also endure , germany 's creative midfield trio of lukas podolski , mesut oezil and thomas mueller will have to be ready to drop back to the edge of their own box while wing-backs philipp lahm and perhaps kevin-prince 's brother jerome will have to watch that they do n't get caught too up-field in support of germany 's attack .
the potential clash of the boateng brothers is another interesting factor ahead of the germany-ghana game .
kevin-prince , a former germany under-21 player before choosing to take his father 's nationality , will have both identity issues and the potential wrath of a nation against him .
it was he who injured germany skipper michael ballack in the fa cup final at the end of the season to end the iconic german 's hopes of playing in south africa .
psychological pressure may affect the youngster 's potential to threaten .
on the attack , germany 's youthful creativity will be looking to exploit ghana 's sometimes erratic and jittery defense .
serbia , who play a less sophisticated version of the german game , caused chaos in ghana 's penalty area and only the lack of killer instinct prevented serbia from punishing this weakness .

however it was another asamoah - kwadwo asamoah – who ran the game for ghana from the middle of the pitch , conducting play and pushing his team 's attacks forward from deep .
the black stars ' midfielder was certainly a strong candidate for man-of-the-match .
germany 's coaching staff and players will have been watching asamoah 's contribution with interest and may well single him out for special treatment as the most dangerous player in the ghana midfield when they face each other in their final game of group d on june 23 .
ghana midfielder asamoah pivotal to attacking threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghana broke well but resorted to lofted crosses into the box asamoah was the fulcrum of the ghana team on sunday – whether or not he will remain so depends on whether ghana 's serbian coach milovan rajevac brings inter milan 's sulley muntari back into the starting line-up or gives stalwart stephan appiah a run-out .
but on this performance against serbia , it is likely that asamoah will be the man who links ghana 's defense to its attack against the germans .
ghana defended very deeply throughout the match and fell back in large numbers whenever the serbians broke .
as soon as the threat had been neutralized , usually by some desperate defending and bodies being thrown in front of the ball , the play was immediately fed out to asamoah .
from his central position , the udinese midfielder would then run at the retreating serbs .
throughout the game , ghana would stretch the play to the very by-lines with asamoah feeding either prince tagoe on the right or andre ayew on the left .
serbia were dragged out of position by this tactic which allowed gyan and kevin-prince boateng to exploit the vacuum created in front of the serbian defense .
more often or not , however , the ghanaians resorted to lofted balls into the serbian penalty area rather than switching play to the forwards on the edge of the box .
lofted balls no problem for aerially-savvy germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker and friedrich will be ready for any aerial assault if this is a tactic they intend to stick with throughout the group stages , germany 's central defenders will have little trouble cutting out the high balls .
per mertesacker and arne friedrich are both tall players and accomplished in aerial battles .
ghana lacked initiative when running directly at the serbian defense and often headed straight into danger or chose to shoot from distance , which will also play into germany 's hands .
should the tactic of stretching play to the wings also endure , germany 's creative midfield trio of lukas podolski , mesut oezil and thomas mueller will have to be ready to drop back to the edge of their own box while wing-backs philipp lahm and perhaps kevin-prince 's brother jerome will have to watch that they do n't get caught too up-field in support of germany 's attack .
the potential clash of the boateng brothers is another interesting factor ahead of the germany-ghana game .
kevin-prince , a former germany under-21 player before choosing to take his father 's nationality , will have both identity issues and the potential wrath of a nation against him .
it was he who injured germany skipper michael ballack in the fa cup final at the end of the season to end the iconic german 's hopes of playing in south africa .
psychological pressure may affect the youngster 's potential to threaten .
on the attack , germany 's youthful creativity will be looking to exploit ghana 's sometimes erratic and jittery defense .
serbia , who play a less sophisticated version of the german game , caused chaos in ghana 's penalty area and only the lack of killer instinct prevented serbia from punishing this weakness .
competent ball carriers like oezil and mueller could unlock the ghanaians while lukas podolski and perhaps miroslav klose will have plenty of scuffed clearances to pounce on .

interior ministry projections show that the party would have 27 seats in the lower house of parliament – one more than the french-speaking socialist -lrb- ps -rrb- . the nva favors an eventual split between the dutch-speaking flanders region and the french-speaking wallonia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de wever has claimed victory head of the party bart de wever declared the nva winners as supporters chanted the slogan " long live a free flanders . " " the nva has won the election today , " said de wever .
" we stand before you with a party that has around 30 percent -lrb- of flemish votes -rrb- . " traditional rivals fall behind the projected figures would make the nva the first separatist party to win more seats than traditional rivals , who wish to keep the 180-year-old state intact . " the people of flanders have voted for change .
we will not disappoint them , " de wever said .
he added that flemish nationalists had to " extend a hand to francophones , " adding that " we need to change the state together . " together with the flemish socialists , the ps could still form the largest group in parliament , making ps leader elio di rupo the next prime minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ps leader elio di rupo could become the country 's next prime minister de wever is reluctant to be the premier of a united belgium and has said that he is not opposed to the country having its first french-speaking premier since 1974 – provided that this would bring more power to flanders . several parties needed the nature of belgium 's parliamentary system , under which parties divide on linguistic as well as policy grounds , means at least four parties will have to agree to form a coalition . tension between the wealthier flanders in the north and the poorer french-speaking walloons in the south has existed for decades and has led to continual problems in the national government . the latest elections were called after the coalition government collapsed in april over a language dispute .
the snap elections came a year ahead of schedule after the belgian government fell in a struggle between french and dutch-speaking parties .

meanwhile four centre-right parties with a total of 79 seats in the 150-seat parliament have claimed victory , saying the people of slovakia have given them a clear mandate for change .
he won , yet it seems he might have lost .
robert fico , the uncompromising premier who promised to shield slovaks from the worst of the global financial crisis and protect them from hungarian revisionism , saw his smer party win almost 35 % of the vote - an impressive result for a party that 's been in government for the last four years .
" it 's a result that gives us the right to receive the go-ahead from the president to lead talks on forming a government , " he told bleary-eyed journalists at a pre-dawn press conference .
end of meciar era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fico has not conceded defeat just yet but in the same breath , fico conceded that his efforts may be in vain , and smer may end up in opposition , where it would provide a " clear alternative " to a potential center-right coalition .
smer may control 62 seats in the new parliament , but the party looks isolated .
his two coalition allies did not fare well .
the ultra-nationalist slovak national party -lrb- sns -rrb- barely scraped the 5 % threshold into parliament .
however , the movement for a democratic slovakia -lrb- hzds -rrb- - the party of slovakia 's authoritarian former prime minister vladimir meciar - was unceremoniously kicked out .
observers are already calling that " the final end of the meciar era . "
the heavy-handed , autocratic politician who led his country into international isolation could now be on the brink of political retirement .
smer victorious but isolated together , smer and the slovak national party will command 71 seats - several short of a majority .
the only way prime minister fico can stay in power is if one of four center-right opposition parties choose to lend him their support - an unlikely , but , analysts stress , not impossible , prospect .
the champagne was flowing , however , over at the headquarters of those four parties - two of them brand new .
the center-right slovak democratic and christian union -lrb- sdku -rrb- - which presided over government from 1998-2006 and undid much of meciar 's damage to slovakia 's international reputation - emerged with 15 % of the vote .

"
radicova added that , as soon as sunday , talks would be convened with three fellow center-right parties on forming a coalition government - the newly-created freedom and solidarity -lrb- sas -rrb- , the christian democratic movement -lrb- kdh -rrb- and most-hid , a joint slovak-hungarian party that promotes unity between slovaks and ethnic hungarians .
that 's a very different message from fico 's government , which has followed a clear nationalist agenda , clashing frequently with slovakia 's increasingly assertive southern neighbor , hungary .
cutting the deficit priorities for a potential center-right government would include trimming the deficit by reforming public finances .
the four parties had promised austerity steps before the election to get slovakia 's export-driven economy , which has been battered by the global financial crisis , back on track .
an ethnic hungarian party in power would at first glance seem to raise the prospect of some sort of reconciliation with hungary .
however , the party with the closest links to budapest 's nationalist government - the party of the hungarian coalition -lrb- smk -rrb- - had a disastrous election , failing to retain any of its seats in parliament , as slovakia 's 500,000 ethnic hungarians put their faith in the more moderate most-hid .
but even if the four parties do manage to agree on a government , the new cabinet may lack stability .
with a majority of just eight seats in parliament , it could be a shaky coalition .
dark predictions of failure came from fico himself , who said such a government would last " a year , at most . "
perhaps the biggest change for slovakia will be the style of its next leader .
after being ruled by men for its 17-year-history as an independent state , slovaks may be about to find themselves governed by iveta radicova , their first female prime minister , one who promotes dialogue over confrontation .

meanwhile four centre-right parties with a total of 79 seats in the 150-seat parliament have claimed victory , saying the people of slovakia have given them a clear mandate for change .
he won , yet it seems he might have lost .
robert fico , the uncompromising premier who promised to shield slovaks from the worst of the global financial crisis and protect them from hungarian revisionism , saw his smer party win almost 35 % of the vote - an impressive result for a party that 's been in government for the last four years .
" it 's a result that gives us the right to receive the go-ahead from the president to lead talks on forming a government , " he told bleary-eyed journalists at a pre-dawn press conference .
end of meciar era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fico has not conceded defeat just yet but in the same breath , fico conceded that his efforts may be in vain , and smer may end up in opposition , where it would provide a " clear alternative " to a potential center-right coalition .
smer may control 62 seats in the new parliament , but the party looks isolated .
his two coalition allies did not fare well .
the ultra-nationalist slovak national party -lrb- sns -rrb- barely scraped the 5 % threshold into parliament .
however , the movement for a democratic slovakia -lrb- hzds -rrb- - the party of slovakia 's authoritarian former prime minister vladimir meciar - was unceremoniously kicked out .
observers are already calling that " the final end of the meciar era . "
the heavy-handed , autocratic politician who led his country into international isolation could now be on the brink of political retirement .
smer victorious but isolated together , smer and the slovak national party will command 71 seats - several short of a majority .
the only way prime minister fico can stay in power is if one of four center-right opposition parties choose to lend him their support - an unlikely , but , analysts stress , not impossible , prospect .
the champagne was flowing , however , over at the headquarters of those four parties - two of them brand new .
the center-right slovak democratic and christian union -lrb- sdku -rrb- - which presided over government from 1998-2006 and undid much of meciar 's damage to slovakia 's international reputation - emerged with 15 % of the vote .
" beautiful morning miracle " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radicova could be the leader of a new , center-right coalition the party 's new leader iveta radicova described the centre-right 's majority as " a beautiful morning miracle " , and said " change for slovakia was truly around the corner . "
radicova added that , as soon as sunday , talks would be convened with three fellow center-right parties on forming a coalition government - the newly-created freedom and solidarity -lrb- sas -rrb- , the christian democratic movement -lrb- kdh -rrb- and most-hid , a joint slovak-hungarian party that promotes unity between slovaks and ethnic hungarians .
that 's a very different message from fico 's government , which has followed a clear nationalist agenda , clashing frequently with slovakia 's increasingly assertive southern neighbor , hungary .
cutting the deficit priorities for a potential center-right government would include trimming the deficit by reforming public finances .
the four parties had promised austerity steps before the election to get slovakia 's export-driven economy , which has been battered by the global financial crisis , back on track .
an ethnic hungarian party in power would at first glance seem to raise the prospect of some sort of reconciliation with hungary .
however , the party with the closest links to budapest 's nationalist government - the party of the hungarian coalition -lrb- smk -rrb- - had a disastrous election , failing to retain any of its seats in parliament , as slovakia 's 500,000 ethnic hungarians put their faith in the more moderate most-hid .
but even if the four parties do manage to agree on a government , the new cabinet may lack stability .
with a majority of just eight seats in parliament , it could be a shaky coalition .
dark predictions of failure came from fico himself , who said such a government would last " a year , at most . "
perhaps the biggest change for slovakia will be the style of its next leader .
after being ruled by men for its 17-year-history as an independent state , slovaks may be about to find themselves governed by iveta radicova , their first female prime minister , one who promotes dialogue over confrontation .

during a 30-minute telephone conversation , obama , who said last week he wants to know " whose ass to kick " , reaffirmed america 's " deep commitment to the special and historic relationship " between the us and the uk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron has been under pressure to defend bp but , obama also made it clear that he expects bp to pay for the clean-up costs and meet economic claims from the spill .
bp under pressure cameron , who described the conversation as " warm and constructive " , stressed the importance of bp to the british and other economies , after he came under pressure at home to defend the economic heavyweight .
on friday he said that " it is in everyone 's interests that bp continues to be a financially strong and stable company " .
bp is a staple in british pension funds and accounts for 12 percent of all dividends paid by uk companies .
its share price has plunged by 40 percent since the offshore oil rig blast in the gulf of mexico on april 20 killed 11 people and triggered an environmental disaster , with up to 40,000 barrels of oil a day spilling into the sea and washing up along coastal areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp has been told its plans to cap the oil well are insufficient some us lawmakers are demanding that bp suspend its dividend payments until the crisis is resolved .
bp 's chairman carl-henric svanberg has been summoned to a meeting in the white house next wednesday .
48 hours to improve containment plans meanwhile , bp has been ordered by the us coast guard to come up with an improved containment plan within the next two days , as bp 's plans do not go far enough to have backup resources in place , according to the us military .
us government data released on thursday suggests that the oil flow from the leak is higher than previously thought and could be upwards of 40,000 barrels a day .

casual observers and hardcore german soccer fans were all curious as to how germany 2010 would be set up and whether the promise of exciting , offensive football would just be a smokescreen for a return to the safe , traditional approach of old . this was the first test for the youthful germans in world cup battle proper , pitting the second youngest team at this world cup - after group d opponents ghana - against the oldest in durban 's impressive moses mabhida stadium .
the hugely experienced australians were expected to provide a stern test for this new breed and no-one would have blamed joachim loew for going with a cautious approach in germany 's opening game . instead , the germany coach threw holger badstuber into his back four , sami khedira into the empty midfield shoes of the absent michael ballack while the exciting creative duo of mesut oezil and thomas mueller were charged with opening up the australian defense .
keeping goal was the equally youthful manuel neuer - germany 's new no.1.

german head coach joachim loew made the full-back captain of the national team in south africa . without analyzing his game , it 's hard to believe that the likely new germany captain philipp lahm has been one of the world 's best full backs for over six years now .
the bayern munich defender just does n't look old enough to have been at the top of the game in his position for that long .
yet he has been an integral player for both club and country since his appearances at euro 2004 first caught the eye .
lahm is not only coveted by the likes of barcelona and manchester united for his prowess in the full back role but also because of his versatility .
as comfortable on the left as on the right , lahm has shown his pace , dribbling and crossing abilities from both flanks .
he has even played as an emergency holding midfielder and left-winger in his career , showing an aptitude for both .
the diminutive defender -lrb- 170cm , or 5 ' 7 " -rrb- is a handful in full gallop , his small stature and low center of gravity making it very hard for opponents to knock him off the ball .
he also packs a powerful shot with his strong right foot , utilized as a potent weapon by both bayern and germany .
bildunterschrift : lahm 's tireless running and tackling has been key to bayern and germany 's success mr. consistency lahm rarely has a bad game for either club or country and has stood out at each international tournament he has played in since making his germany debut in february 2004 .
lahm clearly relishes the biggest of stages .
outstanding campaigns at the european championships in 2004 and 2008 , and a starring role in germany 's 2006 world cup campaign have only added to a reputation cultivated through top-notch domestic service , first with stuttgart and then bayern .
starting the 2006 world cup in style with the opening goal of the tournament , scored with a looping shot against costa rica , lahm went on to become the only german player to play all 690 minutes of the host nation 's campaign .
six months after the tournament , he was nominated for the fifa world player of the year award and was included in the mastercard all star team of 2006 .
two years later , after another impressive tournament at euro 2008 , he was included in the uefa team of the tournament .
this season with bayern , he was also a unanimous selection for dw 's bundesliga best xi .
lahm brings a wealth of experience to the germany team and it 's no surprise that he has been chosen to wear the captain 's armband following michael ballack 's ankle injury .
the bayern defender 's consistency and leadership will be vital to germany 's hopes of returning home from south africa with the world cup .

he 's quick , powerful and capable of turning a game single-handedly , but schweinsteiger has had a reputation for going missing in big matches – not something you want in a central figure in major tournaments .
however this season has seen a new maturity bloom in the player once known as " schweini " - a tag he 's known to dislike and is finally growing out of .
bayern coach lous van gaal has moved him in from the wing to a new role as a holder-playmaker , and it 's planted in that middle ground that schweinsteiger has blossomed .
he is now the player that almost all bayern 's offensive moves pass through , and is one of a rare breed of creative midfielders seems to relish the physical side of the game .

bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger 's performances have made him a fan favorite for bayern and germany heir apparent even before ballack 's injury ruled him out of the world cup , schweinsteiger was beginning to emerge at the germany captain 's most likely successor in his midfield role .
since making his international debut in 2004 , schweinsteiger has become a mainstay of the germany team and has shown his international class in superior performances at euro 2004 and the world cup in 2006 .
schweinsteiger struggled somewhat during germany 's euro 2008 campaign , having earned a suspension after a red card in germany 's second group stage game , a loss to croatia . but when he returned to the line-up against portugal in the quarter-finals , his impact was undeniable .
schweinsteiger scored the opener , and set up headed goals from miroslav klose and ballack with curling free kicks in the side 's eventual 3-2 victory .
in the semi-final germany won over turkey , it was a similar story - it was a schweinsteiger strike that drew the team level after they 'd gone a goal down .
while his primary role in south africa will be to play deep in midfield rather than up front poaching goals , schweinsteriger still knows how to makes dangerous runs and has a wicked shot from distance .
he 's a good luck charm too , it seems .
whenever schweinsteiger scores for germany , they win .

german head coach joachim loew made the full-back captain of the national team in south africa . without analyzing his game , it 's hard to believe that the likely new germany captain philipp lahm has been one of the world 's best full backs for over six years now .
the bayern munich defender just does n't look old enough to have been at the top of the game in his position for that long .
yet he has been an integral player for both club and country since his appearances at euro 2004 first caught the eye .
lahm is not only coveted by the likes of barcelona and manchester united for his prowess in the full back role but also because of his versatility .
as comfortable on the left as on the right , lahm has shown his pace , dribbling and crossing abilities from both flanks .
he has even played as an emergency holding midfielder and left-winger in his career , showing an aptitude for both .
the diminutive defender -lrb- 170cm , or 5 ' 7 " -rrb- is a handful in full gallop , his small stature and low center of gravity making it very hard for opponents to knock him off the ball .

german head coach joachim loew made the full-back captain of the national team in south africa . without analyzing his game , it 's hard to believe that the likely new germany captain philipp lahm has been one of the world 's best full backs for over six years now .
the bayern munich defender just does n't look old enough to have been at the top of the game in his position for that long .
yet he has been an integral player for both club and country since his appearances at euro 2004 first caught the eye .
lahm is not only coveted by the likes of barcelona and manchester united for his prowess in the full back role but also because of his versatility .
as comfortable on the left as on the right , lahm has shown his pace , dribbling and crossing abilities from both flanks .
he has even played as an emergency holding midfielder and left-winger in his career , showing an aptitude for both .
the diminutive defender -lrb- 170cm , or 5 ' 7 " -rrb- is a handful in full gallop , his small stature and low center of gravity making it very hard for opponents to knock him off the ball .
he also packs a powerful shot with his strong right foot , utilized as a potent weapon by both bayern and germany .
bildunterschrift : lahm 's tireless running and tackling has been key to bayern and germany 's success mr. consistency lahm rarely has a bad game for either club or country and has stood out at each international tournament he has played in since making his germany debut in february 2004 .
lahm clearly relishes the biggest of stages .
outstanding campaigns at the european championships in 2004 and 2008 , and a starring role in germany 's 2006 world cup campaign have only added to a reputation cultivated through top-notch domestic service , first with stuttgart and then bayern .
starting the 2006 world cup in style with the opening goal of the tournament , scored with a looping shot against costa rica , lahm went on to become the only german player to play all 690 minutes of the host nation 's campaign .
six months after the tournament , he was nominated for the fifa world player of the year award and was included in the mastercard all star team of 2006 .
two years later , after another impressive tournament at euro 2008 , he was included in the uefa team of the tournament .
this season with bayern , he was also a unanimous selection for dw 's bundesliga best xi .
lahm brings a wealth of experience to the germany team and it 's no surprise that he has been chosen to wear the captain 's armband following michael ballack 's ankle injury .
the bayern defender 's consistency and leadership will be vital to germany 's hopes of returning home from south africa with the world cup .

he 's quick , powerful and capable of turning a game single-handedly , but schweinsteiger has had a reputation for going missing in big matches – not something you want in a central figure in major tournaments .
however this season has seen a new maturity bloom in the player once known as " schweini " - a tag he 's known to dislike and is finally growing out of .
bayern coach lous van gaal has moved him in from the wing to a new role as a holder-playmaker , and it 's planted in that middle ground that schweinsteiger has blossomed .
he is now the player that almost all bayern 's offensive moves pass through , and is one of a rare breed of creative midfielders seems to relish the physical side of the game .
what 's more , schweinsteiger 's new deeper central vantage point has showed his skill at anticiaption and game vision - surprise in a player once though of as somewhat impetuous .
bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger 's performances have made him a fan favorite for bayern and germany heir apparent even before ballack 's injury ruled him out of the world cup , schweinsteiger was beginning to emerge at the germany captain 's most likely successor in his midfield role .
since making his international debut in 2004 , schweinsteiger has become a mainstay of the germany team and has shown his international class in superior performances at euro 2004 and the world cup in 2006 .
schweinsteiger struggled somewhat during germany 's euro 2008 campaign , having earned a suspension after a red card in germany 's second group stage game , a loss to croatia . but when he returned to the line-up against portugal in the quarter-finals , his impact was undeniable .
schweinsteiger scored the opener , and set up headed goals from miroslav klose and ballack with curling free kicks in the side 's eventual 3-2 victory .
in the semi-final germany won over turkey , it was a similar story - it was a schweinsteiger strike that drew the team level after they 'd gone a goal down .
while his primary role in south africa will be to play deep in midfield rather than up front poaching goals , schweinsteriger still knows how to makes dangerous runs and has a wicked shot from distance .
he 's a good luck charm too , it seems .
whenever schweinsteiger scores for germany , they win .

yet he has been an integral player for both club and country since his appearances at euro 2004 first caught the eye .
lahm is not only coveted by the likes of barcelona and manchester united for his prowess in the full back role but also because of his versatility .
as comfortable on the left as on the right , lahm has shown his pace , dribbling and crossing abilities from both flanks .
he has even played as an emergency holding midfielder and left-winger in his career , showing an aptitude for both .
the diminutive defender -lrb- 170cm , or 5 ' 7 " -rrb- is a handful in full gallop , his small stature and low center of gravity making it very hard for opponents to knock him off the ball .
he also packs a powerful shot with his strong right foot , utilized as a potent weapon by both bayern and germany .
bildunterschrift : lahm 's tireless running and tackling has been key to bayern and germany 's success mr. consistency lahm rarely has a bad game for either club or country and has stood out at each international tournament he has played in since making his germany debut in february 2004 .
lahm clearly relishes the biggest of stages .
outstanding campaigns at the european championships in 2004 and 2008 , and a starring role in germany 's 2006 world cup campaign have only added to a reputation cultivated through top-notch domestic service , first with stuttgart and then bayern .
starting the 2006 world cup in style with the opening goal of the tournament , scored with a looping shot against costa rica , lahm went on to become the only german player to play all 690 minutes of the host nation 's campaign .
six months after the tournament , he was nominated for the fifa world player of the year award and was included in the mastercard all star team of 2006 .
two years later , after another impressive tournament at euro 2008 , he was included in the uefa team of the tournament .
this season with bayern , he was also a unanimous selection for dw 's bundesliga best xi .
lahm brings a wealth of experience to the germany team and it 's no surprise that he has been chosen to wear the captain 's armband following michael ballack 's ankle injury .
the bayern defender 's consistency and leadership will be vital to germany 's hopes of returning home from south africa with the world cup .

he 's quick , powerful and capable of turning a game single-handedly , but schweinsteiger has had a reputation for going missing in big matches – not something you want in a central figure in major tournaments .
however this season has seen a new maturity bloom in the player once known as " schweini " - a tag he 's known to dislike and is finally growing out of .
bayern coach lous van gaal has moved him in from the wing to a new role as a holder-playmaker , and it 's planted in that middle ground that schweinsteiger has blossomed .
he is now the player that almost all bayern 's offensive moves pass through , and is one of a rare breed of creative midfielders seems to relish the physical side of the game .
what 's more , schweinsteiger 's new deeper central vantage point has showed his skill at anticiaption and game vision - surprise in a player once though of as somewhat impetuous .
bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger 's performances have made him a fan favorite for bayern and germany heir apparent even before ballack 's injury ruled him out of the world cup , schweinsteiger was beginning to emerge at the germany captain 's most likely successor in his midfield role .
since making his international debut in 2004 , schweinsteiger has become a mainstay of the germany team and has shown his international class in superior performances at euro 2004 and the world cup in 2006 .
schweinsteiger struggled somewhat during germany 's euro 2008 campaign , having earned a suspension after a red card in germany 's second group stage game , a loss to croatia . but when he returned to the line-up against portugal in the quarter-finals , his impact was undeniable .
schweinsteiger scored the opener , and set up headed goals from miroslav klose and ballack with curling free kicks in the side 's eventual 3-2 victory .
in the semi-final germany won over turkey , it was a similar story - it was a schweinsteiger strike that drew the team level after they 'd gone a goal down .
while his primary role in south africa will be to play deep in midfield rather than up front poaching goals , schweinsteriger still knows how to makes dangerous runs and has a wicked shot from distance .
he 's a good luck charm too , it seems .
whenever schweinsteiger scores for germany , they win .

german head coach joachim loew made the full-back captain of the national team in south africa . without analyzing his game , it 's hard to believe that the likely new germany captain philipp lahm has been one of the world 's best full backs for over six years now .
the bayern munich defender just does n't look old enough to have been at the top of the game in his position for that long .
yet he has been an integral player for both club and country since his appearances at euro 2004 first caught the eye .
lahm is not only coveted by the likes of barcelona and manchester united for his prowess in the full back role but also because of his versatility .
as comfortable on the left as on the right , lahm has shown his pace , dribbling and crossing abilities from both flanks .
he has even played as an emergency holding midfielder and left-winger in his career , showing an aptitude for both .
the diminutive defender -lrb- 170cm , or 5 ' 7 " -rrb- is a handful in full gallop , his small stature and low center of gravity making it very hard for opponents to knock him off the ball .
he also packs a powerful shot with his strong right foot , utilized as a potent weapon by both bayern and germany .
bildunterschrift : lahm 's tireless running and tackling has been key to bayern and germany 's success mr. consistency lahm rarely has a bad game for either club or country and has stood out at each international tournament he has played in since making his germany debut in february 2004 .
lahm clearly relishes the biggest of stages .
outstanding campaigns at the european championships in 2004 and 2008 , and a starring role in germany 's 2006 world cup campaign have only added to a reputation cultivated through top-notch domestic service , first with stuttgart and then bayern .
starting the 2006 world cup in style with the opening goal of the tournament , scored with a looping shot against costa rica , lahm went on to become the only german player to play all 690 minutes of the host nation 's campaign .
six months after the tournament , he was nominated for the fifa world player of the year award and was included in the mastercard all star team of 2006 .
two years later , after another impressive tournament at euro 2008 , he was included in the uefa team of the tournament .
this season with bayern , he was also a unanimous selection for dw 's bundesliga best xi .
lahm brings a wealth of experience to the germany team and it 's no surprise that he has been chosen to wear the captain 's armband following michael ballack 's ankle injury .
the bayern defender 's consistency and leadership will be vital to germany 's hopes of returning home from south africa with the world cup .

he 's quick , powerful and capable of turning a game single-handedly , but schweinsteiger has had a reputation for going missing in big matches – not something you want in a central figure in major tournaments .
however this season has seen a new maturity bloom in the player once known as " schweini " - a tag he 's known to dislike and is finally growing out of .
bayern coach lous van gaal has moved him in from the wing to a new role as a holder-playmaker , and it 's planted in that middle ground that schweinsteiger has blossomed .
he is now the player that almost all bayern 's offensive moves pass through , and is one of a rare breed of creative midfielders seems to relish the physical side of the game .

schweinsteiger scored the opener , and set up headed goals from miroslav klose and ballack with curling free kicks in the side 's eventual 3-2 victory .
in the semi-final germany won over turkey , it was a similar story - it was a schweinsteiger strike that drew the team level after they 'd gone a goal down .

he 's quick , powerful and capable of turning a game single-handedly , but schweinsteiger has had a reputation for going missing in big matches – not something you want in a central figure in major tournaments .
however this season has seen a new maturity bloom in the player once known as " schweini " - a tag he 's known to dislike and is finally growing out of .
bayern coach lous van gaal has moved him in from the wing to a new role as a holder-playmaker , and it 's planted in that middle ground that schweinsteiger has blossomed .
he is now the player that almost all bayern 's offensive moves pass through , and is one of a rare breed of creative midfielders seems to relish the physical side of the game .
what 's more , schweinsteiger 's new deeper central vantage point has showed his skill at anticiaption and game vision - surprise in a player once though of as somewhat impetuous .
bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger 's performances have made him a fan favorite for bayern and germany heir apparent even before ballack 's injury ruled him out of the world cup , schweinsteiger was beginning to emerge at the germany captain 's most likely successor in his midfield role .
since making his international debut in 2004 , schweinsteiger has become a mainstay of the germany team and has shown his international class in superior performances at euro 2004 and the world cup in 2006 .
schweinsteiger struggled somewhat during germany 's euro 2008 campaign , having earned a suspension after a red card in germany 's second group stage game , a loss to croatia . but when he returned to the line-up against portugal in the quarter-finals , his impact was undeniable .
schweinsteiger scored the opener , and set up headed goals from miroslav klose and ballack with curling free kicks in the side 's eventual 3-2 victory .
in the semi-final germany won over turkey , it was a similar story - it was a schweinsteiger strike that drew the team level after they 'd gone a goal down .
while his primary role in south africa will be to play deep in midfield rather than up front poaching goals , schweinsteriger still knows how to makes dangerous runs and has a wicked shot from distance .
he 's a good luck charm too , it seems .
whenever schweinsteiger scores for germany , they win .

german head coach joachim loew made the full-back captain of the national team in south africa . without analyzing his game , it 's hard to believe that the likely new germany captain philipp lahm has been one of the world 's best full backs for over six years now .
the bayern munich defender just does n't look old enough to have been at the top of the game in his position for that long .
yet he has been an integral player for both club and country since his appearances at euro 2004 first caught the eye .
lahm is not only coveted by the likes of barcelona and manchester united for his prowess in the full back role but also because of his versatility .
as comfortable on the left as on the right , lahm has shown his pace , dribbling and crossing abilities from both flanks .
he has even played as an emergency holding midfielder and left-winger in his career , showing an aptitude for both .
the diminutive defender -lrb- 170cm , or 5 ' 7 " -rrb- is a handful in full gallop , his small stature and low center of gravity making it very hard for opponents to knock him off the ball .
he also packs a powerful shot with his strong right foot , utilized as a potent weapon by both bayern and germany .
bildunterschrift : lahm 's tireless running and tackling has been key to bayern and germany 's success mr. consistency lahm rarely has a bad game for either club or country and has stood out at each international tournament he has played in since making his germany debut in february 2004 .
lahm clearly relishes the biggest of stages .
outstanding campaigns at the european championships in 2004 and 2008 , and a starring role in germany 's 2006 world cup campaign have only added to a reputation cultivated through top-notch domestic service , first with stuttgart and then bayern .
starting the 2006 world cup in style with the opening goal of the tournament , scored with a looping shot against costa rica , lahm went on to become the only german player to play all 690 minutes of the host nation 's campaign .
six months after the tournament , he was nominated for the fifa world player of the year award and was included in the mastercard all star team of 2006 .
two years later , after another impressive tournament at euro 2008 , he was included in the uefa team of the tournament .
this season with bayern , he was also a unanimous selection for dw 's bundesliga best xi .
lahm brings a wealth of experience to the germany team and it 's no surprise that he has been chosen to wear the captain 's armband following michael ballack 's ankle injury .
the bayern defender 's consistency and leadership will be vital to germany 's hopes of returning home from south africa with the world cup .

he 's quick , powerful and capable of turning a game single-handedly , but schweinsteiger has had a reputation for going missing in big matches – not something you want in a central figure in major tournaments .
however this season has seen a new maturity bloom in the player once known as " schweini " - a tag he 's known to dislike and is finally growing out of .
bayern coach lous van gaal has moved him in from the wing to a new role as a holder-playmaker , and it 's planted in that middle ground that schweinsteiger has blossomed .
he is now the player that almost all bayern 's offensive moves pass through , and is one of a rare breed of creative midfielders seems to relish the physical side of the game .
what 's more , schweinsteiger 's new deeper central vantage point has showed his skill at anticiaption and game vision - surprise in a player once though of as somewhat impetuous .
bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger 's performances have made him a fan favorite for bayern and germany heir apparent even before ballack 's injury ruled him out of the world cup , schweinsteiger was beginning to emerge at the germany captain 's most likely successor in his midfield role .
since making his international debut in 2004 , schweinsteiger has become a mainstay of the germany team and has shown his international class in superior performances at euro 2004 and the world cup in 2006 .
schweinsteiger struggled somewhat during germany 's euro 2008 campaign , having earned a suspension after a red card in germany 's second group stage game , a loss to croatia . but when he returned to the line-up against portugal in the quarter-finals , his impact was undeniable .
schweinsteiger scored the opener , and set up headed goals from miroslav klose and ballack with curling free kicks in the side 's eventual 3-2 victory .
in the semi-final germany won over turkey , it was a similar story - it was a schweinsteiger strike that drew the team level after they 'd gone a goal down .
while his primary role in south africa will be to play deep in midfield rather than up front poaching goals , schweinsteriger still knows how to makes dangerous runs and has a wicked shot from distance .
he 's a good luck charm too , it seems .
whenever schweinsteiger scores for germany , they win .

bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger 's performances have made him a fan favorite for bayern and germany heir apparent even before ballack 's injury ruled him out of the world cup , schweinsteiger was beginning to emerge at the germany captain 's most likely successor in his midfield role .
since making his international debut in 2004 , schweinsteiger has become a mainstay of the germany team and has shown his international class in superior performances at euro 2004 and the world cup in 2006 .
schweinsteiger struggled somewhat during germany 's euro 2008 campaign , having earned a suspension after a red card in germany 's second group stage game , a loss to croatia . but when he returned to the line-up against portugal in the quarter-finals , his impact was undeniable .
schweinsteiger scored the opener , and set up headed goals from miroslav klose and ballack with curling free kicks in the side 's eventual 3-2 victory .
in the semi-final germany won over turkey , it was a similar story - it was a schweinsteiger strike that drew the team level after they 'd gone a goal down .
while his primary role in south africa will be to play deep in midfield rather than up front poaching goals , schweinsteriger still knows how to makes dangerous runs and has a wicked shot from distance .
he 's a good luck charm too , it seems .
whenever schweinsteiger scores for germany , they win .

german head coach joachim loew made the full-back captain of the national team in south africa . without analyzing his game , it 's hard to believe that the likely new germany captain philipp lahm has been one of the world 's best full backs for over six years now .
the bayern munich defender just does n't look old enough to have been at the top of the game in his position for that long .
yet he has been an integral player for both club and country since his appearances at euro 2004 first caught the eye .
lahm is not only coveted by the likes of barcelona and manchester united for his prowess in the full back role but also because of his versatility .
as comfortable on the left as on the right , lahm has shown his pace , dribbling and crossing abilities from both flanks .
he has even played as an emergency holding midfielder and left-winger in his career , showing an aptitude for both .
the diminutive defender -lrb- 170cm , or 5 ' 7 " -rrb- is a handful in full gallop , his small stature and low center of gravity making it very hard for opponents to knock him off the ball .
he also packs a powerful shot with his strong right foot , utilized as a potent weapon by both bayern and germany .
bildunterschrift : lahm 's tireless running and tackling has been key to bayern and germany 's success mr. consistency lahm rarely has a bad game for either club or country and has stood out at each international tournament he has played in since making his germany debut in february 2004 .
lahm clearly relishes the biggest of stages .
outstanding campaigns at the european championships in 2004 and 2008 , and a starring role in germany 's 2006 world cup campaign have only added to a reputation cultivated through top-notch domestic service , first with stuttgart and then bayern .
starting the 2006 world cup in style with the opening goal of the tournament , scored with a looping shot against costa rica , lahm went on to become the only german player to play all 690 minutes of the host nation 's campaign .
six months after the tournament , he was nominated for the fifa world player of the year award and was included in the mastercard all star team of 2006 .
two years later , after another impressive tournament at euro 2008 , he was included in the uefa team of the tournament .
this season with bayern , he was also a unanimous selection for dw 's bundesliga best xi .
lahm brings a wealth of experience to the germany team and it 's no surprise that he has been chosen to wear the captain 's armband following michael ballack 's ankle injury .
the bayern defender 's consistency and leadership will be vital to germany 's hopes of returning home from south africa with the world cup .

at 70kg -lrb- 154 lbs . -rrb- , mesut oezil is not the heavyweight presence to replace michael ballack as germany 's midfield general or media magnet , but he certainly has the skills to bring excitement and creativity to die mannschaft 's 2010 campaign .
the gelsenkirchen-born attacking midfielder with turkish heritage has been among the most consistent flair players on the germany roster in the past couple of years as he has grown into his fledgling role as the team 's creative spark .

but considering he is a player -lrb- albeit a very young , inexperienced one in comparison -rrb- in the mold of kaka or zinedine zidane , loew may want to exploit oezil 's great ball skills , his attacking mentality and vision in germany 's offensive play while leaving the heavy lifting to other midfielders .
germany is still best-known for playing organized , efficient and maybe even a little boring soccer .

german head coach joachim loew made the full-back captain of the national team in south africa . without analyzing his game , it 's hard to believe that the likely new germany captain philipp lahm has been one of the world 's best full backs for over six years now .
the bayern munich defender just does n't look old enough to have been at the top of the game in his position for that long .
yet he has been an integral player for both club and country since his appearances at euro 2004 first caught the eye .
lahm is not only coveted by the likes of barcelona and manchester united for his prowess in the full back role but also because of his versatility .

he 's quick , powerful and capable of turning a game single-handedly , but schweinsteiger has had a reputation for going missing in big matches – not something you want in a central figure in major tournaments .
however this season has seen a new maturity bloom in the player once known as " schweini " - a tag he 's known to dislike and is finally growing out of .
bayern coach lous van gaal has moved him in from the wing to a new role as a holder-playmaker , and it 's planted in that middle ground that schweinsteiger has blossomed .
he is now the player that almost all bayern 's offensive moves pass through , and is one of a rare breed of creative midfielders seems to relish the physical side of the game .

since making his international debut in 2004 , schweinsteiger has become a mainstay of the germany team and has shown his international class in superior performances at euro 2004 and the world cup in 2006 .
schweinsteiger struggled somewhat during germany 's euro 2008 campaign , having earned a suspension after a red card in germany 's second group stage game , a loss to croatia . but when he returned to the line-up against portugal in the quarter-finals , his impact was undeniable .
schweinsteiger scored the opener , and set up headed goals from miroslav klose and ballack with curling free kicks in the side 's eventual 3-2 victory .
in the semi-final germany won over turkey , it was a similar story - it was a schweinsteiger strike that drew the team level after they 'd gone a goal down .
while his primary role in south africa will be to play deep in midfield rather than up front poaching goals , schweinsteriger still knows how to makes dangerous runs and has a wicked shot from distance .
he 's a good luck charm too , it seems .

he 's quick , powerful and capable of turning a game single-handedly , but schweinsteiger has had a reputation for going missing in big matches – not something you want in a central figure in major tournaments .
however this season has seen a new maturity bloom in the player once known as " schweini " - a tag he 's known to dislike and is finally growing out of .
bayern coach lous van gaal has moved him in from the wing to a new role as a holder-playmaker , and it 's planted in that middle ground that schweinsteiger has blossomed .
he is now the player that almost all bayern 's offensive moves pass through , and is one of a rare breed of creative midfielders seems to relish the physical side of the game .
what 's more , schweinsteiger 's new deeper central vantage point has showed his skill at anticiaption and game vision - surprise in a player once though of as somewhat impetuous .
bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger 's performances have made him a fan favorite for bayern and germany heir apparent even before ballack 's injury ruled him out of the world cup , schweinsteiger was beginning to emerge at the germany captain 's most likely successor in his midfield role .
since making his international debut in 2004 , schweinsteiger has become a mainstay of the germany team and has shown his international class in superior performances at euro 2004 and the world cup in 2006 .
schweinsteiger struggled somewhat during germany 's euro 2008 campaign , having earned a suspension after a red card in germany 's second group stage game , a loss to croatia . but when he returned to the line-up against portugal in the quarter-finals , his impact was undeniable .
schweinsteiger scored the opener , and set up headed goals from miroslav klose and ballack with curling free kicks in the side 's eventual 3-2 victory .
in the semi-final germany won over turkey , it was a similar story - it was a schweinsteiger strike that drew the team level after they 'd gone a goal down .
while his primary role in south africa will be to play deep in midfield rather than up front poaching goals , schweinsteriger still knows how to makes dangerous runs and has a wicked shot from distance .
he 's a good luck charm too , it seems .
whenever schweinsteiger scores for germany , they win .

german head coach joachim loew made the full-back captain of the national team in south africa . without analyzing his game , it 's hard to believe that the likely new germany captain philipp lahm has been one of the world 's best full backs for over six years now .
the bayern munich defender just does n't look old enough to have been at the top of the game in his position for that long .
yet he has been an integral player for both club and country since his appearances at euro 2004 first caught the eye .
lahm is not only coveted by the likes of barcelona and manchester united for his prowess in the full back role but also because of his versatility .
as comfortable on the left as on the right , lahm has shown his pace , dribbling and crossing abilities from both flanks .
he has even played as an emergency holding midfielder and left-winger in his career , showing an aptitude for both .
the diminutive defender -lrb- 170cm , or 5 ' 7 " -rrb- is a handful in full gallop , his small stature and low center of gravity making it very hard for opponents to knock him off the ball .
he also packs a powerful shot with his strong right foot , utilized as a potent weapon by both bayern and germany .
bildunterschrift : lahm 's tireless running and tackling has been key to bayern and germany 's success mr. consistency lahm rarely has a bad game for either club or country and has stood out at each international tournament he has played in since making his germany debut in february 2004 .
lahm clearly relishes the biggest of stages .
outstanding campaigns at the european championships in 2004 and 2008 , and a starring role in germany 's 2006 world cup campaign have only added to a reputation cultivated through top-notch domestic service , first with stuttgart and then bayern .
starting the 2006 world cup in style with the opening goal of the tournament , scored with a looping shot against costa rica , lahm went on to become the only german player to play all 690 minutes of the host nation 's campaign .
six months after the tournament , he was nominated for the fifa world player of the year award and was included in the mastercard all star team of 2006 .
two years later , after another impressive tournament at euro 2008 , he was included in the uefa team of the tournament .
this season with bayern , he was also a unanimous selection for dw 's bundesliga best xi .
lahm brings a wealth of experience to the germany team and it 's no surprise that he has been chosen to wear the captain 's armband following michael ballack 's ankle injury .
the bayern defender 's consistency and leadership will be vital to germany 's hopes of returning home from south africa with the world cup .

he is now the player that almost all bayern 's offensive moves pass through , and is one of a rare breed of creative midfielders seems to relish the physical side of the game .
what 's more , schweinsteiger 's new deeper central vantage point has showed his skill at anticiaption and game vision - surprise in a player once though of as somewhat impetuous .
bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger 's performances have made him a fan favorite for bayern and germany heir apparent even before ballack 's injury ruled him out of the world cup , schweinsteiger was beginning to emerge at the germany captain 's most likely successor in his midfield role .
since making his international debut in 2004 , schweinsteiger has become a mainstay of the germany team and has shown his international class in superior performances at euro 2004 and the world cup in 2006 .
schweinsteiger struggled somewhat during germany 's euro 2008 campaign , having earned a suspension after a red card in germany 's second group stage game , a loss to croatia . but when he returned to the line-up against portugal in the quarter-finals , his impact was undeniable .
schweinsteiger scored the opener , and set up headed goals from miroslav klose and ballack with curling free kicks in the side 's eventual 3-2 victory .
in the semi-final germany won over turkey , it was a similar story - it was a schweinsteiger strike that drew the team level after they 'd gone a goal down .
while his primary role in south africa will be to play deep in midfield rather than up front poaching goals , schweinsteriger still knows how to makes dangerous runs and has a wicked shot from distance .
he 's a good luck charm too , it seems .
whenever schweinsteiger scores for germany , they win .

german head coach joachim loew made the full-back captain of the national team in south africa . without analyzing his game , it 's hard to believe that the likely new germany captain philipp lahm has been one of the world 's best full backs for over six years now .
the bayern munich defender just does n't look old enough to have been at the top of the game in his position for that long .
yet he has been an integral player for both club and country since his appearances at euro 2004 first caught the eye .
lahm is not only coveted by the likes of barcelona and manchester united for his prowess in the full back role but also because of his versatility .
as comfortable on the left as on the right , lahm has shown his pace , dribbling and crossing abilities from both flanks .
he has even played as an emergency holding midfielder and left-winger in his career , showing an aptitude for both .
the diminutive defender -lrb- 170cm , or 5 ' 7 " -rrb- is a handful in full gallop , his small stature and low center of gravity making it very hard for opponents to knock him off the ball .
he also packs a powerful shot with his strong right foot , utilized as a potent weapon by both bayern and germany .
bildunterschrift : lahm 's tireless running and tackling has been key to bayern and germany 's success mr. consistency lahm rarely has a bad game for either club or country and has stood out at each international tournament he has played in since making his germany debut in february 2004 .
lahm clearly relishes the biggest of stages .
outstanding campaigns at the european championships in 2004 and 2008 , and a starring role in germany 's 2006 world cup campaign have only added to a reputation cultivated through top-notch domestic service , first with stuttgart and then bayern .
starting the 2006 world cup in style with the opening goal of the tournament , scored with a looping shot against costa rica , lahm went on to become the only german player to play all 690 minutes of the host nation 's campaign .
six months after the tournament , he was nominated for the fifa world player of the year award and was included in the mastercard all star team of 2006 .
two years later , after another impressive tournament at euro 2008 , he was included in the uefa team of the tournament .
this season with bayern , he was also a unanimous selection for dw 's bundesliga best xi .
lahm brings a wealth of experience to the germany team and it 's no surprise that he has been chosen to wear the captain 's armband following michael ballack 's ankle injury .
the bayern defender 's consistency and leadership will be vital to germany 's hopes of returning home from south africa with the world cup .

at 70kg -lrb- 154 lbs . -rrb- , mesut oezil is not the heavyweight presence to replace michael ballack as germany 's midfield general or media magnet , but he certainly has the skills to bring excitement and creativity to die mannschaft 's 2010 campaign .
the gelsenkirchen-born attacking midfielder with turkish heritage has been among the most consistent flair players on the germany roster in the past couple of years as he has grown into his fledgling role as the team 's creative spark .
germany 's world cup qualifying campaign had already wound down by the time oezil really began making his mark in the bundesliga with werder bremen , so the world cup will be oezil 's international coming out party for many a spectator .

in the last two seasons with bremen he 's racked up 12 goals and a gaudy 29 assists . just how effective he is as a box-to-box midfielder remains to be seen - and with germany without enforcers such as ballack , thorsten frings and thomas hitzlsperger , the livewire oezil may be required to track back more than he 's used to .
but considering he is a player -lrb- albeit a very young , inexperienced one in comparison -rrb- in the mold of kaka or zinedine zidane , loew may want to exploit oezil 's great ball skills , his attacking mentality and vision in germany 's offensive play while leaving the heavy lifting to other midfielders .
germany is still best-known for playing organized , efficient and maybe even a little boring soccer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 13.06.2010 philipp lahm : germany 's little giant is now its team captain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm is a defending and attacking force for germany bayern munich defender philipp lahm has added another line to his long international cv this summer .
german head coach joachim loew made the full-back captain of the national team in south africa . without analyzing his game , it 's hard to believe that the likely new germany captain philipp lahm has been one of the world 's best full backs for over six years now .
the bayern munich defender just does n't look old enough to have been at the top of the game in his position for that long .
yet he has been an integral player for both club and country since his appearances at euro 2004 first caught the eye .
lahm is not only coveted by the likes of barcelona and manchester united for his prowess in the full back role but also because of his versatility .
as comfortable on the left as on the right , lahm has shown his pace , dribbling and crossing abilities from both flanks .
he has even played as an emergency holding midfielder and left-winger in his career , showing an aptitude for both .
the diminutive defender -lrb- 170cm , or 5 ' 7 " -rrb- is a handful in full gallop , his small stature and low center of gravity making it very hard for opponents to knock him off the ball .
he also packs a powerful shot with his strong right foot , utilized as a potent weapon by both bayern and germany .
bildunterschrift : lahm 's tireless running and tackling has been key to bayern and germany 's success mr. consistency lahm rarely has a bad game for either club or country and has stood out at each international tournament he has played in since making his germany debut in february 2004 .
lahm clearly relishes the biggest of stages .
outstanding campaigns at the european championships in 2004 and 2008 , and a starring role in germany 's 2006 world cup campaign have only added to a reputation cultivated through top-notch domestic service , first with stuttgart and then bayern .
starting the 2006 world cup in style with the opening goal of the tournament , scored with a looping shot against costa rica , lahm went on to become the only german player to play all 690 minutes of the host nation 's campaign .
six months after the tournament , he was nominated for the fifa world player of the year award and was included in the mastercard all star team of 2006 .
two years later , after another impressive tournament at euro 2008 , he was included in the uefa team of the tournament .
this season with bayern , he was also a unanimous selection for dw 's bundesliga best xi .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 13.06.2010 philipp lahm : germany 's little giant is now its team captain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm is a defending and attacking force for germany bayern munich defender philipp lahm has added another line to his long international cv this summer .
german head coach joachim loew made the full-back captain of the national team in south africa . without analyzing his game , it 's hard to believe that the likely new germany captain philipp lahm has been one of the world 's best full backs for over six years now .
the bayern munich defender just does n't look old enough to have been at the top of the game in his position for that long .
yet he has been an integral player for both club and country since his appearances at euro 2004 first caught the eye .
lahm is not only coveted by the likes of barcelona and manchester united for his prowess in the full back role but also because of his versatility .
as comfortable on the left as on the right , lahm has shown his pace , dribbling and crossing abilities from both flanks .
he has even played as an emergency holding midfielder and left-winger in his career , showing an aptitude for both .
the diminutive defender -lrb- 170cm , or 5 ' 7 " -rrb- is a handful in full gallop , his small stature and low center of gravity making it very hard for opponents to knock him off the ball .
he also packs a powerful shot with his strong right foot , utilized as a potent weapon by both bayern and germany .
bildunterschrift : lahm 's tireless running and tackling has been key to bayern and germany 's success mr. consistency lahm rarely has a bad game for either club or country and has stood out at each international tournament he has played in since making his germany debut in february 2004 .
lahm clearly relishes the biggest of stages .
outstanding campaigns at the european championships in 2004 and 2008 , and a starring role in germany 's 2006 world cup campaign have only added to a reputation cultivated through top-notch domestic service , first with stuttgart and then bayern .
starting the 2006 world cup in style with the opening goal of the tournament , scored with a looping shot against costa rica , lahm went on to become the only german player to play all 690 minutes of the host nation 's campaign .
six months after the tournament , he was nominated for the fifa world player of the year award and was included in the mastercard all star team of 2006 .
two years later , after another impressive tournament at euro 2008 , he was included in the uefa team of the tournament .
this season with bayern , he was also a unanimous selection for dw 's bundesliga best xi .
lahm brings a wealth of experience to the germany team and it 's no surprise that he has been chosen to wear the captain 's armband following michael ballack 's ankle injury .
the bayern defender 's consistency and leadership will be vital to germany 's hopes of returning home from south africa with the world cup .

he 's quick , powerful and capable of turning a game single-handedly , but schweinsteiger has had a reputation for going missing in big matches – not something you want in a central figure in major tournaments .
however this season has seen a new maturity bloom in the player once known as " schweini " - a tag he 's known to dislike and is finally growing out of .
bayern coach lous van gaal has moved him in from the wing to a new role as a holder-playmaker , and it 's planted in that middle ground that schweinsteiger has blossomed .
he is now the player that almost all bayern 's offensive moves pass through , and is one of a rare breed of creative midfielders seems to relish the physical side of the game .
what 's more , schweinsteiger 's new deeper central vantage point has showed his skill at anticiaption and game vision - surprise in a player once though of as somewhat impetuous .
bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger 's performances have made him a fan favorite for bayern and germany heir apparent even before ballack 's injury ruled him out of the world cup , schweinsteiger was beginning to emerge at the germany captain 's most likely successor in his midfield role .
since making his international debut in 2004 , schweinsteiger has become a mainstay of the germany team and has shown his international class in superior performances at euro 2004 and the world cup in 2006 .
schweinsteiger struggled somewhat during germany 's euro 2008 campaign , having earned a suspension after a red card in germany 's second group stage game , a loss to croatia . but when he returned to the line-up against portugal in the quarter-finals , his impact was undeniable .
schweinsteiger scored the opener , and set up headed goals from miroslav klose and ballack with curling free kicks in the side 's eventual 3-2 victory .
in the semi-final germany won over turkey , it was a similar story - it was a schweinsteiger strike that drew the team level after they 'd gone a goal down .
while his primary role in south africa will be to play deep in midfield rather than up front poaching goals , schweinsteriger still knows how to makes dangerous runs and has a wicked shot from distance .
he 's a good luck charm too , it seems .
whenever schweinsteiger scores for germany , they win .

bayern coach lous van gaal has moved him in from the wing to a new role as a holder-playmaker , and it 's planted in that middle ground that schweinsteiger has blossomed .
he is now the player that almost all bayern 's offensive moves pass through , and is one of a rare breed of creative midfielders seems to relish the physical side of the game .
what 's more , schweinsteiger 's new deeper central vantage point has showed his skill at anticiaption and game vision - surprise in a player once though of as somewhat impetuous .
bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger 's performances have made him a fan favorite for bayern and germany heir apparent even before ballack 's injury ruled him out of the world cup , schweinsteiger was beginning to emerge at the germany captain 's most likely successor in his midfield role .
since making his international debut in 2004 , schweinsteiger has become a mainstay of the germany team and has shown his international class in superior performances at euro 2004 and the world cup in 2006 .
schweinsteiger struggled somewhat during germany 's euro 2008 campaign , having earned a suspension after a red card in germany 's second group stage game , a loss to croatia . but when he returned to the line-up against portugal in the quarter-finals , his impact was undeniable .
schweinsteiger scored the opener , and set up headed goals from miroslav klose and ballack with curling free kicks in the side 's eventual 3-2 victory .
in the semi-final germany won over turkey , it was a similar story - it was a schweinsteiger strike that drew the team level after they 'd gone a goal down .
while his primary role in south africa will be to play deep in midfield rather than up front poaching goals , schweinsteriger still knows how to makes dangerous runs and has a wicked shot from distance .
he 's a good luck charm too , it seems .

german head coach joachim loew made the full-back captain of the national team in south africa . without analyzing his game , it 's hard to believe that the likely new germany captain philipp lahm has been one of the world 's best full backs for over six years now .
the bayern munich defender just does n't look old enough to have been at the top of the game in his position for that long .
yet he has been an integral player for both club and country since his appearances at euro 2004 first caught the eye .
lahm is not only coveted by the likes of barcelona and manchester united for his prowess in the full back role but also because of his versatility .
as comfortable on the left as on the right , lahm has shown his pace , dribbling and crossing abilities from both flanks .
he has even played as an emergency holding midfielder and left-winger in his career , showing an aptitude for both .
the diminutive defender -lrb- 170cm , or 5 ' 7 " -rrb- is a handful in full gallop , his small stature and low center of gravity making it very hard for opponents to knock him off the ball .
he also packs a powerful shot with his strong right foot , utilized as a potent weapon by both bayern and germany .
bildunterschrift : lahm 's tireless running and tackling has been key to bayern and germany 's success mr. consistency lahm rarely has a bad game for either club or country and has stood out at each international tournament he has played in since making his germany debut in february 2004 .
lahm clearly relishes the biggest of stages .
outstanding campaigns at the european championships in 2004 and 2008 , and a starring role in germany 's 2006 world cup campaign have only added to a reputation cultivated through top-notch domestic service , first with stuttgart and then bayern .
starting the 2006 world cup in style with the opening goal of the tournament , scored with a looping shot against costa rica , lahm went on to become the only german player to play all 690 minutes of the host nation 's campaign .
six months after the tournament , he was nominated for the fifa world player of the year award and was included in the mastercard all star team of 2006 .
two years later , after another impressive tournament at euro 2008 , he was included in the uefa team of the tournament .
this season with bayern , he was also a unanimous selection for dw 's bundesliga best xi .
lahm brings a wealth of experience to the germany team and it 's no surprise that he has been chosen to wear the captain 's armband following michael ballack 's ankle injury .
the bayern defender 's consistency and leadership will be vital to germany 's hopes of returning home from south africa with the world cup .

german head coach joachim loew made the full-back captain of the national team in south africa . without analyzing his game , it 's hard to believe that the likely new germany captain philipp lahm has been one of the world 's best full backs for over six years now .
the bayern munich defender just does n't look old enough to have been at the top of the game in his position for that long .
yet he has been an integral player for both club and country since his appearances at euro 2004 first caught the eye .
lahm is not only coveted by the likes of barcelona and manchester united for his prowess in the full back role but also because of his versatility .
as comfortable on the left as on the right , lahm has shown his pace , dribbling and crossing abilities from both flanks .
he has even played as an emergency holding midfielder and left-winger in his career , showing an aptitude for both .
the diminutive defender -lrb- 170cm , or 5 ' 7 " -rrb- is a handful in full gallop , his small stature and low center of gravity making it very hard for opponents to knock him off the ball .
he also packs a powerful shot with his strong right foot , utilized as a potent weapon by both bayern and germany .
bildunterschrift : lahm 's tireless running and tackling has been key to bayern and germany 's success mr. consistency lahm rarely has a bad game for either club or country and has stood out at each international tournament he has played in since making his germany debut in february 2004 .
lahm clearly relishes the biggest of stages .
outstanding campaigns at the european championships in 2004 and 2008 , and a starring role in germany 's 2006 world cup campaign have only added to a reputation cultivated through top-notch domestic service , first with stuttgart and then bayern .
starting the 2006 world cup in style with the opening goal of the tournament , scored with a looping shot against costa rica , lahm went on to become the only german player to play all 690 minutes of the host nation 's campaign .
six months after the tournament , he was nominated for the fifa world player of the year award and was included in the mastercard all star team of 2006 .
two years later , after another impressive tournament at euro 2008 , he was included in the uefa team of the tournament .
this season with bayern , he was also a unanimous selection for dw 's bundesliga best xi .
lahm brings a wealth of experience to the germany team and it 's no surprise that he has been chosen to wear the captain 's armband following michael ballack 's ankle injury .
the bayern defender 's consistency and leadership will be vital to germany 's hopes of returning home from south africa with the world cup .

the gelsenkirchen-born attacking midfielder with turkish heritage has been among the most consistent flair players on the germany roster in the past couple of years as he has grown into his fledgling role as the team 's creative spark .

germany is still best-known for playing organized , efficient and maybe even a little boring soccer .

in the last two seasons with bremen he 's racked up 12 goals and a gaudy 29 assists . just how effective he is as a box-to-box midfielder remains to be seen - and with germany without enforcers such as ballack , thorsten frings and thomas hitzlsperger , the livewire oezil may be required to track back more than he 's used to .
but considering he is a player -lrb- albeit a very young , inexperienced one in comparison -rrb- in the mold of kaka or zinedine zidane , loew may want to exploit oezil 's great ball skills , his attacking mentality and vision in germany 's offensive play while leaving the heavy lifting to other midfielders .
germany is still best-known for playing organized , efficient and maybe even a little boring soccer .
but mesut oezil 's potentially electrifying play at the world cup could yet re-make germany 's image .

and it 's no fluke either . of the 23 players representing germany at the world cup , 11 have foreign backgrounds .
more than half of the outfield players selected by joachim loew were either born outside germany themselves , or have a non-german parent .
the squad has roots in eight different countries - nine when germany 's included . the role of sport in incorporating ethnic minorities into society is one of the olympic movement 's central leitmotifs . " sport is a fantastic instrument of social integration , " said jacques rogge , president of the international olympic committee , at a recent lecture in darmstadt . germany 's favorite sport is a working-class game , but not exclusively so .
soccer is cheap to take up but promises great riches at the top , and so offers the chance to advance and climb the social ladder .
these opportunities are keenly seized by youngsters from lower-earning , ethnically-diverse backgrounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the national team is redefining what it means to be german according to the most up-to-date figures from the federal statistics office , one in five people living in germany in 2008 was of foreign descent .
from the total of 15.9 million with roots abroad , 2.9 million were from turkey .
two likely starters for the national team at the world cup - serdar tasci and mesut oezil - both have turkish parents .
" a gift for german football , " was how joachim loew described oezil . it works both ways .
the sport plays a leading role in a successfully multicultural society today .
germany hopes to reap the rewards with its ethnically-diverse team on the pitch in south africa . helmut from sau paulo lukas podolski , miroslav klose and piotr trochowski were born in poland , and moved across the border as children .
all have been part of germany 's international set-up for years .
youngster marko marin was born in war-struck bosnia-herzegovina .
his parents moved to frankfurt when he was two , and , when he came of age , marin decided on a german passport .
mario gomez was born in baden-wuerttemberg , but his father comes from spain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cacau had to work his way to the top of german football gomez is likely to miss out on a place in germany 's attack , in favor of an in-form brazilian-born striker nicknamed " helmut . "
more commonly known as cacau , he was born in sao paulo province , and moved to german lower-league football ten years ago .
he gradually rose through the ranks to become a bundesliga winner with stuttgart in 2007 .
he 's just extended his contract at the club until 2013 . cacau became a german citizen in 2009 , and the call from joachim loew came quickly .
" i am glad that germany has adopted me , " he said .
" my whole mindset is german . " " never mind where you come from " the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is not afraid of celebrating its eclectic new generation of players .
since 2007 , the dfb and its general sponsor mercedes-benz have given an integration prize under the label " football : many cultures - but a single passion . "
they also put on a spectrum of projects and activities to promote the integration of youngsters from different backgrounds into society , both by playing soccer and using it as an example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira completes a trio of players with african roots but an impression of a complete acceptance of ethnic diversity in german soccer would not be fair .
far-right groups were reprimanded in court for racist publications attacking black german national players gerald asamoah and patrick owomoyela only four years ago , in the build-up to germany 's world cup . included in germany 's 2010 squad are dennis aogo , whose father is nigerian , and jerome boateng , born in berlin to a ghanaian father .
sami khedira is set to play an important role after captain michael ballack was ruled out through injury .
ballack was notable for being born in the former east germany when he made his national team debut in 1999 .
his replacement has a tunisian father , and is well-versed on the collective goals of a diverse group of players . " we are a team , " says khedira .

at 70kg -lrb- 154 lbs . -rrb- , mesut oezil is not the heavyweight presence to replace michael ballack as germany 's midfield general or media magnet , but he certainly has the skills to bring excitement and creativity to die mannschaft 's 2010 campaign .
the gelsenkirchen-born attacking midfielder with turkish heritage has been among the most consistent flair players on the germany roster in the past couple of years as he has grown into his fledgling role as the team 's creative spark .
germany 's world cup qualifying campaign had already wound down by the time oezil really began making his mark in the bundesliga with werder bremen , so the world cup will be oezil 's international coming out party for many a spectator .
bildunterschrift : oezil 's creative spark and incisive vision should be harnessed to make germany an attacking threat versatile weapon a player of intelligence as well as speed , oezil is a proficient dribbler , a canny passer and a proven midfield goal-scorer .
in the last two seasons with bremen he 's racked up 12 goals and a gaudy 29 assists . just how effective he is as a box-to-box midfielder remains to be seen - and with germany without enforcers such as ballack , thorsten frings and thomas hitzlsperger , the livewire oezil may be required to track back more than he 's used to .
but considering he is a player -lrb- albeit a very young , inexperienced one in comparison -rrb- in the mold of kaka or zinedine zidane , loew may want to exploit oezil 's great ball skills , his attacking mentality and vision in germany 's offensive play while leaving the heavy lifting to other midfielders .
germany is still best-known for playing organized , efficient and maybe even a little boring soccer .
but mesut oezil 's potentially electrifying play at the world cup could yet re-make germany 's image .

german head coach joachim loew made the full-back captain of the national team in south africa . without analyzing his game , it 's hard to believe that the likely new germany captain philipp lahm has been one of the world 's best full backs for over six years now .
the bayern munich defender just does n't look old enough to have been at the top of the game in his position for that long .
yet he has been an integral player for both club and country since his appearances at euro 2004 first caught the eye .
lahm is not only coveted by the likes of barcelona and manchester united for his prowess in the full back role but also because of his versatility .
as comfortable on the left as on the right , lahm has shown his pace , dribbling and crossing abilities from both flanks .
he has even played as an emergency holding midfielder and left-winger in his career , showing an aptitude for both .
the diminutive defender -lrb- 170cm , or 5 ' 7 " -rrb- is a handful in full gallop , his small stature and low center of gravity making it very hard for opponents to knock him off the ball .
he also packs a powerful shot with his strong right foot , utilized as a potent weapon by both bayern and germany .
bildunterschrift : lahm 's tireless running and tackling has been key to bayern and germany 's success mr. consistency lahm rarely has a bad game for either club or country and has stood out at each international tournament he has played in since making his germany debut in february 2004 .
lahm clearly relishes the biggest of stages .
outstanding campaigns at the european championships in 2004 and 2008 , and a starring role in germany 's 2006 world cup campaign have only added to a reputation cultivated through top-notch domestic service , first with stuttgart and then bayern .
starting the 2006 world cup in style with the opening goal of the tournament , scored with a looping shot against costa rica , lahm went on to become the only german player to play all 690 minutes of the host nation 's campaign .
six months after the tournament , he was nominated for the fifa world player of the year award and was included in the mastercard all star team of 2006 .
two years later , after another impressive tournament at euro 2008 , he was included in the uefa team of the tournament .
this season with bayern , he was also a unanimous selection for dw 's bundesliga best xi .
lahm brings a wealth of experience to the germany team and it 's no surprise that he has been chosen to wear the captain 's armband following michael ballack 's ankle injury .
the bayern defender 's consistency and leadership will be vital to germany 's hopes of returning home from south africa with the world cup .

a majority of germans think her ruling center-right coalition will not last . german chancellor angela merkel reprimanded members of her center-right governing coalition on sunday , calling on them to end their public dispute in order to win back voter trust . insults have been flying back and forth within merkel 's coalition government , exposing a level of vitriol usually seen in exchanges between the government and the opposition , not among members on the same team .
the tenor has forced the german chancellor to speak out to maintain discipline as talk of a coalition on the skids and even new elections fill the air . " we have to show people that we can be relied upon at this difficult time , " she said in an interview in the weekly bild am sonntag newspaper .
" that 's the only way to win back trust . " strong differences of opinion on policy have emerged within merkel 's coalition of conservatives and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on a variety of issues and sharp tongues have not been held . a government spokesman was forced to deny reports that merkel 's chief of staff had described defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg as " rumpelstiltskin , " a fairy tale dwarf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center-right coalition has been plagued by infighting an fdp lawmaker accused bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- of acting like a destructive " wild sow " over health-reform plans .
a senior csu politician retaliated , calling the fdp a " bunch of clowns . " in an uncharacteristically direct appeal , merkel urged her colleagues to restrain themselves . " i assume those involved realize that this behavior is not acceptable , " she said in the bild am sonntag . " this should not and will not set a precedent . " merkel denied that her authority as chancellor has suffered because of the row . polls show drop in confidence but the infighting has caused some experts to predict the downfall of merkel 's coalition government . " the current level of conflict between the conservatives and fdp certainly goes beyond what is normal and some commentators have started to question the stability of the government , " goldman sachs economist dirk schumacher told the reuters news agency . more than half of german citizens do not expect merkel 's coalition government to survive for the next three years .
according to a survey for the bild am sonntag paper , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the coalition would collapse before the end of its legislative period . a survey conducted for the german broadcaster ard also showed that only 40 percent of germans expect the coalition to last its full term . merkel is under pressure to seize the political initiative and boost her party 's support , which is languishing at four-year lows according to recent polls . all eyes on the presidential election the is one immediate hurdle that analysts say merkel must overcome to ensure her coalition 's future .
she faces an unexpected battle to get christian wulff , the conservative leader of the state lower saxony , elected president on june 30 by the federal council , a 1,200-strong body convened to elect the head of state .
the previous president , horst koehler , resigned suddenly last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coalition hopes are pinned on presidential candidate christian wulff the candidate put forward by the opposition social democrats and greens , joachim gauck , poses a strong challenge and is being widely praised in the german media as the better choice . some provincial leaders of the fdp have even suggested they might try to obstruct wulff 's election if merkel tries to raise taxes on the wealthy . " the failure of chancellor merkel 's candidate wulff to get a majority could easily be the beginning of the end of the coalition , " said schumacher . author : joanna impey -lrb- apn / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

max goeldi was at the center of a diplomatic spat between the two countries , which have now signed an agreement to cool tensions . after spending almost two years in a libyan jail for visa offenses , swiss businessman max goeldi is heading back home to switzerland .
it will be the end , many hope , of a fierce diplomatic dispute between bern and tripoli .
goeldi was released from the prison three days ago , and swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey has confirmed that he will be leaving libya sunday .
the conflict dates back to the arrest of a son of libyan leader moammar gadhafi .
the son , hannibal , was arrested for allegedly beating his domestic servants in geneva in july 2008 .
the charges against him were later dropped , but it was the start of a row that the two countries now hope to put behind them .
a few days after hannibal 's arrest , goeldi was detained and not allowed to leave libya .
goeldi has spent the last four months in prison after being convicted of violating immigration rules .
the situation has hurt relations between switzerland and libya , but the two nations have now signed what calmy-rey calls an " action plan " to help repair diplomatic ties .
" goeldi will return to switzerland and this is the start of the normalization of relations between the two countries , " she said .
the price for goeldi 's return home appeared to be a swiss apology for the publication of a leaked police photo of hannibal gadhafi taken while he was under arrest .
libya says the leak was an invasion of his privacy and hurt his reputation .
the swiss foreign minister said her country acknowledged the publication was unlawful , gave an apology and promised to pay hannibal gadhafi compensation if a criminal investigation fails to find who was responsible for the leak .
spain , which currently holds the european union 's rotating presidency , was part of the negotiations in tripoli and the agreement was also signed by a german mediator .

casual observers and hardcore german soccer fans were all curious as to how germany 2010 would be set up and whether the promise of exciting , offensive football would just be a smokescreen for a return to the safe , traditional approach of old . this was the first test for the youthful germans in world cup battle proper , pitting the second youngest team at this world cup - after group d opponents ghana - against the oldest in durban 's impressive moses mabhida stadium .
the hugely experienced australians were expected to provide a stern test for this new breed and no-one would have blamed joachim loew for going with a cautious approach in germany 's opening game . instead , the germany coach threw holger badstuber into his back four , sami khedira into the empty midfield shoes of the absent michael ballack while the exciting creative duo of mesut oezil and thomas mueller were charged with opening up the australian defense .

nevertheless , the ' socceroos ' still hope to take points off germany on sunday . in germany in 2006 , australia was playing in its first world cup in 32 years and was able to draw upon the hype and euphoria associated with finally breaking such a long drought .
the team was young and represented a genuine surprise package in the tournament - and surprise they did , reaching the round of 16 and losing in controversial circumstances to eventual champions italy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injury has kept kewell from training ahead of the cup but with a starting xi nearly identical to the one that overwhelmed japan 3-1 in the opening match of 2006 , many pundits are wondering whether australia is now four years more experienced , or just four years slower .
the first xi in south africa is expected to mirror the 2006 equivalent , with the exception of striker mark viduka , who has n't played international football since 2007 .
the team played exciting football in 2006 , but the 2010 version of the " socceroos " has not evolved , and there are fears the unit now lacks that crucial blend of youth and experience , of pace and steadiness .
worries galore significant injury clouds have hung over key attacking players harry kewell , who plays his club football at galatasaray , and midfielder brett emerton of blackburn rovers - both of whom only resumed training with the national squad a week before their group d opener against germany .
the likes of midfielders vince grella , also of blackburn , and mark bresciano , whose palermo contract has just expired , have also battled injury in recent months and have played limited first-team football in their respective leagues .
defender craig moore , formerly of glasgow rangers , is also without a club - and at the age of 34 has been fending off concerns he may have lost the speed necessary to match it with the likes of a bastian schweinsteiger , marko marin or mesut oezil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socceroos captain neill is a rock in defense at the back , australia 's great hope lies with veteran goalkeeper mark schwarzer , who , at the age of 37 , has returned to career-best form with europa league finalists fulham .
captain lucas neill is also still considered a rock in defense , but endured an up-and-down season himself , switching from everton to galatasaray in january .
national coach dutchman pim verbeek has sought to dispel the concerns over injuries and lack of game time , insisting a week out from australia 's clash with germany that all his players were now fit and ready to take on the world .
defensive unit but it remains to be seen whether this will equate to match fitness , and whether the socceroos will be in-tune enough to keep up with a youthful germany team displaying at times a mesmerizing brand of attacking football .
moreover , the socceroos are being billed as a team that will offer little in the way of genuine attacking threats of their own , instead presenting themselves as a difficult team to break down in their defensive third - and indeed verbeek 's preferred 4-2-3-1 formation attests to this .
several attack-minded teams play 4-2-3-1 , of course - germany and brazil to name but two - but australia has often lacked the speed and technical proficiency to use the formation in the same way they do .
in its world cup warm-up matches the socceroos struggled to shift the ball quickly enough from the back , through the midfield and up to the lone striker in order to effectively hit teams on the counter-attack .
australia can boast a highly organized team , though no more than most other countries that made it to south africa .
at this level , possessing a tight , well-organized team is the lowest common denominator .
happily underdogs so what does australia have going in its favor ?
the first two words that come to mind are tim cahill , who has enjoyed a solid season with his club everton , and who is without doubt the socceroos ' primary attacking threat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cahill is one aussie making the germans nervous despite his height , or lack thereof , cahill is remarkably good with his head , and has a knack for slipping into the right place at the right time .
he 'll certainly be a handful for the german defense , with national team defender per mertesacker commenting recently that cahill was " one of australia 's most dangerous players and will be their midfield maestro . "
luke wilkshire of dynamo moscow will also be one to keep an eye on .
wilkshire 's crosses and free kicks from the right were a source of several goals during world cup qualifying for the likes of beanpole striker joshua kennedy .
also in australia 's corner will be the knowledge that they 've been written off as also-rans by the other two teams in group d , serbia and ghana .
ghana midfielder sulley muntari commented as recently as thursday that his team would be focusing its attention on games against serbia and germany , with victory against australia all but considered a fait accompli .
this perceived dismissiveness will undoubtedly work in the socceroos ' favor .
never lie down australians see as central to their sporting mentality the ability to rise to an occasion , to thrive against all odds .
australians love an underdog and cherish a squad full of fierce competitors .
australia is also a young country , and sporting success is a big part of its national mythology .
they do n't give up without a fight .
australia is also known as a physical team , with the national squad having been subject to a fitness regime many in the socceroos camp feel is superior to those of other countries .
lucas neill may have stated recently that australia would be happy with a draw against the much-fancied germans come sunday , but do n't take this to mean the socceroos feel they do n't have a chance .
' ' -lsb- germany 's -rsb- record suggests they are the most consistent team in world football , and the pressure is on them to win , " neill said earlier in the week .
" nobody in the world , apart from our team , expects us to beat them .
if we manage to win , we will shock the world . "

during a 30-minute telephone conversation , obama , who said last week he wants to know " whose ass to kick " , reaffirmed america 's " deep commitment to the special and historic relationship " between the us and the uk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron has been under pressure to defend bp but , obama also made it clear that he expects bp to pay for the clean-up costs and meet economic claims from the spill .
bp under pressure cameron , who described the conversation as " warm and constructive " , stressed the importance of bp to the british and other economies , after he came under pressure at home to defend the economic heavyweight .
on friday he said that " it is in everyone 's interests that bp continues to be a financially strong and stable company " .
bp is a staple in british pension funds and accounts for 12 percent of all dividends paid by uk companies .
its share price has plunged by 40 percent since the offshore oil rig blast in the gulf of mexico on april 20 killed 11 people and triggered an environmental disaster , with up to 40,000 barrels of oil a day spilling into the sea and washing up along coastal areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp has been told its plans to cap the oil well are insufficient some us lawmakers are demanding that bp suspend its dividend payments until the crisis is resolved .
bp 's chairman carl-henric svanberg has been summoned to a meeting in the white house next wednesday .
48 hours to improve containment plans meanwhile , bp has been ordered by the us coast guard to come up with an improved containment plan within the next two days , as bp 's plans do not go far enough to have backup resources in place , according to the us military .
us government data released on thursday suggests that the oil flow from the leak is higher than previously thought and could be upwards of 40,000 barrels a day .

max goeldi was at the center of a diplomatic spat between the two countries , which have now signed an agreement to cool tensions . after spending almost two years in a libyan jail for visa offenses , swiss businessman max goeldi is heading back home to switzerland .
it will be the end , many hope , of a fierce diplomatic dispute between bern and tripoli .
goeldi was released from the prison three days ago , and swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey has confirmed that he will be leaving libya sunday .
the conflict dates back to the arrest of a son of libyan leader moammar gadhafi .
the son , hannibal , was arrested for allegedly beating his domestic servants in geneva in july 2008 .
the charges against him were later dropped , but it was the start of a row that the two countries now hope to put behind them .
a few days after hannibal 's arrest , goeldi was detained and not allowed to leave libya .
goeldi has spent the last four months in prison after being convicted of violating immigration rules .
the situation has hurt relations between switzerland and libya , but the two nations have now signed what calmy-rey calls an " action plan " to help repair diplomatic ties .
" goeldi will return to switzerland and this is the start of the normalization of relations between the two countries , " she said .
the price for goeldi 's return home appeared to be a swiss apology for the publication of a leaked police photo of hannibal gadhafi taken while he was under arrest .
libya says the leak was an invasion of his privacy and hurt his reputation .
the swiss foreign minister said her country acknowledged the publication was unlawful , gave an apology and promised to pay hannibal gadhafi compensation if a criminal investigation fails to find who was responsible for the leak .
spain , which currently holds the european union 's rotating presidency , was part of the negotiations in tripoli and the agreement was also signed by a german mediator .

however it was another asamoah - kwadwo asamoah – who ran the game for ghana from the middle of the pitch , conducting play and pushing his team 's attacks forward from deep .
the black stars ' midfielder was certainly a strong candidate for man-of-the-match .
germany 's coaching staff and players will have been watching asamoah 's contribution with interest and may well single him out for special treatment as the most dangerous player in the ghana midfield when they face each other in their final game of group d on june 23 .
ghana midfielder asamoah pivotal to attacking threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghana broke well but resorted to lofted crosses into the box asamoah was the fulcrum of the ghana team on sunday – whether or not he will remain so depends on whether ghana 's serbian coach milovan rajevac brings inter milan 's sulley muntari back into the starting line-up or gives stalwart stephan appiah a run-out .
but on this performance against serbia , it is likely that asamoah will be the man who links ghana 's defense to its attack against the germans .
ghana defended very deeply throughout the match and fell back in large numbers whenever the serbians broke .
as soon as the threat had been neutralized , usually by some desperate defending and bodies being thrown in front of the ball , the play was immediately fed out to asamoah .
from his central position , the udinese midfielder would then run at the retreating serbs .
throughout the game , ghana would stretch the play to the very by-lines with asamoah feeding either prince tagoe on the right or andre ayew on the left .
serbia were dragged out of position by this tactic which allowed gyan and kevin-prince boateng to exploit the vacuum created in front of the serbian defense .
more often or not , however , the ghanaians resorted to lofted balls into the serbian penalty area rather than switching play to the forwards on the edge of the box .
lofted balls no problem for aerially-savvy germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker and friedrich will be ready for any aerial assault if this is a tactic they intend to stick with throughout the group stages , germany 's central defenders will have little trouble cutting out the high balls .
per mertesacker and arne friedrich are both tall players and accomplished in aerial battles .
ghana lacked initiative when running directly at the serbian defense and often headed straight into danger or chose to shoot from distance , which will also play into germany 's hands .
should the tactic of stretching play to the wings also endure , germany 's creative midfield trio of lukas podolski , mesut oezil and thomas mueller will have to be ready to drop back to the edge of their own box while wing-backs philipp lahm and perhaps kevin-prince 's brother jerome will have to watch that they do n't get caught too up-field in support of germany 's attack .
the potential clash of the boateng brothers is another interesting factor ahead of the germany-ghana game .
kevin-prince , a former germany under-21 player before choosing to take his father 's nationality , will have both identity issues and the potential wrath of a nation against him .
it was he who injured germany skipper michael ballack in the fa cup final at the end of the season to end the iconic german 's hopes of playing in south africa .
psychological pressure may affect the youngster 's potential to threaten .
on the attack , germany 's youthful creativity will be looking to exploit ghana 's sometimes erratic and jittery defense .
serbia , who play a less sophisticated version of the german game , caused chaos in ghana 's penalty area and only the lack of killer instinct prevented serbia from punishing this weakness .
competent ball carriers like oezil and mueller could unlock the ghanaians while lukas podolski and perhaps miroslav klose will have plenty of scuffed clearances to pounce on .
germany need to cut off serbia 's midfield route to attackers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia will be obstinate opponents for germany the germans may find serbia 's style of play to be similar to their own - but different enough to cause certain problems .
the serbians found it hard to play at times against ghana 's pressing tactic when they were in possession , the serbs being closed down at speed with space at a premium .
germany 's nippy youngsters will have to employ a similar tactic to smother any attempts at creativity by the serbian midfielders , who will be looking to release forwards milos krasnic , marko pantelic and nikola zigic .
should serbia captain dejan stankovic find himself with time and space to cue up attacks , however , germany could find themselves in trouble .
bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira will also have their hands full if the ball is fed to milan jovanovic who will operate in the areas they will be charged to protect in front of the back four .
the serbs attack in formations around the penalty area once the ball has been worked through midfield and germany will have to cut this threat out higher up the pitch to avoid pressure .
while the serbia-ghana game was hardly a classic , there were signs to suggest that as these teams grow into the tournament and find their rhythm and patterns , both could provide germany with a few obstacles as joachim loew 's side looks to win group d. author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

joachim loew 's blend of youth and experience opens its world cup campaign against australia in durban on sunday . the proof of the pudding , they say , is in the eating .
germany begin their world cup 2010 campaign against australia on sunday with coach joachim loew remaining true to his pledge that youth will lead the way .
loew experimented with his youth policy throughout qualification with a number of exciting youngsters blooded along the road to south africa but the real test awaits them in durban .
germany will hope that jogi has blended the right ingredients and that his mix of youth and experience does n't sink in the heat of competition like a failed soufflé .
with an average age of around 25 , germany 's likely starting line-up in the moses mabidha stadium will be die mannschaft 's youngest team in over 70 years .
but what it may be lacking in years , it certainly makes up for in excitement and quality .
germany are expected to play in an offensively minded 4-2-3-1 formation , which could include lukas podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either thomas mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either miroslav klose or cacau .
youth at the heart of germany 's creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german young guns kroos , mueller and badstuber much has been written about the wisdom of charging the likes of oezil , mueller and kroos with the job of conducting germany 's attacks , given the fact that these fresh-faced starlets are all short of their 23rd birthdays .
what is mostly forgotten in this analysis is that both oezil and mueller have spent the past season playing against some of the top teams in europe while holding down first-team places in two of germany 's best teams , werder bremen and bayern munich respectively .
kroos , meanwhile , was an instrumental component in bayer leverkusen 's best season in many a year .
germany should therefore have few concerns that these youngsters will be over-awed by the occasion .
and if there are a few jitters , loew has maintained enough of the experienced guard in the side to calm the nerves and help repel what is expected to be a robust socceroos team .
experienced back-up bildunterschrift : loew 's plan to play new stars with experienced players aims to bring germany new energy new captain philipp lahm will command fellow stalwarts per mertesacker and arne friedrich in the back four , all of which will give one of the two talented youngsters holger badstuber or jerome boateng the confidence to take his place in germany 's defensive quartet , safe in the knowledge that his fellow stoppers have been here before .
ahead of them , the increasingly mature and influential bastian schweinsteiger will shepherd the midfield with newcomer sami khedira by his side .
ahead of the creative trio of podolski , oezil and mueller -lrb- or kroos -rrb- - who is likely to get the nod ahead of piotr trochowski - germany may have the old head of miroslav klose to aim for as the chosen lone striker .
while klose has been off the boil for bayern this season , he is still a proven world cup striker who always seems to rise to such an occasion .
germany will hope this is the case again this year as his deputies all come with question marks .
mario gomez and stefan kiessling have never proved convincing at this level , and while cacau has looked good in recent friendlies he has had few appearances in competitive matches in a germany shirt .
" we watched a video of australia on friday and they made a big impression , " said oliver bierhoff , the germany team manager .
" they have not conceded a goal in 17 of their last 27 games , they are sturdy and they will be very focused , " he warned .
socceroos play the waiting game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia were no push-overs in germany in 2006 the australian team will be full of experience with an average age over 30 and are expected to face this young , attacking germany with defense in mind .
a strong defensive game and organization was the key to australia 's strong showing in the 2006 world cup which saw them through to the knockout stage where they were felled by a very debatable penalty decision in extra time against italy - the side who went on to become champions .
the socceroos will send out a team charged with soaking up german pressure , hoping to sap the strength of germany 's youngsters while hoping that star midfielder tim cahill can unlock the defense on the counter-attack .
australia 's dutch coach pim verbeek was hoping that striker harry kewell would be fit enough to spearhead those attacks but the galatasaray forward is unlikely to start after missing all the socceroos ' warm-up games due to injury .
while kewell could well be back to face ghana in the next game , joshua kennedy will continue to fill in for the time being as australia 's lone striker against the germans .

max goeldi was at the center of a diplomatic spat between the two countries , which have now signed an agreement to cool tensions . after spending almost two years in a libyan jail for visa offenses , swiss businessman max goeldi is heading back home to switzerland .
it will be the end , many hope , of a fierce diplomatic dispute between bern and tripoli .
goeldi was released from the prison three days ago , and swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey has confirmed that he will be leaving libya sunday .
the conflict dates back to the arrest of a son of libyan leader moammar gadhafi .
the son , hannibal , was arrested for allegedly beating his domestic servants in geneva in july 2008 .
the charges against him were later dropped , but it was the start of a row that the two countries now hope to put behind them .
a few days after hannibal 's arrest , goeldi was detained and not allowed to leave libya .
goeldi has spent the last four months in prison after being convicted of violating immigration rules .
the situation has hurt relations between switzerland and libya , but the two nations have now signed what calmy-rey calls an " action plan " to help repair diplomatic ties .
" goeldi will return to switzerland and this is the start of the normalization of relations between the two countries , " she said .
the price for goeldi 's return home appeared to be a swiss apology for the publication of a leaked police photo of hannibal gadhafi taken while he was under arrest .
libya says the leak was an invasion of his privacy and hurt his reputation .
the swiss foreign minister said her country acknowledged the publication was unlawful , gave an apology and promised to pay hannibal gadhafi compensation if a criminal investigation fails to find who was responsible for the leak .
spain , which currently holds the european union 's rotating presidency , was part of the negotiations in tripoli and the agreement was also signed by a german mediator .

a majority of germans think her ruling center-right coalition will not last . german chancellor angela merkel reprimanded members of her center-right governing coalition on sunday , calling on them to end their public dispute in order to win back voter trust . insults have been flying back and forth within merkel 's coalition government , exposing a level of vitriol usually seen in exchanges between the government and the opposition , not among members on the same team .
the tenor has forced the german chancellor to speak out to maintain discipline as talk of a coalition on the skids and even new elections fill the air . " we have to show people that we can be relied upon at this difficult time , " she said in an interview in the weekly bild am sonntag newspaper .
" that 's the only way to win back trust . " strong differences of opinion on policy have emerged within merkel 's coalition of conservatives and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on a variety of issues and sharp tongues have not been held . a government spokesman was forced to deny reports that merkel 's chief of staff had described defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg as " rumpelstiltskin , " a fairy tale dwarf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center-right coalition has been plagued by infighting an fdp lawmaker accused bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- of acting like a destructive " wild sow " over health-reform plans .
a senior csu politician retaliated , calling the fdp a " bunch of clowns . " in an uncharacteristically direct appeal , merkel urged her colleagues to restrain themselves . " i assume those involved realize that this behavior is not acceptable , " she said in the bild am sonntag . " this should not and will not set a precedent . " merkel denied that her authority as chancellor has suffered because of the row . polls show drop in confidence but the infighting has caused some experts to predict the downfall of merkel 's coalition government . " the current level of conflict between the conservatives and fdp certainly goes beyond what is normal and some commentators have started to question the stability of the government , " goldman sachs economist dirk schumacher told the reuters news agency . more than half of german citizens do not expect merkel 's coalition government to survive for the next three years .
according to a survey for the bild am sonntag paper , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the coalition would collapse before the end of its legislative period . a survey conducted for the german broadcaster ard also showed that only 40 percent of germans expect the coalition to last its full term . merkel is under pressure to seize the political initiative and boost her party 's support , which is languishing at four-year lows according to recent polls . all eyes on the presidential election the is one immediate hurdle that analysts say merkel must overcome to ensure her coalition 's future .
she faces an unexpected battle to get christian wulff , the conservative leader of the state lower saxony , elected president on june 30 by the federal council , a 1,200-strong body convened to elect the head of state .
the previous president , horst koehler , resigned suddenly last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coalition hopes are pinned on presidential candidate christian wulff the candidate put forward by the opposition social democrats and greens , joachim gauck , poses a strong challenge and is being widely praised in the german media as the better choice . some provincial leaders of the fdp have even suggested they might try to obstruct wulff 's election if merkel tries to raise taxes on the wealthy . " the failure of chancellor merkel 's candidate wulff to get a majority could easily be the beginning of the end of the coalition , " said schumacher . author : joanna impey -lrb- apn / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany kept up constant pressure on the socceroos and convincingly won 4-0 in what is the world cup 's highest scoring match so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose headed the german side to a comfortable 2-0 halftime lead the attack on the australian goal began early , with lukas podolski firing an absolute strike at australian keeper mark schwarzer in the 8th minute .
schwarzer managed to get a glove on the ball but could not stop it from going into the goal . striker misoslav klose was in good form early on , but could n't seem to find the net as the game got going .
he sent a nearly wide-open chance just wide of the goal in the 24th minute , but had a chance to redeem himself two minutes later . captain phillip lahm brought the ball up the right side and launched a curling cross from distance toward klose in the area , who leapt just a bit higher than schwarzer to get a head on the ball and put germany ahead 2-0 .
the goal was the seventh header scored by klose in a world cup , giving him the most goals via header by any player in world cup history . right decisions in the second half , germany did not take its foot off the gas and continued to press the australian defense .
the australians were reduced to 10 men in the 56th minute after forward tim cahill was sent off for a hard tackle on bastian schweinsteiger , setting the stage for even more german goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans loved their team 's high-scoring debut twenty-year-old thomas mueller scored his first goal for the german team in the 68th minute , followed shortly after by a strike from cacau , who had just been subbed in for klose . coach joachim loew 's decision to start klose over the brazilian-born cacau proved to be a good one .
midfielder mesut oezil , making his world cup debut for germany at age 21 , also narrowly missed scoring opportunities and seemed to be involved in every german attack . loew also opted to start the 20-year-old mueller over the more-experienced piotr trochowski on the right wing .
in addition to mueller 's goal , he provided the assist to podolski that got the german scoring machine up and running . german keeper manuel neuer also made his world cup debut , but the 24-year old was relatively untested . first win for africa it was a game of firsts in the other group d match between ghana and serbia in pretoria sunday afternoon .
the first penalty kick of the 2010 world cup led to the first win for an african team on the host continent as ghana beat serbia 1-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gyan took the world cup 's first penalty serbia 's zdravko kuzmanovic was given a yellow card for a hand ball in the penalty area in the 85th minute .
the resulting penalty was taken by ghana 's asamoah gyan , who cleanly blasted the ball to the back of the net for the game 's only goal , giving the black stars the victory in the first match of group d. gyan very nearly made it 2-0 in injury time at the end of the game when he beat serbian keeper vladimir stojkovic with a cross-goal shot that took an unlucky bounce off the post . serbia was reduced to 10 men in the 74th minute for a second yellow card on defender aleksandar lukovic .
slovenia records historic victory it was a goalkeeper blunder that gave slovenia its first-ever world cup win on sunday , as it defeated algeria 1-0 in polokwane .
for the first half of the group c match-up between slovenia and algeria , both teams were playing a cautious game that did n't offer much in the way of scoring opportunities .
the game was scoreless when the teams headed for the locker room at the break , and neither team took strong control of the game early in the second half .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koren was the man of the match however , a substitution for algeria proved to be a turning point in the game .
abdelkader ghezzal was brought in to replace rafik djebbour in the 58th minute , only to receive a yellow card sixty seconds later .
just 15 minutes after that , ghezzal was booked again for a handball and sent off the pitch .
taking advantage of the extra man , slovenia turned up the pressure on algeria .
in the 79th minute , slovenian captain robert koren took one of his team 's six shots on goal and got lucky when algerian keeper fawzi chaouchi flubbed the save and deflected the ball into the goal .
the win for slovenia was the country 's first ever in a world cup .
slovenia 's only other world cup appearance was in 2002 and they lost all three matches they played .

while the country is far from being a democracy , its cultural scene is beginning to instigate change . in belarus , the most productive kind of political protest these days has less to do with flag-waving an chanting in public squares than with hoarse voices , heavy chords , and a dance-friendly rhythm . the songs of the band n.r.m. touch on aspects of life as it 's really lived in belarus - and that has upset the government more than many of the opposition politicians have . " since there was no political opposition for years , we musicians took over the role of the opposition , " said singer and band leader lavron volski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is popular in belarus for a long time , n.r.m. was n't allowed to perform publically .
there was never an official ban , but whenever they had a concert lined up , the organizer would get a call from an official and the show would be cancelled . now , the belarusian authorities have agreed to allow the group to perform twice this fall .
it 's part of what the government is calling liberalization and might be related to the naming of a new culture minister , pavel latushko .
however , it 's not yet clear whether the development will mean lasting change in this country often referred to as " europe 's last dictatorship . " support from germany unlike in western europe , culture in belarus receives very little funding from the state .
a few foreign organizations , like the goethe institut in the capital minsk , financially support cooperative projects or let artists use their facilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostwald-richter directs the goethe institut in minsk for the first time in 17 years , the goethe institut has a room where people can organize events and opinions can be shared openly , said director kathrin oswald-richter .
" here , everyone can say what they want , and we 're wildly determined to try that out , " she added . the goethe institut recently moved from a crumbling constructivist building from the 1920s to a high-rise in downtown minsk with glass facades . at the building 's inauguration , the hamburg-based rock group fotos was flown in to perform .
in this relatively isolated city visited by few foreign acts , audiences are quick to jump to their feet and start dancing once a show by an international group begins . cultural exchange projects german language and culture are popular in minsk , with about 30,000 people learning german at universities and other institutions .
there 's also a fan club for the german soccer team fc bayern . foreign organizations in minsk also try to build ties between belarus and western european countries . the goethe institut trains belarusian cultural managers in democratic principles and the organization european borderlands , funded by the literary colloquium berlin and the allianz cultural foundation , brings german authors to belarus for readings . bildunterschrift : the architecture in downtown minsk reflects the country 's communist past still , belarus ' cultural scene is relatively isolated , like the country itself .
the nation has not been represented at the venice biennale in many years , which led several artists to organize a belarusian pavilion full of provocative , political art - if not in venice , then at least in a private gallery in minsk . belarus itself , however , is internally divided by the politics of language .
president lukashenko speaks mainly russian , while the opposition speaks belarusian , the language of the intellectuals and the rural population . " we no longer live under stalin , but not everything 's perfect yet , " said belarusian poet volha hapeyeva .

and it 's no fluke either . of the 23 players representing germany at the world cup , 11 have foreign backgrounds .

and it 's no fluke either . of the 23 players representing germany at the world cup , 11 have foreign backgrounds .
more than half of the outfield players selected by joachim loew were either born outside germany themselves , or have a non-german parent .
the squad has roots in eight different countries - nine when germany 's included . the role of sport in incorporating ethnic minorities into society is one of the olympic movement 's central leitmotifs . " sport is a fantastic instrument of social integration , " said jacques rogge , president of the international olympic committee , at a recent lecture in darmstadt . germany 's favorite sport is a working-class game , but not exclusively so .
soccer is cheap to take up but promises great riches at the top , and so offers the chance to advance and climb the social ladder .
these opportunities are keenly seized by youngsters from lower-earning , ethnically-diverse backgrounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the national team is redefining what it means to be german according to the most up-to-date figures from the federal statistics office , one in five people living in germany in 2008 was of foreign descent .
from the total of 15.9 million with roots abroad , 2.9 million were from turkey .
two likely starters for the national team at the world cup - serdar tasci and mesut oezil - both have turkish parents .
" a gift for german football , " was how joachim loew described oezil . it works both ways .
the sport plays a leading role in a successfully multicultural society today .
germany hopes to reap the rewards with its ethnically-diverse team on the pitch in south africa . helmut from sau paulo lukas podolski , miroslav klose and piotr trochowski were born in poland , and moved across the border as children .
all have been part of germany 's international set-up for years .
youngster marko marin was born in war-struck bosnia-herzegovina .
his parents moved to frankfurt when he was two , and , when he came of age , marin decided on a german passport .
mario gomez was born in baden-wuerttemberg , but his father comes from spain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cacau had to work his way to the top of german football gomez is likely to miss out on a place in germany 's attack , in favor of an in-form brazilian-born striker nicknamed " helmut . "
more commonly known as cacau , he was born in sao paulo province , and moved to german lower-league football ten years ago .
he gradually rose through the ranks to become a bundesliga winner with stuttgart in 2007 .
he 's just extended his contract at the club until 2013 . cacau became a german citizen in 2009 , and the call from joachim loew came quickly .
" i am glad that germany has adopted me , " he said .
" my whole mindset is german . " " never mind where you come from " the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is not afraid of celebrating its eclectic new generation of players .
since 2007 , the dfb and its general sponsor mercedes-benz have given an integration prize under the label " football : many cultures - but a single passion . "
they also put on a spectrum of projects and activities to promote the integration of youngsters from different backgrounds into society , both by playing soccer and using it as an example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira completes a trio of players with african roots but an impression of a complete acceptance of ethnic diversity in german soccer would not be fair .
far-right groups were reprimanded in court for racist publications attacking black german national players gerald asamoah and patrick owomoyela only four years ago , in the build-up to germany 's world cup . included in germany 's 2010 squad are dennis aogo , whose father is nigerian , and jerome boateng , born in berlin to a ghanaian father .
sami khedira is set to play an important role after captain michael ballack was ruled out through injury .
ballack was notable for being born in the former east germany when he made his national team debut in 1999 .
his replacement has a tunisian father , and is well-versed on the collective goals of a diverse group of players . " we are a team , " says khedira .

joachim loew 's blend of youth and experience opens its world cup campaign against australia in durban on sunday . the proof of the pudding , they say , is in the eating .
germany begin their world cup 2010 campaign against australia on sunday with coach joachim loew remaining true to his pledge that youth will lead the way .
loew experimented with his youth policy throughout qualification with a number of exciting youngsters blooded along the road to south africa but the real test awaits them in durban .
germany will hope that jogi has blended the right ingredients and that his mix of youth and experience does n't sink in the heat of competition like a failed soufflé .
with an average age of around 25 , germany 's likely starting line-up in the moses mabidha stadium will be die mannschaft 's youngest team in over 70 years .
but what it may be lacking in years , it certainly makes up for in excitement and quality .
germany are expected to play in an offensively minded 4-2-3-1 formation , which could include lukas podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either thomas mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either miroslav klose or cacau .
youth at the heart of germany 's creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german young guns kroos , mueller and badstuber much has been written about the wisdom of charging the likes of oezil , mueller and kroos with the job of conducting germany 's attacks , given the fact that these fresh-faced starlets are all short of their 23rd birthdays .
what is mostly forgotten in this analysis is that both oezil and mueller have spent the past season playing against some of the top teams in europe while holding down first-team places in two of germany 's best teams , werder bremen and bayern munich respectively .
kroos , meanwhile , was an instrumental component in bayer leverkusen 's best season in many a year .
germany should therefore have few concerns that these youngsters will be over-awed by the occasion .
and if there are a few jitters , loew has maintained enough of the experienced guard in the side to calm the nerves and help repel what is expected to be a robust socceroos team .
experienced back-up bildunterschrift : loew 's plan to play new stars with experienced players aims to bring germany new energy new captain philipp lahm will command fellow stalwarts per mertesacker and arne friedrich in the back four , all of which will give one of the two talented youngsters holger badstuber or jerome boateng the confidence to take his place in germany 's defensive quartet , safe in the knowledge that his fellow stoppers have been here before .
ahead of them , the increasingly mature and influential bastian schweinsteiger will shepherd the midfield with newcomer sami khedira by his side .
ahead of the creative trio of podolski , oezil and mueller -lrb- or kroos -rrb- - who is likely to get the nod ahead of piotr trochowski - germany may have the old head of miroslav klose to aim for as the chosen lone striker .
while klose has been off the boil for bayern this season , he is still a proven world cup striker who always seems to rise to such an occasion .
germany will hope this is the case again this year as his deputies all come with question marks .
mario gomez and stefan kiessling have never proved convincing at this level , and while cacau has looked good in recent friendlies he has had few appearances in competitive matches in a germany shirt .
" we watched a video of australia on friday and they made a big impression , " said oliver bierhoff , the germany team manager .
" they have not conceded a goal in 17 of their last 27 games , they are sturdy and they will be very focused , " he warned .
socceroos play the waiting game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia were no push-overs in germany in 2006 the australian team will be full of experience with an average age over 30 and are expected to face this young , attacking germany with defense in mind .
a strong defensive game and organization was the key to australia 's strong showing in the 2006 world cup which saw them through to the knockout stage where they were felled by a very debatable penalty decision in extra time against italy - the side who went on to become champions .
the socceroos will send out a team charged with soaking up german pressure , hoping to sap the strength of germany 's youngsters while hoping that star midfielder tim cahill can unlock the defense on the counter-attack .
australia 's dutch coach pim verbeek was hoping that striker harry kewell would be fit enough to spearhead those attacks but the galatasaray forward is unlikely to start after missing all the socceroos ' warm-up games due to injury .
while kewell could well be back to face ghana in the next game , joshua kennedy will continue to fill in for the time being as australia 's lone striker against the germans .

germany begin their world cup 2010 campaign against australia on sunday with coach joachim loew remaining true to his pledge that youth will lead the way .
loew experimented with his youth policy throughout qualification with a number of exciting youngsters blooded along the road to south africa but the real test awaits them in durban .
germany will hope that jogi has blended the right ingredients and that his mix of youth and experience does n't sink in the heat of competition like a failed soufflé .
with an average age of around 25 , germany 's likely starting line-up in the moses mabidha stadium will be die mannschaft 's youngest team in over 70 years .
but what it may be lacking in years , it certainly makes up for in excitement and quality .
germany are expected to play in an offensively minded 4-2-3-1 formation , which could include lukas podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either thomas mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either miroslav klose or cacau .
youth at the heart of germany 's creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german young guns kroos , mueller and badstuber much has been written about the wisdom of charging the likes of oezil , mueller and kroos with the job of conducting germany 's attacks , given the fact that these fresh-faced starlets are all short of their 23rd birthdays .
what is mostly forgotten in this analysis is that both oezil and mueller have spent the past season playing against some of the top teams in europe while holding down first-team places in two of germany 's best teams , werder bremen and bayern munich respectively .
kroos , meanwhile , was an instrumental component in bayer leverkusen 's best season in many a year .
germany should therefore have few concerns that these youngsters will be over-awed by the occasion .
and if there are a few jitters , loew has maintained enough of the experienced guard in the side to calm the nerves and help repel what is expected to be a robust socceroos team .
experienced back-up bildunterschrift : loew 's plan to play new stars with experienced players aims to bring germany new energy new captain philipp lahm will command fellow stalwarts per mertesacker and arne friedrich in the back four , all of which will give one of the two talented youngsters holger badstuber or jerome boateng the confidence to take his place in germany 's defensive quartet , safe in the knowledge that his fellow stoppers have been here before .
ahead of them , the increasingly mature and influential bastian schweinsteiger will shepherd the midfield with newcomer sami khedira by his side .
ahead of the creative trio of podolski , oezil and mueller -lrb- or kroos -rrb- - who is likely to get the nod ahead of piotr trochowski - germany may have the old head of miroslav klose to aim for as the chosen lone striker .
while klose has been off the boil for bayern this season , he is still a proven world cup striker who always seems to rise to such an occasion .
germany will hope this is the case again this year as his deputies all come with question marks .
mario gomez and stefan kiessling have never proved convincing at this level , and while cacau has looked good in recent friendlies he has had few appearances in competitive matches in a germany shirt .

joachim loew 's blend of youth and experience opens its world cup campaign against australia in durban on sunday . the proof of the pudding , they say , is in the eating .
germany begin their world cup 2010 campaign against australia on sunday with coach joachim loew remaining true to his pledge that youth will lead the way .
loew experimented with his youth policy throughout qualification with a number of exciting youngsters blooded along the road to south africa but the real test awaits them in durban .
germany will hope that jogi has blended the right ingredients and that his mix of youth and experience does n't sink in the heat of competition like a failed soufflé .
with an average age of around 25 , germany 's likely starting line-up in the moses mabidha stadium will be die mannschaft 's youngest team in over 70 years .
but what it may be lacking in years , it certainly makes up for in excitement and quality .
germany are expected to play in an offensively minded 4-2-3-1 formation , which could include lukas podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either thomas mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either miroslav klose or cacau .
youth at the heart of germany 's creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german young guns kroos , mueller and badstuber much has been written about the wisdom of charging the likes of oezil , mueller and kroos with the job of conducting germany 's attacks , given the fact that these fresh-faced starlets are all short of their 23rd birthdays .

germany should therefore have few concerns that these youngsters will be over-awed by the occasion .

during a 30-minute telephone conversation , obama , who said last week he wants to know " whose ass to kick " , reaffirmed america 's " deep commitment to the special and historic relationship " between the us and the uk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron has been under pressure to defend bp but , obama also made it clear that he expects bp to pay for the clean-up costs and meet economic claims from the spill .

on friday he said that " it is in everyone 's interests that bp continues to be a financially strong and stable company " .
bp is a staple in british pension funds and accounts for 12 percent of all dividends paid by uk companies .
its share price has plunged by 40 percent since the offshore oil rig blast in the gulf of mexico on april 20 killed 11 people and triggered an environmental disaster , with up to 40,000 barrels of oil a day spilling into the sea and washing up along coastal areas .

bp 's chairman carl-henric svanberg has been summoned to a meeting in the white house next wednesday .
48 hours to improve containment plans meanwhile , bp has been ordered by the us coast guard to come up with an improved containment plan within the next two days , as bp 's plans do not go far enough to have backup resources in place , according to the us military .
us government data released on thursday suggests that the oil flow from the leak is higher than previously thought and could be upwards of 40,000 barrels a day .

during a 30-minute telephone conversation , obama , who said last week he wants to know " whose ass to kick " , reaffirmed america 's " deep commitment to the special and historic relationship " between the us and the uk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron has been under pressure to defend bp but , obama also made it clear that he expects bp to pay for the clean-up costs and meet economic claims from the spill .
bp under pressure cameron , who described the conversation as " warm and constructive " , stressed the importance of bp to the british and other economies , after he came under pressure at home to defend the economic heavyweight .
on friday he said that " it is in everyone 's interests that bp continues to be a financially strong and stable company " .
bp is a staple in british pension funds and accounts for 12 percent of all dividends paid by uk companies .
its share price has plunged by 40 percent since the offshore oil rig blast in the gulf of mexico on april 20 killed 11 people and triggered an environmental disaster , with up to 40,000 barrels of oil a day spilling into the sea and washing up along coastal areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp has been told its plans to cap the oil well are insufficient some us lawmakers are demanding that bp suspend its dividend payments until the crisis is resolved .
bp 's chairman carl-henric svanberg has been summoned to a meeting in the white house next wednesday .
48 hours to improve containment plans meanwhile , bp has been ordered by the us coast guard to come up with an improved containment plan within the next two days , as bp 's plans do not go far enough to have backup resources in place , according to the us military .
us government data released on thursday suggests that the oil flow from the leak is higher than previously thought and could be upwards of 40,000 barrels a day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 13.06.2010 happy as underdogs , aussies looking for germany upset großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the socceroos want to spring a surprise the big question hanging over australia 's world cup first xi is whether it 's lost the youthful spark that propelled it in 2006 .
nevertheless , the ' socceroos ' still hope to take points off germany on sunday . in germany in 2006 , australia was playing in its first world cup in 32 years and was able to draw upon the hype and euphoria associated with finally breaking such a long drought .
the team was young and represented a genuine surprise package in the tournament - and surprise they did , reaching the round of 16 and losing in controversial circumstances to eventual champions italy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injury has kept kewell from training ahead of the cup but with a starting xi nearly identical to the one that overwhelmed japan 3-1 in the opening match of 2006 , many pundits are wondering whether australia is now four years more experienced , or just four years slower .
the first xi in south africa is expected to mirror the 2006 equivalent , with the exception of striker mark viduka , who has n't played international football since 2007 .
the team played exciting football in 2006 , but the 2010 version of the " socceroos " has not evolved , and there are fears the unit now lacks that crucial blend of youth and experience , of pace and steadiness .
worries galore significant injury clouds have hung over key attacking players harry kewell , who plays his club football at galatasaray , and midfielder brett emerton of blackburn rovers - both of whom only resumed training with the national squad a week before their group d opener against germany .
the likes of midfielders vince grella , also of blackburn , and mark bresciano , whose palermo contract has just expired , have also battled injury in recent months and have played limited first-team football in their respective leagues .
defender craig moore , formerly of glasgow rangers , is also without a club - and at the age of 34 has been fending off concerns he may have lost the speed necessary to match it with the likes of a bastian schweinsteiger , marko marin or mesut oezil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socceroos captain neill is a rock in defense at the back , australia 's great hope lies with veteran goalkeeper mark schwarzer , who , at the age of 37 , has returned to career-best form with europa league finalists fulham .
captain lucas neill is also still considered a rock in defense , but endured an up-and-down season himself , switching from everton to galatasaray in january .
national coach dutchman pim verbeek has sought to dispel the concerns over injuries and lack of game time , insisting a week out from australia 's clash with germany that all his players were now fit and ready to take on the world .
defensive unit but it remains to be seen whether this will equate to match fitness , and whether the socceroos will be in-tune enough to keep up with a youthful germany team displaying at times a mesmerizing brand of attacking football .
moreover , the socceroos are being billed as a team that will offer little in the way of genuine attacking threats of their own , instead presenting themselves as a difficult team to break down in their defensive third - and indeed verbeek 's preferred 4-2-3-1 formation attests to this .
several attack-minded teams play 4-2-3-1 , of course - germany and brazil to name but two - but australia has often lacked the speed and technical proficiency to use the formation in the same way they do .
in its world cup warm-up matches the socceroos struggled to shift the ball quickly enough from the back , through the midfield and up to the lone striker in order to effectively hit teams on the counter-attack .
australia can boast a highly organized team , though no more than most other countries that made it to south africa .
at this level , possessing a tight , well-organized team is the lowest common denominator .
happily underdogs so what does australia have going in its favor ?
the first two words that come to mind are tim cahill , who has enjoyed a solid season with his club everton , and who is without doubt the socceroos ' primary attacking threat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cahill is one aussie making the germans nervous despite his height , or lack thereof , cahill is remarkably good with his head , and has a knack for slipping into the right place at the right time .
he 'll certainly be a handful for the german defense , with national team defender per mertesacker commenting recently that cahill was " one of australia 's most dangerous players and will be their midfield maestro . "
luke wilkshire of dynamo moscow will also be one to keep an eye on .
wilkshire 's crosses and free kicks from the right were a source of several goals during world cup qualifying for the likes of beanpole striker joshua kennedy .
also in australia 's corner will be the knowledge that they 've been written off as also-rans by the other two teams in group d , serbia and ghana .
ghana midfielder sulley muntari commented as recently as thursday that his team would be focusing its attention on games against serbia and germany , with victory against australia all but considered a fait accompli .
this perceived dismissiveness will undoubtedly work in the socceroos ' favor .
never lie down australians see as central to their sporting mentality the ability to rise to an occasion , to thrive against all odds .
australians love an underdog and cherish a squad full of fierce competitors .
australia is also a young country , and sporting success is a big part of its national mythology .
they do n't give up without a fight .
australia is also known as a physical team , with the national squad having been subject to a fitness regime many in the socceroos camp feel is superior to those of other countries .
lucas neill may have stated recently that australia would be happy with a draw against the much-fancied germans come sunday , but do n't take this to mean the socceroos feel they do n't have a chance .
' ' -lsb- germany 's -rsb- record suggests they are the most consistent team in world football , and the pressure is on them to win , " neill said earlier in the week .
" nobody in the world , apart from our team , expects us to beat them .
if we manage to win , we will shock the world . "

several attack-minded teams play 4-2-3-1 , of course - germany and brazil to name but two - but australia has often lacked the speed and technical proficiency to use the formation in the same way they do .
in its world cup warm-up matches the socceroos struggled to shift the ball quickly enough from the back , through the midfield and up to the lone striker in order to effectively hit teams on the counter-attack .
australia can boast a highly organized team , though no more than most other countries that made it to south africa .
at this level , possessing a tight , well-organized team is the lowest common denominator .
happily underdogs so what does australia have going in its favor ?
the first two words that come to mind are tim cahill , who has enjoyed a solid season with his club everton , and who is without doubt the socceroos ' primary attacking threat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cahill is one aussie making the germans nervous despite his height , or lack thereof , cahill is remarkably good with his head , and has a knack for slipping into the right place at the right time .
he 'll certainly be a handful for the german defense , with national team defender per mertesacker commenting recently that cahill was " one of australia 's most dangerous players and will be their midfield maestro . "
luke wilkshire of dynamo moscow will also be one to keep an eye on .
wilkshire 's crosses and free kicks from the right were a source of several goals during world cup qualifying for the likes of beanpole striker joshua kennedy .
also in australia 's corner will be the knowledge that they 've been written off as also-rans by the other two teams in group d , serbia and ghana .
ghana midfielder sulley muntari commented as recently as thursday that his team would be focusing its attention on games against serbia and germany , with victory against australia all but considered a fait accompli .
this perceived dismissiveness will undoubtedly work in the socceroos ' favor .
never lie down australians see as central to their sporting mentality the ability to rise to an occasion , to thrive against all odds .
australians love an underdog and cherish a squad full of fierce competitors .
australia is also a young country , and sporting success is a big part of its national mythology .
they do n't give up without a fight .
australia is also known as a physical team , with the national squad having been subject to a fitness regime many in the socceroos camp feel is superior to those of other countries .
lucas neill may have stated recently that australia would be happy with a draw against the much-fancied germans come sunday , but do n't take this to mean the socceroos feel they do n't have a chance .
' ' -lsb- germany 's -rsb- record suggests they are the most consistent team in world football , and the pressure is on them to win , " neill said earlier in the week .
" nobody in the world , apart from our team , expects us to beat them .
if we manage to win , we will shock the world . "

nevertheless , the ' socceroos ' still hope to take points off germany on sunday . in germany in 2006 , australia was playing in its first world cup in 32 years and was able to draw upon the hype and euphoria associated with finally breaking such a long drought .
the team was young and represented a genuine surprise package in the tournament - and surprise they did , reaching the round of 16 and losing in controversial circumstances to eventual champions italy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injury has kept kewell from training ahead of the cup but with a starting xi nearly identical to the one that overwhelmed japan 3-1 in the opening match of 2006 , many pundits are wondering whether australia is now four years more experienced , or just four years slower .
the first xi in south africa is expected to mirror the 2006 equivalent , with the exception of striker mark viduka , who has n't played international football since 2007 .
the team played exciting football in 2006 , but the 2010 version of the " socceroos " has not evolved , and there are fears the unit now lacks that crucial blend of youth and experience , of pace and steadiness .
worries galore significant injury clouds have hung over key attacking players harry kewell , who plays his club football at galatasaray , and midfielder brett emerton of blackburn rovers - both of whom only resumed training with the national squad a week before their group d opener against germany .
the likes of midfielders vince grella , also of blackburn , and mark bresciano , whose palermo contract has just expired , have also battled injury in recent months and have played limited first-team football in their respective leagues .
defender craig moore , formerly of glasgow rangers , is also without a club - and at the age of 34 has been fending off concerns he may have lost the speed necessary to match it with the likes of a bastian schweinsteiger , marko marin or mesut oezil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socceroos captain neill is a rock in defense at the back , australia 's great hope lies with veteran goalkeeper mark schwarzer , who , at the age of 37 , has returned to career-best form with europa league finalists fulham .
captain lucas neill is also still considered a rock in defense , but endured an up-and-down season himself , switching from everton to galatasaray in january .
national coach dutchman pim verbeek has sought to dispel the concerns over injuries and lack of game time , insisting a week out from australia 's clash with germany that all his players were now fit and ready to take on the world .
defensive unit but it remains to be seen whether this will equate to match fitness , and whether the socceroos will be in-tune enough to keep up with a youthful germany team displaying at times a mesmerizing brand of attacking football .
moreover , the socceroos are being billed as a team that will offer little in the way of genuine attacking threats of their own , instead presenting themselves as a difficult team to break down in their defensive third - and indeed verbeek 's preferred 4-2-3-1 formation attests to this .
several attack-minded teams play 4-2-3-1 , of course - germany and brazil to name but two - but australia has often lacked the speed and technical proficiency to use the formation in the same way they do .
in its world cup warm-up matches the socceroos struggled to shift the ball quickly enough from the back , through the midfield and up to the lone striker in order to effectively hit teams on the counter-attack .
australia can boast a highly organized team , though no more than most other countries that made it to south africa .
at this level , possessing a tight , well-organized team is the lowest common denominator .
happily underdogs so what does australia have going in its favor ?
the first two words that come to mind are tim cahill , who has enjoyed a solid season with his club everton , and who is without doubt the socceroos ' primary attacking threat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cahill is one aussie making the germans nervous despite his height , or lack thereof , cahill is remarkably good with his head , and has a knack for slipping into the right place at the right time .
he 'll certainly be a handful for the german defense , with national team defender per mertesacker commenting recently that cahill was " one of australia 's most dangerous players and will be their midfield maestro . "
luke wilkshire of dynamo moscow will also be one to keep an eye on .
wilkshire 's crosses and free kicks from the right were a source of several goals during world cup qualifying for the likes of beanpole striker joshua kennedy .
also in australia 's corner will be the knowledge that they 've been written off as also-rans by the other two teams in group d , serbia and ghana .
ghana midfielder sulley muntari commented as recently as thursday that his team would be focusing its attention on games against serbia and germany , with victory against australia all but considered a fait accompli .
this perceived dismissiveness will undoubtedly work in the socceroos ' favor .
never lie down australians see as central to their sporting mentality the ability to rise to an occasion , to thrive against all odds .
australians love an underdog and cherish a squad full of fierce competitors .
australia is also a young country , and sporting success is a big part of its national mythology .
they do n't give up without a fight .
australia is also known as a physical team , with the national squad having been subject to a fitness regime many in the socceroos camp feel is superior to those of other countries .
lucas neill may have stated recently that australia would be happy with a draw against the much-fancied germans come sunday , but do n't take this to mean the socceroos feel they do n't have a chance .
' ' -lsb- germany 's -rsb- record suggests they are the most consistent team in world football , and the pressure is on them to win , " neill said earlier in the week .
" nobody in the world , apart from our team , expects us to beat them .
if we manage to win , we will shock the world . "

a majority of germans think her ruling center-right coalition will not last . german chancellor angela merkel reprimanded members of her center-right governing coalition on sunday , calling on them to end their public dispute in order to win back voter trust . insults have been flying back and forth within merkel 's coalition government , exposing a level of vitriol usually seen in exchanges between the government and the opposition , not among members on the same team .
the tenor has forced the german chancellor to speak out to maintain discipline as talk of a coalition on the skids and even new elections fill the air . " we have to show people that we can be relied upon at this difficult time , " she said in an interview in the weekly bild am sonntag newspaper .
" that 's the only way to win back trust . " strong differences of opinion on policy have emerged within merkel 's coalition of conservatives and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on a variety of issues and sharp tongues have not been held . a government spokesman was forced to deny reports that merkel 's chief of staff had described defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg as " rumpelstiltskin , " a fairy tale dwarf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center-right coalition has been plagued by infighting an fdp lawmaker accused bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- of acting like a destructive " wild sow " over health-reform plans .

" the current level of conflict between the conservatives and fdp certainly goes beyond what is normal and some commentators have started to question the stability of the government , " goldman sachs economist dirk schumacher told the reuters news agency . more than half of german citizens do not expect merkel 's coalition government to survive for the next three years .
according to a survey for the bild am sonntag paper , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the coalition would collapse before the end of its legislative period . a survey conducted for the german broadcaster ard also showed that only 40 percent of germans expect the coalition to last its full term . merkel is under pressure to seize the political initiative and boost her party 's support , which is languishing at four-year lows according to recent polls . all eyes on the presidential election the is one immediate hurdle that analysts say merkel must overcome to ensure her coalition 's future .
she faces an unexpected battle to get christian wulff , the conservative leader of the state lower saxony , elected president on june 30 by the federal council , a 1,200-strong body convened to elect the head of state .

" the failure of chancellor merkel 's candidate wulff to get a majority could easily be the beginning of the end of the coalition , " said schumacher . author : joanna impey -lrb- apn / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a majority of germans think her ruling center-right coalition will not last . german chancellor angela merkel reprimanded members of her center-right governing coalition on sunday , calling on them to end their public dispute in order to win back voter trust . insults have been flying back and forth within merkel 's coalition government , exposing a level of vitriol usually seen in exchanges between the government and the opposition , not among members on the same team .
the tenor has forced the german chancellor to speak out to maintain discipline as talk of a coalition on the skids and even new elections fill the air . " we have to show people that we can be relied upon at this difficult time , " she said in an interview in the weekly bild am sonntag newspaper .
" that 's the only way to win back trust . " strong differences of opinion on policy have emerged within merkel 's coalition of conservatives and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on a variety of issues and sharp tongues have not been held . a government spokesman was forced to deny reports that merkel 's chief of staff had described defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg as " rumpelstiltskin , " a fairy tale dwarf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center-right coalition has been plagued by infighting an fdp lawmaker accused bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- of acting like a destructive " wild sow " over health-reform plans .
a senior csu politician retaliated , calling the fdp a " bunch of clowns . " in an uncharacteristically direct appeal , merkel urged her colleagues to restrain themselves . " i assume those involved realize that this behavior is not acceptable , " she said in the bild am sonntag . " this should not and will not set a precedent . " merkel denied that her authority as chancellor has suffered because of the row . polls show drop in confidence but the infighting has caused some experts to predict the downfall of merkel 's coalition government . " the current level of conflict between the conservatives and fdp certainly goes beyond what is normal and some commentators have started to question the stability of the government , " goldman sachs economist dirk schumacher told the reuters news agency . more than half of german citizens do not expect merkel 's coalition government to survive for the next three years .
according to a survey for the bild am sonntag paper , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the coalition would collapse before the end of its legislative period . a survey conducted for the german broadcaster ard also showed that only 40 percent of germans expect the coalition to last its full term . merkel is under pressure to seize the political initiative and boost her party 's support , which is languishing at four-year lows according to recent polls . all eyes on the presidential election the is one immediate hurdle that analysts say merkel must overcome to ensure her coalition 's future .
she faces an unexpected battle to get christian wulff , the conservative leader of the state lower saxony , elected president on june 30 by the federal council , a 1,200-strong body convened to elect the head of state .
the previous president , horst koehler , resigned suddenly last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coalition hopes are pinned on presidential candidate christian wulff the candidate put forward by the opposition social democrats and greens , joachim gauck , poses a strong challenge and is being widely praised in the german media as the better choice . some provincial leaders of the fdp have even suggested they might try to obstruct wulff 's election if merkel tries to raise taxes on the wealthy . " the failure of chancellor merkel 's candidate wulff to get a majority could easily be the beginning of the end of the coalition , " said schumacher . author : joanna impey -lrb- apn / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a majority of germans think her ruling center-right coalition will not last . german chancellor angela merkel reprimanded members of her center-right governing coalition on sunday , calling on them to end their public dispute in order to win back voter trust . insults have been flying back and forth within merkel 's coalition government , exposing a level of vitriol usually seen in exchanges between the government and the opposition , not among members on the same team .
the tenor has forced the german chancellor to speak out to maintain discipline as talk of a coalition on the skids and even new elections fill the air . " we have to show people that we can be relied upon at this difficult time , " she said in an interview in the weekly bild am sonntag newspaper .
" that 's the only way to win back trust . " strong differences of opinion on policy have emerged within merkel 's coalition of conservatives and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on a variety of issues and sharp tongues have not been held . a government spokesman was forced to deny reports that merkel 's chief of staff had described defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg as " rumpelstiltskin , " a fairy tale dwarf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center-right coalition has been plagued by infighting an fdp lawmaker accused bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- of acting like a destructive " wild sow " over health-reform plans .
a senior csu politician retaliated , calling the fdp a " bunch of clowns . " in an uncharacteristically direct appeal , merkel urged her colleagues to restrain themselves . " i assume those involved realize that this behavior is not acceptable , " she said in the bild am sonntag . " this should not and will not set a precedent . " merkel denied that her authority as chancellor has suffered because of the row . polls show drop in confidence but the infighting has caused some experts to predict the downfall of merkel 's coalition government . " the current level of conflict between the conservatives and fdp certainly goes beyond what is normal and some commentators have started to question the stability of the government , " goldman sachs economist dirk schumacher told the reuters news agency . more than half of german citizens do not expect merkel 's coalition government to survive for the next three years .
according to a survey for the bild am sonntag paper , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the coalition would collapse before the end of its legislative period . a survey conducted for the german broadcaster ard also showed that only 40 percent of germans expect the coalition to last its full term . merkel is under pressure to seize the political initiative and boost her party 's support , which is languishing at four-year lows according to recent polls . all eyes on the presidential election the is one immediate hurdle that analysts say merkel must overcome to ensure her coalition 's future .
she faces an unexpected battle to get christian wulff , the conservative leader of the state lower saxony , elected president on june 30 by the federal council , a 1,200-strong body convened to elect the head of state .
the previous president , horst koehler , resigned suddenly last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coalition hopes are pinned on presidential candidate christian wulff the candidate put forward by the opposition social democrats and greens , joachim gauck , poses a strong challenge and is being widely praised in the german media as the better choice . some provincial leaders of the fdp have even suggested they might try to obstruct wulff 's election if merkel tries to raise taxes on the wealthy . " the failure of chancellor merkel 's candidate wulff to get a majority could easily be the beginning of the end of the coalition , " said schumacher . author : joanna impey -lrb- apn / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp has been told its plans to cap the oil well are insufficient some us lawmakers are demanding that bp suspend its dividend payments until the crisis is resolved .
bp 's chairman carl-henric svanberg has been summoned to a meeting in the white house next wednesday .

during a 30-minute telephone conversation , obama , who said last week he wants to know " whose ass to kick " , reaffirmed america 's " deep commitment to the special and historic relationship " between the us and the uk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron has been under pressure to defend bp but , obama also made it clear that he expects bp to pay for the clean-up costs and meet economic claims from the spill .
bp under pressure cameron , who described the conversation as " warm and constructive " , stressed the importance of bp to the british and other economies , after he came under pressure at home to defend the economic heavyweight .
on friday he said that " it is in everyone 's interests that bp continues to be a financially strong and stable company " .
bp is a staple in british pension funds and accounts for 12 percent of all dividends paid by uk companies .
its share price has plunged by 40 percent since the offshore oil rig blast in the gulf of mexico on april 20 killed 11 people and triggered an environmental disaster , with up to 40,000 barrels of oil a day spilling into the sea and washing up along coastal areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp has been told its plans to cap the oil well are insufficient some us lawmakers are demanding that bp suspend its dividend payments until the crisis is resolved .
bp 's chairman carl-henric svanberg has been summoned to a meeting in the white house next wednesday .
48 hours to improve containment plans meanwhile , bp has been ordered by the us coast guard to come up with an improved containment plan within the next two days , as bp 's plans do not go far enough to have backup resources in place , according to the us military .
us government data released on thursday suggests that the oil flow from the leak is higher than previously thought and could be upwards of 40,000 barrels a day .

nevertheless , the ' socceroos ' still hope to take points off germany on sunday . in germany in 2006 , australia was playing in its first world cup in 32 years and was able to draw upon the hype and euphoria associated with finally breaking such a long drought .
the team was young and represented a genuine surprise package in the tournament - and surprise they did , reaching the round of 16 and losing in controversial circumstances to eventual champions italy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injury has kept kewell from training ahead of the cup but with a starting xi nearly identical to the one that overwhelmed japan 3-1 in the opening match of 2006 , many pundits are wondering whether australia is now four years more experienced , or just four years slower .
the first xi in south africa is expected to mirror the 2006 equivalent , with the exception of striker mark viduka , who has n't played international football since 2007 .
the team played exciting football in 2006 , but the 2010 version of the " socceroos " has not evolved , and there are fears the unit now lacks that crucial blend of youth and experience , of pace and steadiness .
worries galore significant injury clouds have hung over key attacking players harry kewell , who plays his club football at galatasaray , and midfielder brett emerton of blackburn rovers - both of whom only resumed training with the national squad a week before their group d opener against germany .
the likes of midfielders vince grella , also of blackburn , and mark bresciano , whose palermo contract has just expired , have also battled injury in recent months and have played limited first-team football in their respective leagues .
defender craig moore , formerly of glasgow rangers , is also without a club - and at the age of 34 has been fending off concerns he may have lost the speed necessary to match it with the likes of a bastian schweinsteiger , marko marin or mesut oezil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socceroos captain neill is a rock in defense at the back , australia 's great hope lies with veteran goalkeeper mark schwarzer , who , at the age of 37 , has returned to career-best form with europa league finalists fulham .
captain lucas neill is also still considered a rock in defense , but endured an up-and-down season himself , switching from everton to galatasaray in january .
national coach dutchman pim verbeek has sought to dispel the concerns over injuries and lack of game time , insisting a week out from australia 's clash with germany that all his players were now fit and ready to take on the world .
defensive unit but it remains to be seen whether this will equate to match fitness , and whether the socceroos will be in-tune enough to keep up with a youthful germany team displaying at times a mesmerizing brand of attacking football .
moreover , the socceroos are being billed as a team that will offer little in the way of genuine attacking threats of their own , instead presenting themselves as a difficult team to break down in their defensive third - and indeed verbeek 's preferred 4-2-3-1 formation attests to this .
several attack-minded teams play 4-2-3-1 , of course - germany and brazil to name but two - but australia has often lacked the speed and technical proficiency to use the formation in the same way they do .
in its world cup warm-up matches the socceroos struggled to shift the ball quickly enough from the back , through the midfield and up to the lone striker in order to effectively hit teams on the counter-attack .
australia can boast a highly organized team , though no more than most other countries that made it to south africa .
at this level , possessing a tight , well-organized team is the lowest common denominator .
happily underdogs so what does australia have going in its favor ?
the first two words that come to mind are tim cahill , who has enjoyed a solid season with his club everton , and who is without doubt the socceroos ' primary attacking threat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cahill is one aussie making the germans nervous despite his height , or lack thereof , cahill is remarkably good with his head , and has a knack for slipping into the right place at the right time .
he 'll certainly be a handful for the german defense , with national team defender per mertesacker commenting recently that cahill was " one of australia 's most dangerous players and will be their midfield maestro . "
luke wilkshire of dynamo moscow will also be one to keep an eye on .
wilkshire 's crosses and free kicks from the right were a source of several goals during world cup qualifying for the likes of beanpole striker joshua kennedy .
also in australia 's corner will be the knowledge that they 've been written off as also-rans by the other two teams in group d , serbia and ghana .
ghana midfielder sulley muntari commented as recently as thursday that his team would be focusing its attention on games against serbia and germany , with victory against australia all but considered a fait accompli .
this perceived dismissiveness will undoubtedly work in the socceroos ' favor .
never lie down australians see as central to their sporting mentality the ability to rise to an occasion , to thrive against all odds .
australians love an underdog and cherish a squad full of fierce competitors .
australia is also a young country , and sporting success is a big part of its national mythology .
they do n't give up without a fight .
australia is also known as a physical team , with the national squad having been subject to a fitness regime many in the socceroos camp feel is superior to those of other countries .
lucas neill may have stated recently that australia would be happy with a draw against the much-fancied germans come sunday , but do n't take this to mean the socceroos feel they do n't have a chance .
' ' -lsb- germany 's -rsb- record suggests they are the most consistent team in world football , and the pressure is on them to win , " neill said earlier in the week .
" nobody in the world , apart from our team , expects us to beat them .
if we manage to win , we will shock the world . "

moreover , the socceroos are being billed as a team that will offer little in the way of genuine attacking threats of their own , instead presenting themselves as a difficult team to break down in their defensive third - and indeed verbeek 's preferred 4-2-3-1 formation attests to this .
several attack-minded teams play 4-2-3-1 , of course - germany and brazil to name but two - but australia has often lacked the speed and technical proficiency to use the formation in the same way they do .
in its world cup warm-up matches the socceroos struggled to shift the ball quickly enough from the back , through the midfield and up to the lone striker in order to effectively hit teams on the counter-attack .
australia can boast a highly organized team , though no more than most other countries that made it to south africa .
at this level , possessing a tight , well-organized team is the lowest common denominator .
happily underdogs so what does australia have going in its favor ?
the first two words that come to mind are tim cahill , who has enjoyed a solid season with his club everton , and who is without doubt the socceroos ' primary attacking threat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cahill is one aussie making the germans nervous despite his height , or lack thereof , cahill is remarkably good with his head , and has a knack for slipping into the right place at the right time .
he 'll certainly be a handful for the german defense , with national team defender per mertesacker commenting recently that cahill was " one of australia 's most dangerous players and will be their midfield maestro . "
luke wilkshire of dynamo moscow will also be one to keep an eye on .
wilkshire 's crosses and free kicks from the right were a source of several goals during world cup qualifying for the likes of beanpole striker joshua kennedy .
also in australia 's corner will be the knowledge that they 've been written off as also-rans by the other two teams in group d , serbia and ghana .
ghana midfielder sulley muntari commented as recently as thursday that his team would be focusing its attention on games against serbia and germany , with victory against australia all but considered a fait accompli .
this perceived dismissiveness will undoubtedly work in the socceroos ' favor .
never lie down australians see as central to their sporting mentality the ability to rise to an occasion , to thrive against all odds .
australians love an underdog and cherish a squad full of fierce competitors .
australia is also a young country , and sporting success is a big part of its national mythology .
they do n't give up without a fight .
australia is also known as a physical team , with the national squad having been subject to a fitness regime many in the socceroos camp feel is superior to those of other countries .
lucas neill may have stated recently that australia would be happy with a draw against the much-fancied germans come sunday , but do n't take this to mean the socceroos feel they do n't have a chance .
' ' -lsb- germany 's -rsb- record suggests they are the most consistent team in world football , and the pressure is on them to win , " neill said earlier in the week .
" nobody in the world , apart from our team , expects us to beat them .
if we manage to win , we will shock the world . "

nevertheless , the ' socceroos ' still hope to take points off germany on sunday . in germany in 2006 , australia was playing in its first world cup in 32 years and was able to draw upon the hype and euphoria associated with finally breaking such a long drought .
the team was young and represented a genuine surprise package in the tournament - and surprise they did , reaching the round of 16 and losing in controversial circumstances to eventual champions italy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injury has kept kewell from training ahead of the cup but with a starting xi nearly identical to the one that overwhelmed japan 3-1 in the opening match of 2006 , many pundits are wondering whether australia is now four years more experienced , or just four years slower .
the first xi in south africa is expected to mirror the 2006 equivalent , with the exception of striker mark viduka , who has n't played international football since 2007 .
the team played exciting football in 2006 , but the 2010 version of the " socceroos " has not evolved , and there are fears the unit now lacks that crucial blend of youth and experience , of pace and steadiness .
worries galore significant injury clouds have hung over key attacking players harry kewell , who plays his club football at galatasaray , and midfielder brett emerton of blackburn rovers - both of whom only resumed training with the national squad a week before their group d opener against germany .
the likes of midfielders vince grella , also of blackburn , and mark bresciano , whose palermo contract has just expired , have also battled injury in recent months and have played limited first-team football in their respective leagues .
defender craig moore , formerly of glasgow rangers , is also without a club - and at the age of 34 has been fending off concerns he may have lost the speed necessary to match it with the likes of a bastian schweinsteiger , marko marin or mesut oezil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socceroos captain neill is a rock in defense at the back , australia 's great hope lies with veteran goalkeeper mark schwarzer , who , at the age of 37 , has returned to career-best form with europa league finalists fulham .
captain lucas neill is also still considered a rock in defense , but endured an up-and-down season himself , switching from everton to galatasaray in january .
national coach dutchman pim verbeek has sought to dispel the concerns over injuries and lack of game time , insisting a week out from australia 's clash with germany that all his players were now fit and ready to take on the world .
defensive unit but it remains to be seen whether this will equate to match fitness , and whether the socceroos will be in-tune enough to keep up with a youthful germany team displaying at times a mesmerizing brand of attacking football .
moreover , the socceroos are being billed as a team that will offer little in the way of genuine attacking threats of their own , instead presenting themselves as a difficult team to break down in their defensive third - and indeed verbeek 's preferred 4-2-3-1 formation attests to this .
several attack-minded teams play 4-2-3-1 , of course - germany and brazil to name but two - but australia has often lacked the speed and technical proficiency to use the formation in the same way they do .
in its world cup warm-up matches the socceroos struggled to shift the ball quickly enough from the back , through the midfield and up to the lone striker in order to effectively hit teams on the counter-attack .
australia can boast a highly organized team , though no more than most other countries that made it to south africa .
at this level , possessing a tight , well-organized team is the lowest common denominator .
happily underdogs so what does australia have going in its favor ?
the first two words that come to mind are tim cahill , who has enjoyed a solid season with his club everton , and who is without doubt the socceroos ' primary attacking threat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cahill is one aussie making the germans nervous despite his height , or lack thereof , cahill is remarkably good with his head , and has a knack for slipping into the right place at the right time .
he 'll certainly be a handful for the german defense , with national team defender per mertesacker commenting recently that cahill was " one of australia 's most dangerous players and will be their midfield maestro . "
luke wilkshire of dynamo moscow will also be one to keep an eye on .
wilkshire 's crosses and free kicks from the right were a source of several goals during world cup qualifying for the likes of beanpole striker joshua kennedy .
also in australia 's corner will be the knowledge that they 've been written off as also-rans by the other two teams in group d , serbia and ghana .
ghana midfielder sulley muntari commented as recently as thursday that his team would be focusing its attention on games against serbia and germany , with victory against australia all but considered a fait accompli .
this perceived dismissiveness will undoubtedly work in the socceroos ' favor .
never lie down australians see as central to their sporting mentality the ability to rise to an occasion , to thrive against all odds .
australians love an underdog and cherish a squad full of fierce competitors .
australia is also a young country , and sporting success is a big part of its national mythology .
they do n't give up without a fight .
australia is also known as a physical team , with the national squad having been subject to a fitness regime many in the socceroos camp feel is superior to those of other countries .
lucas neill may have stated recently that australia would be happy with a draw against the much-fancied germans come sunday , but do n't take this to mean the socceroos feel they do n't have a chance .
' ' -lsb- germany 's -rsb- record suggests they are the most consistent team in world football , and the pressure is on them to win , " neill said earlier in the week .
" nobody in the world , apart from our team , expects us to beat them .
if we manage to win , we will shock the world . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 13.06.2010 germany 's blend of youth and experience delivers on promise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cacau scored the fourth in a rampant night for germany while the focus was undoubtedly on how germany would begin its world cup campaign on sunday night , plenty of interest was being afforded to joachim loew 's chosen line-up and its promise of attacking football . germany had arrived in south africa with the youngest squad in over 70 years and with an attacking mentality running through the ranks .
casual observers and hardcore german soccer fans were all curious as to how germany 2010 would be set up and whether the promise of exciting , offensive football would just be a smokescreen for a return to the safe , traditional approach of old . this was the first test for the youthful germans in world cup battle proper , pitting the second youngest team at this world cup - after group d opponents ghana - against the oldest in durban 's impressive moses mabhida stadium .
the hugely experienced australians were expected to provide a stern test for this new breed and no-one would have blamed joachim loew for going with a cautious approach in germany 's opening game . instead , the germany coach threw holger badstuber into his back four , sami khedira into the empty midfield shoes of the absent michael ballack while the exciting creative duo of mesut oezil and thomas mueller were charged with opening up the australian defense .
keeping goal was the equally youthful manuel neuer - germany 's new no.1.
loew also had marcel jansen , toni kroos , marko marin and jerome boateng on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sami khedira was outstanding in germany 's midfield neuer looked nervous at kick-off , unsurprisingly given the 22-year-old 's experience only stretched to six games , but an early , safely-gathered ball seemed to settle his nerves . just how much he had settled was obvious just three minutes later when australia had the first clear chance .
the schalke keeper stood up well to block the close-range shot and philipp lahm cleared .
australia 's subsequent sorties found the young schalke stopper in even more confident form , punching clear and smothering at feet like an old pro .
his distribution was also considered and clever . khedira raises the question : michael who ? sami khedira looked to have understood what loew wanted from him in his role as a protector of the back four , which was important as the australians had flown out of the blocks with a surprisingly high-tempo attacking game . young holger badstuber appeared a little shell-shocked when faced with a marauding brett emerson so khedira 's intelligence was a godsend on the left flank on a number of occasions .
as the game wore on , badstuber may have seemed quiet but only because khedira had the left side sewn up in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller -lrb- no.13 -rrb- performed like a seasoned international equally impressive was the stuttgart man 's willingness to play as box-to-box midfielder , popping up regularly in the australian penalty area in support of the attack .
he could have had at least two goals himself .
such was his dynamism that it will not come as a surprise if khedira permanently replaces the fading ballack . germany 's breakthrough had the stamp of youth all over it .
mesut oezil drifted through the midfield and poked a ball beyond the australian defense for thomas mueller to sprint onto .
the bayern munich youngster 's cut back looked too deep but it was inch perfect for lukas podolski to hammer home from the edge of the box . mueller 's performance beyond his years mueller and oezil seemed to be everywhere , one always offering the other an option when the germans attacked .
mueller , playing effectively as a winger at times , was shredding the socceroos left back and delivering the kind of crosses that forwards dream of . his inclusion was being constantly justified as the 20-year-old not only proved to be an integral link in the attacking chain but on more than one occasion he had the chance to put his name on the score sheet .
when he finally hit the net with a goal of his won , it was only what he deserved after a performance beyond his years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose rolled back the years with a goal-scoring return oezil was also constant threat , dancing through tackles at will and showing intelligent movement .
he nearly had a cheeky goal to his name on the half-hour mark but his chip over keeper mark schwarzer was cleared off the line by socceroos captain lucas neill .
ten minutes later the werder bremen star saw another chance go begging after stripping neill for pace . germany 2010 could be a vintage team while a lot of the attacking intent was coming from the youngsters , the execution was coming from the old guard , even if podolski and philipp lahm – the provider for miroslav klose 's goal to make it 2-0 , could hardly be called pensioners . the promised offensive formation and style was truly in evidence and paying off in spades .
the first two goals may have come from the 2006 strike force but the vim and vitality which had proved too much for the aussies was of the 2010 vintage . when cacau came on and made it four after mueller 's goal had put the game out of sight , no-one could say that this was a typical germany performance .
australia had n't been worn down in style of german sides of the past - they had been torn apart by a new approach . germany , with its young stars and experienced heads had delivered on its promise .

casual observers and hardcore german soccer fans were all curious as to how germany 2010 would be set up and whether the promise of exciting , offensive football would just be a smokescreen for a return to the safe , traditional approach of old . this was the first test for the youthful germans in world cup battle proper , pitting the second youngest team at this world cup - after group d opponents ghana - against the oldest in durban 's impressive moses mabhida stadium .
the hugely experienced australians were expected to provide a stern test for this new breed and no-one would have blamed joachim loew for going with a cautious approach in germany 's opening game . instead , the germany coach threw holger badstuber into his back four , sami khedira into the empty midfield shoes of the absent michael ballack while the exciting creative duo of mesut oezil and thomas mueller were charged with opening up the australian defense .
keeping goal was the equally youthful manuel neuer - germany 's new no.1.
loew also had marcel jansen , toni kroos , marko marin and jerome boateng on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sami khedira was outstanding in germany 's midfield neuer looked nervous at kick-off , unsurprisingly given the 22-year-old 's experience only stretched to six games , but an early , safely-gathered ball seemed to settle his nerves . just how much he had settled was obvious just three minutes later when australia had the first clear chance .
the schalke keeper stood up well to block the close-range shot and philipp lahm cleared .
australia 's subsequent sorties found the young schalke stopper in even more confident form , punching clear and smothering at feet like an old pro .
his distribution was also considered and clever . khedira raises the question : michael who ? sami khedira looked to have understood what loew wanted from him in his role as a protector of the back four , which was important as the australians had flown out of the blocks with a surprisingly high-tempo attacking game . young holger badstuber appeared a little shell-shocked when faced with a marauding brett emerson so khedira 's intelligence was a godsend on the left flank on a number of occasions .
as the game wore on , badstuber may have seemed quiet but only because khedira had the left side sewn up in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller -lrb- no.13 -rrb- performed like a seasoned international equally impressive was the stuttgart man 's willingness to play as box-to-box midfielder , popping up regularly in the australian penalty area in support of the attack .
he could have had at least two goals himself .
such was his dynamism that it will not come as a surprise if khedira permanently replaces the fading ballack . germany 's breakthrough had the stamp of youth all over it .
mesut oezil drifted through the midfield and poked a ball beyond the australian defense for thomas mueller to sprint onto .
the bayern munich youngster 's cut back looked too deep but it was inch perfect for lukas podolski to hammer home from the edge of the box . mueller 's performance beyond his years mueller and oezil seemed to be everywhere , one always offering the other an option when the germans attacked .
mueller , playing effectively as a winger at times , was shredding the socceroos left back and delivering the kind of crosses that forwards dream of . his inclusion was being constantly justified as the 20-year-old not only proved to be an integral link in the attacking chain but on more than one occasion he had the chance to put his name on the score sheet .
when he finally hit the net with a goal of his won , it was only what he deserved after a performance beyond his years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose rolled back the years with a goal-scoring return oezil was also constant threat , dancing through tackles at will and showing intelligent movement .
he nearly had a cheeky goal to his name on the half-hour mark but his chip over keeper mark schwarzer was cleared off the line by socceroos captain lucas neill .
ten minutes later the werder bremen star saw another chance go begging after stripping neill for pace . germany 2010 could be a vintage team while a lot of the attacking intent was coming from the youngsters , the execution was coming from the old guard , even if podolski and philipp lahm – the provider for miroslav klose 's goal to make it 2-0 , could hardly be called pensioners . the promised offensive formation and style was truly in evidence and paying off in spades .
the first two goals may have come from the 2006 strike force but the vim and vitality which had proved too much for the aussies was of the 2010 vintage . when cacau came on and made it four after mueller 's goal had put the game out of sight , no-one could say that this was a typical germany performance .

when he finally hit the net with a goal of his won , it was only what he deserved after a performance beyond his years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose rolled back the years with a goal-scoring return oezil was also constant threat , dancing through tackles at will and showing intelligent movement .
he nearly had a cheeky goal to his name on the half-hour mark but his chip over keeper mark schwarzer was cleared off the line by socceroos captain lucas neill .
ten minutes later the werder bremen star saw another chance go begging after stripping neill for pace . germany 2010 could be a vintage team while a lot of the attacking intent was coming from the youngsters , the execution was coming from the old guard , even if podolski and philipp lahm – the provider for miroslav klose 's goal to make it 2-0 , could hardly be called pensioners . the promised offensive formation and style was truly in evidence and paying off in spades .
the first two goals may have come from the 2006 strike force but the vim and vitality which had proved too much for the aussies was of the 2010 vintage . when cacau came on and made it four after mueller 's goal had put the game out of sight , no-one could say that this was a typical germany performance .
australia had n't been worn down in style of german sides of the past - they had been torn apart by a new approach . germany , with its young stars and experienced heads had delivered on its promise .

interior ministry projections show that the party would have 27 seats in the lower house of parliament – one more than the french-speaking socialist -lrb- ps -rrb- . the nva favors an eventual split between the dutch-speaking flanders region and the french-speaking wallonia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de wever has claimed victory head of the party bart de wever declared the nva winners as supporters chanted the slogan " long live a free flanders . " " the nva has won the election today , " said de wever .
" we stand before you with a party that has around 30 percent -lrb- of flemish votes -rrb- . " traditional rivals fall behind the projected figures would make the nva the first separatist party to win more seats than traditional rivals , who wish to keep the 180-year-old state intact . " the people of flanders have voted for change .
we will not disappoint them , " de wever said .
he added that flemish nationalists had to " extend a hand to francophones , " adding that " we need to change the state together . " together with the flemish socialists , the ps could still form the largest group in parliament , making ps leader elio di rupo the next prime minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ps leader elio di rupo could become the country 's next prime minister de wever is reluctant to be the premier of a united belgium and has said that he is not opposed to the country having its first french-speaking premier since 1974 – provided that this would bring more power to flanders . several parties needed the nature of belgium 's parliamentary system , under which parties divide on linguistic as well as policy grounds , means at least four parties will have to agree to form a coalition . tension between the wealthier flanders in the north and the poorer french-speaking walloons in the south has existed for decades and has led to continual problems in the national government . the latest elections were called after the coalition government collapsed in april over a language dispute .
the snap elections came a year ahead of schedule after the belgian government fell in a struggle between french and dutch-speaking parties .

however it was another asamoah - kwadwo asamoah – who ran the game for ghana from the middle of the pitch , conducting play and pushing his team 's attacks forward from deep .
the black stars ' midfielder was certainly a strong candidate for man-of-the-match .
germany 's coaching staff and players will have been watching asamoah 's contribution with interest and may well single him out for special treatment as the most dangerous player in the ghana midfield when they face each other in their final game of group d on june 23 .
ghana midfielder asamoah pivotal to attacking threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghana broke well but resorted to lofted crosses into the box asamoah was the fulcrum of the ghana team on sunday – whether or not he will remain so depends on whether ghana 's serbian coach milovan rajevac brings inter milan 's sulley muntari back into the starting line-up or gives stalwart stephan appiah a run-out .
but on this performance against serbia , it is likely that asamoah will be the man who links ghana 's defense to its attack against the germans .
ghana defended very deeply throughout the match and fell back in large numbers whenever the serbians broke .
as soon as the threat had been neutralized , usually by some desperate defending and bodies being thrown in front of the ball , the play was immediately fed out to asamoah .
from his central position , the udinese midfielder would then run at the retreating serbs .
throughout the game , ghana would stretch the play to the very by-lines with asamoah feeding either prince tagoe on the right or andre ayew on the left .
serbia were dragged out of position by this tactic which allowed gyan and kevin-prince boateng to exploit the vacuum created in front of the serbian defense .
more often or not , however , the ghanaians resorted to lofted balls into the serbian penalty area rather than switching play to the forwards on the edge of the box .
lofted balls no problem for aerially-savvy germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker and friedrich will be ready for any aerial assault if this is a tactic they intend to stick with throughout the group stages , germany 's central defenders will have little trouble cutting out the high balls .
per mertesacker and arne friedrich are both tall players and accomplished in aerial battles .
ghana lacked initiative when running directly at the serbian defense and often headed straight into danger or chose to shoot from distance , which will also play into germany 's hands .
should the tactic of stretching play to the wings also endure , germany 's creative midfield trio of lukas podolski , mesut oezil and thomas mueller will have to be ready to drop back to the edge of their own box while wing-backs philipp lahm and perhaps kevin-prince 's brother jerome will have to watch that they do n't get caught too up-field in support of germany 's attack .
the potential clash of the boateng brothers is another interesting factor ahead of the germany-ghana game .
kevin-prince , a former germany under-21 player before choosing to take his father 's nationality , will have both identity issues and the potential wrath of a nation against him .
it was he who injured germany skipper michael ballack in the fa cup final at the end of the season to end the iconic german 's hopes of playing in south africa .
psychological pressure may affect the youngster 's potential to threaten .
on the attack , germany 's youthful creativity will be looking to exploit ghana 's sometimes erratic and jittery defense .
serbia , who play a less sophisticated version of the german game , caused chaos in ghana 's penalty area and only the lack of killer instinct prevented serbia from punishing this weakness .
competent ball carriers like oezil and mueller could unlock the ghanaians while lukas podolski and perhaps miroslav klose will have plenty of scuffed clearances to pounce on .

joachim loew 's blend of youth and experience opens its world cup campaign against australia in durban on sunday . the proof of the pudding , they say , is in the eating .
germany begin their world cup 2010 campaign against australia on sunday with coach joachim loew remaining true to his pledge that youth will lead the way .
loew experimented with his youth policy throughout qualification with a number of exciting youngsters blooded along the road to south africa but the real test awaits them in durban .
germany will hope that jogi has blended the right ingredients and that his mix of youth and experience does n't sink in the heat of competition like a failed soufflé .
with an average age of around 25 , germany 's likely starting line-up in the moses mabidha stadium will be die mannschaft 's youngest team in over 70 years .
but what it may be lacking in years , it certainly makes up for in excitement and quality .
germany are expected to play in an offensively minded 4-2-3-1 formation , which could include lukas podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either thomas mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either miroslav klose or cacau .
youth at the heart of germany 's creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german young guns kroos , mueller and badstuber much has been written about the wisdom of charging the likes of oezil , mueller and kroos with the job of conducting germany 's attacks , given the fact that these fresh-faced starlets are all short of their 23rd birthdays .
what is mostly forgotten in this analysis is that both oezil and mueller have spent the past season playing against some of the top teams in europe while holding down first-team places in two of germany 's best teams , werder bremen and bayern munich respectively .
kroos , meanwhile , was an instrumental component in bayer leverkusen 's best season in many a year .
germany should therefore have few concerns that these youngsters will be over-awed by the occasion .
and if there are a few jitters , loew has maintained enough of the experienced guard in the side to calm the nerves and help repel what is expected to be a robust socceroos team .
experienced back-up bildunterschrift : loew 's plan to play new stars with experienced players aims to bring germany new energy new captain philipp lahm will command fellow stalwarts per mertesacker and arne friedrich in the back four , all of which will give one of the two talented youngsters holger badstuber or jerome boateng the confidence to take his place in germany 's defensive quartet , safe in the knowledge that his fellow stoppers have been here before .
ahead of them , the increasingly mature and influential bastian schweinsteiger will shepherd the midfield with newcomer sami khedira by his side .
ahead of the creative trio of podolski , oezil and mueller -lrb- or kroos -rrb- - who is likely to get the nod ahead of piotr trochowski - germany may have the old head of miroslav klose to aim for as the chosen lone striker .
while klose has been off the boil for bayern this season , he is still a proven world cup striker who always seems to rise to such an occasion .
germany will hope this is the case again this year as his deputies all come with question marks .
mario gomez and stefan kiessling have never proved convincing at this level , and while cacau has looked good in recent friendlies he has had few appearances in competitive matches in a germany shirt .
" we watched a video of australia on friday and they made a big impression , " said oliver bierhoff , the germany team manager .
" they have not conceded a goal in 17 of their last 27 games , they are sturdy and they will be very focused , " he warned .
socceroos play the waiting game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia were no push-overs in germany in 2006 the australian team will be full of experience with an average age over 30 and are expected to face this young , attacking germany with defense in mind .
a strong defensive game and organization was the key to australia 's strong showing in the 2006 world cup which saw them through to the knockout stage where they were felled by a very debatable penalty decision in extra time against italy - the side who went on to become champions .
the socceroos will send out a team charged with soaking up german pressure , hoping to sap the strength of germany 's youngsters while hoping that star midfielder tim cahill can unlock the defense on the counter-attack .
australia 's dutch coach pim verbeek was hoping that striker harry kewell would be fit enough to spearhead those attacks but the galatasaray forward is unlikely to start after missing all the socceroos ' warm-up games due to injury .
while kewell could well be back to face ghana in the next game , joshua kennedy will continue to fill in for the time being as australia 's lone striker against the germans .

germany begin their world cup 2010 campaign against australia on sunday with coach joachim loew remaining true to his pledge that youth will lead the way .

germany will hope that jogi has blended the right ingredients and that his mix of youth and experience does n't sink in the heat of competition like a failed soufflé .
with an average age of around 25 , germany 's likely starting line-up in the moses mabidha stadium will be die mannschaft 's youngest team in over 70 years .

germany are expected to play in an offensively minded 4-2-3-1 formation , which could include lukas podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either thomas mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either miroslav klose or cacau .

what is mostly forgotten in this analysis is that both oezil and mueller have spent the past season playing against some of the top teams in europe while holding down first-team places in two of germany 's best teams , werder bremen and bayern munich respectively .
kroos , meanwhile , was an instrumental component in bayer leverkusen 's best season in many a year .
germany should therefore have few concerns that these youngsters will be over-awed by the occasion .

a strong defensive game and organization was the key to australia 's strong showing in the 2006 world cup which saw them through to the knockout stage where they were felled by a very debatable penalty decision in extra time against italy - the side who went on to become champions .
the socceroos will send out a team charged with soaking up german pressure , hoping to sap the strength of germany 's youngsters while hoping that star midfielder tim cahill can unlock the defense on the counter-attack .
australia 's dutch coach pim verbeek was hoping that striker harry kewell would be fit enough to spearhead those attacks but the galatasaray forward is unlikely to start after missing all the socceroos ' warm-up games due to injury .
while kewell could well be back to face ghana in the next game , joshua kennedy will continue to fill in for the time being as australia 's lone striker against the germans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 13.06.2010 german world cup starlets looking to catch socceroos on the hop großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to start the world cup in style with a win the moment of truth for germany 's youngest team in over seven decades has arrived .
joachim loew 's blend of youth and experience opens its world cup campaign against australia in durban on sunday . the proof of the pudding , they say , is in the eating .
germany begin their world cup 2010 campaign against australia on sunday with coach joachim loew remaining true to his pledge that youth will lead the way .
loew experimented with his youth policy throughout qualification with a number of exciting youngsters blooded along the road to south africa but the real test awaits them in durban .
germany will hope that jogi has blended the right ingredients and that his mix of youth and experience does n't sink in the heat of competition like a failed soufflé .
with an average age of around 25 , germany 's likely starting line-up in the moses mabidha stadium will be die mannschaft 's youngest team in over 70 years .
but what it may be lacking in years , it certainly makes up for in excitement and quality .
germany are expected to play in an offensively minded 4-2-3-1 formation , which could include lukas podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either thomas mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either miroslav klose or cacau .
youth at the heart of germany 's creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german young guns kroos , mueller and badstuber much has been written about the wisdom of charging the likes of oezil , mueller and kroos with the job of conducting germany 's attacks , given the fact that these fresh-faced starlets are all short of their 23rd birthdays .
what is mostly forgotten in this analysis is that both oezil and mueller have spent the past season playing against some of the top teams in europe while holding down first-team places in two of germany 's best teams , werder bremen and bayern munich respectively .
kroos , meanwhile , was an instrumental component in bayer leverkusen 's best season in many a year .
germany should therefore have few concerns that these youngsters will be over-awed by the occasion .
and if there are a few jitters , loew has maintained enough of the experienced guard in the side to calm the nerves and help repel what is expected to be a robust socceroos team .
experienced back-up bildunterschrift : loew 's plan to play new stars with experienced players aims to bring germany new energy new captain philipp lahm will command fellow stalwarts per mertesacker and arne friedrich in the back four , all of which will give one of the two talented youngsters holger badstuber or jerome boateng the confidence to take his place in germany 's defensive quartet , safe in the knowledge that his fellow stoppers have been here before .
ahead of them , the increasingly mature and influential bastian schweinsteiger will shepherd the midfield with newcomer sami khedira by his side .
ahead of the creative trio of podolski , oezil and mueller -lrb- or kroos -rrb- - who is likely to get the nod ahead of piotr trochowski - germany may have the old head of miroslav klose to aim for as the chosen lone striker .
while klose has been off the boil for bayern this season , he is still a proven world cup striker who always seems to rise to such an occasion .
germany will hope this is the case again this year as his deputies all come with question marks .
mario gomez and stefan kiessling have never proved convincing at this level , and while cacau has looked good in recent friendlies he has had few appearances in competitive matches in a germany shirt .
" we watched a video of australia on friday and they made a big impression , " said oliver bierhoff , the germany team manager .
" they have not conceded a goal in 17 of their last 27 games , they are sturdy and they will be very focused , " he warned .
socceroos play the waiting game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia were no push-overs in germany in 2006 the australian team will be full of experience with an average age over 30 and are expected to face this young , attacking germany with defense in mind .
a strong defensive game and organization was the key to australia 's strong showing in the 2006 world cup which saw them through to the knockout stage where they were felled by a very debatable penalty decision in extra time against italy - the side who went on to become champions .
the socceroos will send out a team charged with soaking up german pressure , hoping to sap the strength of germany 's youngsters while hoping that star midfielder tim cahill can unlock the defense on the counter-attack .
australia 's dutch coach pim verbeek was hoping that striker harry kewell would be fit enough to spearhead those attacks but the galatasaray forward is unlikely to start after missing all the socceroos ' warm-up games due to injury .
while kewell could well be back to face ghana in the next game , joshua kennedy will continue to fill in for the time being as australia 's lone striker against the germans .

max goeldi was at the center of a diplomatic spat between the two countries , which have now signed an agreement to cool tensions . after spending almost two years in a libyan jail for visa offenses , swiss businessman max goeldi is heading back home to switzerland .
it will be the end , many hope , of a fierce diplomatic dispute between bern and tripoli .
goeldi was released from the prison three days ago , and swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey has confirmed that he will be leaving libya sunday .
the conflict dates back to the arrest of a son of libyan leader moammar gadhafi .
the son , hannibal , was arrested for allegedly beating his domestic servants in geneva in july 2008 .
the charges against him were later dropped , but it was the start of a row that the two countries now hope to put behind them .
a few days after hannibal 's arrest , goeldi was detained and not allowed to leave libya .
goeldi has spent the last four months in prison after being convicted of violating immigration rules .
the situation has hurt relations between switzerland and libya , but the two nations have now signed what calmy-rey calls an " action plan " to help repair diplomatic ties .
" goeldi will return to switzerland and this is the start of the normalization of relations between the two countries , " she said .
the price for goeldi 's return home appeared to be a swiss apology for the publication of a leaked police photo of hannibal gadhafi taken while he was under arrest .
libya says the leak was an invasion of his privacy and hurt his reputation .
the swiss foreign minister said her country acknowledged the publication was unlawful , gave an apology and promised to pay hannibal gadhafi compensation if a criminal investigation fails to find who was responsible for the leak .
spain , which currently holds the european union 's rotating presidency , was part of the negotiations in tripoli and the agreement was also signed by a german mediator .

max goeldi was at the center of a diplomatic spat between the two countries , which have now signed an agreement to cool tensions . after spending almost two years in a libyan jail for visa offenses , swiss businessman max goeldi is heading back home to switzerland .
it will be the end , many hope , of a fierce diplomatic dispute between bern and tripoli .
goeldi was released from the prison three days ago , and swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey has confirmed that he will be leaving libya sunday .
the conflict dates back to the arrest of a son of libyan leader moammar gadhafi .
the son , hannibal , was arrested for allegedly beating his domestic servants in geneva in july 2008 .
the charges against him were later dropped , but it was the start of a row that the two countries now hope to put behind them .
a few days after hannibal 's arrest , goeldi was detained and not allowed to leave libya .
goeldi has spent the last four months in prison after being convicted of violating immigration rules .
the situation has hurt relations between switzerland and libya , but the two nations have now signed what calmy-rey calls an " action plan " to help repair diplomatic ties .
" goeldi will return to switzerland and this is the start of the normalization of relations between the two countries , " she said .
the price for goeldi 's return home appeared to be a swiss apology for the publication of a leaked police photo of hannibal gadhafi taken while he was under arrest .
libya says the leak was an invasion of his privacy and hurt his reputation .
the swiss foreign minister said her country acknowledged the publication was unlawful , gave an apology and promised to pay hannibal gadhafi compensation if a criminal investigation fails to find who was responsible for the leak .
spain , which currently holds the european union 's rotating presidency , was part of the negotiations in tripoli and the agreement was also signed by a german mediator .

a majority of germans think her ruling center-right coalition will not last . german chancellor angela merkel reprimanded members of her center-right governing coalition on sunday , calling on them to end their public dispute in order to win back voter trust . insults have been flying back and forth within merkel 's coalition government , exposing a level of vitriol usually seen in exchanges between the government and the opposition , not among members on the same team .
the tenor has forced the german chancellor to speak out to maintain discipline as talk of a coalition on the skids and even new elections fill the air . " we have to show people that we can be relied upon at this difficult time , " she said in an interview in the weekly bild am sonntag newspaper .
" that 's the only way to win back trust . " strong differences of opinion on policy have emerged within merkel 's coalition of conservatives and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on a variety of issues and sharp tongues have not been held . a government spokesman was forced to deny reports that merkel 's chief of staff had described defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg as " rumpelstiltskin , " a fairy tale dwarf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center-right coalition has been plagued by infighting an fdp lawmaker accused bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- of acting like a destructive " wild sow " over health-reform plans .
a senior csu politician retaliated , calling the fdp a " bunch of clowns . " in an uncharacteristically direct appeal , merkel urged her colleagues to restrain themselves . " i assume those involved realize that this behavior is not acceptable , " she said in the bild am sonntag . " this should not and will not set a precedent . " merkel denied that her authority as chancellor has suffered because of the row . polls show drop in confidence but the infighting has caused some experts to predict the downfall of merkel 's coalition government . " the current level of conflict between the conservatives and fdp certainly goes beyond what is normal and some commentators have started to question the stability of the government , " goldman sachs economist dirk schumacher told the reuters news agency . more than half of german citizens do not expect merkel 's coalition government to survive for the next three years .
according to a survey for the bild am sonntag paper , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the coalition would collapse before the end of its legislative period . a survey conducted for the german broadcaster ard also showed that only 40 percent of germans expect the coalition to last its full term . merkel is under pressure to seize the political initiative and boost her party 's support , which is languishing at four-year lows according to recent polls . all eyes on the presidential election the is one immediate hurdle that analysts say merkel must overcome to ensure her coalition 's future .
she faces an unexpected battle to get christian wulff , the conservative leader of the state lower saxony , elected president on june 30 by the federal council , a 1,200-strong body convened to elect the head of state .
the previous president , horst koehler , resigned suddenly last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coalition hopes are pinned on presidential candidate christian wulff the candidate put forward by the opposition social democrats and greens , joachim gauck , poses a strong challenge and is being widely praised in the german media as the better choice . some provincial leaders of the fdp have even suggested they might try to obstruct wulff 's election if merkel tries to raise taxes on the wealthy . " the failure of chancellor merkel 's candidate wulff to get a majority could easily be the beginning of the end of the coalition , " said schumacher . author : joanna impey -lrb- apn / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a majority of germans think her ruling center-right coalition will not last . german chancellor angela merkel reprimanded members of her center-right governing coalition on sunday , calling on them to end their public dispute in order to win back voter trust . insults have been flying back and forth within merkel 's coalition government , exposing a level of vitriol usually seen in exchanges between the government and the opposition , not among members on the same team .
the tenor has forced the german chancellor to speak out to maintain discipline as talk of a coalition on the skids and even new elections fill the air . " we have to show people that we can be relied upon at this difficult time , " she said in an interview in the weekly bild am sonntag newspaper .
" that 's the only way to win back trust . " strong differences of opinion on policy have emerged within merkel 's coalition of conservatives and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on a variety of issues and sharp tongues have not been held . a government spokesman was forced to deny reports that merkel 's chief of staff had described defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg as " rumpelstiltskin , " a fairy tale dwarf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center-right coalition has been plagued by infighting an fdp lawmaker accused bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- of acting like a destructive " wild sow " over health-reform plans .
a senior csu politician retaliated , calling the fdp a " bunch of clowns . " in an uncharacteristically direct appeal , merkel urged her colleagues to restrain themselves . " i assume those involved realize that this behavior is not acceptable , " she said in the bild am sonntag . " this should not and will not set a precedent . " merkel denied that her authority as chancellor has suffered because of the row . polls show drop in confidence but the infighting has caused some experts to predict the downfall of merkel 's coalition government . " the current level of conflict between the conservatives and fdp certainly goes beyond what is normal and some commentators have started to question the stability of the government , " goldman sachs economist dirk schumacher told the reuters news agency . more than half of german citizens do not expect merkel 's coalition government to survive for the next three years .
according to a survey for the bild am sonntag paper , 55 percent of those questioned said they thought the coalition would collapse before the end of its legislative period . a survey conducted for the german broadcaster ard also showed that only 40 percent of germans expect the coalition to last its full term . merkel is under pressure to seize the political initiative and boost her party 's support , which is languishing at four-year lows according to recent polls . all eyes on the presidential election the is one immediate hurdle that analysts say merkel must overcome to ensure her coalition 's future .
she faces an unexpected battle to get christian wulff , the conservative leader of the state lower saxony , elected president on june 30 by the federal council , a 1,200-strong body convened to elect the head of state .
the previous president , horst koehler , resigned suddenly last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coalition hopes are pinned on presidential candidate christian wulff the candidate put forward by the opposition social democrats and greens , joachim gauck , poses a strong challenge and is being widely praised in the german media as the better choice . some provincial leaders of the fdp have even suggested they might try to obstruct wulff 's election if merkel tries to raise taxes on the wealthy . " the failure of chancellor merkel 's candidate wulff to get a majority could easily be the beginning of the end of the coalition , " said schumacher . author : joanna impey -lrb- apn / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 13.06.2010 germany 's blend of youth and experience delivers on promise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cacau scored the fourth in a rampant night for germany while the focus was undoubtedly on how germany would begin its world cup campaign on sunday night , plenty of interest was being afforded to joachim loew 's chosen line-up and its promise of attacking football . germany had arrived in south africa with the youngest squad in over 70 years and with an attacking mentality running through the ranks .
casual observers and hardcore german soccer fans were all curious as to how germany 2010 would be set up and whether the promise of exciting , offensive football would just be a smokescreen for a return to the safe , traditional approach of old . this was the first test for the youthful germans in world cup battle proper , pitting the second youngest team at this world cup - after group d opponents ghana - against the oldest in durban 's impressive moses mabhida stadium .
the hugely experienced australians were expected to provide a stern test for this new breed and no-one would have blamed joachim loew for going with a cautious approach in germany 's opening game . instead , the germany coach threw holger badstuber into his back four , sami khedira into the empty midfield shoes of the absent michael ballack while the exciting creative duo of mesut oezil and thomas mueller were charged with opening up the australian defense .
keeping goal was the equally youthful manuel neuer - germany 's new no.1.
loew also had marcel jansen , toni kroos , marko marin and jerome boateng on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sami khedira was outstanding in germany 's midfield neuer looked nervous at kick-off , unsurprisingly given the 22-year-old 's experience only stretched to six games , but an early , safely-gathered ball seemed to settle his nerves . just how much he had settled was obvious just three minutes later when australia had the first clear chance .
the schalke keeper stood up well to block the close-range shot and philipp lahm cleared .
australia 's subsequent sorties found the young schalke stopper in even more confident form , punching clear and smothering at feet like an old pro .
his distribution was also considered and clever . khedira raises the question : michael who ? sami khedira looked to have understood what loew wanted from him in his role as a protector of the back four , which was important as the australians had flown out of the blocks with a surprisingly high-tempo attacking game . young holger badstuber appeared a little shell-shocked when faced with a marauding brett emerson so khedira 's intelligence was a godsend on the left flank on a number of occasions .
as the game wore on , badstuber may have seemed quiet but only because khedira had the left side sewn up in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller -lrb- no.13 -rrb- performed like a seasoned international equally impressive was the stuttgart man 's willingness to play as box-to-box midfielder , popping up regularly in the australian penalty area in support of the attack .
he could have had at least two goals himself .
such was his dynamism that it will not come as a surprise if khedira permanently replaces the fading ballack . germany 's breakthrough had the stamp of youth all over it .
mesut oezil drifted through the midfield and poked a ball beyond the australian defense for thomas mueller to sprint onto .
the bayern munich youngster 's cut back looked too deep but it was inch perfect for lukas podolski to hammer home from the edge of the box . mueller 's performance beyond his years mueller and oezil seemed to be everywhere , one always offering the other an option when the germans attacked .
mueller , playing effectively as a winger at times , was shredding the socceroos left back and delivering the kind of crosses that forwards dream of . his inclusion was being constantly justified as the 20-year-old not only proved to be an integral link in the attacking chain but on more than one occasion he had the chance to put his name on the score sheet .
when he finally hit the net with a goal of his won , it was only what he deserved after a performance beyond his years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose rolled back the years with a goal-scoring return oezil was also constant threat , dancing through tackles at will and showing intelligent movement .
he nearly had a cheeky goal to his name on the half-hour mark but his chip over keeper mark schwarzer was cleared off the line by socceroos captain lucas neill .
ten minutes later the werder bremen star saw another chance go begging after stripping neill for pace . germany 2010 could be a vintage team while a lot of the attacking intent was coming from the youngsters , the execution was coming from the old guard , even if podolski and philipp lahm – the provider for miroslav klose 's goal to make it 2-0 , could hardly be called pensioners . the promised offensive formation and style was truly in evidence and paying off in spades .
the first two goals may have come from the 2006 strike force but the vim and vitality which had proved too much for the aussies was of the 2010 vintage . when cacau came on and made it four after mueller 's goal had put the game out of sight , no-one could say that this was a typical germany performance .
australia had n't been worn down in style of german sides of the past - they had been torn apart by a new approach . germany , with its young stars and experienced heads had delivered on its promise .

max goeldi was at the center of a diplomatic spat between the two countries , which have now signed an agreement to cool tensions . after spending almost two years in a libyan jail for visa offenses , swiss businessman max goeldi is heading back home to switzerland .
it will be the end , many hope , of a fierce diplomatic dispute between bern and tripoli .
goeldi was released from the prison three days ago , and swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey has confirmed that he will be leaving libya sunday .
the conflict dates back to the arrest of a son of libyan leader moammar gadhafi .
the son , hannibal , was arrested for allegedly beating his domestic servants in geneva in july 2008 .
the charges against him were later dropped , but it was the start of a row that the two countries now hope to put behind them .
a few days after hannibal 's arrest , goeldi was detained and not allowed to leave libya .
goeldi has spent the last four months in prison after being convicted of violating immigration rules .
the situation has hurt relations between switzerland and libya , but the two nations have now signed what calmy-rey calls an " action plan " to help repair diplomatic ties .
" goeldi will return to switzerland and this is the start of the normalization of relations between the two countries , " she said .
the price for goeldi 's return home appeared to be a swiss apology for the publication of a leaked police photo of hannibal gadhafi taken while he was under arrest .
libya says the leak was an invasion of his privacy and hurt his reputation .
the swiss foreign minister said her country acknowledged the publication was unlawful , gave an apology and promised to pay hannibal gadhafi compensation if a criminal investigation fails to find who was responsible for the leak .
spain , which currently holds the european union 's rotating presidency , was part of the negotiations in tripoli and the agreement was also signed by a german mediator .

during a 30-minute telephone conversation , obama , who said last week he wants to know " whose ass to kick " , reaffirmed america 's " deep commitment to the special and historic relationship " between the us and the uk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron has been under pressure to defend bp but , obama also made it clear that he expects bp to pay for the clean-up costs and meet economic claims from the spill .
bp under pressure cameron , who described the conversation as " warm and constructive " , stressed the importance of bp to the british and other economies , after he came under pressure at home to defend the economic heavyweight .
on friday he said that " it is in everyone 's interests that bp continues to be a financially strong and stable company " .
bp is a staple in british pension funds and accounts for 12 percent of all dividends paid by uk companies .
its share price has plunged by 40 percent since the offshore oil rig blast in the gulf of mexico on april 20 killed 11 people and triggered an environmental disaster , with up to 40,000 barrels of oil a day spilling into the sea and washing up along coastal areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp has been told its plans to cap the oil well are insufficient some us lawmakers are demanding that bp suspend its dividend payments until the crisis is resolved .
bp 's chairman carl-henric svanberg has been summoned to a meeting in the white house next wednesday .
48 hours to improve containment plans meanwhile , bp has been ordered by the us coast guard to come up with an improved containment plan within the next two days , as bp 's plans do not go far enough to have backup resources in place , according to the us military .
us government data released on thursday suggests that the oil flow from the leak is higher than previously thought and could be upwards of 40,000 barrels a day .

german head coach joachim loew made the full-back captain of the national team in south africa . without analyzing his game , it 's hard to believe that the likely new germany captain philipp lahm has been one of the world 's best full backs for over six years now .
the bayern munich defender just does n't look old enough to have been at the top of the game in his position for that long .
yet he has been an integral player for both club and country since his appearances at euro 2004 first caught the eye .
lahm is not only coveted by the likes of barcelona and manchester united for his prowess in the full back role but also because of his versatility .
as comfortable on the left as on the right , lahm has shown his pace , dribbling and crossing abilities from both flanks .
he has even played as an emergency holding midfielder and left-winger in his career , showing an aptitude for both .
the diminutive defender -lrb- 170cm , or 5 ' 7 " -rrb- is a handful in full gallop , his small stature and low center of gravity making it very hard for opponents to knock him off the ball .
he also packs a powerful shot with his strong right foot , utilized as a potent weapon by both bayern and germany .
bildunterschrift : lahm 's tireless running and tackling has been key to bayern and germany 's success mr. consistency lahm rarely has a bad game for either club or country and has stood out at each international tournament he has played in since making his germany debut in february 2004 .
lahm clearly relishes the biggest of stages .
outstanding campaigns at the european championships in 2004 and 2008 , and a starring role in germany 's 2006 world cup campaign have only added to a reputation cultivated through top-notch domestic service , first with stuttgart and then bayern .
starting the 2006 world cup in style with the opening goal of the tournament , scored with a looping shot against costa rica , lahm went on to become the only german player to play all 690 minutes of the host nation 's campaign .
six months after the tournament , he was nominated for the fifa world player of the year award and was included in the mastercard all star team of 2006 .
two years later , after another impressive tournament at euro 2008 , he was included in the uefa team of the tournament .
this season with bayern , he was also a unanimous selection for dw 's bundesliga best xi .
lahm brings a wealth of experience to the germany team and it 's no surprise that he has been chosen to wear the captain 's armband following michael ballack 's ankle injury .
the bayern defender 's consistency and leadership will be vital to germany 's hopes of returning home from south africa with the world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 13.06.2010 germany 's blend of youth and experience delivers on promise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cacau scored the fourth in a rampant night for germany while the focus was undoubtedly on how germany would begin its world cup campaign on sunday night , plenty of interest was being afforded to joachim loew 's chosen line-up and its promise of attacking football . germany had arrived in south africa with the youngest squad in over 70 years and with an attacking mentality running through the ranks .
casual observers and hardcore german soccer fans were all curious as to how germany 2010 would be set up and whether the promise of exciting , offensive football would just be a smokescreen for a return to the safe , traditional approach of old . this was the first test for the youthful germans in world cup battle proper , pitting the second youngest team at this world cup - after group d opponents ghana - against the oldest in durban 's impressive moses mabhida stadium .
the hugely experienced australians were expected to provide a stern test for this new breed and no-one would have blamed joachim loew for going with a cautious approach in germany 's opening game . instead , the germany coach threw holger badstuber into his back four , sami khedira into the empty midfield shoes of the absent michael ballack while the exciting creative duo of mesut oezil and thomas mueller were charged with opening up the australian defense .
keeping goal was the equally youthful manuel neuer - germany 's new no.1.
loew also had marcel jansen , toni kroos , marko marin and jerome boateng on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sami khedira was outstanding in germany 's midfield neuer looked nervous at kick-off , unsurprisingly given the 22-year-old 's experience only stretched to six games , but an early , safely-gathered ball seemed to settle his nerves . just how much he had settled was obvious just three minutes later when australia had the first clear chance .
the schalke keeper stood up well to block the close-range shot and philipp lahm cleared .
australia 's subsequent sorties found the young schalke stopper in even more confident form , punching clear and smothering at feet like an old pro .
his distribution was also considered and clever . khedira raises the question : michael who ? sami khedira looked to have understood what loew wanted from him in his role as a protector of the back four , which was important as the australians had flown out of the blocks with a surprisingly high-tempo attacking game . young holger badstuber appeared a little shell-shocked when faced with a marauding brett emerson so khedira 's intelligence was a godsend on the left flank on a number of occasions .
as the game wore on , badstuber may have seemed quiet but only because khedira had the left side sewn up in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller -lrb- no.13 -rrb- performed like a seasoned international equally impressive was the stuttgart man 's willingness to play as box-to-box midfielder , popping up regularly in the australian penalty area in support of the attack .
he could have had at least two goals himself .
such was his dynamism that it will not come as a surprise if khedira permanently replaces the fading ballack . germany 's breakthrough had the stamp of youth all over it .
mesut oezil drifted through the midfield and poked a ball beyond the australian defense for thomas mueller to sprint onto .
the bayern munich youngster 's cut back looked too deep but it was inch perfect for lukas podolski to hammer home from the edge of the box . mueller 's performance beyond his years mueller and oezil seemed to be everywhere , one always offering the other an option when the germans attacked .
mueller , playing effectively as a winger at times , was shredding the socceroos left back and delivering the kind of crosses that forwards dream of . his inclusion was being constantly justified as the 20-year-old not only proved to be an integral link in the attacking chain but on more than one occasion he had the chance to put his name on the score sheet .
when he finally hit the net with a goal of his won , it was only what he deserved after a performance beyond his years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose rolled back the years with a goal-scoring return oezil was also constant threat , dancing through tackles at will and showing intelligent movement .
he nearly had a cheeky goal to his name on the half-hour mark but his chip over keeper mark schwarzer was cleared off the line by socceroos captain lucas neill .
ten minutes later the werder bremen star saw another chance go begging after stripping neill for pace . germany 2010 could be a vintage team while a lot of the attacking intent was coming from the youngsters , the execution was coming from the old guard , even if podolski and philipp lahm – the provider for miroslav klose 's goal to make it 2-0 , could hardly be called pensioners . the promised offensive formation and style was truly in evidence and paying off in spades .
the first two goals may have come from the 2006 strike force but the vim and vitality which had proved too much for the aussies was of the 2010 vintage . when cacau came on and made it four after mueller 's goal had put the game out of sight , no-one could say that this was a typical germany performance .
australia had n't been worn down in style of german sides of the past - they had been torn apart by a new approach . germany , with its young stars and experienced heads had delivered on its promise .

several attack-minded teams play 4-2-3-1 , of course - germany and brazil to name but two - but australia has often lacked the speed and technical proficiency to use the formation in the same way they do .

australia is also a young country , and sporting success is a big part of its national mythology .
they do n't give up without a fight .
australia is also known as a physical team , with the national squad having been subject to a fitness regime many in the socceroos camp feel is superior to those of other countries .

nevertheless , the ' socceroos ' still hope to take points off germany on sunday . in germany in 2006 , australia was playing in its first world cup in 32 years and was able to draw upon the hype and euphoria associated with finally breaking such a long drought .
the team was young and represented a genuine surprise package in the tournament - and surprise they did , reaching the round of 16 and losing in controversial circumstances to eventual champions italy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injury has kept kewell from training ahead of the cup but with a starting xi nearly identical to the one that overwhelmed japan 3-1 in the opening match of 2006 , many pundits are wondering whether australia is now four years more experienced , or just four years slower .
the first xi in south africa is expected to mirror the 2006 equivalent , with the exception of striker mark viduka , who has n't played international football since 2007 .
the team played exciting football in 2006 , but the 2010 version of the " socceroos " has not evolved , and there are fears the unit now lacks that crucial blend of youth and experience , of pace and steadiness .
worries galore significant injury clouds have hung over key attacking players harry kewell , who plays his club football at galatasaray , and midfielder brett emerton of blackburn rovers - both of whom only resumed training with the national squad a week before their group d opener against germany .
the likes of midfielders vince grella , also of blackburn , and mark bresciano , whose palermo contract has just expired , have also battled injury in recent months and have played limited first-team football in their respective leagues .
defender craig moore , formerly of glasgow rangers , is also without a club - and at the age of 34 has been fending off concerns he may have lost the speed necessary to match it with the likes of a bastian schweinsteiger , marko marin or mesut oezil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socceroos captain neill is a rock in defense at the back , australia 's great hope lies with veteran goalkeeper mark schwarzer , who , at the age of 37 , has returned to career-best form with europa league finalists fulham .
captain lucas neill is also still considered a rock in defense , but endured an up-and-down season himself , switching from everton to galatasaray in january .
national coach dutchman pim verbeek has sought to dispel the concerns over injuries and lack of game time , insisting a week out from australia 's clash with germany that all his players were now fit and ready to take on the world .
defensive unit but it remains to be seen whether this will equate to match fitness , and whether the socceroos will be in-tune enough to keep up with a youthful germany team displaying at times a mesmerizing brand of attacking football .
moreover , the socceroos are being billed as a team that will offer little in the way of genuine attacking threats of their own , instead presenting themselves as a difficult team to break down in their defensive third - and indeed verbeek 's preferred 4-2-3-1 formation attests to this .
several attack-minded teams play 4-2-3-1 , of course - germany and brazil to name but two - but australia has often lacked the speed and technical proficiency to use the formation in the same way they do .
in its world cup warm-up matches the socceroos struggled to shift the ball quickly enough from the back , through the midfield and up to the lone striker in order to effectively hit teams on the counter-attack .
australia can boast a highly organized team , though no more than most other countries that made it to south africa .
at this level , possessing a tight , well-organized team is the lowest common denominator .
happily underdogs so what does australia have going in its favor ?
the first two words that come to mind are tim cahill , who has enjoyed a solid season with his club everton , and who is without doubt the socceroos ' primary attacking threat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cahill is one aussie making the germans nervous despite his height , or lack thereof , cahill is remarkably good with his head , and has a knack for slipping into the right place at the right time .
he 'll certainly be a handful for the german defense , with national team defender per mertesacker commenting recently that cahill was " one of australia 's most dangerous players and will be their midfield maestro . "
luke wilkshire of dynamo moscow will also be one to keep an eye on .
wilkshire 's crosses and free kicks from the right were a source of several goals during world cup qualifying for the likes of beanpole striker joshua kennedy .
also in australia 's corner will be the knowledge that they 've been written off as also-rans by the other two teams in group d , serbia and ghana .
ghana midfielder sulley muntari commented as recently as thursday that his team would be focusing its attention on games against serbia and germany , with victory against australia all but considered a fait accompli .
this perceived dismissiveness will undoubtedly work in the socceroos ' favor .
never lie down australians see as central to their sporting mentality the ability to rise to an occasion , to thrive against all odds .
australians love an underdog and cherish a squad full of fierce competitors .
australia is also a young country , and sporting success is a big part of its national mythology .

during a 30-minute telephone conversation , obama , who said last week he wants to know " whose ass to kick " , reaffirmed america 's " deep commitment to the special and historic relationship " between the us and the uk .

bp is a staple in british pension funds and accounts for 12 percent of all dividends paid by uk companies .

during a 30-minute telephone conversation , obama , who said last week he wants to know " whose ass to kick " , reaffirmed america 's " deep commitment to the special and historic relationship " between the us and the uk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron has been under pressure to defend bp but , obama also made it clear that he expects bp to pay for the clean-up costs and meet economic claims from the spill .
bp under pressure cameron , who described the conversation as " warm and constructive " , stressed the importance of bp to the british and other economies , after he came under pressure at home to defend the economic heavyweight .
on friday he said that " it is in everyone 's interests that bp continues to be a financially strong and stable company " .
bp is a staple in british pension funds and accounts for 12 percent of all dividends paid by uk companies .
its share price has plunged by 40 percent since the offshore oil rig blast in the gulf of mexico on april 20 killed 11 people and triggered an environmental disaster , with up to 40,000 barrels of oil a day spilling into the sea and washing up along coastal areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp has been told its plans to cap the oil well are insufficient some us lawmakers are demanding that bp suspend its dividend payments until the crisis is resolved .
bp 's chairman carl-henric svanberg has been summoned to a meeting in the white house next wednesday .
48 hours to improve containment plans meanwhile , bp has been ordered by the us coast guard to come up with an improved containment plan within the next two days , as bp 's plans do not go far enough to have backup resources in place , according to the us military .
us government data released on thursday suggests that the oil flow from the leak is higher than previously thought and could be upwards of 40,000 barrels a day .

nevertheless , the ' socceroos ' still hope to take points off germany on sunday . in germany in 2006 , australia was playing in its first world cup in 32 years and was able to draw upon the hype and euphoria associated with finally breaking such a long drought .
the team was young and represented a genuine surprise package in the tournament - and surprise they did , reaching the round of 16 and losing in controversial circumstances to eventual champions italy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injury has kept kewell from training ahead of the cup but with a starting xi nearly identical to the one that overwhelmed japan 3-1 in the opening match of 2006 , many pundits are wondering whether australia is now four years more experienced , or just four years slower .
the first xi in south africa is expected to mirror the 2006 equivalent , with the exception of striker mark viduka , who has n't played international football since 2007 .
the team played exciting football in 2006 , but the 2010 version of the " socceroos " has not evolved , and there are fears the unit now lacks that crucial blend of youth and experience , of pace and steadiness .
worries galore significant injury clouds have hung over key attacking players harry kewell , who plays his club football at galatasaray , and midfielder brett emerton of blackburn rovers - both of whom only resumed training with the national squad a week before their group d opener against germany .
the likes of midfielders vince grella , also of blackburn , and mark bresciano , whose palermo contract has just expired , have also battled injury in recent months and have played limited first-team football in their respective leagues .
defender craig moore , formerly of glasgow rangers , is also without a club - and at the age of 34 has been fending off concerns he may have lost the speed necessary to match it with the likes of a bastian schweinsteiger , marko marin or mesut oezil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socceroos captain neill is a rock in defense at the back , australia 's great hope lies with veteran goalkeeper mark schwarzer , who , at the age of 37 , has returned to career-best form with europa league finalists fulham .
captain lucas neill is also still considered a rock in defense , but endured an up-and-down season himself , switching from everton to galatasaray in january .
national coach dutchman pim verbeek has sought to dispel the concerns over injuries and lack of game time , insisting a week out from australia 's clash with germany that all his players were now fit and ready to take on the world .
defensive unit but it remains to be seen whether this will equate to match fitness , and whether the socceroos will be in-tune enough to keep up with a youthful germany team displaying at times a mesmerizing brand of attacking football .
moreover , the socceroos are being billed as a team that will offer little in the way of genuine attacking threats of their own , instead presenting themselves as a difficult team to break down in their defensive third - and indeed verbeek 's preferred 4-2-3-1 formation attests to this .
several attack-minded teams play 4-2-3-1 , of course - germany and brazil to name but two - but australia has often lacked the speed and technical proficiency to use the formation in the same way they do .
in its world cup warm-up matches the socceroos struggled to shift the ball quickly enough from the back , through the midfield and up to the lone striker in order to effectively hit teams on the counter-attack .
australia can boast a highly organized team , though no more than most other countries that made it to south africa .
at this level , possessing a tight , well-organized team is the lowest common denominator .
happily underdogs so what does australia have going in its favor ?
the first two words that come to mind are tim cahill , who has enjoyed a solid season with his club everton , and who is without doubt the socceroos ' primary attacking threat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cahill is one aussie making the germans nervous despite his height , or lack thereof , cahill is remarkably good with his head , and has a knack for slipping into the right place at the right time .
he 'll certainly be a handful for the german defense , with national team defender per mertesacker commenting recently that cahill was " one of australia 's most dangerous players and will be their midfield maestro . "
luke wilkshire of dynamo moscow will also be one to keep an eye on .
wilkshire 's crosses and free kicks from the right were a source of several goals during world cup qualifying for the likes of beanpole striker joshua kennedy .
also in australia 's corner will be the knowledge that they 've been written off as also-rans by the other two teams in group d , serbia and ghana .
ghana midfielder sulley muntari commented as recently as thursday that his team would be focusing its attention on games against serbia and germany , with victory against australia all but considered a fait accompli .
this perceived dismissiveness will undoubtedly work in the socceroos ' favor .
never lie down australians see as central to their sporting mentality the ability to rise to an occasion , to thrive against all odds .
australians love an underdog and cherish a squad full of fierce competitors .
australia is also a young country , and sporting success is a big part of its national mythology .
they do n't give up without a fight .
australia is also known as a physical team , with the national squad having been subject to a fitness regime many in the socceroos camp feel is superior to those of other countries .
lucas neill may have stated recently that australia would be happy with a draw against the much-fancied germans come sunday , but do n't take this to mean the socceroos feel they do n't have a chance .
' ' -lsb- germany 's -rsb- record suggests they are the most consistent team in world football , and the pressure is on them to win , " neill said earlier in the week .
" nobody in the world , apart from our team , expects us to beat them .
if we manage to win , we will shock the world . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 13.06.2010 germany 's blend of youth and experience delivers on promise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cacau scored the fourth in a rampant night for germany while the focus was undoubtedly on how germany would begin its world cup campaign on sunday night , plenty of interest was being afforded to joachim loew 's chosen line-up and its promise of attacking football . germany had arrived in south africa with the youngest squad in over 70 years and with an attacking mentality running through the ranks .
casual observers and hardcore german soccer fans were all curious as to how germany 2010 would be set up and whether the promise of exciting , offensive football would just be a smokescreen for a return to the safe , traditional approach of old . this was the first test for the youthful germans in world cup battle proper , pitting the second youngest team at this world cup - after group d opponents ghana - against the oldest in durban 's impressive moses mabhida stadium .
the hugely experienced australians were expected to provide a stern test for this new breed and no-one would have blamed joachim loew for going with a cautious approach in germany 's opening game . instead , the germany coach threw holger badstuber into his back four , sami khedira into the empty midfield shoes of the absent michael ballack while the exciting creative duo of mesut oezil and thomas mueller were charged with opening up the australian defense .
keeping goal was the equally youthful manuel neuer - germany 's new no.1.
loew also had marcel jansen , toni kroos , marko marin and jerome boateng on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sami khedira was outstanding in germany 's midfield neuer looked nervous at kick-off , unsurprisingly given the 22-year-old 's experience only stretched to six games , but an early , safely-gathered ball seemed to settle his nerves . just how much he had settled was obvious just three minutes later when australia had the first clear chance .
the schalke keeper stood up well to block the close-range shot and philipp lahm cleared .
australia 's subsequent sorties found the young schalke stopper in even more confident form , punching clear and smothering at feet like an old pro .
his distribution was also considered and clever . khedira raises the question : michael who ? sami khedira looked to have understood what loew wanted from him in his role as a protector of the back four , which was important as the australians had flown out of the blocks with a surprisingly high-tempo attacking game . young holger badstuber appeared a little shell-shocked when faced with a marauding brett emerson so khedira 's intelligence was a godsend on the left flank on a number of occasions .
as the game wore on , badstuber may have seemed quiet but only because khedira had the left side sewn up in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller -lrb- no.13 -rrb- performed like a seasoned international equally impressive was the stuttgart man 's willingness to play as box-to-box midfielder , popping up regularly in the australian penalty area in support of the attack .
he could have had at least two goals himself .
such was his dynamism that it will not come as a surprise if khedira permanently replaces the fading ballack . germany 's breakthrough had the stamp of youth all over it .
mesut oezil drifted through the midfield and poked a ball beyond the australian defense for thomas mueller to sprint onto .
the bayern munich youngster 's cut back looked too deep but it was inch perfect for lukas podolski to hammer home from the edge of the box . mueller 's performance beyond his years mueller and oezil seemed to be everywhere , one always offering the other an option when the germans attacked .
mueller , playing effectively as a winger at times , was shredding the socceroos left back and delivering the kind of crosses that forwards dream of . his inclusion was being constantly justified as the 20-year-old not only proved to be an integral link in the attacking chain but on more than one occasion he had the chance to put his name on the score sheet .
when he finally hit the net with a goal of his won , it was only what he deserved after a performance beyond his years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose rolled back the years with a goal-scoring return oezil was also constant threat , dancing through tackles at will and showing intelligent movement .
he nearly had a cheeky goal to his name on the half-hour mark but his chip over keeper mark schwarzer was cleared off the line by socceroos captain lucas neill .
ten minutes later the werder bremen star saw another chance go begging after stripping neill for pace . germany 2010 could be a vintage team while a lot of the attacking intent was coming from the youngsters , the execution was coming from the old guard , even if podolski and philipp lahm – the provider for miroslav klose 's goal to make it 2-0 , could hardly be called pensioners . the promised offensive formation and style was truly in evidence and paying off in spades .
the first two goals may have come from the 2006 strike force but the vim and vitality which had proved too much for the aussies was of the 2010 vintage . when cacau came on and made it four after mueller 's goal had put the game out of sight , no-one could say that this was a typical germany performance .
australia had n't been worn down in style of german sides of the past - they had been torn apart by a new approach . germany , with its young stars and experienced heads had delivered on its promise .

interior ministry projections show that the party would have 27 seats in the lower house of parliament – one more than the french-speaking socialist -lrb- ps -rrb- . the nva favors an eventual split between the dutch-speaking flanders region and the french-speaking wallonia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de wever has claimed victory head of the party bart de wever declared the nva winners as supporters chanted the slogan " long live a free flanders .

the snap elections came a year ahead of schedule after the belgian government fell in a struggle between french and dutch-speaking parties .

however it was another asamoah - kwadwo asamoah – who ran the game for ghana from the middle of the pitch , conducting play and pushing his team 's attacks forward from deep .
the black stars ' midfielder was certainly a strong candidate for man-of-the-match .
germany 's coaching staff and players will have been watching asamoah 's contribution with interest and may well single him out for special treatment as the most dangerous player in the ghana midfield when they face each other in their final game of group d on june 23 .
ghana midfielder asamoah pivotal to attacking threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghana broke well but resorted to lofted crosses into the box asamoah was the fulcrum of the ghana team on sunday – whether or not he will remain so depends on whether ghana 's serbian coach milovan rajevac brings inter milan 's sulley muntari back into the starting line-up or gives stalwart stephan appiah a run-out .
but on this performance against serbia , it is likely that asamoah will be the man who links ghana 's defense to its attack against the germans .
ghana defended very deeply throughout the match and fell back in large numbers whenever the serbians broke .
as soon as the threat had been neutralized , usually by some desperate defending and bodies being thrown in front of the ball , the play was immediately fed out to asamoah .
from his central position , the udinese midfielder would then run at the retreating serbs .
throughout the game , ghana would stretch the play to the very by-lines with asamoah feeding either prince tagoe on the right or andre ayew on the left .
serbia were dragged out of position by this tactic which allowed gyan and kevin-prince boateng to exploit the vacuum created in front of the serbian defense .
more often or not , however , the ghanaians resorted to lofted balls into the serbian penalty area rather than switching play to the forwards on the edge of the box .
lofted balls no problem for aerially-savvy germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker and friedrich will be ready for any aerial assault if this is a tactic they intend to stick with throughout the group stages , germany 's central defenders will have little trouble cutting out the high balls .
per mertesacker and arne friedrich are both tall players and accomplished in aerial battles .
ghana lacked initiative when running directly at the serbian defense and often headed straight into danger or chose to shoot from distance , which will also play into germany 's hands .
should the tactic of stretching play to the wings also endure , germany 's creative midfield trio of lukas podolski , mesut oezil and thomas mueller will have to be ready to drop back to the edge of their own box while wing-backs philipp lahm and perhaps kevin-prince 's brother jerome will have to watch that they do n't get caught too up-field in support of germany 's attack .
the potential clash of the boateng brothers is another interesting factor ahead of the germany-ghana game .
kevin-prince , a former germany under-21 player before choosing to take his father 's nationality , will have both identity issues and the potential wrath of a nation against him .
it was he who injured germany skipper michael ballack in the fa cup final at the end of the season to end the iconic german 's hopes of playing in south africa .
psychological pressure may affect the youngster 's potential to threaten .
on the attack , germany 's youthful creativity will be looking to exploit ghana 's sometimes erratic and jittery defense .
serbia , who play a less sophisticated version of the german game , caused chaos in ghana 's penalty area and only the lack of killer instinct prevented serbia from punishing this weakness .
competent ball carriers like oezil and mueller could unlock the ghanaians while lukas podolski and perhaps miroslav klose will have plenty of scuffed clearances to pounce on .
germany need to cut off serbia 's midfield route to attackers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia will be obstinate opponents for germany the germans may find serbia 's style of play to be similar to their own - but different enough to cause certain problems .
the serbians found it hard to play at times against ghana 's pressing tactic when they were in possession , the serbs being closed down at speed with space at a premium .
germany 's nippy youngsters will have to employ a similar tactic to smother any attempts at creativity by the serbian midfielders , who will be looking to release forwards milos krasnic , marko pantelic and nikola zigic .
should serbia captain dejan stankovic find himself with time and space to cue up attacks , however , germany could find themselves in trouble .
bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira will also have their hands full if the ball is fed to milan jovanovic who will operate in the areas they will be charged to protect in front of the back four .
the serbs attack in formations around the penalty area once the ball has been worked through midfield and germany will have to cut this threat out higher up the pitch to avoid pressure .
while the serbia-ghana game was hardly a classic , there were signs to suggest that as these teams grow into the tournament and find their rhythm and patterns , both could provide germany with a few obstacles as joachim loew 's side looks to win group d. author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 13.06.2010 germany 's blend of youth and experience delivers on promise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cacau scored the fourth in a rampant night for germany while the focus was undoubtedly on how germany would begin its world cup campaign on sunday night , plenty of interest was being afforded to joachim loew 's chosen line-up and its promise of attacking football . germany had arrived in south africa with the youngest squad in over 70 years and with an attacking mentality running through the ranks .
casual observers and hardcore german soccer fans were all curious as to how germany 2010 would be set up and whether the promise of exciting , offensive football would just be a smokescreen for a return to the safe , traditional approach of old . this was the first test for the youthful germans in world cup battle proper , pitting the second youngest team at this world cup - after group d opponents ghana - against the oldest in durban 's impressive moses mabhida stadium .
the hugely experienced australians were expected to provide a stern test for this new breed and no-one would have blamed joachim loew for going with a cautious approach in germany 's opening game . instead , the germany coach threw holger badstuber into his back four , sami khedira into the empty midfield shoes of the absent michael ballack while the exciting creative duo of mesut oezil and thomas mueller were charged with opening up the australian defense .
keeping goal was the equally youthful manuel neuer - germany 's new no.1.
loew also had marcel jansen , toni kroos , marko marin and jerome boateng on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sami khedira was outstanding in germany 's midfield neuer looked nervous at kick-off , unsurprisingly given the 22-year-old 's experience only stretched to six games , but an early , safely-gathered ball seemed to settle his nerves . just how much he had settled was obvious just three minutes later when australia had the first clear chance .
the schalke keeper stood up well to block the close-range shot and philipp lahm cleared .
australia 's subsequent sorties found the young schalke stopper in even more confident form , punching clear and smothering at feet like an old pro .
his distribution was also considered and clever . khedira raises the question : michael who ? sami khedira looked to have understood what loew wanted from him in his role as a protector of the back four , which was important as the australians had flown out of the blocks with a surprisingly high-tempo attacking game . young holger badstuber appeared a little shell-shocked when faced with a marauding brett emerson so khedira 's intelligence was a godsend on the left flank on a number of occasions .
as the game wore on , badstuber may have seemed quiet but only because khedira had the left side sewn up in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller -lrb- no.13 -rrb- performed like a seasoned international equally impressive was the stuttgart man 's willingness to play as box-to-box midfielder , popping up regularly in the australian penalty area in support of the attack .
he could have had at least two goals himself .
such was his dynamism that it will not come as a surprise if khedira permanently replaces the fading ballack . germany 's breakthrough had the stamp of youth all over it .
mesut oezil drifted through the midfield and poked a ball beyond the australian defense for thomas mueller to sprint onto .
the bayern munich youngster 's cut back looked too deep but it was inch perfect for lukas podolski to hammer home from the edge of the box . mueller 's performance beyond his years mueller and oezil seemed to be everywhere , one always offering the other an option when the germans attacked .
mueller , playing effectively as a winger at times , was shredding the socceroos left back and delivering the kind of crosses that forwards dream of . his inclusion was being constantly justified as the 20-year-old not only proved to be an integral link in the attacking chain but on more than one occasion he had the chance to put his name on the score sheet .
when he finally hit the net with a goal of his won , it was only what he deserved after a performance beyond his years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose rolled back the years with a goal-scoring return oezil was also constant threat , dancing through tackles at will and showing intelligent movement .
he nearly had a cheeky goal to his name on the half-hour mark but his chip over keeper mark schwarzer was cleared off the line by socceroos captain lucas neill .
ten minutes later the werder bremen star saw another chance go begging after stripping neill for pace . germany 2010 could be a vintage team while a lot of the attacking intent was coming from the youngsters , the execution was coming from the old guard , even if podolski and philipp lahm – the provider for miroslav klose 's goal to make it 2-0 , could hardly be called pensioners . the promised offensive formation and style was truly in evidence and paying off in spades .
the first two goals may have come from the 2006 strike force but the vim and vitality which had proved too much for the aussies was of the 2010 vintage . when cacau came on and made it four after mueller 's goal had put the game out of sight , no-one could say that this was a typical germany performance .
australia had n't been worn down in style of german sides of the past - they had been torn apart by a new approach . germany , with its young stars and experienced heads had delivered on its promise .

casual observers and hardcore german soccer fans were all curious as to how germany 2010 would be set up and whether the promise of exciting , offensive football would just be a smokescreen for a return to the safe , traditional approach of old . this was the first test for the youthful germans in world cup battle proper , pitting the second youngest team at this world cup - after group d opponents ghana - against the oldest in durban 's impressive moses mabhida stadium .
the hugely experienced australians were expected to provide a stern test for this new breed and no-one would have blamed joachim loew for going with a cautious approach in germany 's opening game . instead , the germany coach threw holger badstuber into his back four , sami khedira into the empty midfield shoes of the absent michael ballack while the exciting creative duo of mesut oezil and thomas mueller were charged with opening up the australian defense .
keeping goal was the equally youthful manuel neuer - germany 's new no.1.
loew also had marcel jansen , toni kroos , marko marin and jerome boateng on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sami khedira was outstanding in germany 's midfield neuer looked nervous at kick-off , unsurprisingly given the 22-year-old 's experience only stretched to six games , but an early , safely-gathered ball seemed to settle his nerves . just how much he had settled was obvious just three minutes later when australia had the first clear chance .
the schalke keeper stood up well to block the close-range shot and philipp lahm cleared .
australia 's subsequent sorties found the young schalke stopper in even more confident form , punching clear and smothering at feet like an old pro .
his distribution was also considered and clever . khedira raises the question : michael who ? sami khedira looked to have understood what loew wanted from him in his role as a protector of the back four , which was important as the australians had flown out of the blocks with a surprisingly high-tempo attacking game . young holger badstuber appeared a little shell-shocked when faced with a marauding brett emerson so khedira 's intelligence was a godsend on the left flank on a number of occasions .
as the game wore on , badstuber may have seemed quiet but only because khedira had the left side sewn up in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller -lrb- no.13 -rrb- performed like a seasoned international equally impressive was the stuttgart man 's willingness to play as box-to-box midfielder , popping up regularly in the australian penalty area in support of the attack .
he could have had at least two goals himself .
such was his dynamism that it will not come as a surprise if khedira permanently replaces the fading ballack . germany 's breakthrough had the stamp of youth all over it .
mesut oezil drifted through the midfield and poked a ball beyond the australian defense for thomas mueller to sprint onto .
the bayern munich youngster 's cut back looked too deep but it was inch perfect for lukas podolski to hammer home from the edge of the box . mueller 's performance beyond his years mueller and oezil seemed to be everywhere , one always offering the other an option when the germans attacked .
mueller , playing effectively as a winger at times , was shredding the socceroos left back and delivering the kind of crosses that forwards dream of . his inclusion was being constantly justified as the 20-year-old not only proved to be an integral link in the attacking chain but on more than one occasion he had the chance to put his name on the score sheet .
when he finally hit the net with a goal of his won , it was only what he deserved after a performance beyond his years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose rolled back the years with a goal-scoring return oezil was also constant threat , dancing through tackles at will and showing intelligent movement .
he nearly had a cheeky goal to his name on the half-hour mark but his chip over keeper mark schwarzer was cleared off the line by socceroos captain lucas neill .
ten minutes later the werder bremen star saw another chance go begging after stripping neill for pace . germany 2010 could be a vintage team while a lot of the attacking intent was coming from the youngsters , the execution was coming from the old guard , even if podolski and philipp lahm – the provider for miroslav klose 's goal to make it 2-0 , could hardly be called pensioners . the promised offensive formation and style was truly in evidence and paying off in spades .
the first two goals may have come from the 2006 strike force but the vim and vitality which had proved too much for the aussies was of the 2010 vintage . when cacau came on and made it four after mueller 's goal had put the game out of sight , no-one could say that this was a typical germany performance .
australia had n't been worn down in style of german sides of the past - they had been torn apart by a new approach . germany , with its young stars and experienced heads had delivered on its promise .

however it was another asamoah - kwadwo asamoah – who ran the game for ghana from the middle of the pitch , conducting play and pushing his team 's attacks forward from deep .
the black stars ' midfielder was certainly a strong candidate for man-of-the-match .
germany 's coaching staff and players will have been watching asamoah 's contribution with interest and may well single him out for special treatment as the most dangerous player in the ghana midfield when they face each other in their final game of group d on june 23 .
ghana midfielder asamoah pivotal to attacking threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghana broke well but resorted to lofted crosses into the box asamoah was the fulcrum of the ghana team on sunday – whether or not he will remain so depends on whether ghana 's serbian coach milovan rajevac brings inter milan 's sulley muntari back into the starting line-up or gives stalwart stephan appiah a run-out .
but on this performance against serbia , it is likely that asamoah will be the man who links ghana 's defense to its attack against the germans .
ghana defended very deeply throughout the match and fell back in large numbers whenever the serbians broke .
as soon as the threat had been neutralized , usually by some desperate defending and bodies being thrown in front of the ball , the play was immediately fed out to asamoah .
from his central position , the udinese midfielder would then run at the retreating serbs .
throughout the game , ghana would stretch the play to the very by-lines with asamoah feeding either prince tagoe on the right or andre ayew on the left .
serbia were dragged out of position by this tactic which allowed gyan and kevin-prince boateng to exploit the vacuum created in front of the serbian defense .

the potential clash of the boateng brothers is another interesting factor ahead of the germany-ghana game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 13.06.2010 slovakia 's leftist leader wins pyrrhic victory as right claims majority großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fico wants to form a cabinet but may end up in opposition leftist slovak prime minister robert fico 's party came out on top of saturday 's polls , but a coalition of center-right parties that have sworn not to work with him have won a majority in parliament . parliamentary elections in slovakia have seen the current leftist coalition lose its majority , although controversial prime minister robert fico says he retains the right to lead any talks on forming a new government .
meanwhile four centre-right parties with a total of 79 seats in the 150-seat parliament have claimed victory , saying the people of slovakia have given them a clear mandate for change .
he won , yet it seems he might have lost .
robert fico , the uncompromising premier who promised to shield slovaks from the worst of the global financial crisis and protect them from hungarian revisionism , saw his smer party win almost 35 % of the vote - an impressive result for a party that 's been in government for the last four years .
" it 's a result that gives us the right to receive the go-ahead from the president to lead talks on forming a government , " he told bleary-eyed journalists at a pre-dawn press conference .
end of meciar era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fico has not conceded defeat just yet but in the same breath , fico conceded that his efforts may be in vain , and smer may end up in opposition , where it would provide a " clear alternative " to a potential center-right coalition .
smer may control 62 seats in the new parliament , but the party looks isolated .
his two coalition allies did not fare well .
the ultra-nationalist slovak national party -lrb- sns -rrb- barely scraped the 5 % threshold into parliament .
however , the movement for a democratic slovakia -lrb- hzds -rrb- - the party of slovakia 's authoritarian former prime minister vladimir meciar - was unceremoniously kicked out .
observers are already calling that " the final end of the meciar era . "
the heavy-handed , autocratic politician who led his country into international isolation could now be on the brink of political retirement .
smer victorious but isolated together , smer and the slovak national party will command 71 seats - several short of a majority .
the only way prime minister fico can stay in power is if one of four center-right opposition parties choose to lend him their support - an unlikely , but , analysts stress , not impossible , prospect .
the champagne was flowing , however , over at the headquarters of those four parties - two of them brand new .
the center-right slovak democratic and christian union -lrb- sdku -rrb- - which presided over government from 1998-2006 and undid much of meciar 's damage to slovakia 's international reputation - emerged with 15 % of the vote .
" beautiful morning miracle " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radicova could be the leader of a new , center-right coalition the party 's new leader iveta radicova described the centre-right 's majority as " a beautiful morning miracle " , and said " change for slovakia was truly around the corner . "
radicova added that , as soon as sunday , talks would be convened with three fellow center-right parties on forming a coalition government - the newly-created freedom and solidarity -lrb- sas -rrb- , the christian democratic movement -lrb- kdh -rrb- and most-hid , a joint slovak-hungarian party that promotes unity between slovaks and ethnic hungarians .
that 's a very different message from fico 's government , which has followed a clear nationalist agenda , clashing frequently with slovakia 's increasingly assertive southern neighbor , hungary .
cutting the deficit priorities for a potential center-right government would include trimming the deficit by reforming public finances .
the four parties had promised austerity steps before the election to get slovakia 's export-driven economy , which has been battered by the global financial crisis , back on track .
an ethnic hungarian party in power would at first glance seem to raise the prospect of some sort of reconciliation with hungary .
however , the party with the closest links to budapest 's nationalist government - the party of the hungarian coalition -lrb- smk -rrb- - had a disastrous election , failing to retain any of its seats in parliament , as slovakia 's 500,000 ethnic hungarians put their faith in the more moderate most-hid .
but even if the four parties do manage to agree on a government , the new cabinet may lack stability .
with a majority of just eight seats in parliament , it could be a shaky coalition .
dark predictions of failure came from fico himself , who said such a government would last " a year , at most . "
perhaps the biggest change for slovakia will be the style of its next leader .
after being ruled by men for its 17-year-history as an independent state , slovaks may be about to find themselves governed by iveta radicova , their first female prime minister , one who promotes dialogue over confrontation .

however it was another asamoah - kwadwo asamoah – who ran the game for ghana from the middle of the pitch , conducting play and pushing his team 's attacks forward from deep .
the black stars ' midfielder was certainly a strong candidate for man-of-the-match .
germany 's coaching staff and players will have been watching asamoah 's contribution with interest and may well single him out for special treatment as the most dangerous player in the ghana midfield when they face each other in their final game of group d on june 23 .
ghana midfielder asamoah pivotal to attacking threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghana broke well but resorted to lofted crosses into the box asamoah was the fulcrum of the ghana team on sunday – whether or not he will remain so depends on whether ghana 's serbian coach milovan rajevac brings inter milan 's sulley muntari back into the starting line-up or gives stalwart stephan appiah a run-out .
but on this performance against serbia , it is likely that asamoah will be the man who links ghana 's defense to its attack against the germans .
ghana defended very deeply throughout the match and fell back in large numbers whenever the serbians broke .
as soon as the threat had been neutralized , usually by some desperate defending and bodies being thrown in front of the ball , the play was immediately fed out to asamoah .
from his central position , the udinese midfielder would then run at the retreating serbs .
throughout the game , ghana would stretch the play to the very by-lines with asamoah feeding either prince tagoe on the right or andre ayew on the left .
serbia were dragged out of position by this tactic which allowed gyan and kevin-prince boateng to exploit the vacuum created in front of the serbian defense .
more often or not , however , the ghanaians resorted to lofted balls into the serbian penalty area rather than switching play to the forwards on the edge of the box .
lofted balls no problem for aerially-savvy germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker and friedrich will be ready for any aerial assault if this is a tactic they intend to stick with throughout the group stages , germany 's central defenders will have little trouble cutting out the high balls .
per mertesacker and arne friedrich are both tall players and accomplished in aerial battles .
ghana lacked initiative when running directly at the serbian defense and often headed straight into danger or chose to shoot from distance , which will also play into germany 's hands .
should the tactic of stretching play to the wings also endure , germany 's creative midfield trio of lukas podolski , mesut oezil and thomas mueller will have to be ready to drop back to the edge of their own box while wing-backs philipp lahm and perhaps kevin-prince 's brother jerome will have to watch that they do n't get caught too up-field in support of germany 's attack .
the potential clash of the boateng brothers is another interesting factor ahead of the germany-ghana game .
kevin-prince , a former germany under-21 player before choosing to take his father 's nationality , will have both identity issues and the potential wrath of a nation against him .
it was he who injured germany skipper michael ballack in the fa cup final at the end of the season to end the iconic german 's hopes of playing in south africa .
psychological pressure may affect the youngster 's potential to threaten .
on the attack , germany 's youthful creativity will be looking to exploit ghana 's sometimes erratic and jittery defense .
serbia , who play a less sophisticated version of the german game , caused chaos in ghana 's penalty area and only the lack of killer instinct prevented serbia from punishing this weakness .
competent ball carriers like oezil and mueller could unlock the ghanaians while lukas podolski and perhaps miroslav klose will have plenty of scuffed clearances to pounce on .
germany need to cut off serbia 's midfield route to attackers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia will be obstinate opponents for germany the germans may find serbia 's style of play to be similar to their own - but different enough to cause certain problems .
the serbians found it hard to play at times against ghana 's pressing tactic when they were in possession , the serbs being closed down at speed with space at a premium .
germany 's nippy youngsters will have to employ a similar tactic to smother any attempts at creativity by the serbian midfielders , who will be looking to release forwards milos krasnic , marko pantelic and nikola zigic .

meanwhile four centre-right parties with a total of 79 seats in the 150-seat parliament have claimed victory , saying the people of slovakia have given them a clear mandate for change .
he won , yet it seems he might have lost .
robert fico , the uncompromising premier who promised to shield slovaks from the worst of the global financial crisis and protect them from hungarian revisionism , saw his smer party win almost 35 % of the vote - an impressive result for a party that 's been in government for the last four years .
" it 's a result that gives us the right to receive the go-ahead from the president to lead talks on forming a government , " he told bleary-eyed journalists at a pre-dawn press conference .
end of meciar era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fico has not conceded defeat just yet but in the same breath , fico conceded that his efforts may be in vain , and smer may end up in opposition , where it would provide a " clear alternative " to a potential center-right coalition .
smer may control 62 seats in the new parliament , but the party looks isolated .
his two coalition allies did not fare well .
the ultra-nationalist slovak national party -lrb- sns -rrb- barely scraped the 5 % threshold into parliament .
however , the movement for a democratic slovakia -lrb- hzds -rrb- - the party of slovakia 's authoritarian former prime minister vladimir meciar - was unceremoniously kicked out .
observers are already calling that " the final end of the meciar era . "
the heavy-handed , autocratic politician who led his country into international isolation could now be on the brink of political retirement .
smer victorious but isolated together , smer and the slovak national party will command 71 seats - several short of a majority .
the only way prime minister fico can stay in power is if one of four center-right opposition parties choose to lend him their support - an unlikely , but , analysts stress , not impossible , prospect .
the champagne was flowing , however , over at the headquarters of those four parties - two of them brand new .
the center-right slovak democratic and christian union -lrb- sdku -rrb- - which presided over government from 1998-2006 and undid much of meciar 's damage to slovakia 's international reputation - emerged with 15 % of the vote .
" beautiful morning miracle " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radicova could be the leader of a new , center-right coalition the party 's new leader iveta radicova described the centre-right 's majority as " a beautiful morning miracle " , and said " change for slovakia was truly around the corner . "
radicova added that , as soon as sunday , talks would be convened with three fellow center-right parties on forming a coalition government - the newly-created freedom and solidarity -lrb- sas -rrb- , the christian democratic movement -lrb- kdh -rrb- and most-hid , a joint slovak-hungarian party that promotes unity between slovaks and ethnic hungarians .
that 's a very different message from fico 's government , which has followed a clear nationalist agenda , clashing frequently with slovakia 's increasingly assertive southern neighbor , hungary .
cutting the deficit priorities for a potential center-right government would include trimming the deficit by reforming public finances .
the four parties had promised austerity steps before the election to get slovakia 's export-driven economy , which has been battered by the global financial crisis , back on track .
an ethnic hungarian party in power would at first glance seem to raise the prospect of some sort of reconciliation with hungary .
however , the party with the closest links to budapest 's nationalist government - the party of the hungarian coalition -lrb- smk -rrb- - had a disastrous election , failing to retain any of its seats in parliament , as slovakia 's 500,000 ethnic hungarians put their faith in the more moderate most-hid .
but even if the four parties do manage to agree on a government , the new cabinet may lack stability .
with a majority of just eight seats in parliament , it could be a shaky coalition .
dark predictions of failure came from fico himself , who said such a government would last " a year , at most . "
perhaps the biggest change for slovakia will be the style of its next leader .
after being ruled by men for its 17-year-history as an independent state , slovaks may be about to find themselves governed by iveta radicova , their first female prime minister , one who promotes dialogue over confrontation .

" it 's a result that gives us the right to receive the go-ahead from the president to lead talks on forming a government , " he told bleary-eyed journalists at a pre-dawn press conference .
end of meciar era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fico has not conceded defeat just yet but in the same breath , fico conceded that his efforts may be in vain , and smer may end up in opposition , where it would provide a " clear alternative " to a potential center-right coalition .
smer may control 62 seats in the new parliament , but the party looks isolated .
his two coalition allies did not fare well .
the ultra-nationalist slovak national party -lrb- sns -rrb- barely scraped the 5 % threshold into parliament .
however , the movement for a democratic slovakia -lrb- hzds -rrb- - the party of slovakia 's authoritarian former prime minister vladimir meciar - was unceremoniously kicked out .
observers are already calling that " the final end of the meciar era . "
the heavy-handed , autocratic politician who led his country into international isolation could now be on the brink of political retirement .
smer victorious but isolated together , smer and the slovak national party will command 71 seats - several short of a majority .
the only way prime minister fico can stay in power is if one of four center-right opposition parties choose to lend him their support - an unlikely , but , analysts stress , not impossible , prospect .
the champagne was flowing , however , over at the headquarters of those four parties - two of them brand new .
the center-right slovak democratic and christian union -lrb- sdku -rrb- - which presided over government from 1998-2006 and undid much of meciar 's damage to slovakia 's international reputation - emerged with 15 % of the vote .
" beautiful morning miracle " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radicova could be the leader of a new , center-right coalition the party 's new leader iveta radicova described the centre-right 's majority as " a beautiful morning miracle " , and said " change for slovakia was truly around the corner . "
radicova added that , as soon as sunday , talks would be convened with three fellow center-right parties on forming a coalition government - the newly-created freedom and solidarity -lrb- sas -rrb- , the christian democratic movement -lrb- kdh -rrb- and most-hid , a joint slovak-hungarian party that promotes unity between slovaks and ethnic hungarians .
that 's a very different message from fico 's government , which has followed a clear nationalist agenda , clashing frequently with slovakia 's increasingly assertive southern neighbor , hungary .
cutting the deficit priorities for a potential center-right government would include trimming the deficit by reforming public finances .
the four parties had promised austerity steps before the election to get slovakia 's export-driven economy , which has been battered by the global financial crisis , back on track .
an ethnic hungarian party in power would at first glance seem to raise the prospect of some sort of reconciliation with hungary .
however , the party with the closest links to budapest 's nationalist government - the party of the hungarian coalition -lrb- smk -rrb- - had a disastrous election , failing to retain any of its seats in parliament , as slovakia 's 500,000 ethnic hungarians put their faith in the more moderate most-hid .
but even if the four parties do manage to agree on a government , the new cabinet may lack stability .
with a majority of just eight seats in parliament , it could be a shaky coalition .
dark predictions of failure came from fico himself , who said such a government would last " a year , at most . "
perhaps the biggest change for slovakia will be the style of its next leader .
after being ruled by men for its 17-year-history as an independent state , slovaks may be about to find themselves governed by iveta radicova , their first female prime minister , one who promotes dialogue over confrontation .

max goeldi was at the center of a diplomatic spat between the two countries , which have now signed an agreement to cool tensions . after spending almost two years in a libyan jail for visa offenses , swiss businessman max goeldi is heading back home to switzerland .
it will be the end , many hope , of a fierce diplomatic dispute between bern and tripoli .
goeldi was released from the prison three days ago , and swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey has confirmed that he will be leaving libya sunday .
the conflict dates back to the arrest of a son of libyan leader moammar gadhafi .
the son , hannibal , was arrested for allegedly beating his domestic servants in geneva in july 2008 .
the charges against him were later dropped , but it was the start of a row that the two countries now hope to put behind them .
a few days after hannibal 's arrest , goeldi was detained and not allowed to leave libya .
goeldi has spent the last four months in prison after being convicted of violating immigration rules .
the situation has hurt relations between switzerland and libya , but the two nations have now signed what calmy-rey calls an " action plan " to help repair diplomatic ties .
" goeldi will return to switzerland and this is the start of the normalization of relations between the two countries , " she said .
the price for goeldi 's return home appeared to be a swiss apology for the publication of a leaked police photo of hannibal gadhafi taken while he was under arrest .
libya says the leak was an invasion of his privacy and hurt his reputation .
the swiss foreign minister said her country acknowledged the publication was unlawful , gave an apology and promised to pay hannibal gadhafi compensation if a criminal investigation fails to find who was responsible for the leak .
spain , which currently holds the european union 's rotating presidency , was part of the negotiations in tripoli and the agreement was also signed by a german mediator .

max goeldi was at the center of a diplomatic spat between the two countries , which have now signed an agreement to cool tensions . after spending almost two years in a libyan jail for visa offenses , swiss businessman max goeldi is heading back home to switzerland .
it will be the end , many hope , of a fierce diplomatic dispute between bern and tripoli .
goeldi was released from the prison three days ago , and swiss foreign minister micheline calmy-rey has confirmed that he will be leaving libya sunday .
the conflict dates back to the arrest of a son of libyan leader moammar gadhafi .
the son , hannibal , was arrested for allegedly beating his domestic servants in geneva in july 2008 .
the charges against him were later dropped , but it was the start of a row that the two countries now hope to put behind them .
a few days after hannibal 's arrest , goeldi was detained and not allowed to leave libya .
goeldi has spent the last four months in prison after being convicted of violating immigration rules .
the situation has hurt relations between switzerland and libya , but the two nations have now signed what calmy-rey calls an " action plan " to help repair diplomatic ties .
" goeldi will return to switzerland and this is the start of the normalization of relations between the two countries , " she said .
the price for goeldi 's return home appeared to be a swiss apology for the publication of a leaked police photo of hannibal gadhafi taken while he was under arrest .
libya says the leak was an invasion of his privacy and hurt his reputation .
the swiss foreign minister said her country acknowledged the publication was unlawful , gave an apology and promised to pay hannibal gadhafi compensation if a criminal investigation fails to find who was responsible for the leak .
spain , which currently holds the european union 's rotating presidency , was part of the negotiations in tripoli and the agreement was also signed by a german mediator .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 13.06.2010 germany 's blend of youth and experience delivers on promise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cacau scored the fourth in a rampant night for germany while the focus was undoubtedly on how germany would begin its world cup campaign on sunday night , plenty of interest was being afforded to joachim loew 's chosen line-up and its promise of attacking football . germany had arrived in south africa with the youngest squad in over 70 years and with an attacking mentality running through the ranks .
casual observers and hardcore german soccer fans were all curious as to how germany 2010 would be set up and whether the promise of exciting , offensive football would just be a smokescreen for a return to the safe , traditional approach of old . this was the first test for the youthful germans in world cup battle proper , pitting the second youngest team at this world cup - after group d opponents ghana - against the oldest in durban 's impressive moses mabhida stadium .
the hugely experienced australians were expected to provide a stern test for this new breed and no-one would have blamed joachim loew for going with a cautious approach in germany 's opening game . instead , the germany coach threw holger badstuber into his back four , sami khedira into the empty midfield shoes of the absent michael ballack while the exciting creative duo of mesut oezil and thomas mueller were charged with opening up the australian defense .
keeping goal was the equally youthful manuel neuer - germany 's new no.1.
loew also had marcel jansen , toni kroos , marko marin and jerome boateng on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sami khedira was outstanding in germany 's midfield neuer looked nervous at kick-off , unsurprisingly given the 22-year-old 's experience only stretched to six games , but an early , safely-gathered ball seemed to settle his nerves . just how much he had settled was obvious just three minutes later when australia had the first clear chance .
the schalke keeper stood up well to block the close-range shot and philipp lahm cleared .
australia 's subsequent sorties found the young schalke stopper in even more confident form , punching clear and smothering at feet like an old pro .
his distribution was also considered and clever . khedira raises the question : michael who ? sami khedira looked to have understood what loew wanted from him in his role as a protector of the back four , which was important as the australians had flown out of the blocks with a surprisingly high-tempo attacking game . young holger badstuber appeared a little shell-shocked when faced with a marauding brett emerson so khedira 's intelligence was a godsend on the left flank on a number of occasions .
as the game wore on , badstuber may have seemed quiet but only because khedira had the left side sewn up in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller -lrb- no.13 -rrb- performed like a seasoned international equally impressive was the stuttgart man 's willingness to play as box-to-box midfielder , popping up regularly in the australian penalty area in support of the attack .
he could have had at least two goals himself .
such was his dynamism that it will not come as a surprise if khedira permanently replaces the fading ballack . germany 's breakthrough had the stamp of youth all over it .
mesut oezil drifted through the midfield and poked a ball beyond the australian defense for thomas mueller to sprint onto .
the bayern munich youngster 's cut back looked too deep but it was inch perfect for lukas podolski to hammer home from the edge of the box . mueller 's performance beyond his years mueller and oezil seemed to be everywhere , one always offering the other an option when the germans attacked .
mueller , playing effectively as a winger at times , was shredding the socceroos left back and delivering the kind of crosses that forwards dream of . his inclusion was being constantly justified as the 20-year-old not only proved to be an integral link in the attacking chain but on more than one occasion he had the chance to put his name on the score sheet .
when he finally hit the net with a goal of his won , it was only what he deserved after a performance beyond his years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose rolled back the years with a goal-scoring return oezil was also constant threat , dancing through tackles at will and showing intelligent movement .
he nearly had a cheeky goal to his name on the half-hour mark but his chip over keeper mark schwarzer was cleared off the line by socceroos captain lucas neill .
ten minutes later the werder bremen star saw another chance go begging after stripping neill for pace . germany 2010 could be a vintage team while a lot of the attacking intent was coming from the youngsters , the execution was coming from the old guard , even if podolski and philipp lahm – the provider for miroslav klose 's goal to make it 2-0 , could hardly be called pensioners . the promised offensive formation and style was truly in evidence and paying off in spades .
the first two goals may have come from the 2006 strike force but the vim and vitality which had proved too much for the aussies was of the 2010 vintage . when cacau came on and made it four after mueller 's goal had put the game out of sight , no-one could say that this was a typical germany performance .
australia had n't been worn down in style of german sides of the past - they had been torn apart by a new approach . germany , with its young stars and experienced heads had delivered on its promise .

germany kept up constant pressure on the socceroos and convincingly won 4-0 in what is the world cup 's highest scoring match so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose headed the german side to a comfortable 2-0 halftime lead the attack on the australian goal began early , with lukas podolski firing an absolute strike at australian keeper mark schwarzer in the 8th minute .
schwarzer managed to get a glove on the ball but could not stop it from going into the goal . striker misoslav klose was in good form early on , but could n't seem to find the net as the game got going .
he sent a nearly wide-open chance just wide of the goal in the 24th minute , but had a chance to redeem himself two minutes later . captain phillip lahm brought the ball up the right side and launched a curling cross from distance toward klose in the area , who leapt just a bit higher than schwarzer to get a head on the ball and put germany ahead 2-0 .
the goal was the seventh header scored by klose in a world cup , giving him the most goals via header by any player in world cup history . right decisions in the second half , germany did not take its foot off the gas and continued to press the australian defense .

midfielder mesut oezil , making his world cup debut for germany at age 21 , also narrowly missed scoring opportunities and seemed to be involved in every german attack . loew also opted to start the 20-year-old mueller over the more-experienced piotr trochowski on the right wing .
in addition to mueller 's goal , he provided the assist to podolski that got the german scoring machine up and running . german keeper manuel neuer also made his world cup debut , but the 24-year old was relatively untested . first win for africa it was a game of firsts in the other group d match between ghana and serbia in pretoria sunday afternoon .

while the country is far from being a democracy , its cultural scene is beginning to instigate change . in belarus , the most productive kind of political protest these days has less to do with flag-waving an chanting in public squares than with hoarse voices , heavy chords , and a dance-friendly rhythm . the songs of the band n.r.m. touch on aspects of life as it 's really lived in belarus - and that has upset the government more than many of the opposition politicians have . " since there was no political opposition for years , we musicians took over the role of the opposition , " said singer and band leader lavron volski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is popular in belarus for a long time , n.r.m. was n't allowed to perform publically .
there was never an official ban , but whenever they had a concert lined up , the organizer would get a call from an official and the show would be cancelled . now , the belarusian authorities have agreed to allow the group to perform twice this fall .
it 's part of what the government is calling liberalization and might be related to the naming of a new culture minister , pavel latushko .
however , it 's not yet clear whether the development will mean lasting change in this country often referred to as " europe 's last dictatorship . " support from germany unlike in western europe , culture in belarus receives very little funding from the state .
a few foreign organizations , like the goethe institut in the capital minsk , financially support cooperative projects or let artists use their facilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostwald-richter directs the goethe institut in minsk for the first time in 17 years , the goethe institut has a room where people can organize events and opinions can be shared openly , said director kathrin oswald-richter .
" here , everyone can say what they want , and we 're wildly determined to try that out , " she added . the goethe institut recently moved from a crumbling constructivist building from the 1920s to a high-rise in downtown minsk with glass facades . at the building 's inauguration , the hamburg-based rock group fotos was flown in to perform .
in this relatively isolated city visited by few foreign acts , audiences are quick to jump to their feet and start dancing once a show by an international group begins . cultural exchange projects german language and culture are popular in minsk , with about 30,000 people learning german at universities and other institutions .
there 's also a fan club for the german soccer team fc bayern . foreign organizations in minsk also try to build ties between belarus and western european countries . the goethe institut trains belarusian cultural managers in democratic principles and the organization european borderlands , funded by the literary colloquium berlin and the allianz cultural foundation , brings german authors to belarus for readings . bildunterschrift : the architecture in downtown minsk reflects the country 's communist past still , belarus ' cultural scene is relatively isolated , like the country itself .
the nation has not been represented at the venice biennale in many years , which led several artists to organize a belarusian pavilion full of provocative , political art - if not in venice , then at least in a private gallery in minsk . belarus itself , however , is internally divided by the politics of language .
president lukashenko speaks mainly russian , while the opposition speaks belarusian , the language of the intellectuals and the rural population . " we no longer live under stalin , but not everything 's perfect yet , " said belarusian poet volha hapeyeva .
and the country has a long , slow road ahead , if it 's going to improve its democratic credentials . " author : werner bloch -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during a 30-minute telephone conversation , obama , who said last week he wants to know " whose ass to kick " , reaffirmed america 's " deep commitment to the special and historic relationship " between the us and the uk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron has been under pressure to defend bp but , obama also made it clear that he expects bp to pay for the clean-up costs and meet economic claims from the spill .
bp under pressure cameron , who described the conversation as " warm and constructive " , stressed the importance of bp to the british and other economies , after he came under pressure at home to defend the economic heavyweight .
on friday he said that " it is in everyone 's interests that bp continues to be a financially strong and stable company " .
bp is a staple in british pension funds and accounts for 12 percent of all dividends paid by uk companies .
its share price has plunged by 40 percent since the offshore oil rig blast in the gulf of mexico on april 20 killed 11 people and triggered an environmental disaster , with up to 40,000 barrels of oil a day spilling into the sea and washing up along coastal areas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp has been told its plans to cap the oil well are insufficient some us lawmakers are demanding that bp suspend its dividend payments until the crisis is resolved .
bp 's chairman carl-henric svanberg has been summoned to a meeting in the white house next wednesday .
48 hours to improve containment plans meanwhile , bp has been ordered by the us coast guard to come up with an improved containment plan within the next two days , as bp 's plans do not go far enough to have backup resources in place , according to the us military .
us government data released on thursday suggests that the oil flow from the leak is higher than previously thought and could be upwards of 40,000 barrels a day .

germany kept up constant pressure on the socceroos and convincingly won 4-0 in what is the world cup 's highest scoring match so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose headed the german side to a comfortable 2-0 halftime lead the attack on the australian goal began early , with lukas podolski firing an absolute strike at australian keeper mark schwarzer in the 8th minute .
schwarzer managed to get a glove on the ball but could not stop it from going into the goal . striker misoslav klose was in good form early on , but could n't seem to find the net as the game got going .
he sent a nearly wide-open chance just wide of the goal in the 24th minute , but had a chance to redeem himself two minutes later . captain phillip lahm brought the ball up the right side and launched a curling cross from distance toward klose in the area , who leapt just a bit higher than schwarzer to get a head on the ball and put germany ahead 2-0 .
the goal was the seventh header scored by klose in a world cup , giving him the most goals via header by any player in world cup history . right decisions in the second half , germany did not take its foot off the gas and continued to press the australian defense .
the australians were reduced to 10 men in the 56th minute after forward tim cahill was sent off for a hard tackle on bastian schweinsteiger , setting the stage for even more german goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans loved their team 's high-scoring debut twenty-year-old thomas mueller scored his first goal for the german team in the 68th minute , followed shortly after by a strike from cacau , who had just been subbed in for klose . coach joachim loew 's decision to start klose over the brazilian-born cacau proved to be a good one .
midfielder mesut oezil , making his world cup debut for germany at age 21 , also narrowly missed scoring opportunities and seemed to be involved in every german attack . loew also opted to start the 20-year-old mueller over the more-experienced piotr trochowski on the right wing .
in addition to mueller 's goal , he provided the assist to podolski that got the german scoring machine up and running . german keeper manuel neuer also made his world cup debut , but the 24-year old was relatively untested . first win for africa it was a game of firsts in the other group d match between ghana and serbia in pretoria sunday afternoon .
the first penalty kick of the 2010 world cup led to the first win for an african team on the host continent as ghana beat serbia 1-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gyan took the world cup 's first penalty serbia 's zdravko kuzmanovic was given a yellow card for a hand ball in the penalty area in the 85th minute .
the resulting penalty was taken by ghana 's asamoah gyan , who cleanly blasted the ball to the back of the net for the game 's only goal , giving the black stars the victory in the first match of group d. gyan very nearly made it 2-0 in injury time at the end of the game when he beat serbian keeper vladimir stojkovic with a cross-goal shot that took an unlucky bounce off the post . serbia was reduced to 10 men in the 74th minute for a second yellow card on defender aleksandar lukovic .
slovenia records historic victory it was a goalkeeper blunder that gave slovenia its first-ever world cup win on sunday , as it defeated algeria 1-0 in polokwane .
for the first half of the group c match-up between slovenia and algeria , both teams were playing a cautious game that did n't offer much in the way of scoring opportunities .
the game was scoreless when the teams headed for the locker room at the break , and neither team took strong control of the game early in the second half .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koren was the man of the match however , a substitution for algeria proved to be a turning point in the game .
abdelkader ghezzal was brought in to replace rafik djebbour in the 58th minute , only to receive a yellow card sixty seconds later .
just 15 minutes after that , ghezzal was booked again for a handball and sent off the pitch .
taking advantage of the extra man , slovenia turned up the pressure on algeria .
in the 79th minute , slovenian captain robert koren took one of his team 's six shots on goal and got lucky when algerian keeper fawzi chaouchi flubbed the save and deflected the ball into the goal .
the win for slovenia was the country 's first ever in a world cup .
slovenia 's only other world cup appearance was in 2002 and they lost all three matches they played .
slovenia now leads group c ahead of the united states and england , who are tied for second following their 1-1 draw on saturday . author : matt zuvela -lrb- afp / ap -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 13.06.2010 german world cup starlets looking to catch socceroos on the hop großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to start the world cup in style with a win the moment of truth for germany 's youngest team in over seven decades has arrived .
joachim loew 's blend of youth and experience opens its world cup campaign against australia in durban on sunday . the proof of the pudding , they say , is in the eating .
germany begin their world cup 2010 campaign against australia on sunday with coach joachim loew remaining true to his pledge that youth will lead the way .
loew experimented with his youth policy throughout qualification with a number of exciting youngsters blooded along the road to south africa but the real test awaits them in durban .
germany will hope that jogi has blended the right ingredients and that his mix of youth and experience does n't sink in the heat of competition like a failed soufflé .
with an average age of around 25 , germany 's likely starting line-up in the moses mabidha stadium will be die mannschaft 's youngest team in over 70 years .
but what it may be lacking in years , it certainly makes up for in excitement and quality .
germany are expected to play in an offensively minded 4-2-3-1 formation , which could include lukas podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either thomas mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either miroslav klose or cacau .
youth at the heart of germany 's creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german young guns kroos , mueller and badstuber much has been written about the wisdom of charging the likes of oezil , mueller and kroos with the job of conducting germany 's attacks , given the fact that these fresh-faced starlets are all short of their 23rd birthdays .
what is mostly forgotten in this analysis is that both oezil and mueller have spent the past season playing against some of the top teams in europe while holding down first-team places in two of germany 's best teams , werder bremen and bayern munich respectively .
kroos , meanwhile , was an instrumental component in bayer leverkusen 's best season in many a year .
germany should therefore have few concerns that these youngsters will be over-awed by the occasion .
and if there are a few jitters , loew has maintained enough of the experienced guard in the side to calm the nerves and help repel what is expected to be a robust socceroos team .
experienced back-up bildunterschrift : loew 's plan to play new stars with experienced players aims to bring germany new energy new captain philipp lahm will command fellow stalwarts per mertesacker and arne friedrich in the back four , all of which will give one of the two talented youngsters holger badstuber or jerome boateng the confidence to take his place in germany 's defensive quartet , safe in the knowledge that his fellow stoppers have been here before .
ahead of them , the increasingly mature and influential bastian schweinsteiger will shepherd the midfield with newcomer sami khedira by his side .
ahead of the creative trio of podolski , oezil and mueller -lrb- or kroos -rrb- - who is likely to get the nod ahead of piotr trochowski - germany may have the old head of miroslav klose to aim for as the chosen lone striker .
while klose has been off the boil for bayern this season , he is still a proven world cup striker who always seems to rise to such an occasion .
germany will hope this is the case again this year as his deputies all come with question marks .
mario gomez and stefan kiessling have never proved convincing at this level , and while cacau has looked good in recent friendlies he has had few appearances in competitive matches in a germany shirt .
" we watched a video of australia on friday and they made a big impression , " said oliver bierhoff , the germany team manager .
" they have not conceded a goal in 17 of their last 27 games , they are sturdy and they will be very focused , " he warned .
socceroos play the waiting game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia were no push-overs in germany in 2006 the australian team will be full of experience with an average age over 30 and are expected to face this young , attacking germany with defense in mind .
a strong defensive game and organization was the key to australia 's strong showing in the 2006 world cup which saw them through to the knockout stage where they were felled by a very debatable penalty decision in extra time against italy - the side who went on to become champions .
the socceroos will send out a team charged with soaking up german pressure , hoping to sap the strength of germany 's youngsters while hoping that star midfielder tim cahill can unlock the defense on the counter-attack .
australia 's dutch coach pim verbeek was hoping that striker harry kewell would be fit enough to spearhead those attacks but the galatasaray forward is unlikely to start after missing all the socceroos ' warm-up games due to injury .
while kewell could well be back to face ghana in the next game , joshua kennedy will continue to fill in for the time being as australia 's lone striker against the germans .

joachim loew 's blend of youth and experience opens its world cup campaign against australia in durban on sunday . the proof of the pudding , they say , is in the eating .
germany begin their world cup 2010 campaign against australia on sunday with coach joachim loew remaining true to his pledge that youth will lead the way .
loew experimented with his youth policy throughout qualification with a number of exciting youngsters blooded along the road to south africa but the real test awaits them in durban .
germany will hope that jogi has blended the right ingredients and that his mix of youth and experience does n't sink in the heat of competition like a failed soufflé .
with an average age of around 25 , germany 's likely starting line-up in the moses mabidha stadium will be die mannschaft 's youngest team in over 70 years .
but what it may be lacking in years , it certainly makes up for in excitement and quality .
germany are expected to play in an offensively minded 4-2-3-1 formation , which could include lukas podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either thomas mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either miroslav klose or cacau .
youth at the heart of germany 's creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german young guns kroos , mueller and badstuber much has been written about the wisdom of charging the likes of oezil , mueller and kroos with the job of conducting germany 's attacks , given the fact that these fresh-faced starlets are all short of their 23rd birthdays .
what is mostly forgotten in this analysis is that both oezil and mueller have spent the past season playing against some of the top teams in europe while holding down first-team places in two of germany 's best teams , werder bremen and bayern munich respectively .
kroos , meanwhile , was an instrumental component in bayer leverkusen 's best season in many a year .
germany should therefore have few concerns that these youngsters will be over-awed by the occasion .
and if there are a few jitters , loew has maintained enough of the experienced guard in the side to calm the nerves and help repel what is expected to be a robust socceroos team .
experienced back-up bildunterschrift : loew 's plan to play new stars with experienced players aims to bring germany new energy new captain philipp lahm will command fellow stalwarts per mertesacker and arne friedrich in the back four , all of which will give one of the two talented youngsters holger badstuber or jerome boateng the confidence to take his place in germany 's defensive quartet , safe in the knowledge that his fellow stoppers have been here before .
ahead of them , the increasingly mature and influential bastian schweinsteiger will shepherd the midfield with newcomer sami khedira by his side .
ahead of the creative trio of podolski , oezil and mueller -lrb- or kroos -rrb- - who is likely to get the nod ahead of piotr trochowski - germany may have the old head of miroslav klose to aim for as the chosen lone striker .
while klose has been off the boil for bayern this season , he is still a proven world cup striker who always seems to rise to such an occasion .
germany will hope this is the case again this year as his deputies all come with question marks .
mario gomez and stefan kiessling have never proved convincing at this level , and while cacau has looked good in recent friendlies he has had few appearances in competitive matches in a germany shirt .
" we watched a video of australia on friday and they made a big impression , " said oliver bierhoff , the germany team manager .
" they have not conceded a goal in 17 of their last 27 games , they are sturdy and they will be very focused , " he warned .
socceroos play the waiting game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia were no push-overs in germany in 2006 the australian team will be full of experience with an average age over 30 and are expected to face this young , attacking germany with defense in mind .
a strong defensive game and organization was the key to australia 's strong showing in the 2006 world cup which saw them through to the knockout stage where they were felled by a very debatable penalty decision in extra time against italy - the side who went on to become champions .
the socceroos will send out a team charged with soaking up german pressure , hoping to sap the strength of germany 's youngsters while hoping that star midfielder tim cahill can unlock the defense on the counter-attack .
australia 's dutch coach pim verbeek was hoping that striker harry kewell would be fit enough to spearhead those attacks but the galatasaray forward is unlikely to start after missing all the socceroos ' warm-up games due to injury .
while kewell could well be back to face ghana in the next game , joshua kennedy will continue to fill in for the time being as australia 's lone striker against the germans .

it was part of czechoslovakia until the " velvet divorce " in january 1993 .
the subsequent independence years can be divided into several chapters .
overview overview facts leaders media the story in chapter one revolved around frosty relations with the european union and nato combined with rejection of economic reform .
chapter two saw a complete change of direction and moves to embrace all three , culminating in eu and nato membership in 2004 .
for the first five years after independence , there was growing international criticism of the lack of respect for minority rights and the democratic process shown by the authoritarian prime minister , vladimir meciar .
he led a string of coalition governments , pursuing nationalist and populist policies until october 1998 when an alliance of liberals , centrists , left-wingers and ethnic hungarians ousted him , forming a new coalition with mikulas dzurinda as prime minister .
during mr dzurinda 's term of office -lrb- 1998-2006 -rrb- , slovakia forged ahead with an economic reform programme and saw a boost in foreign investment .
his government also tried to improve the lot of minorities .
slovakia 's ethnic hungarian community constitutes about a tenth of the country 's population , and the status of this substantial minority has long been a source of tension between slovakia and hungary .
the premiership of mr dzurinda 's successor , robert fico , has been marred by regular sparring over the treatment of the hungarian minority .
slovakia also has a significant romany population which suffers disproportionately high levels of poverty and social deprivation .
the post-war benes decrees , which called for the expulsion of 3 million ethnic germans and 600,000 ethnic hungarians from then-czechoslovakia and the confiscation of their property , remain a sensitive issue in relations with neighbours .
facts overview facts leaders media full name : slovak republic population : 5.4 million -lrb- un , 2009 -rrb- capital : bratislava area : 49,033 sq km -lrb- 18,932 sq miles -rrb- major language : slovak major religion : christianity life expectancy : 71 years -lrb- men -rrb- , 79 years -lrb- women -rrb- -lrb- un -rrb- monetary unit : 1 euro = 100 cents main exports : manufactured goods , machinery and transport equipment gni per capita : us $ 14,540 -lrb- world bank , 2008 -rrb- internet domain : .sk international dialling code : + 421 leaders overview facts leaders media president : ivan gasparovic ivan gasparovic defeated former prime minister vladimir meciar in the second round of the presidential elections in april 2004 on the eve of eu entry .
during his election campaign he supported eu accession but criticised the minority government 's eu-oriented economic reforms .
in april 2009 mr gasparovic became the first president of slovakia to win re-election , when he defeated his centre-right challenger , iveta radicova , in the second round of voting by more than ten percentage points .
he received more than 55 % of the vote .
the president appoints the prime minister .
however , parliament exercises legislative power .
prime minister : robert fico robert fico , as incumbent pm , was asked to form a government after elections in june 2010 , but four opposition centre-right parties won a majority of seats in parliament , and looked more likely to form a governing coalition .
mr fico 's centre-left smer party increased its share of the vote , but one of his main coalition partners , the nationalist movement for a democratic slovakia -lrb- hzds -rrb- , failed to gain any seats .
robert fico put social welfare at the top of his agenda together , the opposition parties - the conservative slovak democratic and christian union , the conservative christian democrats , the liberal freedom and solidarity party and the ethnic hungarian most-hid party - won 79 out of 150 seats .
robert fico came to power in 2006 at the head of a coalition with the hzds , led by controversial former prime minister vladimir meciar , and the right-wing slovak national party .
the new government replaced the centre-right coalition led by mikulas dzurinda , who had steered through an unpopular economic reform package , and oversaw slovakia 's entry into the eu and nato .
mr fico said his main priority was to strengthen social welfare measures , reversing some of the policies of the previous government .
he approved the withdrawal of slovakia 's troops in iraq , which numbered around 110 , by the end of 2007 , describing the invasion as " unbelievably unjust and wrong . "
slovakia also has troops in afghanistan .
mr fico , a former human rights lawyer , was 41 when he became prime minister .
media overview facts leaders media private network markiza claims the lion 's share of the tv audience .
cable and satellite tv are widely watched , as are channels from the neighbouring czech republic and hungary .
all major dailies are privately-owned and there are more than 20 private radio stations .
the constitution guarantees a free press .
however , a controversial provision in the 2008 press act , which obliges newspapers to publish responses from individuals who say their reputation has been harmed by an article , has been condemned by media rights bodies and journalists .
the vienna-based international press institute warned in 2009 that the " targeting " of the press through defamation cases was causing alarm among journalists .
by may 2008 there were 2.7 million internet users -lrb- internetworldstats -rrb- .

democracy live page last updated at 13:15 gmt , sunday , 13 june 2010 14:15 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version us ambassador : " we do n't to hurt bp " on sunday 13 june andrew marr interviewed his excellency louis susman , us ambassador to the uk .
please note ' the andrew marr show ' must be credited if any part of this transcript is used .
andrew marr : now , as we heard a little earlier on , president obama 's been using some rather un-diplomatic language about bp .
his supporters say that he 's entirely justified because of the depth of the oil spill and the crisis , but a lot of people in this country , led by the london mayor boris johnson , have been fighting back saying bp 's being unfairly beaten up .
i 'm joined now by the us ambassador louis susman .
ambassador , thank you very much indeed for coming in .
would you accept that perhaps some of the language used by the administration was a little over the top - all this stuff about putting their , keeping a boot on british petroleum 's throat ?
ambassador susman : well i would suggest to you that the importance of what we 're saying is president obama and the administration would probably have said the same thing if it had been an american company .
it 's not the issue of diplomatic issues .
it 's an issue that we have a catastrophic event that has not only caused loss of lives , loss of all of the fisheries in the sea , economically devastated .
so while it might seem a bit un-diplomatic in terms of the words - trust me , it had nothing to do with the fact that it was british or american .
it was the fact that it 's a problem .
andrew marr : i suppose it was the constant use of british petroleum where they changed their name nine years ago .
and you know i do n't remember anything about the nationality of occidental when we had a much worse disaster with piper alpha .
nobody said , " that 's an american company " here .
ambassador susman : i think the president potentially spoke that one time where he said british petroleum , and he 's very keen to say bp at this point .
andrew marr : so he spoke yesterday to david cameron , the prime minister ambassador susman : yes .
andrew marr : and we 've got some accounts of the conversation from the british side in the newspapers this morning .
can you enlighten us from your side what it felt like ?
ambassador susman : it was as reported : a very warm conversation on a multitude of issues - afghanistan , iran , g20 .
and when the bp particular issue came up , they both are agreed it 's an ecological disaster .
bp has to do everything possible to stop the leak , accept the responsibility .
and the president made it very clear that he has no intention of trying to hurt the financial viability of bp .
that would be the last thing we want .
andrew marr : or of this being seen as an anti-british thing .
ambassador susman : it has nothing to do with anti-british .
andrew marr : let 's talk about afghanistan , which is another of the crucial questions .
people in this country are asking again when troops are going to come home and all the rest of it .
in terms of the way the british operation has been perceived in america - whether it 's been perhaps not sufficiently supported in terms of gear and kit and so on , the british have had a very , very hard time down in helmand - what 's the perception ?
ambassador susman : well i was with secretary gates and general petraeus this week , and we were with the prime minister .
we were with liam fox and we were with william hague .
and both countries have mutuality purpose and objective .
and i think secretary gates said it well ; that both countries are looking for progress , signs of progress , trend lines by the end of the year .
and that 's probably when we 'll be looking at it , as to how we go forward .
but i call your attention to the fact that , one , president obama will have practically all the troops out of iraq by august .
we have set a date of july 11th to evaluate the situation 2011 .
and i am positive , because i know this , that he and prime minister cameron are exactly on the same page .
andrew marr : so we should look to 2011 as the sort of crucial year in terms of ?
ambassador susman : absolutely .
andrew marr : okay .
one of the other big issues of course is iran .
people in this country , the former foreign secretary said any kind of military response to iran was unthinkable or crackers .
i mean he used some pretty salty phrase about it on this programme .
is that still also the view in washington ?
ambassador susman : well the view in washington is one we are determined with our p5 plus 1 partners not for iran to obtain nuclear weapons .
number two : we are very gratified of the un resolution which came out to put the sanctions in place .
and , andrew , that 's just the beginning .
the sanctions are the platform now for america to put their sanctions , british sanctions and the eu .
and it is crucial , crucial , that these sanctions be appropriately aimed to get the iranians either back to the table or to stop .
andrew marr : the prime minister 's going over for his first visit to washington next month to see the president .
there has been a perception in this country that perhaps the new administration was n't as naturally or instinctively close to britain as previous administrations have been .
what are we going to see , do you think , in that visit ?
ambassador susman : well i think already we 've seen the fact that the first call that prime minister cameron got was from the president .
he re-emphasised the special relationship .
he did it again yesterday on the call .
andrew marr : cameron 's going to have to explain coalition governments to the president .
ambassador susman : he certainly will .
-lrb- marr laughs -rrb- but we also feel that we have no better ally , no greater friend than the united kingdom .
we may have had a little bit of a tiff last night , but it only adds to the relationship .
andrew marr : -lrb- laughs -rrb- and how did you explain to the president the result of the election because that was your job ?
i mean you had to say right , this is how it 's going to work .
ambassador susman : i told the president that i felt the coalition government from america 's point of view had some very , very favourable results because it appears we will have a stable government for anywhere from two to five , four to five years .
and stability without paralysis is very important in governing , in facing the objectives that we have to face .
andrew marr : let 's turn to a really serious issue , of course , which was your bet with our ambassador in washington .
ambassador susman : oh yes , oh yes .
andrew marr : it was a burger , i think , or a meal was it ?
ambassador susman : no , no , it was a meal .
it was a meal .
andrew marr : and now you 've got a 1 all draw .
does that mean you just have to go and sit in solitary splendour in your respective restaurants ?
ambassador susman : no , no , we 're going to get together and go 50-50 on some meal somewhere because it was a draw .
andrew marr : indeed .
ambassador susman , thanks very much indeed for joining us .
see you again soon , i hope .
ambassador susman : always a pleasure .
andrew marr : thank you .
ambassador susman : bye , bye .
