this year , he took the podium as conductor of wagner 's opera " lohengrin " at the bayreuth festival . andris nelsons is a shooting star in the classical music scene .
as the youngest conductor in the history of the bayreuth festival , the 31-year-old latvian has reaped praise from critics across germany and beyond .
this fall , he will see premieres with two of the world 's major orchestras - the berlin and the vienna philharmonics .
deutsche welle spoke with the conductor about his bayreuth debut . deutsche welle : how do you feel after your first performance this year in bayreuth ? andris nelsons : i 'm very excited because it 's such a special place and atmosphere .

you 're dealing with orchestras and choirs composed of individuals who are each wonderful musicians and who each have their own ideas about how the music should be . everybody has an ego - in a good sense .
you need an artistic ego to perform music , but you have to focus those egos toward one result . when the members of an orchestra forget about the global result , it 's dangerous , and that 's a very real possibility in opera .
it should be like a family , though - everyone has a very important place and part in the family .

this year , he took the podium as conductor of wagner 's opera " lohengrin " at the bayreuth festival . andris nelsons is a shooting star in the classical music scene .
as the youngest conductor in the history of the bayreuth festival , the 31-year-old latvian has reaped praise from critics across germany and beyond .
this fall , he will see premieres with two of the world 's major orchestras - the berlin and the vienna philharmonics .
deutsche welle spoke with the conductor about his bayreuth debut . deutsche welle : how do you feel after your first performance this year in bayreuth ? andris nelsons : i 'm very excited because it 's such a special place and atmosphere .
it 's a great pleasure to be here ; everybody 's motivation is just to make the best possible music . but it 's also quite difficult for a conductor in this orchestra pit .
achieving the right balance between the choir , the soloists and the orchestra is hard - especially when conducting pieces that were n't written for bayreuth . have you always been steeped in wager , or what path led you to his work ? wagner was actually one of the first composers i got to know - the first opera i saw was " tannhaeuser " when i was five years old .
ever since then , i 've been listening to and analyzing his operas and been in love with his music . i think starting with wagner also opened my eyes for other composers .
approaching the philosophical and emotional components of wagner 's music helped me understand many other composers , including beethoven .
since wagner was the first i was introduced to , i viewed every other composer from a different perspective . bildunterschrift : the young conductor already has an impressive list of engagements it 's been said that you 're able to have a kind of empathy with each member of an orchestra .
how would you describe the process of bringing together so many different elements when conducting ? that process is what 's magical about being a conductor .
you 're dealing with orchestras and choirs composed of individuals who are each wonderful musicians and who each have their own ideas about how the music should be . everybody has an ego - in a good sense .
you need an artistic ego to perform music , but you have to focus those egos toward one result . when the members of an orchestra forget about the global result , it 's dangerous , and that 's a very real possibility in opera .
it should be like a family , though - everyone has a very important place and part in the family .
if some member of the family thinks someone else is more important , then it does n't work .
that seems to relate to wagner 's intentions with bayreuth - to have people focus on the music and not on themselves .
have you found the bayreuth setting encourages that artistic ideal ? i agree that there is something special about this place both practically and theoretically .
wagner really is the only star here .
for one thing , the audience ca n't even see the conductor in the orchestra pit , so there 's no possibility of the conductor stealing the show . that means the music starts without applause - it starts from scratch in a way .
everything is set up to be just about music . there 's a mystical quality to being here , which i experienced three years ago in the audience when i was invited to conduct " lohengrin . "
everyone comes to this mountain , and everyone is concentrated on the music .
that 's particular to bayreuth , but i wish it were that way everywhere - that the composer would be the one put on the podium . bildunterschrift : nelsons conducted a new production of " lohengrin " by hans neuenfels that was heavy on rodents where do think " lohengrin " stands in wagner 's oeuvre - is it the point where wagner comes into his own as a composer ? i think one notices that " lohengrin " is still an early opera in the oeuvre .
but wagner is so clever , and you can feel from the work that he very consciously knows how to use his powers and to manipulate people in writing music .
i think act two of " lohengrin " contains one of wagner 's greatest masterpieces .
there , he creates the atmosphere so dramatically , and you think , " everything can be so beautiful in life , if you just make the right decisions . "
but then , you also know , " no , no , the ending wo n't be nice . " in act two of the opera , you know that the future could be so great , but wagner knows it will never happen and shows that in the music .

and it 's not that far away , galactically speaking . scientists at the european southern observatory , or eso , announced the discovery of the richest known extrasolar planetary system on tuesday .
after six years of study , eso published its findings that at least five confirmed exoplanets , or extrasolar planets , are orbiting a star only 127 light years away from earth . the five exoplanets all have approximately the mass of neptune - between 13 and 25 times the mass of earth - but orbit much closer to their star , with orbital periods between six and 600 days -lrb- neptune takes 164.79 years to orbit the sun -rrb- . in addition to the five neptune-sized planets , eso astronomers have " tantalizing " evidence of two more exoplanets in the system .
one is saturn-sized , with an orbital period of 2,200 days and the other is the smallest known exoplanet with merely 1.4 earth masses and an orbital period of only 1.18 days . the sun-like star , which is called hd 10180 , is located in the southern constellation hydrus , and has been studied closely since its discovery with the harps spectrograph in la silla , chile .
the existence of the exoplanets was discovered through gravitational wobbles in the behavior of the star caused by the passage of the planets . bildunterschrift : the newly discovered system is only 127 light years from earth familiar traits observed using data from this new discovery as well as data from other planetary systems , the researchers found evidence of the titius-bode law that exists in our solar system : the distances of the planets from their star seem to follow a regular pattern . " this could be a signature of the formation process of these planetary systems , " team member michel mayor said in the eso press release . eso astronomer christophe lovis also acknowledged that this discovery highlights the changes in the field of exoplanet research . " we are now entering a new era in exoplanet research : the study of complex planetary systems and not just of individual planets , " lovis said .
" studies of planetary motions in the new system reveal complex gravitational interactions between the planets and give us insights into the long-term evolution of the system . " through further study of the system around hd 10180 , eso astronomers hope to learn more about planetary formation and about how the solar system was developed , as well as what its future may look like . author : stuart tiffen -lrb- ap / afp -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 25.08.2010 germans are falling in love with tango großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emotion and speed are crucial in tango the germans may not be famous for passionate physical expression , but many are swooning for argentinean tango .
last year , it was added to unesco 's world heritage list and for 2010 it has been named dance of the year . as the sound of bandoneons and violins emanates sensuously from the loudspeakers , a man puts his arm around his partner 's waist , pressing her against him .
from the hips up , the two are welded together like one body , while their legs artistically entangle and detangle themselves . it 's a scene that can be found in any number of dance schools across germany that offer the so-called milonga - the insiders ' term for a tango evening . from munich to hamburg , the tango scene has become so well organized that not having a partner is not an excuse not to join in .
networking services are available to help dancers find partners and travel agencies offer special holiday packages for tango fans . not as easy as it looks despite all the enthusiasm , going from the beginners ' class to being able to glide across the dance floor like a professional is quite a lot of work and takes more than a little talent . " the tango is one of the most difficult dances in the world , " norma raimondi said , a teacher at the don tango club in cologne .
" of course it depends on each person 's talent , but it generally takes a good three years to be able to dance spontaneously , without having to think about each step in advance . " " at the beginning i was just curious , but now it 's like a drug , i have to dance more and more , " said johanna , one of raimondi 's dance student 's , who preferred not to give her last name .
and a certain addiction is necessary to invest so much time into perfecting the dance . bildunterschrift : being comfortable with the steps can take years born out of trials prominent argentinean tango composer enrique santos discepolo -lrb- 1901-1951 -rrb- once said , " the tango is a sad thought that you can dance . "
indeed , that melancholy aspect is inseparably tied to the birthplace of the dance : buenos aires ' old port district , la boca . toward the end of the 19th century , this neighborhood became a gathering place for immigrants who had come to the city on the rio de la plata in search of a better life . tango blended the folklore and the instruments of the immigrants ' homelands to create a completely new sound that would become a symbol of their adopted home : buenos aires . " tango reflects all elements of life , " said 80-year-old luis stazo , a bandoneon player who performed for decades all over the globe with the legendary sexteto mayor .
" it tells how the man betrays the woman and the woman the man .
tango knows horse races , gambling - everything in life .
that 's why tango is much more than a dance . " stazo explained that tango was originally played only with guitar and flute .
later , the bandoneon was added .
the bandoneon - which looks somewhat like an accordion - was invented in the mid-19th century by heinrich band and was initially intended for religious and popular music . " we bandoneon players can thank germany , because the instrument that is so typical for tango and is so important to its soul was invented there , " said stazo . bildunterschrift : a hundred years ago , tango was deamed too sexy for high society frowned upon by the elite corazon , amor y sangre - heart , love and blood - was the immigrants ' motto and describes the soul of the dance .
in the beginning , the big-city argentinean elite rejected the " obscene " tango , which embodied the betrayal , loneliness and failures of the immigrant population . when the foreigners did n't find the riches they had hoped for , many became resigned , turning to gambling or prostitution .
it took many years before tango became socially acceptable . in 1904 , the police even warned against the dance , saying it promoted rivalry among people who , in the end , " always reached for the knife . "
in 1913 , pope st. pius x even condemned the dance . it was , however , too late ; tango had already caught hold .
the roaring twenties ushered in a comeback and in the 21st century it has experienced a revival . " i think that , with tango , many people are looking for a closeness to other people that we are missing in today 's society , " said daniel perusin , an argentinean tango teacher in cologne .
being able to embrace and be embraced is part of what makes tango so fascinating , he added . adjusting to gender roles getting to the point of being able to enjoy the embrace is the first hurdle . " it took me a while to get used to the fact that the man leads , " said dance student johanna .
" as an emancipated european woman , i often tend to want to take the reins . " perusin , on the other hand , said that german men tend to be passive and hesitant and have to learn to take the lead : " they probably think that if they take the active role the women will get upset . " nevertheless , whatever may be holding germans back from expressing themselves fully in this type of dance is still not stopping many of them from giving it a try . author : suzanne cords -lrb- ew / kjb -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite an expected drop in exports , businesses say they are planning to hire . more good news for the german economy emerged on wednesday as the munich-based ifo research institute announced another increase in the german business confidence index .
ifo said its index rose by half a point from july to 106.7 points .
a poll by dow jones newswires had predicted a slight drop to 106 after last month 's record increase of 4.4 points .
" the german economy remains robust , " a statement quoted ifo president hans-werner sinn as saying .
the six-month outlook for manufacturing was " still very confident , though somewhat less so than in the previous month , " the statement said .
ifo releases the closely-watched german business confidence index monthly , and bases its score on a survey of 7,000 business executives in manufacturing , construction , wholesale and retail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sinn says the german economy is still in good shape recovery underway official german second-quarter economic figures released on tuesday increased optimism in the country , with the national statistical office confirming a 2.2 percent growth in gross domestic product - the country 's largest since reunification in 1990 .
german exports largely spurred the economic growth , as a weaker euro made selling easier and demand in the world 's emerging economies surged by 8.2 percent in the second quarter .
however analysts expect growth to taper off in coming months as the growth of exports slows down and countries begin to unravel economic stimulus programs intended to ease effects from the recession .

and it 's not that far away , galactically speaking . scientists at the european southern observatory , or eso , announced the discovery of the richest known extrasolar planetary system on tuesday .
after six years of study , eso published its findings that at least five confirmed exoplanets , or extrasolar planets , are orbiting a star only 127 light years away from earth . the five exoplanets all have approximately the mass of neptune - between 13 and 25 times the mass of earth - but orbit much closer to their star , with orbital periods between six and 600 days -lrb- neptune takes 164.79 years to orbit the sun -rrb- . in addition to the five neptune-sized planets , eso astronomers have " tantalizing " evidence of two more exoplanets in the system .
one is saturn-sized , with an orbital period of 2,200 days and the other is the smallest known exoplanet with merely 1.4 earth masses and an orbital period of only 1.18 days . the sun-like star , which is called hd 10180 , is located in the southern constellation hydrus , and has been studied closely since its discovery with the harps spectrograph in la silla , chile .
the existence of the exoplanets was discovered through gravitational wobbles in the behavior of the star caused by the passage of the planets . bildunterschrift : the newly discovered system is only 127 light years from earth familiar traits observed using data from this new discovery as well as data from other planetary systems , the researchers found evidence of the titius-bode law that exists in our solar system : the distances of the planets from their star seem to follow a regular pattern . " this could be a signature of the formation process of these planetary systems , " team member michel mayor said in the eso press release . eso astronomer christophe lovis also acknowledged that this discovery highlights the changes in the field of exoplanet research . " we are now entering a new era in exoplanet research : the study of complex planetary systems and not just of individual planets , " lovis said .
" studies of planetary motions in the new system reveal complex gravitational interactions between the planets and give us insights into the long-term evolution of the system . " through further study of the system around hd 10180 , eso astronomers hope to learn more about planetary formation and about how the solar system was developed , as well as what its future may look like . author : stuart tiffen -lrb- ap / afp -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with handheld devices , the organization is able to get more accurate data and transmit it wirelessly back to headquarters . the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- in burundi is using handheld personal digital assistants , or pdas , to help keep tabs on the country 's food situation .
the technology has helped speed up the process of data collection and improve the accuracy of the organization 's food security surveys .
staff members organize fact-finding missions to gauge the country 's food supply .
when wfp arrived in burundi in 1968 , the organization was using pen and paper to conduct their food surveys .
now , wfp uses small palmtop computers , only slightly larger than normal cell phones and light enough to carry .
the devices have held up against the strong burundian heat and can last for days before needing a recharge .
" so you have the speed of gathering data , which means you can expand your survey area , and that makes it more valid by interviewing more people , " marc neilson said , a public information officer for wfp burundi .
the organization provides food assistance to more than 600,000 " food-insecure " burundians and some 90 million people around the world every year .
wfp plans to provide about 3.7 million tons of food in 73 countries to those unable to produce or obtain enough food for themselves and their families .
bildunterschrift : wfp provides food assistance to about 90 million people worldwide a welcome development in bihogo village in northern burundi , wfp program assistant gerard bisman uses his pda to conduct a 20-question survey with local residents about their food needs and living standards .
" it 's very interesting to use the device because it 's a lot faster , " he said .
" it used to take us about an hour-and-a-half to complete the entire interview with paper , and now it takes only half-an-hour . "
since he started using the device in march , bisman has eliminated prep time , paper shuffling and the need to decipher sloppy hand writing , which has reduced the margin of error .
the wfp staffer said residents also appreciate the technology , noting that survey-takers used to get " very , very tired " back when the questionnaire was conducted by hand .
bihogo resident elisabeth tembaidai had never been interviewed by wfp before .
the 56-year-old primary school teacher said it is the first time she has seen a pda - and the device shows the country is making progress .
a few years ago , tembaidai received food aid from wfp during a drought .
she said she hopes wfp will provide her with food this year , too .
" well , we will probably need some help in regards to food this year because the water that used to come from up north does n't come anymore , " she said .
" it 's the dry season also , and we are short of food at the moment , and we are asking wfp for some food now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pdas allow wfp to transmit data wirelessly high-speed , wireless transmission information is currently collected on a memory card and sent to the main wfp office in bujumbura , but soon wfp field staff will be able to transmit their findings wirelessly .
burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world , with annual per capita income averaging about $ 300 , or 236 euros .
in 2006 , the country emerged from a 13-year civil war ; one rebel group laid down its arms just last year .
now , however , the country has a new high-speed 3g wireless network .
by sending data wirelessly to the central database for analysis , wfp staff can provide up-to-date information from around the country , helping streamline planning on food shipments . the pda 's price tag is about $ 200 , or 158 euros - and providing two devices in each of burundi 's 15 provinces costs about $ 6,000 , or 4728 euros , not including training costs .
but neilson said the devices are a good investment : " any time you can save doing that , it means those most at risk - the poor - are getting the assistance faster and more effectively , and you 're not perhaps going in an area where you really should n't be , " he said .
" wfp needs to be in the areas that are most at risk .
that 's the bottom line . "
bildunterschrift : scratch card ' e-vouchers ' allow beneficiaries more options to receive food aid scratch card ' e-vouchers ' wfp has put the pdas to use elsewhere in africa , including the congo and mozambique .
in zambia , wfp distributes " e-voucher " scratch cards to improve the food voucher program .
instead of lining up for food aid , people can now choose when and where to pick up their monthly assistance .
the scratch card codes are entered into a mobile phone upon delivery of the food .
wfp said the program reduces transaction costs and increases the " efficiency and effectiveness " of food distribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wfp 's scratch card program reduces the transaction costs of food distribution in syria , 130,000 iraqi refugees receiving food aid are able to get the wfp 's " virtual vouchers " via text message .
the electronic vouchers can be exchanged for items not normally included in conventional aid baskets , such as rice , wheat flour , lentils , chickpeas , oil and canned fish , as well as cheese and eggs .
other organizations are also taking advantage of the new technologies in the field .
in the west african countries of togo and niger , the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- has worked with pdas equipped with gps capabilities to help prevent malaria .
a team of scientists used the electronic devices to collect high-quality data on the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets . in the asia-pacific region , un children 's fund staff use pda questionnaires to provide rapid assessments in emergency situations .
local statistical data on livelihood , poverty , health and nutrition can help inform situation reports , as well as high-level government officials .

with handheld devices , the organization is able to get more accurate data and transmit it wirelessly back to headquarters . the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- in burundi is using handheld personal digital assistants , or pdas , to help keep tabs on the country 's food situation .
the technology has helped speed up the process of data collection and improve the accuracy of the organization 's food security surveys .
staff members organize fact-finding missions to gauge the country 's food supply .
when wfp arrived in burundi in 1968 , the organization was using pen and paper to conduct their food surveys .
now , wfp uses small palmtop computers , only slightly larger than normal cell phones and light enough to carry .
the devices have held up against the strong burundian heat and can last for days before needing a recharge .
" so you have the speed of gathering data , which means you can expand your survey area , and that makes it more valid by interviewing more people , " marc neilson said , a public information officer for wfp burundi .
the organization provides food assistance to more than 600,000 " food-insecure " burundians and some 90 million people around the world every year .
wfp plans to provide about 3.7 million tons of food in 73 countries to those unable to produce or obtain enough food for themselves and their families .
bildunterschrift : wfp provides food assistance to about 90 million people worldwide a welcome development in bihogo village in northern burundi , wfp program assistant gerard bisman uses his pda to conduct a 20-question survey with local residents about their food needs and living standards .
" it 's very interesting to use the device because it 's a lot faster , " he said .
" it used to take us about an hour-and-a-half to complete the entire interview with paper , and now it takes only half-an-hour . "
since he started using the device in march , bisman has eliminated prep time , paper shuffling and the need to decipher sloppy hand writing , which has reduced the margin of error .
the wfp staffer said residents also appreciate the technology , noting that survey-takers used to get " very , very tired " back when the questionnaire was conducted by hand .
bihogo resident elisabeth tembaidai had never been interviewed by wfp before .
the 56-year-old primary school teacher said it is the first time she has seen a pda - and the device shows the country is making progress .
a few years ago , tembaidai received food aid from wfp during a drought .
she said she hopes wfp will provide her with food this year , too .
" well , we will probably need some help in regards to food this year because the water that used to come from up north does n't come anymore , " she said .

with handheld devices , the organization is able to get more accurate data and transmit it wirelessly back to headquarters . the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- in burundi is using handheld personal digital assistants , or pdas , to help keep tabs on the country 's food situation .
the technology has helped speed up the process of data collection and improve the accuracy of the organization 's food security surveys .
staff members organize fact-finding missions to gauge the country 's food supply .
when wfp arrived in burundi in 1968 , the organization was using pen and paper to conduct their food surveys .
now , wfp uses small palmtop computers , only slightly larger than normal cell phones and light enough to carry .
the devices have held up against the strong burundian heat and can last for days before needing a recharge .
" so you have the speed of gathering data , which means you can expand your survey area , and that makes it more valid by interviewing more people , " marc neilson said , a public information officer for wfp burundi .
the organization provides food assistance to more than 600,000 " food-insecure " burundians and some 90 million people around the world every year .
wfp plans to provide about 3.7 million tons of food in 73 countries to those unable to produce or obtain enough food for themselves and their families .
bildunterschrift : wfp provides food assistance to about 90 million people worldwide a welcome development in bihogo village in northern burundi , wfp program assistant gerard bisman uses his pda to conduct a 20-question survey with local residents about their food needs and living standards .
" it 's very interesting to use the device because it 's a lot faster , " he said .
" it used to take us about an hour-and-a-half to complete the entire interview with paper , and now it takes only half-an-hour . "
since he started using the device in march , bisman has eliminated prep time , paper shuffling and the need to decipher sloppy hand writing , which has reduced the margin of error .
the wfp staffer said residents also appreciate the technology , noting that survey-takers used to get " very , very tired " back when the questionnaire was conducted by hand .
bihogo resident elisabeth tembaidai had never been interviewed by wfp before .
the 56-year-old primary school teacher said it is the first time she has seen a pda - and the device shows the country is making progress .
a few years ago , tembaidai received food aid from wfp during a drought .
she said she hopes wfp will provide her with food this year , too .
" well , we will probably need some help in regards to food this year because the water that used to come from up north does n't come anymore , " she said .
" it 's the dry season also , and we are short of food at the moment , and we are asking wfp for some food now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pdas allow wfp to transmit data wirelessly high-speed , wireless transmission information is currently collected on a memory card and sent to the main wfp office in bujumbura , but soon wfp field staff will be able to transmit their findings wirelessly .
burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world , with annual per capita income averaging about $ 300 , or 236 euros .
in 2006 , the country emerged from a 13-year civil war ; one rebel group laid down its arms just last year .
now , however , the country has a new high-speed 3g wireless network .
by sending data wirelessly to the central database for analysis , wfp staff can provide up-to-date information from around the country , helping streamline planning on food shipments . the pda 's price tag is about $ 200 , or 158 euros - and providing two devices in each of burundi 's 15 provinces costs about $ 6,000 , or 4728 euros , not including training costs .
but neilson said the devices are a good investment : " any time you can save doing that , it means those most at risk - the poor - are getting the assistance faster and more effectively , and you 're not perhaps going in an area where you really should n't be , " he said .
" wfp needs to be in the areas that are most at risk .
that 's the bottom line . "
bildunterschrift : scratch card ' e-vouchers ' allow beneficiaries more options to receive food aid scratch card ' e-vouchers ' wfp has put the pdas to use elsewhere in africa , including the congo and mozambique .
in zambia , wfp distributes " e-voucher " scratch cards to improve the food voucher program .
instead of lining up for food aid , people can now choose when and where to pick up their monthly assistance .
the scratch card codes are entered into a mobile phone upon delivery of the food .
wfp said the program reduces transaction costs and increases the " efficiency and effectiveness " of food distribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wfp 's scratch card program reduces the transaction costs of food distribution in syria , 130,000 iraqi refugees receiving food aid are able to get the wfp 's " virtual vouchers " via text message .
the electronic vouchers can be exchanged for items not normally included in conventional aid baskets , such as rice , wheat flour , lentils , chickpeas , oil and canned fish , as well as cheese and eggs .
other organizations are also taking advantage of the new technologies in the field .
in the west african countries of togo and niger , the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- has worked with pdas equipped with gps capabilities to help prevent malaria .
a team of scientists used the electronic devices to collect high-quality data on the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets . in the asia-pacific region , un children 's fund staff use pda questionnaires to provide rapid assessments in emergency situations .
local statistical data on livelihood , poverty , health and nutrition can help inform situation reports , as well as high-level government officials .

last year , it was added to unesco 's world heritage list and for 2010 it has been named dance of the year . as the sound of bandoneons and violins emanates sensuously from the loudspeakers , a man puts his arm around his partner 's waist , pressing her against him .
from the hips up , the two are welded together like one body , while their legs artistically entangle and detangle themselves . it 's a scene that can be found in any number of dance schools across germany that offer the so-called milonga - the insiders ' term for a tango evening . from munich to hamburg , the tango scene has become so well organized that not having a partner is not an excuse not to join in .
networking services are available to help dancers find partners and travel agencies offer special holiday packages for tango fans . not as easy as it looks despite all the enthusiasm , going from the beginners ' class to being able to glide across the dance floor like a professional is quite a lot of work and takes more than a little talent . " the tango is one of the most difficult dances in the world , " norma raimondi said , a teacher at the don tango club in cologne .
" of course it depends on each person 's talent , but it generally takes a good three years to be able to dance spontaneously , without having to think about each step in advance . " " at the beginning i was just curious , but now it 's like a drug , i have to dance more and more , " said johanna , one of raimondi 's dance student 's , who preferred not to give her last name .

indeed , that melancholy aspect is inseparably tied to the birthplace of the dance : buenos aires ' old port district , la boca . toward the end of the 19th century , this neighborhood became a gathering place for immigrants who had come to the city on the rio de la plata in search of a better life . tango blended the folklore and the instruments of the immigrants ' homelands to create a completely new sound that would become a symbol of their adopted home : buenos aires . " tango reflects all elements of life , " said 80-year-old luis stazo , a bandoneon player who performed for decades all over the globe with the legendary sexteto mayor .
" it tells how the man betrays the woman and the woman the man .
tango knows horse races , gambling - everything in life .
that 's why tango is much more than a dance . " stazo explained that tango was originally played only with guitar and flute .
later , the bandoneon was added .
the bandoneon - which looks somewhat like an accordion - was invented in the mid-19th century by heinrich band and was initially intended for religious and popular music . " we bandoneon players can thank germany , because the instrument that is so typical for tango and is so important to its soul was invented there , " said stazo . bildunterschrift : a hundred years ago , tango was deamed too sexy for high society frowned upon by the elite corazon , amor y sangre - heart , love and blood - was the immigrants ' motto and describes the soul of the dance .
in the beginning , the big-city argentinean elite rejected the " obscene " tango , which embodied the betrayal , loneliness and failures of the immigrant population . when the foreigners did n't find the riches they had hoped for , many became resigned , turning to gambling or prostitution .
it took many years before tango became socially acceptable . in 1904 , the police even warned against the dance , saying it promoted rivalry among people who , in the end , " always reached for the knife . "
in 1913 , pope st. pius x even condemned the dance . it was , however , too late ; tango had already caught hold .
the roaring twenties ushered in a comeback and in the 21st century it has experienced a revival . " i think that , with tango , many people are looking for a closeness to other people that we are missing in today 's society , " said daniel perusin , an argentinean tango teacher in cologne .
being able to embrace and be embraced is part of what makes tango so fascinating , he added . adjusting to gender roles getting to the point of being able to enjoy the embrace is the first hurdle . " it took me a while to get used to the fact that the man leads , " said dance student johanna .
" as an emancipated european woman , i often tend to want to take the reins . " perusin , on the other hand , said that german men tend to be passive and hesitant and have to learn to take the lead : " they probably think that if they take the active role the women will get upset .

last year , it was added to unesco 's world heritage list and for 2010 it has been named dance of the year . as the sound of bandoneons and violins emanates sensuously from the loudspeakers , a man puts his arm around his partner 's waist , pressing her against him .
from the hips up , the two are welded together like one body , while their legs artistically entangle and detangle themselves . it 's a scene that can be found in any number of dance schools across germany that offer the so-called milonga - the insiders ' term for a tango evening . from munich to hamburg , the tango scene has become so well organized that not having a partner is not an excuse not to join in .
networking services are available to help dancers find partners and travel agencies offer special holiday packages for tango fans . not as easy as it looks despite all the enthusiasm , going from the beginners ' class to being able to glide across the dance floor like a professional is quite a lot of work and takes more than a little talent . " the tango is one of the most difficult dances in the world , " norma raimondi said , a teacher at the don tango club in cologne .
" of course it depends on each person 's talent , but it generally takes a good three years to be able to dance spontaneously , without having to think about each step in advance . " " at the beginning i was just curious , but now it 's like a drug , i have to dance more and more , " said johanna , one of raimondi 's dance student 's , who preferred not to give her last name .
and a certain addiction is necessary to invest so much time into perfecting the dance . bildunterschrift : being comfortable with the steps can take years born out of trials prominent argentinean tango composer enrique santos discepolo -lrb- 1901-1951 -rrb- once said , " the tango is a sad thought that you can dance . "
indeed , that melancholy aspect is inseparably tied to the birthplace of the dance : buenos aires ' old port district , la boca . toward the end of the 19th century , this neighborhood became a gathering place for immigrants who had come to the city on the rio de la plata in search of a better life . tango blended the folklore and the instruments of the immigrants ' homelands to create a completely new sound that would become a symbol of their adopted home : buenos aires . " tango reflects all elements of life , " said 80-year-old luis stazo , a bandoneon player who performed for decades all over the globe with the legendary sexteto mayor .
" it tells how the man betrays the woman and the woman the man .
tango knows horse races , gambling - everything in life .
that 's why tango is much more than a dance . " stazo explained that tango was originally played only with guitar and flute .
later , the bandoneon was added .
the bandoneon - which looks somewhat like an accordion - was invented in the mid-19th century by heinrich band and was initially intended for religious and popular music . " we bandoneon players can thank germany , because the instrument that is so typical for tango and is so important to its soul was invented there , " said stazo . bildunterschrift : a hundred years ago , tango was deamed too sexy for high society frowned upon by the elite corazon , amor y sangre - heart , love and blood - was the immigrants ' motto and describes the soul of the dance .
in the beginning , the big-city argentinean elite rejected the " obscene " tango , which embodied the betrayal , loneliness and failures of the immigrant population . when the foreigners did n't find the riches they had hoped for , many became resigned , turning to gambling or prostitution .
it took many years before tango became socially acceptable . in 1904 , the police even warned against the dance , saying it promoted rivalry among people who , in the end , " always reached for the knife . "
in 1913 , pope st. pius x even condemned the dance . it was , however , too late ; tango had already caught hold .
the roaring twenties ushered in a comeback and in the 21st century it has experienced a revival . " i think that , with tango , many people are looking for a closeness to other people that we are missing in today 's society , " said daniel perusin , an argentinean tango teacher in cologne .

with handheld devices , the organization is able to get more accurate data and transmit it wirelessly back to headquarters . the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- in burundi is using handheld personal digital assistants , or pdas , to help keep tabs on the country 's food situation .
the technology has helped speed up the process of data collection and improve the accuracy of the organization 's food security surveys .
staff members organize fact-finding missions to gauge the country 's food supply .
when wfp arrived in burundi in 1968 , the organization was using pen and paper to conduct their food surveys .
now , wfp uses small palmtop computers , only slightly larger than normal cell phones and light enough to carry .
the devices have held up against the strong burundian heat and can last for days before needing a recharge .
" so you have the speed of gathering data , which means you can expand your survey area , and that makes it more valid by interviewing more people , " marc neilson said , a public information officer for wfp burundi .
the organization provides food assistance to more than 600,000 " food-insecure " burundians and some 90 million people around the world every year .
wfp plans to provide about 3.7 million tons of food in 73 countries to those unable to produce or obtain enough food for themselves and their families .
bildunterschrift : wfp provides food assistance to about 90 million people worldwide a welcome development in bihogo village in northern burundi , wfp program assistant gerard bisman uses his pda to conduct a 20-question survey with local residents about their food needs and living standards .
" it 's very interesting to use the device because it 's a lot faster , " he said .
" it used to take us about an hour-and-a-half to complete the entire interview with paper , and now it takes only half-an-hour . "
since he started using the device in march , bisman has eliminated prep time , paper shuffling and the need to decipher sloppy hand writing , which has reduced the margin of error .
the wfp staffer said residents also appreciate the technology , noting that survey-takers used to get " very , very tired " back when the questionnaire was conducted by hand .
bihogo resident elisabeth tembaidai had never been interviewed by wfp before .
the 56-year-old primary school teacher said it is the first time she has seen a pda - and the device shows the country is making progress .
a few years ago , tembaidai received food aid from wfp during a drought .
she said she hopes wfp will provide her with food this year , too .
" well , we will probably need some help in regards to food this year because the water that used to come from up north does n't come anymore , " she said .
" it 's the dry season also , and we are short of food at the moment , and we are asking wfp for some food now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pdas allow wfp to transmit data wirelessly high-speed , wireless transmission information is currently collected on a memory card and sent to the main wfp office in bujumbura , but soon wfp field staff will be able to transmit their findings wirelessly .
burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world , with annual per capita income averaging about $ 300 , or 236 euros .
in 2006 , the country emerged from a 13-year civil war ; one rebel group laid down its arms just last year .
now , however , the country has a new high-speed 3g wireless network .
by sending data wirelessly to the central database for analysis , wfp staff can provide up-to-date information from around the country , helping streamline planning on food shipments . the pda 's price tag is about $ 200 , or 158 euros - and providing two devices in each of burundi 's 15 provinces costs about $ 6,000 , or 4728 euros , not including training costs .
but neilson said the devices are a good investment : " any time you can save doing that , it means those most at risk - the poor - are getting the assistance faster and more effectively , and you 're not perhaps going in an area where you really should n't be , " he said .
" wfp needs to be in the areas that are most at risk .
that 's the bottom line . "
bildunterschrift : scratch card ' e-vouchers ' allow beneficiaries more options to receive food aid scratch card ' e-vouchers ' wfp has put the pdas to use elsewhere in africa , including the congo and mozambique .
in zambia , wfp distributes " e-voucher " scratch cards to improve the food voucher program .
instead of lining up for food aid , people can now choose when and where to pick up their monthly assistance .
the scratch card codes are entered into a mobile phone upon delivery of the food .
wfp said the program reduces transaction costs and increases the " efficiency and effectiveness " of food distribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wfp 's scratch card program reduces the transaction costs of food distribution in syria , 130,000 iraqi refugees receiving food aid are able to get the wfp 's " virtual vouchers " via text message .
the electronic vouchers can be exchanged for items not normally included in conventional aid baskets , such as rice , wheat flour , lentils , chickpeas , oil and canned fish , as well as cheese and eggs .
other organizations are also taking advantage of the new technologies in the field .
in the west african countries of togo and niger , the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- has worked with pdas equipped with gps capabilities to help prevent malaria .
a team of scientists used the electronic devices to collect high-quality data on the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets . in the asia-pacific region , un children 's fund staff use pda questionnaires to provide rapid assessments in emergency situations .
local statistical data on livelihood , poverty , health and nutrition can help inform situation reports , as well as high-level government officials .

the 56-year-old primary school teacher said it is the first time she has seen a pda - and the device shows the country is making progress .
a few years ago , tembaidai received food aid from wfp during a drought .
she said she hopes wfp will provide her with food this year , too .
" well , we will probably need some help in regards to food this year because the water that used to come from up north does n't come anymore , " she said .
" it 's the dry season also , and we are short of food at the moment , and we are asking wfp for some food now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pdas allow wfp to transmit data wirelessly high-speed , wireless transmission information is currently collected on a memory card and sent to the main wfp office in bujumbura , but soon wfp field staff will be able to transmit their findings wirelessly .
burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world , with annual per capita income averaging about $ 300 , or 236 euros .
in 2006 , the country emerged from a 13-year civil war ; one rebel group laid down its arms just last year .
now , however , the country has a new high-speed 3g wireless network .
by sending data wirelessly to the central database for analysis , wfp staff can provide up-to-date information from around the country , helping streamline planning on food shipments . the pda 's price tag is about $ 200 , or 158 euros - and providing two devices in each of burundi 's 15 provinces costs about $ 6,000 , or 4728 euros , not including training costs .
but neilson said the devices are a good investment : " any time you can save doing that , it means those most at risk - the poor - are getting the assistance faster and more effectively , and you 're not perhaps going in an area where you really should n't be , " he said .
" wfp needs to be in the areas that are most at risk .
that 's the bottom line . "
bildunterschrift : scratch card ' e-vouchers ' allow beneficiaries more options to receive food aid scratch card ' e-vouchers ' wfp has put the pdas to use elsewhere in africa , including the congo and mozambique .
in zambia , wfp distributes " e-voucher " scratch cards to improve the food voucher program .
instead of lining up for food aid , people can now choose when and where to pick up their monthly assistance .
the scratch card codes are entered into a mobile phone upon delivery of the food .
wfp said the program reduces transaction costs and increases the " efficiency and effectiveness " of food distribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wfp 's scratch card program reduces the transaction costs of food distribution in syria , 130,000 iraqi refugees receiving food aid are able to get the wfp 's " virtual vouchers " via text message .
the electronic vouchers can be exchanged for items not normally included in conventional aid baskets , such as rice , wheat flour , lentils , chickpeas , oil and canned fish , as well as cheese and eggs .
other organizations are also taking advantage of the new technologies in the field .
in the west african countries of togo and niger , the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- has worked with pdas equipped with gps capabilities to help prevent malaria .
a team of scientists used the electronic devices to collect high-quality data on the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets . in the asia-pacific region , un children 's fund staff use pda questionnaires to provide rapid assessments in emergency situations .
local statistical data on livelihood , poverty , health and nutrition can help inform situation reports , as well as high-level government officials .

this year , he took the podium as conductor of wagner 's opera " lohengrin " at the bayreuth festival . andris nelsons is a shooting star in the classical music scene .
as the youngest conductor in the history of the bayreuth festival , the 31-year-old latvian has reaped praise from critics across germany and beyond .
this fall , he will see premieres with two of the world 's major orchestras - the berlin and the vienna philharmonics .
deutsche welle spoke with the conductor about his bayreuth debut . deutsche welle : how do you feel after your first performance this year in bayreuth ? andris nelsons : i 'm very excited because it 's such a special place and atmosphere .
it 's a great pleasure to be here ; everybody 's motivation is just to make the best possible music . but it 's also quite difficult for a conductor in this orchestra pit .
achieving the right balance between the choir , the soloists and the orchestra is hard - especially when conducting pieces that were n't written for bayreuth . have you always been steeped in wager , or what path led you to his work ? wagner was actually one of the first composers i got to know - the first opera i saw was " tannhaeuser " when i was five years old .
ever since then , i 've been listening to and analyzing his operas and been in love with his music . i think starting with wagner also opened my eyes for other composers .
approaching the philosophical and emotional components of wagner 's music helped me understand many other composers , including beethoven .
since wagner was the first i was introduced to , i viewed every other composer from a different perspective . bildunterschrift : the young conductor already has an impressive list of engagements it 's been said that you 're able to have a kind of empathy with each member of an orchestra .
how would you describe the process of bringing together so many different elements when conducting ? that process is what 's magical about being a conductor .
you 're dealing with orchestras and choirs composed of individuals who are each wonderful musicians and who each have their own ideas about how the music should be . everybody has an ego - in a good sense .
you need an artistic ego to perform music , but you have to focus those egos toward one result . when the members of an orchestra forget about the global result , it 's dangerous , and that 's a very real possibility in opera .
it should be like a family , though - everyone has a very important place and part in the family .
if some member of the family thinks someone else is more important , then it does n't work .
that seems to relate to wagner 's intentions with bayreuth - to have people focus on the music and not on themselves .
have you found the bayreuth setting encourages that artistic ideal ? i agree that there is something special about this place both practically and theoretically .
wagner really is the only star here .
for one thing , the audience ca n't even see the conductor in the orchestra pit , so there 's no possibility of the conductor stealing the show . that means the music starts without applause - it starts from scratch in a way .

deutsche welle spoke with the conductor about his bayreuth debut . deutsche welle : how do you feel after your first performance this year in bayreuth ? andris nelsons : i 'm very excited because it 's such a special place and atmosphere .
it 's a great pleasure to be here ; everybody 's motivation is just to make the best possible music . but it 's also quite difficult for a conductor in this orchestra pit .
achieving the right balance between the choir , the soloists and the orchestra is hard - especially when conducting pieces that were n't written for bayreuth . have you always been steeped in wager , or what path led you to his work ? wagner was actually one of the first composers i got to know - the first opera i saw was " tannhaeuser " when i was five years old .
ever since then , i 've been listening to and analyzing his operas and been in love with his music . i think starting with wagner also opened my eyes for other composers .
approaching the philosophical and emotional components of wagner 's music helped me understand many other composers , including beethoven .
since wagner was the first i was introduced to , i viewed every other composer from a different perspective . bildunterschrift : the young conductor already has an impressive list of engagements it 's been said that you 're able to have a kind of empathy with each member of an orchestra .
how would you describe the process of bringing together so many different elements when conducting ? that process is what 's magical about being a conductor .
you 're dealing with orchestras and choirs composed of individuals who are each wonderful musicians and who each have their own ideas about how the music should be . everybody has an ego - in a good sense .
you need an artistic ego to perform music , but you have to focus those egos toward one result . when the members of an orchestra forget about the global result , it 's dangerous , and that 's a very real possibility in opera .
it should be like a family , though - everyone has a very important place and part in the family .
if some member of the family thinks someone else is more important , then it does n't work .
that seems to relate to wagner 's intentions with bayreuth - to have people focus on the music and not on themselves .
have you found the bayreuth setting encourages that artistic ideal ? i agree that there is something special about this place both practically and theoretically .
wagner really is the only star here .
for one thing , the audience ca n't even see the conductor in the orchestra pit , so there 's no possibility of the conductor stealing the show . that means the music starts without applause - it starts from scratch in a way .
everything is set up to be just about music . there 's a mystical quality to being here , which i experienced three years ago in the audience when i was invited to conduct " lohengrin . "
everyone comes to this mountain , and everyone is concentrated on the music .
that 's particular to bayreuth , but i wish it were that way everywhere - that the composer would be the one put on the podium . bildunterschrift : nelsons conducted a new production of " lohengrin " by hans neuenfels that was heavy on rodents where do think " lohengrin " stands in wagner 's oeuvre - is it the point where wagner comes into his own as a composer ? i think one notices that " lohengrin " is still an early opera in the oeuvre .

westerwelle had words of encouragement but said accession rules would remain firm . german foreign minister guido westerwelle met with croatian leaders in zagreb on wednesday , kicking off his three-day trip to the balkans .
on arrival , westerwelle met with president ivo josipovic , prime minister jadranka kosor and foreign minister gordan jandrokovic .
he then gave a speech to the academy of sciences encouraging the country to make the necessary reforms for european union accession .
" if croatia musters all its strength for the final sprint , then -lsb- eu -rsb- membership could be wrapped up soon , perhaps as soon as next year , " westerwelle said .
he added , however , that there would be no concessions on the accession criteria , especially in light of this year 's greek budget crisis .
" if we loosened the rules , we would only sow concerns about taking on new members . "
croatia is set to join the eu in 2012 , and is seen as the least problematic balkan country seeking accession .
westerwelle praised croatia for recently resolving a border conflict with slovenia , the only country from the former yugoslavia that has joined the union .
diplomatic challenge on thursday , westerwelle travels to the serbian capital of belgrade , where he will face the tricky task of dissuading serbia from seeking a new united nations resolution on the status of kosovo .
" he wo n't put too much pressure on serbia , " westerwelle 's spokesman stephan bredohl , who is traveling with him , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is in line with international law " but we 're very clear on kosovo : germany has accepted its independence and it 's very important for us that if serbia wants to join the european union , it needs to be constructive and toe the eu 's line , " he explained .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 and is now officially recognized by 69 countries .
in july , the international court of justice , which serbia had called on to rule on kosovo 's status , declared that its declaration of independence was in line with international law .
serbia refuses to accept the verdict , pressing instead for a un resolution to reopen talks on the status of what it considers the serbian province of kosovo .
germany was one of the first countries to recognize kosovo as an independent state .
five eu member states , however , do not recognize kosovo , meaning the eu can not make it a precondition for serbia to join the eu .
deadlock in bosnia westerwelle is also to visit bosnia-herzegovina on thursday .
nearly 15 years after the dayton peace agreement , which ended the fighting and split bosnia-herzegovina into two largely autonomous entities , the political situation there remains challenging . many serbs , muslims and croats remain pitted against each other ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for october 3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik seeks independence for bosnian serbs while the ruling on kosovo by the international court of justice was well-received in germany , it has also fanned the flames of separatism in the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , the mainly serb bosnian entity .
its leader milorad dodik has threatened secession from bosnia since he came into power in 2006 .
after the verdict on kosovo , he declared that he would start discussions on independence after the elections .
" in bosnia , the foreign minister 's visit will be largely symbolic and he will try to call on voters to be moderate , " bodo weber , an expert on the region at the democratization policy council , told deutsche welle .
focus on the region germany has been criticized for not making the balkans a focus of its foreign policy , not least because it did not send a representative to the eu-balkan summit in sarajevo in june . many are hoping westerwelle 's trip will change that .
" these countries -lsb- in the balkans -rsb- are already part of europe , that 's why their problems are our problems , " said bernd posselt , mep for germany 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in brussels .
" i would hope that the foreign minister will not just see this trip as a photo opportunity , but see it as the start of a much greater focus of his foreign policy , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 25.08.2010 neurological cause found for the baby blues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postpartum depression affects 15 percent of new mothers the baby blues affects up to three-quarters of new mothers .
new research shows that there 's a physiological cause that could be treated with dietary supplements . after the relative calm of pregnancy , giving birth is a physically and emotionally draining experience .
but the changes do n't stop there .
a woman 's estrogen levels drop significantly , and she now has to care for a crying baby 24 hours a day .
given these circumstances it 's no wonder that up to 75 percent of new mothers around the world feel down for a few days after giving birth .
but new research has found there 's an additional neurological cause to the baby blues as well .
feelings of impotence anne-christin b. , who prefered not to use her last name due to the stigma of postpartum depression , is a 33-year-old mother from berlin .
for the first day or two after her daughter was born four months ago , she felt happy , but that quickly changed .
" then came the feeling that i could n't do things .
i was afraid .
i could n't do things for the child - for whatever reason , " she remembered .
" and then i started to withdraw , i could n't go out or talk with friends on the telephone and this increased very quickly to the point where i could n't be by myself anymore . "
anne-christin is n't the only one .
millions of german women also experience the baby blues .
in her case , she was one of 15 percent of women who develop postpartum depression .
she went to her local doctor , but he did n't take her seriously , so she sought professional psychiatric help .
the source of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decreased serotonin levels are believed to be a culprit of postpartum depression dr. julia sacher , from the max planck institute for human cognitive and brain sciences in leipzig , said it 's well-documented that a sharp drop in estrogen levels and a big change in environment contribute to the baby blues .
that 's why research in this area is incredibly important .
" what we do know is that those women who have severe symptoms of postpartum blues have a higher risk of experiencing a full-blown episode later on , " sacher said .
sacher and her colleagues published the results of their study in the peer-reviewed journal , archives of general psychiatry , earlier this summer .
they found that there is a neurological cause for the baby blues .
" we see an increase in monoamine oxidase a and this can lead to a loss of serotonin , and a loss of serotonin has been associated with low mood , " sacher explained .
feeling sad after childbirth is socially unacceptable other medical professionals , like dr. stephanie krueger , said that this new study may prompt obstetricians to keep an eye on a mother 's moods both before and after childbirth .
krueger is a professor of psychiatry at the charite in berlin , one of the largest university hospitals in europe .
she treated anne-christin for post-partum depression . krueger - who was n't part of the study - said most women who feel depressed after their child is born do n't seek necessary help , because it 's not socially acceptable to feel sad at this time .
" in our culture , women who have just given birth are supposed to be happy , and if they are not , then there 's something wrong with them and they are actually treated as some kind of an outlaw , " krueger said , adding , " in many cases they are being told : why are n't you happy ? "
krueger believes there needs to be more education and support for new mothers .
" families and gps -lsb- general practitioner -rsb- should not take these things lightly and not say , ' well yeah i understand you 've just given birth - everything will be fine ' , " krueger said .
" physicians and families should take any symptoms of depression seriously and go to someone who knows what they are doing , meaning a psychiatrist , for example . "
berlin mother anne-christin b. said she wished her doctors and other medical professionals had talked to her about the baby blues during the pregnancy .
" it would have been better if , even in a midwifery course , there was perhaps 30 minutes or an hour discussion in preparation for pregnancy , where it was explained , where you explain the symptoms and also tell people where they can call for help , " anne-christin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the dramatic life changes brought by babies contribute to depression dietary supplements could help while the baby blues usually goes away by itself after a couple of days , dr. sacher from the max planck institute said treating this temporary condition could be an important step in preventing postpartum depression .
she thinks the baby blues could be treated with medication or dietary supplements , which could counter the increase in the enzyme monoamine oxidase a. but not everyone agrees the baby blues can be prevented so easily .
lisa fehrenbach has been a midwife for 35 years .
she said feeling a bit down after childbirth is a natural thing because childbirth is a physically and emotionally life-changing experience .
many women go from working full-time to being at home with a crying baby - often by themselves .
" you had a completely independent life and you organized everything and you had everything under control and suddenly there 's a little baby , " said fehrenbach , " it clings to your body 24 hours and you have to care for it 24 hours and you can not do what you want , but you have to do what the baby wants . "
fehrenbach said even if women took dietary supplements to counter the enzyme increase , they still have to adjust to this new baby in their lives .
beyond making pregnant women aware of the physiological and psychological changes in their bodies , both sacher and krueger agree this problem needs to be discussed openly in order to fight the stigma of postpartum blues and depression .
" postpartum disorders are nothing the woman is responsible for .
they ca n't help it , " krueger said .
" it has biological reasons for the most part and it can be treated effectively and it should be treated effectively . "
sacher 's next step will be to test for the elevated enzyme in postpartum depression .

new research shows that there 's a physiological cause that could be treated with dietary supplements . after the relative calm of pregnancy , giving birth is a physically and emotionally draining experience .
but the changes do n't stop there .
a woman 's estrogen levels drop significantly , and she now has to care for a crying baby 24 hours a day .
given these circumstances it 's no wonder that up to 75 percent of new mothers around the world feel down for a few days after giving birth .
but new research has found there 's an additional neurological cause to the baby blues as well .
feelings of impotence anne-christin b. , who prefered not to use her last name due to the stigma of postpartum depression , is a 33-year-old mother from berlin .
for the first day or two after her daughter was born four months ago , she felt happy , but that quickly changed .
" then came the feeling that i could n't do things .
i was afraid .
i could n't do things for the child - for whatever reason , " she remembered .
" and then i started to withdraw , i could n't go out or talk with friends on the telephone and this increased very quickly to the point where i could n't be by myself anymore . "
anne-christin is n't the only one .
millions of german women also experience the baby blues .
in her case , she was one of 15 percent of women who develop postpartum depression .
she went to her local doctor , but he did n't take her seriously , so she sought professional psychiatric help .
the source of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decreased serotonin levels are believed to be a culprit of postpartum depression dr. julia sacher , from the max planck institute for human cognitive and brain sciences in leipzig , said it 's well-documented that a sharp drop in estrogen levels and a big change in environment contribute to the baby blues .
that 's why research in this area is incredibly important .
" what we do know is that those women who have severe symptoms of postpartum blues have a higher risk of experiencing a full-blown episode later on , " sacher said .
sacher and her colleagues published the results of their study in the peer-reviewed journal , archives of general psychiatry , earlier this summer .
they found that there is a neurological cause for the baby blues .
" we see an increase in monoamine oxidase a and this can lead to a loss of serotonin , and a loss of serotonin has been associated with low mood , " sacher explained .
feeling sad after childbirth is socially unacceptable other medical professionals , like dr. stephanie krueger , said that this new study may prompt obstetricians to keep an eye on a mother 's moods both before and after childbirth .
krueger is a professor of psychiatry at the charite in berlin , one of the largest university hospitals in europe .
she treated anne-christin for post-partum depression . krueger - who was n't part of the study - said most women who feel depressed after their child is born do n't seek necessary help , because it 's not socially acceptable to feel sad at this time .
" in our culture , women who have just given birth are supposed to be happy , and if they are not , then there 's something wrong with them and they are actually treated as some kind of an outlaw , " krueger said , adding , " in many cases they are being told : why are n't you happy ? "
krueger believes there needs to be more education and support for new mothers .
" families and gps -lsb- general practitioner -rsb- should not take these things lightly and not say , ' well yeah i understand you 've just given birth - everything will be fine ' , " krueger said .
" physicians and families should take any symptoms of depression seriously and go to someone who knows what they are doing , meaning a psychiatrist , for example . "
berlin mother anne-christin b. said she wished her doctors and other medical professionals had talked to her about the baby blues during the pregnancy .
" it would have been better if , even in a midwifery course , there was perhaps 30 minutes or an hour discussion in preparation for pregnancy , where it was explained , where you explain the symptoms and also tell people where they can call for help , " anne-christin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the dramatic life changes brought by babies contribute to depression dietary supplements could help while the baby blues usually goes away by itself after a couple of days , dr. sacher from the max planck institute said treating this temporary condition could be an important step in preventing postpartum depression .
she thinks the baby blues could be treated with medication or dietary supplements , which could counter the increase in the enzyme monoamine oxidase a. but not everyone agrees the baby blues can be prevented so easily .
lisa fehrenbach has been a midwife for 35 years .
she said feeling a bit down after childbirth is a natural thing because childbirth is a physically and emotionally life-changing experience .
many women go from working full-time to being at home with a crying baby - often by themselves .
" you had a completely independent life and you organized everything and you had everything under control and suddenly there 's a little baby , " said fehrenbach , " it clings to your body 24 hours and you have to care for it 24 hours and you can not do what you want , but you have to do what the baby wants . "
fehrenbach said even if women took dietary supplements to counter the enzyme increase , they still have to adjust to this new baby in their lives .
beyond making pregnant women aware of the physiological and psychological changes in their bodies , both sacher and krueger agree this problem needs to be discussed openly in order to fight the stigma of postpartum blues and depression .
" postpartum disorders are nothing the woman is responsible for .
they ca n't help it , " krueger said .
" it has biological reasons for the most part and it can be treated effectively and it should be treated effectively . "
sacher 's next step will be to test for the elevated enzyme in postpartum depression .

westerwelle had words of encouragement but said accession rules would remain firm . german foreign minister guido westerwelle met with croatian leaders in zagreb on wednesday , kicking off his three-day trip to the balkans .
on arrival , westerwelle met with president ivo josipovic , prime minister jadranka kosor and foreign minister gordan jandrokovic .
he then gave a speech to the academy of sciences encouraging the country to make the necessary reforms for european union accession .
" if croatia musters all its strength for the final sprint , then -lsb- eu -rsb- membership could be wrapped up soon , perhaps as soon as next year , " westerwelle said .
he added , however , that there would be no concessions on the accession criteria , especially in light of this year 's greek budget crisis .
" if we loosened the rules , we would only sow concerns about taking on new members . "
croatia is set to join the eu in 2012 , and is seen as the least problematic balkan country seeking accession .
westerwelle praised croatia for recently resolving a border conflict with slovenia , the only country from the former yugoslavia that has joined the union .
diplomatic challenge on thursday , westerwelle travels to the serbian capital of belgrade , where he will face the tricky task of dissuading serbia from seeking a new united nations resolution on the status of kosovo .
" he wo n't put too much pressure on serbia , " westerwelle 's spokesman stephan bredohl , who is traveling with him , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is in line with international law " but we 're very clear on kosovo : germany has accepted its independence and it 's very important for us that if serbia wants to join the european union , it needs to be constructive and toe the eu 's line , " he explained .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 and is now officially recognized by 69 countries .
in july , the international court of justice , which serbia had called on to rule on kosovo 's status , declared that its declaration of independence was in line with international law .
serbia refuses to accept the verdict , pressing instead for a un resolution to reopen talks on the status of what it considers the serbian province of kosovo .
germany was one of the first countries to recognize kosovo as an independent state .
five eu member states , however , do not recognize kosovo , meaning the eu can not make it a precondition for serbia to join the eu .
deadlock in bosnia westerwelle is also to visit bosnia-herzegovina on thursday .
nearly 15 years after the dayton peace agreement , which ended the fighting and split bosnia-herzegovina into two largely autonomous entities , the political situation there remains challenging . many serbs , muslims and croats remain pitted against each other ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for october 3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik seeks independence for bosnian serbs while the ruling on kosovo by the international court of justice was well-received in germany , it has also fanned the flames of separatism in the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , the mainly serb bosnian entity .
its leader milorad dodik has threatened secession from bosnia since he came into power in 2006 .
after the verdict on kosovo , he declared that he would start discussions on independence after the elections .

westerwelle had words of encouragement but said accession rules would remain firm . german foreign minister guido westerwelle met with croatian leaders in zagreb on wednesday , kicking off his three-day trip to the balkans .
on arrival , westerwelle met with president ivo josipovic , prime minister jadranka kosor and foreign minister gordan jandrokovic .
he then gave a speech to the academy of sciences encouraging the country to make the necessary reforms for european union accession .
" if croatia musters all its strength for the final sprint , then -lsb- eu -rsb- membership could be wrapped up soon , perhaps as soon as next year , " westerwelle said .
he added , however , that there would be no concessions on the accession criteria , especially in light of this year 's greek budget crisis .
" if we loosened the rules , we would only sow concerns about taking on new members . "
croatia is set to join the eu in 2012 , and is seen as the least problematic balkan country seeking accession .
westerwelle praised croatia for recently resolving a border conflict with slovenia , the only country from the former yugoslavia that has joined the union .
diplomatic challenge on thursday , westerwelle travels to the serbian capital of belgrade , where he will face the tricky task of dissuading serbia from seeking a new united nations resolution on the status of kosovo .
" he wo n't put too much pressure on serbia , " westerwelle 's spokesman stephan bredohl , who is traveling with him , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is in line with international law " but we 're very clear on kosovo : germany has accepted its independence and it 's very important for us that if serbia wants to join the european union , it needs to be constructive and toe the eu 's line , " he explained .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 and is now officially recognized by 69 countries .
in july , the international court of justice , which serbia had called on to rule on kosovo 's status , declared that its declaration of independence was in line with international law .
serbia refuses to accept the verdict , pressing instead for a un resolution to reopen talks on the status of what it considers the serbian province of kosovo .
germany was one of the first countries to recognize kosovo as an independent state .
five eu member states , however , do not recognize kosovo , meaning the eu can not make it a precondition for serbia to join the eu .
deadlock in bosnia westerwelle is also to visit bosnia-herzegovina on thursday .
nearly 15 years after the dayton peace agreement , which ended the fighting and split bosnia-herzegovina into two largely autonomous entities , the political situation there remains challenging . many serbs , muslims and croats remain pitted against each other ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for october 3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik seeks independence for bosnian serbs while the ruling on kosovo by the international court of justice was well-received in germany , it has also fanned the flames of separatism in the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , the mainly serb bosnian entity .
its leader milorad dodik has threatened secession from bosnia since he came into power in 2006 .
after the verdict on kosovo , he declared that he would start discussions on independence after the elections .
" in bosnia , the foreign minister 's visit will be largely symbolic and he will try to call on voters to be moderate , " bodo weber , an expert on the region at the democratization policy council , told deutsche welle .

one of the key issues is the country 's fledgling economic recovery .
but the party that is leading in the opinion polls wants to forge closer ties with russia . latvia is slowly emerging from recession with the help of money from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the european union .
the economic recovery is likely to play a central role in the parliamentary elections in october .

october 2nd is decision time come election day , latvians will choose between 10 parties , or alliances , running for the 100-seat parliament , or saeima .

she is alarmed at the prospect of " harmony centre " winning the most seats in parliament : " harmony centre is … not a stable party , " locmele said .

in order to keep the economic recovery on track , locmele feels the country needs to stick to its structural reforms .

the former student activist deals with the megacity 's contradictions in her texts .
the writer says jakarta is not friendly to those who have little . " oh darn it , i scratched too deep .
crazy … this wall is crumbly .
look !
here !
under this layer of colour .
this is it .
this is the layer of that mural with the literature quote , " ayu utami explains jubilantly . we are standing on a sidewalk facing a wall at cikini railway station - a small station in the middle of the city .
trains swelling over with commuters from jakarta 's suburbs stop here . under the layer of paint that ayu utami has scratched away , a poem has been written in black against a yellow background .
the poem is titled " ktp , " the abbreviation for identity card in indonesia . " ktp " was written by goenawan mohammad , a poet , writer , thinker , and one of indonesia 's best known cultural critics , with whom ayu utami worked a great deal . bildunterschrift : the indonesian poet goenawan mohammad is very interested in identity the poem speaks of the multiple identities of jakarta 's inhabitants .
each year , at least 300,000 more people arrive in the city , from all over indonesia .
but the city does not change them very much .
nor do they change the city .
most come here to work and do not bring their traditions with them .
so jakarta , this city where languages and cultures live side by side , never really becomes their home . twenty languages spoken we go back to the car , where our driver is speaking in javanese to his wife on his mobile phone .
in jakarta , at least 20 languages are spoken .
like the driver , ayu utami was not born in the capital but came as a child .
her family hails from bogor , where people speak mostly sundanese . she wrote her first novel " saman " in the national language bahasa indonesia .
it quickly became a bestseller in this modern babylon and was then translated into many other languages . ayu utami tries her hand at reading aloud : " he looked at me .
then deep into my eyes , before sitting down next to rosano .
it was actually a very brief contact .
as if he were shy , but at the same time proud , manly … he looked at my tray and said ' you do n't eat much . '
sihar situmorang .
he smiled .
sihar mostly spoke in the jakarta dialect .
occasionally a batak expression came through , usually when he got excited .
to her ears , it sounded warm and comfortable … " bringing literature to public spaces " saman " tells the story of a catholic priest who sides with the poor .
he then falls in love and gives up his priesthood .
it is also the story of a group of women , who break out of their traditional roles .
published in 1988 , it was named best novel by the jakarta arts council . ayu utami is now a member of jakarta arts council and tells me about the projects .
" last year , we focused on the subject of cities .
many groups worked with our committees on this theme .
the literature and arts committee joined forces .
and then a multitude of graffiti and murals with literary quotes from well-known indonesian writers were created in various places around the city .
behind it was the idea of how to take art and culture out of museums and bring it to the public ?
the graffiti and murals were supposed to become part of people 's daily life . " literature and art in public spaces ?
not locked up behind walls ?

despite an expected drop in exports , businesses say they are planning to hire . more good news for the german economy emerged on wednesday as the munich-based ifo research institute announced another increase in the german business confidence index .
ifo said its index rose by half a point from july to 106.7 points .
a poll by dow jones newswires had predicted a slight drop to 106 after last month 's record increase of 4.4 points .
" the german economy remains robust , " a statement quoted ifo president hans-werner sinn as saying .
the six-month outlook for manufacturing was " still very confident , though somewhat less so than in the previous month , " the statement said .
ifo releases the closely-watched german business confidence index monthly , and bases its score on a survey of 7,000 business executives in manufacturing , construction , wholesale and retail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sinn says the german economy is still in good shape recovery underway official german second-quarter economic figures released on tuesday increased optimism in the country , with the national statistical office confirming a 2.2 percent growth in gross domestic product - the country 's largest since reunification in 1990 .
german exports largely spurred the economic growth , as a weaker euro made selling easier and demand in the world 's emerging economies surged by 8.2 percent in the second quarter .
however analysts expect growth to taper off in coming months as the growth of exports slows down and countries begin to unravel economic stimulus programs intended to ease effects from the recession .

but for some german employees , it 's just another day at work . in recent years , a series of workplace spying scandals have come to light , several involving high-profile companies like the telecommunications firm deutsche telekom , the discount retailer lidl and the national railway operator deutsche bahn . " until now , it has not been regulated , in what capacity and under what conditions an employer can use video surveillance to collect information about his employees , " parliamentarian christian ahrendt of the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- told deutsche welle . in response to the scandals , the governing coalition has proposed a draft law on wednesday that would better regulate workplace privacy .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said the new law would be beneficial for both parties . " it 's a balanced compromise among the various interests and will foster more trust in the workplace between employer and employee , " de maiziere told reporters . no more secret cameras bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security cameras will still be allowed , but not hidden ones a central point of the proposal is that employers can no longer use video surveillance on workers without their knowledge . " there has to be a justifiable reason on the employer 's behalf .
and if video surveillance is going on , there has to be a sign informing people about it , " ahrendt told deutsche welle . retailers in germany have been known to use hidden cameras to catch employees they believe are stealing .
according to the new bill , video surveillance will be forbidden in private areas such as changing rooms , break rooms and bathrooms . however , employers will still be permitted to use cameras as anti-shoplifting measures in public areas , such as around the cash register or the entrance to a supermarket . critics of the bill say secret video surveillance is an important tool to protect against theft and corruption by employees .
the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- said the new bill prevents the fight against corruption and criminality in the workplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spying on employees via facebook will be forbidden ' friending ' the boss the law also protects employees ' online privacy on social networking sites such as facebook and myspace .
at a press conference in berlin , de maiziere emphasized employers would still be permitted to gather information about employees via publicly accessible sources , such as search engines . " what an employer ca n't do is befriend someone on a closed social network and then use the ' friend ' status to access private data and then use that information against the applicant , " de maiziere said . if the bill is passed into law , germany will become the first country to slap legal restrictions on the use of personal information in private social networking sites . the law still has to go before parliament for debate and a final vote .
but fdp politician ahrendt , who sits on the parliamentary judiciary committee , was optimistic that it would pass with a majority . until then , employees in germany will just have to be careful about who they add to their facebook friend lists . author : sarah harman editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after six years of study , eso published its findings that at least five confirmed exoplanets , or extrasolar planets , are orbiting a star only 127 light years away from earth . the five exoplanets all have approximately the mass of neptune - between 13 and 25 times the mass of earth - but orbit much closer to their star , with orbital periods between six and 600 days -lrb- neptune takes 164.79 years to orbit the sun -rrb- . in addition to the five neptune-sized planets , eso astronomers have " tantalizing " evidence of two more exoplanets in the system .

and it 's not that far away , galactically speaking . scientists at the european southern observatory , or eso , announced the discovery of the richest known extrasolar planetary system on tuesday .
after six years of study , eso published its findings that at least five confirmed exoplanets , or extrasolar planets , are orbiting a star only 127 light years away from earth . the five exoplanets all have approximately the mass of neptune - between 13 and 25 times the mass of earth - but orbit much closer to their star , with orbital periods between six and 600 days -lrb- neptune takes 164.79 years to orbit the sun -rrb- . in addition to the five neptune-sized planets , eso astronomers have " tantalizing " evidence of two more exoplanets in the system .
one is saturn-sized , with an orbital period of 2,200 days and the other is the smallest known exoplanet with merely 1.4 earth masses and an orbital period of only 1.18 days . the sun-like star , which is called hd 10180 , is located in the southern constellation hydrus , and has been studied closely since its discovery with the harps spectrograph in la silla , chile .
the existence of the exoplanets was discovered through gravitational wobbles in the behavior of the star caused by the passage of the planets . bildunterschrift : the newly discovered system is only 127 light years from earth familiar traits observed using data from this new discovery as well as data from other planetary systems , the researchers found evidence of the titius-bode law that exists in our solar system : the distances of the planets from their star seem to follow a regular pattern . " this could be a signature of the formation process of these planetary systems , " team member michel mayor said in the eso press release . eso astronomer christophe lovis also acknowledged that this discovery highlights the changes in the field of exoplanet research . " we are now entering a new era in exoplanet research : the study of complex planetary systems and not just of individual planets , " lovis said .
" studies of planetary motions in the new system reveal complex gravitational interactions between the planets and give us insights into the long-term evolution of the system .

last year , it was added to unesco 's world heritage list and for 2010 it has been named dance of the year . as the sound of bandoneons and violins emanates sensuously from the loudspeakers , a man puts his arm around his partner 's waist , pressing her against him .
from the hips up , the two are welded together like one body , while their legs artistically entangle and detangle themselves . it 's a scene that can be found in any number of dance schools across germany that offer the so-called milonga - the insiders ' term for a tango evening . from munich to hamburg , the tango scene has become so well organized that not having a partner is not an excuse not to join in .
networking services are available to help dancers find partners and travel agencies offer special holiday packages for tango fans . not as easy as it looks despite all the enthusiasm , going from the beginners ' class to being able to glide across the dance floor like a professional is quite a lot of work and takes more than a little talent . " the tango is one of the most difficult dances in the world , " norma raimondi said , a teacher at the don tango club in cologne .
" of course it depends on each person 's talent , but it generally takes a good three years to be able to dance spontaneously , without having to think about each step in advance . " " at the beginning i was just curious , but now it 's like a drug , i have to dance more and more , " said johanna , one of raimondi 's dance student 's , who preferred not to give her last name .
and a certain addiction is necessary to invest so much time into perfecting the dance . bildunterschrift : being comfortable with the steps can take years born out of trials prominent argentinean tango composer enrique santos discepolo -lrb- 1901-1951 -rrb- once said , " the tango is a sad thought that you can dance . "
indeed , that melancholy aspect is inseparably tied to the birthplace of the dance : buenos aires ' old port district , la boca . toward the end of the 19th century , this neighborhood became a gathering place for immigrants who had come to the city on the rio de la plata in search of a better life . tango blended the folklore and the instruments of the immigrants ' homelands to create a completely new sound that would become a symbol of their adopted home : buenos aires . " tango reflects all elements of life , " said 80-year-old luis stazo , a bandoneon player who performed for decades all over the globe with the legendary sexteto mayor .
" it tells how the man betrays the woman and the woman the man .
tango knows horse races , gambling - everything in life .
that 's why tango is much more than a dance . " stazo explained that tango was originally played only with guitar and flute .
later , the bandoneon was added .
the bandoneon - which looks somewhat like an accordion - was invented in the mid-19th century by heinrich band and was initially intended for religious and popular music . " we bandoneon players can thank germany , because the instrument that is so typical for tango and is so important to its soul was invented there , " said stazo . bildunterschrift : a hundred years ago , tango was deamed too sexy for high society frowned upon by the elite corazon , amor y sangre - heart , love and blood - was the immigrants ' motto and describes the soul of the dance .
in the beginning , the big-city argentinean elite rejected the " obscene " tango , which embodied the betrayal , loneliness and failures of the immigrant population . when the foreigners did n't find the riches they had hoped for , many became resigned , turning to gambling or prostitution .
it took many years before tango became socially acceptable . in 1904 , the police even warned against the dance , saying it promoted rivalry among people who , in the end , " always reached for the knife . "
in 1913 , pope st. pius x even condemned the dance . it was , however , too late ; tango had already caught hold .
the roaring twenties ushered in a comeback and in the 21st century it has experienced a revival . " i think that , with tango , many people are looking for a closeness to other people that we are missing in today 's society , " said daniel perusin , an argentinean tango teacher in cologne .
being able to embrace and be embraced is part of what makes tango so fascinating , he added . adjusting to gender roles getting to the point of being able to enjoy the embrace is the first hurdle . " it took me a while to get used to the fact that the man leads , " said dance student johanna .
" as an emancipated european woman , i often tend to want to take the reins . " perusin , on the other hand , said that german men tend to be passive and hesitant and have to learn to take the lead : " they probably think that if they take the active role the women will get upset .

from the hips up , the two are welded together like one body , while their legs artistically entangle and detangle themselves . it 's a scene that can be found in any number of dance schools across germany that offer the so-called milonga - the insiders ' term for a tango evening . from munich to hamburg , the tango scene has become so well organized that not having a partner is not an excuse not to join in .
networking services are available to help dancers find partners and travel agencies offer special holiday packages for tango fans . not as easy as it looks despite all the enthusiasm , going from the beginners ' class to being able to glide across the dance floor like a professional is quite a lot of work and takes more than a little talent . " the tango is one of the most difficult dances in the world , " norma raimondi said , a teacher at the don tango club in cologne .
" of course it depends on each person 's talent , but it generally takes a good three years to be able to dance spontaneously , without having to think about each step in advance . " " at the beginning i was just curious , but now it 's like a drug , i have to dance more and more , " said johanna , one of raimondi 's dance student 's , who preferred not to give her last name .
and a certain addiction is necessary to invest so much time into perfecting the dance . bildunterschrift : being comfortable with the steps can take years born out of trials prominent argentinean tango composer enrique santos discepolo -lrb- 1901-1951 -rrb- once said , " the tango is a sad thought that you can dance . "
indeed , that melancholy aspect is inseparably tied to the birthplace of the dance : buenos aires ' old port district , la boca . toward the end of the 19th century , this neighborhood became a gathering place for immigrants who had come to the city on the rio de la plata in search of a better life . tango blended the folklore and the instruments of the immigrants ' homelands to create a completely new sound that would become a symbol of their adopted home : buenos aires . " tango reflects all elements of life , " said 80-year-old luis stazo , a bandoneon player who performed for decades all over the globe with the legendary sexteto mayor .
" it tells how the man betrays the woman and the woman the man .
tango knows horse races , gambling - everything in life .
that 's why tango is much more than a dance . " stazo explained that tango was originally played only with guitar and flute .
later , the bandoneon was added .
the bandoneon - which looks somewhat like an accordion - was invented in the mid-19th century by heinrich band and was initially intended for religious and popular music . " we bandoneon players can thank germany , because the instrument that is so typical for tango and is so important to its soul was invented there , " said stazo . bildunterschrift : a hundred years ago , tango was deamed too sexy for high society frowned upon by the elite corazon , amor y sangre - heart , love and blood - was the immigrants ' motto and describes the soul of the dance .
in the beginning , the big-city argentinean elite rejected the " obscene " tango , which embodied the betrayal , loneliness and failures of the immigrant population . when the foreigners did n't find the riches they had hoped for , many became resigned , turning to gambling or prostitution .
it took many years before tango became socially acceptable . in 1904 , the police even warned against the dance , saying it promoted rivalry among people who , in the end , " always reached for the knife . "
in 1913 , pope st. pius x even condemned the dance . it was , however , too late ; tango had already caught hold .
the roaring twenties ushered in a comeback and in the 21st century it has experienced a revival . " i think that , with tango , many people are looking for a closeness to other people that we are missing in today 's society , " said daniel perusin , an argentinean tango teacher in cologne .
being able to embrace and be embraced is part of what makes tango so fascinating , he added . adjusting to gender roles getting to the point of being able to enjoy the embrace is the first hurdle . " it took me a while to get used to the fact that the man leads , " said dance student johanna .
" as an emancipated european woman , i often tend to want to take the reins . " perusin , on the other hand , said that german men tend to be passive and hesitant and have to learn to take the lead : " they probably think that if they take the active role the women will get upset . " nevertheless , whatever may be holding germans back from expressing themselves fully in this type of dance is still not stopping many of them from giving it a try . author : suzanne cords -lrb- ew / kjb -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with handheld devices , the organization is able to get more accurate data and transmit it wirelessly back to headquarters . the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- in burundi is using handheld personal digital assistants , or pdas , to help keep tabs on the country 's food situation .
the technology has helped speed up the process of data collection and improve the accuracy of the organization 's food security surveys .
staff members organize fact-finding missions to gauge the country 's food supply .
when wfp arrived in burundi in 1968 , the organization was using pen and paper to conduct their food surveys .
now , wfp uses small palmtop computers , only slightly larger than normal cell phones and light enough to carry .
the devices have held up against the strong burundian heat and can last for days before needing a recharge .
" so you have the speed of gathering data , which means you can expand your survey area , and that makes it more valid by interviewing more people , " marc neilson said , a public information officer for wfp burundi .
the organization provides food assistance to more than 600,000 " food-insecure " burundians and some 90 million people around the world every year .
wfp plans to provide about 3.7 million tons of food in 73 countries to those unable to produce or obtain enough food for themselves and their families .

" it 's very interesting to use the device because it 's a lot faster , " he said .
" it used to take us about an hour-and-a-half to complete the entire interview with paper , and now it takes only half-an-hour . "
since he started using the device in march , bisman has eliminated prep time , paper shuffling and the need to decipher sloppy hand writing , which has reduced the margin of error .
the wfp staffer said residents also appreciate the technology , noting that survey-takers used to get " very , very tired " back when the questionnaire was conducted by hand .
bihogo resident elisabeth tembaidai had never been interviewed by wfp before .
the 56-year-old primary school teacher said it is the first time she has seen a pda - and the device shows the country is making progress .
a few years ago , tembaidai received food aid from wfp during a drought .
she said she hopes wfp will provide her with food this year , too .
" well , we will probably need some help in regards to food this year because the water that used to come from up north does n't come anymore , " she said .
" it 's the dry season also , and we are short of food at the moment , and we are asking wfp for some food now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pdas allow wfp to transmit data wirelessly high-speed , wireless transmission information is currently collected on a memory card and sent to the main wfp office in bujumbura , but soon wfp field staff will be able to transmit their findings wirelessly .
burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world , with annual per capita income averaging about $ 300 , or 236 euros .
in 2006 , the country emerged from a 13-year civil war ; one rebel group laid down its arms just last year .
now , however , the country has a new high-speed 3g wireless network .
by sending data wirelessly to the central database for analysis , wfp staff can provide up-to-date information from around the country , helping streamline planning on food shipments . the pda 's price tag is about $ 200 , or 158 euros - and providing two devices in each of burundi 's 15 provinces costs about $ 6,000 , or 4728 euros , not including training costs .
but neilson said the devices are a good investment : " any time you can save doing that , it means those most at risk - the poor - are getting the assistance faster and more effectively , and you 're not perhaps going in an area where you really should n't be , " he said .
" wfp needs to be in the areas that are most at risk .
that 's the bottom line . "
bildunterschrift : scratch card ' e-vouchers ' allow beneficiaries more options to receive food aid scratch card ' e-vouchers ' wfp has put the pdas to use elsewhere in africa , including the congo and mozambique .
in zambia , wfp distributes " e-voucher " scratch cards to improve the food voucher program .
instead of lining up for food aid , people can now choose when and where to pick up their monthly assistance .
the scratch card codes are entered into a mobile phone upon delivery of the food .
wfp said the program reduces transaction costs and increases the " efficiency and effectiveness " of food distribution .

with handheld devices , the organization is able to get more accurate data and transmit it wirelessly back to headquarters . the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- in burundi is using handheld personal digital assistants , or pdas , to help keep tabs on the country 's food situation .
the technology has helped speed up the process of data collection and improve the accuracy of the organization 's food security surveys .
staff members organize fact-finding missions to gauge the country 's food supply .
when wfp arrived in burundi in 1968 , the organization was using pen and paper to conduct their food surveys .
now , wfp uses small palmtop computers , only slightly larger than normal cell phones and light enough to carry .
the devices have held up against the strong burundian heat and can last for days before needing a recharge .
" so you have the speed of gathering data , which means you can expand your survey area , and that makes it more valid by interviewing more people , " marc neilson said , a public information officer for wfp burundi .
the organization provides food assistance to more than 600,000 " food-insecure " burundians and some 90 million people around the world every year .
wfp plans to provide about 3.7 million tons of food in 73 countries to those unable to produce or obtain enough food for themselves and their families .
bildunterschrift : wfp provides food assistance to about 90 million people worldwide a welcome development in bihogo village in northern burundi , wfp program assistant gerard bisman uses his pda to conduct a 20-question survey with local residents about their food needs and living standards .
" it 's very interesting to use the device because it 's a lot faster , " he said .
" it used to take us about an hour-and-a-half to complete the entire interview with paper , and now it takes only half-an-hour . "
since he started using the device in march , bisman has eliminated prep time , paper shuffling and the need to decipher sloppy hand writing , which has reduced the margin of error .
the wfp staffer said residents also appreciate the technology , noting that survey-takers used to get " very , very tired " back when the questionnaire was conducted by hand .
bihogo resident elisabeth tembaidai had never been interviewed by wfp before .
the 56-year-old primary school teacher said it is the first time she has seen a pda - and the device shows the country is making progress .
a few years ago , tembaidai received food aid from wfp during a drought .
she said she hopes wfp will provide her with food this year , too .
" well , we will probably need some help in regards to food this year because the water that used to come from up north does n't come anymore , " she said .
" it 's the dry season also , and we are short of food at the moment , and we are asking wfp for some food now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pdas allow wfp to transmit data wirelessly high-speed , wireless transmission information is currently collected on a memory card and sent to the main wfp office in bujumbura , but soon wfp field staff will be able to transmit their findings wirelessly .
burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world , with annual per capita income averaging about $ 300 , or 236 euros .
in 2006 , the country emerged from a 13-year civil war ; one rebel group laid down its arms just last year .
now , however , the country has a new high-speed 3g wireless network .
by sending data wirelessly to the central database for analysis , wfp staff can provide up-to-date information from around the country , helping streamline planning on food shipments . the pda 's price tag is about $ 200 , or 158 euros - and providing two devices in each of burundi 's 15 provinces costs about $ 6,000 , or 4728 euros , not including training costs .
but neilson said the devices are a good investment : " any time you can save doing that , it means those most at risk - the poor - are getting the assistance faster and more effectively , and you 're not perhaps going in an area where you really should n't be , " he said .
" wfp needs to be in the areas that are most at risk .
that 's the bottom line . "
bildunterschrift : scratch card ' e-vouchers ' allow beneficiaries more options to receive food aid scratch card ' e-vouchers ' wfp has put the pdas to use elsewhere in africa , including the congo and mozambique .
in zambia , wfp distributes " e-voucher " scratch cards to improve the food voucher program .
instead of lining up for food aid , people can now choose when and where to pick up their monthly assistance .
the scratch card codes are entered into a mobile phone upon delivery of the food .
wfp said the program reduces transaction costs and increases the " efficiency and effectiveness " of food distribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wfp 's scratch card program reduces the transaction costs of food distribution in syria , 130,000 iraqi refugees receiving food aid are able to get the wfp 's " virtual vouchers " via text message .
the electronic vouchers can be exchanged for items not normally included in conventional aid baskets , such as rice , wheat flour , lentils , chickpeas , oil and canned fish , as well as cheese and eggs .
other organizations are also taking advantage of the new technologies in the field .
in the west african countries of togo and niger , the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- has worked with pdas equipped with gps capabilities to help prevent malaria .
a team of scientists used the electronic devices to collect high-quality data on the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets . in the asia-pacific region , un children 's fund staff use pda questionnaires to provide rapid assessments in emergency situations .

the draft bill hopes to stabilize the banking system by charging higher fees for banks who engage in riskier behavior .
the law could bring in more than 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- per year , which would go into a fund to help bail out banks in the case of another financial crisis .
france and britain have collaborated on similar laws with merkel , who brought the idea up to other global leaders at a group of 8 summit in canada in june but failed to gather broad support .
multi-front opposition the law has gained criticism from several fronts , including economic analysts , who have said the fee must be adopted on a global level to truly stabilize the world financial system .
savings and loan institutions have also opposed the bill , claiming that the most recent crisis has already punished banks , and that they have since modified their own policies to protect against crises .
and opposition parties have also attacked the draft law , saying it is too low and that banks would pass on the costs to consumers .
but german private banks - including the nation 's largest , deutsche bank - have supported the law , saying it would shore up bankruptcy proceedings for the german banking sector .

the former student activist deals with the megacity 's contradictions in her texts .
the writer says jakarta is not friendly to those who have little . " oh darn it , i scratched too deep .
crazy … this wall is crumbly .
look !
here !
under this layer of colour .
this is it .
this is the layer of that mural with the literature quote , " ayu utami explains jubilantly . we are standing on a sidewalk facing a wall at cikini railway station - a small station in the middle of the city .
trains swelling over with commuters from jakarta 's suburbs stop here . under the layer of paint that ayu utami has scratched away , a poem has been written in black against a yellow background .
the poem is titled " ktp , " the abbreviation for identity card in indonesia . " ktp " was written by goenawan mohammad , a poet , writer , thinker , and one of indonesia 's best known cultural critics , with whom ayu utami worked a great deal . bildunterschrift : the indonesian poet goenawan mohammad is very interested in identity the poem speaks of the multiple identities of jakarta 's inhabitants .
each year , at least 300,000 more people arrive in the city , from all over indonesia .
but the city does not change them very much .
nor do they change the city .
most come here to work and do not bring their traditions with them .
so jakarta , this city where languages and cultures live side by side , never really becomes their home . twenty languages spoken we go back to the car , where our driver is speaking in javanese to his wife on his mobile phone .
in jakarta , at least 20 languages are spoken .
like the driver , ayu utami was not born in the capital but came as a child .
her family hails from bogor , where people speak mostly sundanese . she wrote her first novel " saman " in the national language bahasa indonesia .
it quickly became a bestseller in this modern babylon and was then translated into many other languages . ayu utami tries her hand at reading aloud : " he looked at me .
then deep into my eyes , before sitting down next to rosano .
it was actually a very brief contact .
as if he were shy , but at the same time proud , manly … he looked at my tray and said ' you do n't eat much . '
sihar situmorang .
he smiled .
sihar mostly spoke in the jakarta dialect .
occasionally a batak expression came through , usually when he got excited .
to her ears , it sounded warm and comfortable … " bringing literature to public spaces " saman " tells the story of a catholic priest who sides with the poor .
he then falls in love and gives up his priesthood .
it is also the story of a group of women , who break out of their traditional roles .
published in 1988 , it was named best novel by the jakarta arts council . ayu utami is now a member of jakarta arts council and tells me about the projects .
" last year , we focused on the subject of cities .
many groups worked with our committees on this theme .
the literature and arts committee joined forces .
and then a multitude of graffiti and murals with literary quotes from well-known indonesian writers were created in various places around the city .
behind it was the idea of how to take art and culture out of museums and bring it to the public ?
the graffiti and murals were supposed to become part of people 's daily life . " literature and art in public spaces ?
not locked up behind walls ?
is this ayu utami ’ s comment on the politics of this megacity ? bildunterschrift : ayu utami insists on writing about the problems of indonesia she replies that politics in jakarta are more and more for the rich .
many laws criminalize the poor , and then they are thrown in jail .
political issues are a natural part of her stories and articles . " i ca n't just separate my writing with problems faced by the people , the problems of indonesia .
i can not write in an ivory tower . " ' like a huge river , with no beginning or end ' now jakarta is full of graffiti , protest drawings and some of the literary murals have not been painted over , yet .
the dynamism of these changes tells stories about what is on people 's minds . 15 minutes away by car , there is another mural with jakarta 's skyline under a bright blue sky .
there is a young man sporting a crimson shirt in the picture .
he is wearing sunglasses and looking at a piece of paper .
on it is a poem by sitor situmorang , called " jabotabek , " which talks about the semanggi bridge , jakarta 's first modern bridge . " semanggi , from here , from this clover-leaf shaped concrete bridge ; i look at this large city , and at the traffic today , which flows underneath this bridge , like a huge river , with no beginning , nor an end .

and it 's not that far away , galactically speaking . scientists at the european southern observatory , or eso , announced the discovery of the richest known extrasolar planetary system on tuesday .
after six years of study , eso published its findings that at least five confirmed exoplanets , or extrasolar planets , are orbiting a star only 127 light years away from earth . the five exoplanets all have approximately the mass of neptune - between 13 and 25 times the mass of earth - but orbit much closer to their star , with orbital periods between six and 600 days -lrb- neptune takes 164.79 years to orbit the sun -rrb- . in addition to the five neptune-sized planets , eso astronomers have " tantalizing " evidence of two more exoplanets in the system .
one is saturn-sized , with an orbital period of 2,200 days and the other is the smallest known exoplanet with merely 1.4 earth masses and an orbital period of only 1.18 days . the sun-like star , which is called hd 10180 , is located in the southern constellation hydrus , and has been studied closely since its discovery with the harps spectrograph in la silla , chile .
the existence of the exoplanets was discovered through gravitational wobbles in the behavior of the star caused by the passage of the planets . bildunterschrift : the newly discovered system is only 127 light years from earth familiar traits observed using data from this new discovery as well as data from other planetary systems , the researchers found evidence of the titius-bode law that exists in our solar system : the distances of the planets from their star seem to follow a regular pattern . " this could be a signature of the formation process of these planetary systems , " team member michel mayor said in the eso press release . eso astronomer christophe lovis also acknowledged that this discovery highlights the changes in the field of exoplanet research . " we are now entering a new era in exoplanet research : the study of complex planetary systems and not just of individual planets , " lovis said .
" studies of planetary motions in the new system reveal complex gravitational interactions between the planets and give us insights into the long-term evolution of the system . " through further study of the system around hd 10180 , eso astronomers hope to learn more about planetary formation and about how the solar system was developed , as well as what its future may look like . author : stuart tiffen -lrb- ap / afp -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany would become the first country to forbid facebook content to be used for hiring purposes . undercover spies and hidden video cameras - it sounds like the stuff of a james bond movie .
but for some german employees , it 's just another day at work . in recent years , a series of workplace spying scandals have come to light , several involving high-profile companies like the telecommunications firm deutsche telekom , the discount retailer lidl and the national railway operator deutsche bahn . " until now , it has not been regulated , in what capacity and under what conditions an employer can use video surveillance to collect information about his employees , " parliamentarian christian ahrendt of the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- told deutsche welle . in response to the scandals , the governing coalition has proposed a draft law on wednesday that would better regulate workplace privacy .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said the new law would be beneficial for both parties . " it 's a balanced compromise among the various interests and will foster more trust in the workplace between employer and employee , " de maiziere told reporters . no more secret cameras bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security cameras will still be allowed , but not hidden ones a central point of the proposal is that employers can no longer use video surveillance on workers without their knowledge . " there has to be a justifiable reason on the employer 's behalf .
and if video surveillance is going on , there has to be a sign informing people about it , " ahrendt told deutsche welle . retailers in germany have been known to use hidden cameras to catch employees they believe are stealing .
according to the new bill , video surveillance will be forbidden in private areas such as changing rooms , break rooms and bathrooms . however , employers will still be permitted to use cameras as anti-shoplifting measures in public areas , such as around the cash register or the entrance to a supermarket . critics of the bill say secret video surveillance is an important tool to protect against theft and corruption by employees .
the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- said the new bill prevents the fight against corruption and criminality in the workplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spying on employees via facebook will be forbidden ' friending ' the boss the law also protects employees ' online privacy on social networking sites such as facebook and myspace .
at a press conference in berlin , de maiziere emphasized employers would still be permitted to gather information about employees via publicly accessible sources , such as search engines . " what an employer ca n't do is befriend someone on a closed social network and then use the ' friend ' status to access private data and then use that information against the applicant , " de maiziere said . if the bill is passed into law , germany will become the first country to slap legal restrictions on the use of personal information in private social networking sites . the law still has to go before parliament for debate and a final vote .
but fdp politician ahrendt , who sits on the parliamentary judiciary committee , was optimistic that it would pass with a majority . until then , employees in germany will just have to be careful about who they add to their facebook friend lists . author : sarah harman editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

third infant death heats debate about hygiene in german hospitals i have lived in germany for 15 years and during that time my family and i have been to a number of german hospitals , clinics and doctors for everything from back surgery to tonsil surgery , child birth , emergency room enrollments and the flu .
the care has been outstanding and the medical staffs have been top notch .
my biggest observation concerns hygiene .
i have had my blood taken by nurses who did not wear gloves .
i have seen doctors remove bandages with their bare hands .
this is not always the rule , but it has happened enough to make me acknowledge the systemic nature of this oversight .
outside of this , i have never had a major concern that any facility does not meet or exceed standards in the us -lrb- my only comparative standard -rrb- .
i would definitely agree , however , that all medical facilities , wherever they may be , should ratchet up any-and-all policies put in place to avoid a recurrence of the mainz tragedy . - scott , us i spent three months in germany late last year and my girlfriend at the time was a registered nurse .
i visited the hospital where she worked on numerous occasions and from an outsider 's point of view there were numerous signs informing everyone how important it was to maintain a clean and sterile working environment .
i noted how much cleaner the hospital was compared to those back in australia . - paul , australia wow , that 's sad .
i 'm glad germany is taking lax standards seriously though .
i think other countries should as well .
doctors get paid very well ; the least they can do is obey the hygiene standards that would make a computer chip manufacturer laugh .
medicine does n't have the highest hygiene standards , electronics does . - fergal via facebook it was long ago , but i went in with measles as an adult and was there for two weeks .
it was different from my experiences in the us and japan , but i was well treated , pampered by the orderlies -lrb- who pitied my bad vacation luck -rrb- , and left with ... a bill that was only a minor fraction of what it would have been in the us .
my only complaint was the bells from the church across the street from my room .
they were so … odd - a rather avant garde sound to them that was not particularly pleasant . - rickford via facebook two babies dead , five critical from bacteria at german hospital apparently , they did the test after giving the infusion to the babies .
daily lab tests should have been done before using the equipment .
how can such a simple requirement be missed ?
it is also an unlucky situation that the babies were already in intensive care with weaker immune systems than that of a healthy baby .
i send my deepest sympathy to the parents of unlucky babies . - nevres , turkey compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of the key issues is the country 's fledgling economic recovery .
but the party that is leading in the opinion polls wants to forge closer ties with russia . latvia is slowly emerging from recession with the help of money from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the european union .
the economic recovery is likely to play a central role in the parliamentary elections in october .

october 2nd is decision time come election day , latvians will choose between 10 parties , or alliances , running for the 100-seat parliament , or saeima .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the latvian economy is recovering with help from the imf and the eu recent opinion polls show that the pro-kremlin " harmony centre " bloc is currently the most popular party .
it was formed in april this year , and polls indicate that around 20 percent of people intend to vote for it .
nellija locmele is the editor of the weekly news and current affairs magazine " ir . "
she is alarmed at the prospect of " harmony centre " winning the most seats in parliament : " harmony centre is … not a stable party , " locmele said .
" it 's new and has n't proved itself over the years , so we are not able to assess its policies and ideology in practice . "
locmele is concerned that there are politicians with very differing views on how to boost the economy within the party .
the country is at a crossroads latvia is at a crossroads in terms of its further economic and political development .
in order to keep the economic recovery on track , locmele feels the country needs to stick to its structural reforms .
but " harmony centre " wants latvia to have closer economic and political ties with russia .
political scientist janis ikstens says this is part of an increasing trend in latvia , but he warns that this could be dangerous : " what is striking is that this discourse has barely changed after one of the leaders of " harmony centre " openly threatened to stage bloodshed à la bishkek in riga if his political platform is not fulfilled .
this is i think absolutely unacceptable in a democratic society . "
current government is struggling despite the fact that the present government managed to halt the economic recession under prime minister valdia dombrovskis , his pro-western alliance " unity " is falling behind in the polls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 25.08.2010 neurological cause found for the baby blues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postpartum depression affects 15 percent of new mothers the baby blues affects up to three-quarters of new mothers .
new research shows that there 's a physiological cause that could be treated with dietary supplements . after the relative calm of pregnancy , giving birth is a physically and emotionally draining experience .
but the changes do n't stop there .
a woman 's estrogen levels drop significantly , and she now has to care for a crying baby 24 hours a day .
given these circumstances it 's no wonder that up to 75 percent of new mothers around the world feel down for a few days after giving birth .
but new research has found there 's an additional neurological cause to the baby blues as well .
feelings of impotence anne-christin b. , who prefered not to use her last name due to the stigma of postpartum depression , is a 33-year-old mother from berlin .
for the first day or two after her daughter was born four months ago , she felt happy , but that quickly changed .
" then came the feeling that i could n't do things .
i was afraid .
i could n't do things for the child - for whatever reason , " she remembered .
" and then i started to withdraw , i could n't go out or talk with friends on the telephone and this increased very quickly to the point where i could n't be by myself anymore . "
anne-christin is n't the only one .
millions of german women also experience the baby blues .
in her case , she was one of 15 percent of women who develop postpartum depression .
she went to her local doctor , but he did n't take her seriously , so she sought professional psychiatric help .
the source of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decreased serotonin levels are believed to be a culprit of postpartum depression dr. julia sacher , from the max planck institute for human cognitive and brain sciences in leipzig , said it 's well-documented that a sharp drop in estrogen levels and a big change in environment contribute to the baby blues .
that 's why research in this area is incredibly important .
" what we do know is that those women who have severe symptoms of postpartum blues have a higher risk of experiencing a full-blown episode later on , " sacher said .
sacher and her colleagues published the results of their study in the peer-reviewed journal , archives of general psychiatry , earlier this summer .
they found that there is a neurological cause for the baby blues .
" we see an increase in monoamine oxidase a and this can lead to a loss of serotonin , and a loss of serotonin has been associated with low mood , " sacher explained .
feeling sad after childbirth is socially unacceptable other medical professionals , like dr. stephanie krueger , said that this new study may prompt obstetricians to keep an eye on a mother 's moods both before and after childbirth .
krueger is a professor of psychiatry at the charite in berlin , one of the largest university hospitals in europe .
she treated anne-christin for post-partum depression . krueger - who was n't part of the study - said most women who feel depressed after their child is born do n't seek necessary help , because it 's not socially acceptable to feel sad at this time .
" in our culture , women who have just given birth are supposed to be happy , and if they are not , then there 's something wrong with them and they are actually treated as some kind of an outlaw , " krueger said , adding , " in many cases they are being told : why are n't you happy ? "
krueger believes there needs to be more education and support for new mothers .
" families and gps -lsb- general practitioner -rsb- should not take these things lightly and not say , ' well yeah i understand you 've just given birth - everything will be fine ' , " krueger said .
" physicians and families should take any symptoms of depression seriously and go to someone who knows what they are doing , meaning a psychiatrist , for example . "
berlin mother anne-christin b. said she wished her doctors and other medical professionals had talked to her about the baby blues during the pregnancy .
" it would have been better if , even in a midwifery course , there was perhaps 30 minutes or an hour discussion in preparation for pregnancy , where it was explained , where you explain the symptoms and also tell people where they can call for help , " anne-christin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the dramatic life changes brought by babies contribute to depression dietary supplements could help while the baby blues usually goes away by itself after a couple of days , dr. sacher from the max planck institute said treating this temporary condition could be an important step in preventing postpartum depression .
she thinks the baby blues could be treated with medication or dietary supplements , which could counter the increase in the enzyme monoamine oxidase a. but not everyone agrees the baby blues can be prevented so easily .
lisa fehrenbach has been a midwife for 35 years .
she said feeling a bit down after childbirth is a natural thing because childbirth is a physically and emotionally life-changing experience .
many women go from working full-time to being at home with a crying baby - often by themselves .
" you had a completely independent life and you organized everything and you had everything under control and suddenly there 's a little baby , " said fehrenbach , " it clings to your body 24 hours and you have to care for it 24 hours and you can not do what you want , but you have to do what the baby wants . "
fehrenbach said even if women took dietary supplements to counter the enzyme increase , they still have to adjust to this new baby in their lives .
beyond making pregnant women aware of the physiological and psychological changes in their bodies , both sacher and krueger agree this problem needs to be discussed openly in order to fight the stigma of postpartum blues and depression .
" postpartum disorders are nothing the woman is responsible for .
they ca n't help it , " krueger said .
" it has biological reasons for the most part and it can be treated effectively and it should be treated effectively . "
sacher 's next step will be to test for the elevated enzyme in postpartum depression .

but the changes do n't stop there .
a woman 's estrogen levels drop significantly , and she now has to care for a crying baby 24 hours a day .
given these circumstances it 's no wonder that up to 75 percent of new mothers around the world feel down for a few days after giving birth .
but new research has found there 's an additional neurological cause to the baby blues as well .
feelings of impotence anne-christin b. , who prefered not to use her last name due to the stigma of postpartum depression , is a 33-year-old mother from berlin .
for the first day or two after her daughter was born four months ago , she felt happy , but that quickly changed .
" then came the feeling that i could n't do things .
i was afraid .
i could n't do things for the child - for whatever reason , " she remembered .
" and then i started to withdraw , i could n't go out or talk with friends on the telephone and this increased very quickly to the point where i could n't be by myself anymore . "
anne-christin is n't the only one .
millions of german women also experience the baby blues .
in her case , she was one of 15 percent of women who develop postpartum depression .
she went to her local doctor , but he did n't take her seriously , so she sought professional psychiatric help .
the source of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decreased serotonin levels are believed to be a culprit of postpartum depression dr. julia sacher , from the max planck institute for human cognitive and brain sciences in leipzig , said it 's well-documented that a sharp drop in estrogen levels and a big change in environment contribute to the baby blues .
that 's why research in this area is incredibly important .
" what we do know is that those women who have severe symptoms of postpartum blues have a higher risk of experiencing a full-blown episode later on , " sacher said .
sacher and her colleagues published the results of their study in the peer-reviewed journal , archives of general psychiatry , earlier this summer .
they found that there is a neurological cause for the baby blues .
" we see an increase in monoamine oxidase a and this can lead to a loss of serotonin , and a loss of serotonin has been associated with low mood , " sacher explained .
feeling sad after childbirth is socially unacceptable other medical professionals , like dr. stephanie krueger , said that this new study may prompt obstetricians to keep an eye on a mother 's moods both before and after childbirth .
krueger is a professor of psychiatry at the charite in berlin , one of the largest university hospitals in europe .
she treated anne-christin for post-partum depression . krueger - who was n't part of the study - said most women who feel depressed after their child is born do n't seek necessary help , because it 's not socially acceptable to feel sad at this time .
" in our culture , women who have just given birth are supposed to be happy , and if they are not , then there 's something wrong with them and they are actually treated as some kind of an outlaw , " krueger said , adding , " in many cases they are being told : why are n't you happy ? "
krueger believes there needs to be more education and support for new mothers .
" families and gps -lsb- general practitioner -rsb- should not take these things lightly and not say , ' well yeah i understand you 've just given birth - everything will be fine ' , " krueger said .
" physicians and families should take any symptoms of depression seriously and go to someone who knows what they are doing , meaning a psychiatrist , for example . "
berlin mother anne-christin b. said she wished her doctors and other medical professionals had talked to her about the baby blues during the pregnancy .
" it would have been better if , even in a midwifery course , there was perhaps 30 minutes or an hour discussion in preparation for pregnancy , where it was explained , where you explain the symptoms and also tell people where they can call for help , " anne-christin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the dramatic life changes brought by babies contribute to depression dietary supplements could help while the baby blues usually goes away by itself after a couple of days , dr. sacher from the max planck institute said treating this temporary condition could be an important step in preventing postpartum depression .
she thinks the baby blues could be treated with medication or dietary supplements , which could counter the increase in the enzyme monoamine oxidase a. but not everyone agrees the baby blues can be prevented so easily .
lisa fehrenbach has been a midwife for 35 years .
she said feeling a bit down after childbirth is a natural thing because childbirth is a physically and emotionally life-changing experience .
many women go from working full-time to being at home with a crying baby - often by themselves .
" you had a completely independent life and you organized everything and you had everything under control and suddenly there 's a little baby , " said fehrenbach , " it clings to your body 24 hours and you have to care for it 24 hours and you can not do what you want , but you have to do what the baby wants . "
fehrenbach said even if women took dietary supplements to counter the enzyme increase , they still have to adjust to this new baby in their lives .
beyond making pregnant women aware of the physiological and psychological changes in their bodies , both sacher and krueger agree this problem needs to be discussed openly in order to fight the stigma of postpartum blues and depression .
" postpartum disorders are nothing the woman is responsible for .
they ca n't help it , " krueger said .
" it has biological reasons for the most part and it can be treated effectively and it should be treated effectively . "
sacher 's next step will be to test for the elevated enzyme in postpartum depression .

she said feeling a bit down after childbirth is a natural thing because childbirth is a physically and emotionally life-changing experience .
many women go from working full-time to being at home with a crying baby - often by themselves .
" you had a completely independent life and you organized everything and you had everything under control and suddenly there 's a little baby , " said fehrenbach , " it clings to your body 24 hours and you have to care for it 24 hours and you can not do what you want , but you have to do what the baby wants . "
fehrenbach said even if women took dietary supplements to counter the enzyme increase , they still have to adjust to this new baby in their lives .
beyond making pregnant women aware of the physiological and psychological changes in their bodies , both sacher and krueger agree this problem needs to be discussed openly in order to fight the stigma of postpartum blues and depression .
" postpartum disorders are nothing the woman is responsible for .
they ca n't help it , " krueger said .
" it has biological reasons for the most part and it can be treated effectively and it should be treated effectively . "
sacher 's next step will be to test for the elevated enzyme in postpartum depression .

new research shows that there 's a physiological cause that could be treated with dietary supplements . after the relative calm of pregnancy , giving birth is a physically and emotionally draining experience .
but the changes do n't stop there .
a woman 's estrogen levels drop significantly , and she now has to care for a crying baby 24 hours a day .
given these circumstances it 's no wonder that up to 75 percent of new mothers around the world feel down for a few days after giving birth .
but new research has found there 's an additional neurological cause to the baby blues as well .
feelings of impotence anne-christin b. , who prefered not to use her last name due to the stigma of postpartum depression , is a 33-year-old mother from berlin .
for the first day or two after her daughter was born four months ago , she felt happy , but that quickly changed .
" then came the feeling that i could n't do things .
i was afraid .
i could n't do things for the child - for whatever reason , " she remembered .
" and then i started to withdraw , i could n't go out or talk with friends on the telephone and this increased very quickly to the point where i could n't be by myself anymore . "
anne-christin is n't the only one .
millions of german women also experience the baby blues .
in her case , she was one of 15 percent of women who develop postpartum depression .
she went to her local doctor , but he did n't take her seriously , so she sought professional psychiatric help .
the source of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decreased serotonin levels are believed to be a culprit of postpartum depression dr. julia sacher , from the max planck institute for human cognitive and brain sciences in leipzig , said it 's well-documented that a sharp drop in estrogen levels and a big change in environment contribute to the baby blues .
that 's why research in this area is incredibly important .
" what we do know is that those women who have severe symptoms of postpartum blues have a higher risk of experiencing a full-blown episode later on , " sacher said .
sacher and her colleagues published the results of their study in the peer-reviewed journal , archives of general psychiatry , earlier this summer .
they found that there is a neurological cause for the baby blues .
" we see an increase in monoamine oxidase a and this can lead to a loss of serotonin , and a loss of serotonin has been associated with low mood , " sacher explained .
feeling sad after childbirth is socially unacceptable other medical professionals , like dr. stephanie krueger , said that this new study may prompt obstetricians to keep an eye on a mother 's moods both before and after childbirth .
krueger is a professor of psychiatry at the charite in berlin , one of the largest university hospitals in europe .
she treated anne-christin for post-partum depression . krueger - who was n't part of the study - said most women who feel depressed after their child is born do n't seek necessary help , because it 's not socially acceptable to feel sad at this time .
" in our culture , women who have just given birth are supposed to be happy , and if they are not , then there 's something wrong with them and they are actually treated as some kind of an outlaw , " krueger said , adding , " in many cases they are being told : why are n't you happy ? "
krueger believes there needs to be more education and support for new mothers .
" families and gps -lsb- general practitioner -rsb- should not take these things lightly and not say , ' well yeah i understand you 've just given birth - everything will be fine ' , " krueger said .
" physicians and families should take any symptoms of depression seriously and go to someone who knows what they are doing , meaning a psychiatrist , for example . "
berlin mother anne-christin b. said she wished her doctors and other medical professionals had talked to her about the baby blues during the pregnancy .
" it would have been better if , even in a midwifery course , there was perhaps 30 minutes or an hour discussion in preparation for pregnancy , where it was explained , where you explain the symptoms and also tell people where they can call for help , " anne-christin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the dramatic life changes brought by babies contribute to depression dietary supplements could help while the baby blues usually goes away by itself after a couple of days , dr. sacher from the max planck institute said treating this temporary condition could be an important step in preventing postpartum depression .
she thinks the baby blues could be treated with medication or dietary supplements , which could counter the increase in the enzyme monoamine oxidase a. but not everyone agrees the baby blues can be prevented so easily .

the former student activist deals with the megacity 's contradictions in her texts .
the writer says jakarta is not friendly to those who have little . " oh darn it , i scratched too deep .
crazy … this wall is crumbly .
look !
here !
under this layer of colour .
this is it .
this is the layer of that mural with the literature quote , " ayu utami explains jubilantly . we are standing on a sidewalk facing a wall at cikini railway station - a small station in the middle of the city .
trains swelling over with commuters from jakarta 's suburbs stop here . under the layer of paint that ayu utami has scratched away , a poem has been written in black against a yellow background .
the poem is titled " ktp , " the abbreviation for identity card in indonesia . " ktp " was written by goenawan mohammad , a poet , writer , thinker , and one of indonesia 's best known cultural critics , with whom ayu utami worked a great deal . bildunterschrift : the indonesian poet goenawan mohammad is very interested in identity the poem speaks of the multiple identities of jakarta 's inhabitants .
each year , at least 300,000 more people arrive in the city , from all over indonesia .
but the city does not change them very much .
nor do they change the city .
most come here to work and do not bring their traditions with them .
so jakarta , this city where languages and cultures live side by side , never really becomes their home . twenty languages spoken we go back to the car , where our driver is speaking in javanese to his wife on his mobile phone .
in jakarta , at least 20 languages are spoken .
like the driver , ayu utami was not born in the capital but came as a child .
her family hails from bogor , where people speak mostly sundanese . she wrote her first novel " saman " in the national language bahasa indonesia .
it quickly became a bestseller in this modern babylon and was then translated into many other languages . ayu utami tries her hand at reading aloud : " he looked at me .
then deep into my eyes , before sitting down next to rosano .
it was actually a very brief contact .
as if he were shy , but at the same time proud , manly … he looked at my tray and said ' you do n't eat much . '
sihar situmorang .
he smiled .
sihar mostly spoke in the jakarta dialect .
occasionally a batak expression came through , usually when he got excited .
to her ears , it sounded warm and comfortable … " bringing literature to public spaces " saman " tells the story of a catholic priest who sides with the poor .
he then falls in love and gives up his priesthood .
it is also the story of a group of women , who break out of their traditional roles .
published in 1988 , it was named best novel by the jakarta arts council . ayu utami is now a member of jakarta arts council and tells me about the projects .
" last year , we focused on the subject of cities .
many groups worked with our committees on this theme .
the literature and arts committee joined forces .
and then a multitude of graffiti and murals with literary quotes from well-known indonesian writers were created in various places around the city .
behind it was the idea of how to take art and culture out of museums and bring it to the public ?
the graffiti and murals were supposed to become part of people 's daily life . " literature and art in public spaces ?
not locked up behind walls ?
is this ayu utami ’ s comment on the politics of this megacity ? bildunterschrift : ayu utami insists on writing about the problems of indonesia she replies that politics in jakarta are more and more for the rich .
many laws criminalize the poor , and then they are thrown in jail .
political issues are a natural part of her stories and articles . " i ca n't just separate my writing with problems faced by the people , the problems of indonesia .
i can not write in an ivory tower . " ' like a huge river , with no beginning or end ' now jakarta is full of graffiti , protest drawings and some of the literary murals have not been painted over , yet .
the dynamism of these changes tells stories about what is on people 's minds . 15 minutes away by car , there is another mural with jakarta 's skyline under a bright blue sky .
there is a young man sporting a crimson shirt in the picture .
he is wearing sunglasses and looking at a piece of paper .
on it is a poem by sitor situmorang , called " jabotabek , " which talks about the semanggi bridge , jakarta 's first modern bridge . " semanggi , from here , from this clover-leaf shaped concrete bridge ; i look at this large city , and at the traffic today , which flows underneath this bridge , like a huge river , with no beginning , nor an end .

westerwelle had words of encouragement but said accession rules would remain firm . german foreign minister guido westerwelle met with croatian leaders in zagreb on wednesday , kicking off his three-day trip to the balkans .
on arrival , westerwelle met with president ivo josipovic , prime minister jadranka kosor and foreign minister gordan jandrokovic .
he then gave a speech to the academy of sciences encouraging the country to make the necessary reforms for european union accession .
" if croatia musters all its strength for the final sprint , then -lsb- eu -rsb- membership could be wrapped up soon , perhaps as soon as next year , " westerwelle said .
he added , however , that there would be no concessions on the accession criteria , especially in light of this year 's greek budget crisis .
" if we loosened the rules , we would only sow concerns about taking on new members . "
croatia is set to join the eu in 2012 , and is seen as the least problematic balkan country seeking accession .
westerwelle praised croatia for recently resolving a border conflict with slovenia , the only country from the former yugoslavia that has joined the union .
diplomatic challenge on thursday , westerwelle travels to the serbian capital of belgrade , where he will face the tricky task of dissuading serbia from seeking a new united nations resolution on the status of kosovo .
" he wo n't put too much pressure on serbia , " westerwelle 's spokesman stephan bredohl , who is traveling with him , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is in line with international law " but we 're very clear on kosovo : germany has accepted its independence and it 's very important for us that if serbia wants to join the european union , it needs to be constructive and toe the eu 's line , " he explained .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 and is now officially recognized by 69 countries .
in july , the international court of justice , which serbia had called on to rule on kosovo 's status , declared that its declaration of independence was in line with international law .
serbia refuses to accept the verdict , pressing instead for a un resolution to reopen talks on the status of what it considers the serbian province of kosovo .
germany was one of the first countries to recognize kosovo as an independent state .
five eu member states , however , do not recognize kosovo , meaning the eu can not make it a precondition for serbia to join the eu .
deadlock in bosnia westerwelle is also to visit bosnia-herzegovina on thursday .
nearly 15 years after the dayton peace agreement , which ended the fighting and split bosnia-herzegovina into two largely autonomous entities , the political situation there remains challenging . many serbs , muslims and croats remain pitted against each other ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for october 3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik seeks independence for bosnian serbs while the ruling on kosovo by the international court of justice was well-received in germany , it has also fanned the flames of separatism in the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , the mainly serb bosnian entity .
its leader milorad dodik has threatened secession from bosnia since he came into power in 2006 .
after the verdict on kosovo , he declared that he would start discussions on independence after the elections .
" in bosnia , the foreign minister 's visit will be largely symbolic and he will try to call on voters to be moderate , " bodo weber , an expert on the region at the democratization policy council , told deutsche welle .
focus on the region germany has been criticized for not making the balkans a focus of its foreign policy , not least because it did not send a representative to the eu-balkan summit in sarajevo in june . many are hoping westerwelle 's trip will change that .
" these countries -lsb- in the balkans -rsb- are already part of europe , that 's why their problems are our problems , " said bernd posselt , mep for germany 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in brussels .
" i would hope that the foreign minister will not just see this trip as a photo opportunity , but see it as the start of a much greater focus of his foreign policy , " he added .

westerwelle had words of encouragement but said accession rules would remain firm . german foreign minister guido westerwelle met with croatian leaders in zagreb on wednesday , kicking off his three-day trip to the balkans .
on arrival , westerwelle met with president ivo josipovic , prime minister jadranka kosor and foreign minister gordan jandrokovic .
he then gave a speech to the academy of sciences encouraging the country to make the necessary reforms for european union accession .
" if croatia musters all its strength for the final sprint , then -lsb- eu -rsb- membership could be wrapped up soon , perhaps as soon as next year , " westerwelle said .
he added , however , that there would be no concessions on the accession criteria , especially in light of this year 's greek budget crisis .
" if we loosened the rules , we would only sow concerns about taking on new members . "
croatia is set to join the eu in 2012 , and is seen as the least problematic balkan country seeking accession .
westerwelle praised croatia for recently resolving a border conflict with slovenia , the only country from the former yugoslavia that has joined the union .
diplomatic challenge on thursday , westerwelle travels to the serbian capital of belgrade , where he will face the tricky task of dissuading serbia from seeking a new united nations resolution on the status of kosovo .
" he wo n't put too much pressure on serbia , " westerwelle 's spokesman stephan bredohl , who is traveling with him , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is in line with international law " but we 're very clear on kosovo : germany has accepted its independence and it 's very important for us that if serbia wants to join the european union , it needs to be constructive and toe the eu 's line , " he explained .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 and is now officially recognized by 69 countries .
in july , the international court of justice , which serbia had called on to rule on kosovo 's status , declared that its declaration of independence was in line with international law .
serbia refuses to accept the verdict , pressing instead for a un resolution to reopen talks on the status of what it considers the serbian province of kosovo .
germany was one of the first countries to recognize kosovo as an independent state .
five eu member states , however , do not recognize kosovo , meaning the eu can not make it a precondition for serbia to join the eu .
deadlock in bosnia westerwelle is also to visit bosnia-herzegovina on thursday .
nearly 15 years after the dayton peace agreement , which ended the fighting and split bosnia-herzegovina into two largely autonomous entities , the political situation there remains challenging . many serbs , muslims and croats remain pitted against each other ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for october 3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik seeks independence for bosnian serbs while the ruling on kosovo by the international court of justice was well-received in germany , it has also fanned the flames of separatism in the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , the mainly serb bosnian entity .
its leader milorad dodik has threatened secession from bosnia since he came into power in 2006 .
after the verdict on kosovo , he declared that he would start discussions on independence after the elections .
" in bosnia , the foreign minister 's visit will be largely symbolic and he will try to call on voters to be moderate , " bodo weber , an expert on the region at the democratization policy council , told deutsche welle .
focus on the region germany has been criticized for not making the balkans a focus of its foreign policy , not least because it did not send a representative to the eu-balkan summit in sarajevo in june . many are hoping westerwelle 's trip will change that .
" these countries -lsb- in the balkans -rsb- are already part of europe , that 's why their problems are our problems , " said bernd posselt , mep for germany 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in brussels .
" i would hope that the foreign minister will not just see this trip as a photo opportunity , but see it as the start of a much greater focus of his foreign policy , " he added .

on arrival , westerwelle met with president ivo josipovic , prime minister jadranka kosor and foreign minister gordan jandrokovic .
he then gave a speech to the academy of sciences encouraging the country to make the necessary reforms for european union accession .
" if croatia musters all its strength for the final sprint , then -lsb- eu -rsb- membership could be wrapped up soon , perhaps as soon as next year , " westerwelle said .
he added , however , that there would be no concessions on the accession criteria , especially in light of this year 's greek budget crisis .
" if we loosened the rules , we would only sow concerns about taking on new members . "
croatia is set to join the eu in 2012 , and is seen as the least problematic balkan country seeking accession .
westerwelle praised croatia for recently resolving a border conflict with slovenia , the only country from the former yugoslavia that has joined the union .
diplomatic challenge on thursday , westerwelle travels to the serbian capital of belgrade , where he will face the tricky task of dissuading serbia from seeking a new united nations resolution on the status of kosovo .
" he wo n't put too much pressure on serbia , " westerwelle 's spokesman stephan bredohl , who is traveling with him , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is in line with international law " but we 're very clear on kosovo : germany has accepted its independence and it 's very important for us that if serbia wants to join the european union , it needs to be constructive and toe the eu 's line , " he explained .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 and is now officially recognized by 69 countries .
in july , the international court of justice , which serbia had called on to rule on kosovo 's status , declared that its declaration of independence was in line with international law .
serbia refuses to accept the verdict , pressing instead for a un resolution to reopen talks on the status of what it considers the serbian province of kosovo .
germany was one of the first countries to recognize kosovo as an independent state .
five eu member states , however , do not recognize kosovo , meaning the eu can not make it a precondition for serbia to join the eu .
deadlock in bosnia westerwelle is also to visit bosnia-herzegovina on thursday .
nearly 15 years after the dayton peace agreement , which ended the fighting and split bosnia-herzegovina into two largely autonomous entities , the political situation there remains challenging . many serbs , muslims and croats remain pitted against each other ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for october 3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik seeks independence for bosnian serbs while the ruling on kosovo by the international court of justice was well-received in germany , it has also fanned the flames of separatism in the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , the mainly serb bosnian entity .
its leader milorad dodik has threatened secession from bosnia since he came into power in 2006 .
after the verdict on kosovo , he declared that he would start discussions on independence after the elections .
" in bosnia , the foreign minister 's visit will be largely symbolic and he will try to call on voters to be moderate , " bodo weber , an expert on the region at the democratization policy council , told deutsche welle .
focus on the region germany has been criticized for not making the balkans a focus of its foreign policy , not least because it did not send a representative to the eu-balkan summit in sarajevo in june . many are hoping westerwelle 's trip will change that .
" these countries -lsb- in the balkans -rsb- are already part of europe , that 's why their problems are our problems , " said bernd posselt , mep for germany 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in brussels .
" i would hope that the foreign minister will not just see this trip as a photo opportunity , but see it as the start of a much greater focus of his foreign policy , " he added .

" the german economy remains robust , " a statement quoted ifo president hans-werner sinn as saying .
the six-month outlook for manufacturing was " still very confident , though somewhat less so than in the previous month , " the statement said .
ifo releases the closely-watched german business confidence index monthly , and bases its score on a survey of 7,000 business executives in manufacturing , construction , wholesale and retail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sinn says the german economy is still in good shape recovery underway official german second-quarter economic figures released on tuesday increased optimism in the country , with the national statistical office confirming a 2.2 percent growth in gross domestic product - the country 's largest since reunification in 1990 .
german exports largely spurred the economic growth , as a weaker euro made selling easier and demand in the world 's emerging economies surged by 8.2 percent in the second quarter .
however analysts expect growth to taper off in coming months as the growth of exports slows down and countries begin to unravel economic stimulus programs intended to ease effects from the recession .

the draft bill hopes to stabilize the banking system by charging higher fees for banks who engage in riskier behavior .
the law could bring in more than 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- per year , which would go into a fund to help bail out banks in the case of another financial crisis .
france and britain have collaborated on similar laws with merkel , who brought the idea up to other global leaders at a group of 8 summit in canada in june but failed to gather broad support .
multi-front opposition the law has gained criticism from several fronts , including economic analysts , who have said the fee must be adopted on a global level to truly stabilize the world financial system .
savings and loan institutions have also opposed the bill , claiming that the most recent crisis has already punished banks , and that they have since modified their own policies to protect against crises .

the draft bill hopes to stabilize the banking system by charging higher fees for banks who engage in riskier behavior .
the law could bring in more than 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- per year , which would go into a fund to help bail out banks in the case of another financial crisis .
france and britain have collaborated on similar laws with merkel , who brought the idea up to other global leaders at a group of 8 summit in canada in june but failed to gather broad support .
multi-front opposition the law has gained criticism from several fronts , including economic analysts , who have said the fee must be adopted on a global level to truly stabilize the world financial system .
savings and loan institutions have also opposed the bill , claiming that the most recent crisis has already punished banks , and that they have since modified their own policies to protect against crises .
and opposition parties have also attacked the draft law , saying it is too low and that banks would pass on the costs to consumers .
but german private banks - including the nation 's largest , deutsche bank - have supported the law , saying it would shore up bankruptcy proceedings for the german banking sector .

germany would become the first country to forbid facebook content to be used for hiring purposes . undercover spies and hidden video cameras - it sounds like the stuff of a james bond movie .
but for some german employees , it 's just another day at work . in recent years , a series of workplace spying scandals have come to light , several involving high-profile companies like the telecommunications firm deutsche telekom , the discount retailer lidl and the national railway operator deutsche bahn . " until now , it has not been regulated , in what capacity and under what conditions an employer can use video surveillance to collect information about his employees , " parliamentarian christian ahrendt of the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- told deutsche welle . in response to the scandals , the governing coalition has proposed a draft law on wednesday that would better regulate workplace privacy .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said the new law would be beneficial for both parties . " it 's a balanced compromise among the various interests and will foster more trust in the workplace between employer and employee , " de maiziere told reporters . no more secret cameras bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security cameras will still be allowed , but not hidden ones a central point of the proposal is that employers can no longer use video surveillance on workers without their knowledge . " there has to be a justifiable reason on the employer 's behalf .
and if video surveillance is going on , there has to be a sign informing people about it , " ahrendt told deutsche welle . retailers in germany have been known to use hidden cameras to catch employees they believe are stealing .
according to the new bill , video surveillance will be forbidden in private areas such as changing rooms , break rooms and bathrooms . however , employers will still be permitted to use cameras as anti-shoplifting measures in public areas , such as around the cash register or the entrance to a supermarket . critics of the bill say secret video surveillance is an important tool to protect against theft and corruption by employees .
the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- said the new bill prevents the fight against corruption and criminality in the workplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spying on employees via facebook will be forbidden ' friending ' the boss the law also protects employees ' online privacy on social networking sites such as facebook and myspace .

" what an employer ca n't do is befriend someone on a closed social network and then use the ' friend ' status to access private data and then use that information against the applicant , " de maiziere said . if the bill is passed into law , germany will become the first country to slap legal restrictions on the use of personal information in private social networking sites . the law still has to go before parliament for debate and a final vote .

germany would become the first country to forbid facebook content to be used for hiring purposes . undercover spies and hidden video cameras - it sounds like the stuff of a james bond movie .
but for some german employees , it 's just another day at work . in recent years , a series of workplace spying scandals have come to light , several involving high-profile companies like the telecommunications firm deutsche telekom , the discount retailer lidl and the national railway operator deutsche bahn . " until now , it has not been regulated , in what capacity and under what conditions an employer can use video surveillance to collect information about his employees , " parliamentarian christian ahrendt of the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- told deutsche welle . in response to the scandals , the governing coalition has proposed a draft law on wednesday that would better regulate workplace privacy .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said the new law would be beneficial for both parties . " it 's a balanced compromise among the various interests and will foster more trust in the workplace between employer and employee , " de maiziere told reporters . no more secret cameras bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security cameras will still be allowed , but not hidden ones a central point of the proposal is that employers can no longer use video surveillance on workers without their knowledge . " there has to be a justifiable reason on the employer 's behalf .
and if video surveillance is going on , there has to be a sign informing people about it , " ahrendt told deutsche welle . retailers in germany have been known to use hidden cameras to catch employees they believe are stealing .
according to the new bill , video surveillance will be forbidden in private areas such as changing rooms , break rooms and bathrooms . however , employers will still be permitted to use cameras as anti-shoplifting measures in public areas , such as around the cash register or the entrance to a supermarket . critics of the bill say secret video surveillance is an important tool to protect against theft and corruption by employees .
the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- said the new bill prevents the fight against corruption and criminality in the workplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spying on employees via facebook will be forbidden ' friending ' the boss the law also protects employees ' online privacy on social networking sites such as facebook and myspace .
at a press conference in berlin , de maiziere emphasized employers would still be permitted to gather information about employees via publicly accessible sources , such as search engines . " what an employer ca n't do is befriend someone on a closed social network and then use the ' friend ' status to access private data and then use that information against the applicant , " de maiziere said . if the bill is passed into law , germany will become the first country to slap legal restrictions on the use of personal information in private social networking sites . the law still has to go before parliament for debate and a final vote .
but fdp politician ahrendt , who sits on the parliamentary judiciary committee , was optimistic that it would pass with a majority . until then , employees in germany will just have to be careful about who they add to their facebook friend lists . author : sarah harman editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after six years of study , eso published its findings that at least five confirmed exoplanets , or extrasolar planets , are orbiting a star only 127 light years away from earth . the five exoplanets all have approximately the mass of neptune - between 13 and 25 times the mass of earth - but orbit much closer to their star , with orbital periods between six and 600 days -lrb- neptune takes 164.79 years to orbit the sun -rrb- . in addition to the five neptune-sized planets , eso astronomers have " tantalizing " evidence of two more exoplanets in the system .

" studies of planetary motions in the new system reveal complex gravitational interactions between the planets and give us insights into the long-term evolution of the system .

third infant death heats debate about hygiene in german hospitals i have lived in germany for 15 years and during that time my family and i have been to a number of german hospitals , clinics and doctors for everything from back surgery to tonsil surgery , child birth , emergency room enrollments and the flu .
the care has been outstanding and the medical staffs have been top notch .
my biggest observation concerns hygiene .
i have had my blood taken by nurses who did not wear gloves .
i have seen doctors remove bandages with their bare hands .
this is not always the rule , but it has happened enough to make me acknowledge the systemic nature of this oversight .
outside of this , i have never had a major concern that any facility does not meet or exceed standards in the us -lrb- my only comparative standard -rrb- .
i would definitely agree , however , that all medical facilities , wherever they may be , should ratchet up any-and-all policies put in place to avoid a recurrence of the mainz tragedy . - scott , us i spent three months in germany late last year and my girlfriend at the time was a registered nurse .
i visited the hospital where she worked on numerous occasions and from an outsider 's point of view there were numerous signs informing everyone how important it was to maintain a clean and sterile working environment .
i noted how much cleaner the hospital was compared to those back in australia . - paul , australia wow , that 's sad .
i 'm glad germany is taking lax standards seriously though .
i think other countries should as well .
doctors get paid very well ; the least they can do is obey the hygiene standards that would make a computer chip manufacturer laugh .
medicine does n't have the highest hygiene standards , electronics does . - fergal via facebook it was long ago , but i went in with measles as an adult and was there for two weeks .
it was different from my experiences in the us and japan , but i was well treated , pampered by the orderlies -lrb- who pitied my bad vacation luck -rrb- , and left with ... a bill that was only a minor fraction of what it would have been in the us .
my only complaint was the bells from the church across the street from my room .
they were so … odd - a rather avant garde sound to them that was not particularly pleasant . - rickford via facebook two babies dead , five critical from bacteria at german hospital apparently , they did the test after giving the infusion to the babies .
daily lab tests should have been done before using the equipment .
how can such a simple requirement be missed ?
it is also an unlucky situation that the babies were already in intensive care with weaker immune systems than that of a healthy baby .
i send my deepest sympathy to the parents of unlucky babies . - nevres , turkey compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now questions are being asked of germany 's hospital hygiene standards .
-lrb- 24.08.2010 -rrb- two babies dead , five critical from bacteria at german hospital two newborn babies have died and five were in a critical condition on sunday after being given feeding drips suspected of being infected with bacteria .

third infant death heats debate about hygiene in german hospitals i have lived in germany for 15 years and during that time my family and i have been to a number of german hospitals , clinics and doctors for everything from back surgery to tonsil surgery , child birth , emergency room enrollments and the flu .
the care has been outstanding and the medical staffs have been top notch .
my biggest observation concerns hygiene .
i have had my blood taken by nurses who did not wear gloves .
i have seen doctors remove bandages with their bare hands .
this is not always the rule , but it has happened enough to make me acknowledge the systemic nature of this oversight .
outside of this , i have never had a major concern that any facility does not meet or exceed standards in the us -lrb- my only comparative standard -rrb- .
i would definitely agree , however , that all medical facilities , wherever they may be , should ratchet up any-and-all policies put in place to avoid a recurrence of the mainz tragedy . - scott , us i spent three months in germany late last year and my girlfriend at the time was a registered nurse .
i visited the hospital where she worked on numerous occasions and from an outsider 's point of view there were numerous signs informing everyone how important it was to maintain a clean and sterile working environment .
i noted how much cleaner the hospital was compared to those back in australia . - paul , australia wow , that 's sad .
i 'm glad germany is taking lax standards seriously though .
i think other countries should as well .
doctors get paid very well ; the least they can do is obey the hygiene standards that would make a computer chip manufacturer laugh .
medicine does n't have the highest hygiene standards , electronics does . - fergal via facebook it was long ago , but i went in with measles as an adult and was there for two weeks .
it was different from my experiences in the us and japan , but i was well treated , pampered by the orderlies -lrb- who pitied my bad vacation luck -rrb- , and left with ... a bill that was only a minor fraction of what it would have been in the us .
my only complaint was the bells from the church across the street from my room .
they were so … odd - a rather avant garde sound to them that was not particularly pleasant . - rickford via facebook two babies dead , five critical from bacteria at german hospital apparently , they did the test after giving the infusion to the babies .
daily lab tests should have been done before using the equipment .
how can such a simple requirement be missed ?

paris is standing by on the policy , rejecting criticism . the european union 's top justice official expressed concern on wednesday over france 's decision to repatriate roma people to romania and bulgaria , but stopped short of directly criticising the expulsions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reding will report her findings next week " it is clear that those who break the law need to face consequences , " commissioner viviane reding said in a statement .
" it is equally clear that nobody should face expulsion just for being roma . "
reding said her office was analyzing the situation in france to determine whether the repatriation complied with eu laws on free movement of people .
she also said she regretted " that some of the rhetoric that has been used in some member states in the past weeks has been openly discriminatory and inflammatory . "
the commission 's findings will be released next week .
transitional agreement applies to roma france has faced international criticism since it began dismantling roma camps and sending ethnic roma found to be living in france illegally back to bulgaria and romania in exchange for a 300 euro -lrb- 385 dollar -rrb- payout .
as part of a transitional agreement for bulgaria and romania , which both joined the eu in 2007 , romanians and bulgarians can travel freely to france but can also be expelled after three months if they can not show they have the financial means to stay in the country .
that arrangement ends in 2014 after the two countries have been in the eu for seven years .

" none of these issues is easy and none of the solutions can be expected to escape criticism or secure unanimous approval , " the president said , in remarks passed on to the press by government spokesman luc chatel .
when he announced the repatriation operation in late july , sarkozy said the camps were " sources of illegal trafficking , of profoundly shocking living standards , of exploitation of children for begging , of prostitution and of crime . "
asylum talks coming up on wedndesday , french interior minister brice hortefeux defended the operation .
he told rtl radio that 117 camps had so far been dismantled , and 630 people sent home , with 300 more explusions expected by the end of the month .
french officials insist that their policy towards the roma is legitimate .

french immigration minister eric besson said the talks were called to discuss " asylum issues and the fight against irregular migration " and would not be " specifically covering a specific nationality or ethnic community . "
he said sarkozy had urged his team " not to get sidetracked by useless controversies . "
the talks start in paris on september 6 .
the meeting has been called ahead of a european conference on asylum , scheduled for september 13-14 in brussels .

the former student activist deals with the megacity 's contradictions in her texts .
the writer says jakarta is not friendly to those who have little . " oh darn it , i scratched too deep .
crazy … this wall is crumbly .
look !
here !
under this layer of colour .
this is it .
this is the layer of that mural with the literature quote , " ayu utami explains jubilantly . we are standing on a sidewalk facing a wall at cikini railway station - a small station in the middle of the city .
trains swelling over with commuters from jakarta 's suburbs stop here . under the layer of paint that ayu utami has scratched away , a poem has been written in black against a yellow background .
the poem is titled " ktp , " the abbreviation for identity card in indonesia . " ktp " was written by goenawan mohammad , a poet , writer , thinker , and one of indonesia 's best known cultural critics , with whom ayu utami worked a great deal . bildunterschrift : the indonesian poet goenawan mohammad is very interested in identity the poem speaks of the multiple identities of jakarta 's inhabitants .
each year , at least 300,000 more people arrive in the city , from all over indonesia .
but the city does not change them very much .
nor do they change the city .
most come here to work and do not bring their traditions with them .
so jakarta , this city where languages and cultures live side by side , never really becomes their home . twenty languages spoken we go back to the car , where our driver is speaking in javanese to his wife on his mobile phone .
in jakarta , at least 20 languages are spoken .
like the driver , ayu utami was not born in the capital but came as a child .
her family hails from bogor , where people speak mostly sundanese . she wrote her first novel " saman " in the national language bahasa indonesia .
it quickly became a bestseller in this modern babylon and was then translated into many other languages . ayu utami tries her hand at reading aloud : " he looked at me .
then deep into my eyes , before sitting down next to rosano .
it was actually a very brief contact .
as if he were shy , but at the same time proud , manly … he looked at my tray and said ' you do n't eat much . '
sihar situmorang .
he smiled .
sihar mostly spoke in the jakarta dialect .
occasionally a batak expression came through , usually when he got excited .
to her ears , it sounded warm and comfortable … " bringing literature to public spaces " saman " tells the story of a catholic priest who sides with the poor .
he then falls in love and gives up his priesthood .
it is also the story of a group of women , who break out of their traditional roles .
published in 1988 , it was named best novel by the jakarta arts council . ayu utami is now a member of jakarta arts council and tells me about the projects .
" last year , we focused on the subject of cities .
many groups worked with our committees on this theme .
the literature and arts committee joined forces .
and then a multitude of graffiti and murals with literary quotes from well-known indonesian writers were created in various places around the city .
behind it was the idea of how to take art and culture out of museums and bring it to the public ?
the graffiti and murals were supposed to become part of people 's daily life . " literature and art in public spaces ?
not locked up behind walls ?
is this ayu utami ’ s comment on the politics of this megacity ? bildunterschrift : ayu utami insists on writing about the problems of indonesia she replies that politics in jakarta are more and more for the rich .
many laws criminalize the poor , and then they are thrown in jail .
political issues are a natural part of her stories and articles . " i ca n't just separate my writing with problems faced by the people , the problems of indonesia .
i can not write in an ivory tower . " ' like a huge river , with no beginning or end ' now jakarta is full of graffiti , protest drawings and some of the literary murals have not been painted over , yet .
the dynamism of these changes tells stories about what is on people 's minds . 15 minutes away by car , there is another mural with jakarta 's skyline under a bright blue sky .
there is a young man sporting a crimson shirt in the picture .
he is wearing sunglasses and looking at a piece of paper .
on it is a poem by sitor situmorang , called " jabotabek , " which talks about the semanggi bridge , jakarta 's first modern bridge . " semanggi , from here , from this clover-leaf shaped concrete bridge ; i look at this large city , and at the traffic today , which flows underneath this bridge , like a huge river , with no beginning , nor an end .

our readers shared some of their own observations . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
third infant death heats debate about hygiene in german hospitals i have lived in germany for 15 years and during that time my family and i have been to a number of german hospitals , clinics and doctors for everything from back surgery to tonsil surgery , child birth , emergency room enrollments and the flu .
the care has been outstanding and the medical staffs have been top notch .
my biggest observation concerns hygiene .
i have had my blood taken by nurses who did not wear gloves .
i have seen doctors remove bandages with their bare hands .
this is not always the rule , but it has happened enough to make me acknowledge the systemic nature of this oversight .
outside of this , i have never had a major concern that any facility does not meet or exceed standards in the us -lrb- my only comparative standard -rrb- .
i would definitely agree , however , that all medical facilities , wherever they may be , should ratchet up any-and-all policies put in place to avoid a recurrence of the mainz tragedy . - scott , us i spent three months in germany late last year and my girlfriend at the time was a registered nurse .
i visited the hospital where she worked on numerous occasions and from an outsider 's point of view there were numerous signs informing everyone how important it was to maintain a clean and sterile working environment .
i noted how much cleaner the hospital was compared to those back in australia . - paul , australia wow , that 's sad .
i 'm glad germany is taking lax standards seriously though .
i think other countries should as well .
doctors get paid very well ; the least they can do is obey the hygiene standards that would make a computer chip manufacturer laugh .
medicine does n't have the highest hygiene standards , electronics does . - fergal via facebook it was long ago , but i went in with measles as an adult and was there for two weeks .
it was different from my experiences in the us and japan , but i was well treated , pampered by the orderlies -lrb- who pitied my bad vacation luck -rrb- , and left with ... a bill that was only a minor fraction of what it would have been in the us .
my only complaint was the bells from the church across the street from my room .
they were so … odd - a rather avant garde sound to them that was not particularly pleasant . - rickford via facebook two babies dead , five critical from bacteria at german hospital apparently , they did the test after giving the infusion to the babies .
daily lab tests should have been done before using the equipment .
how can such a simple requirement be missed ?
it is also an unlucky situation that the babies were already in intensive care with weaker immune systems than that of a healthy baby .
i send my deepest sympathy to the parents of unlucky babies . - nevres , turkey compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new research shows that there 's a physiological cause that could be treated with dietary supplements . after the relative calm of pregnancy , giving birth is a physically and emotionally draining experience .
but the changes do n't stop there .
a woman 's estrogen levels drop significantly , and she now has to care for a crying baby 24 hours a day .
given these circumstances it 's no wonder that up to 75 percent of new mothers around the world feel down for a few days after giving birth .
but new research has found there 's an additional neurological cause to the baby blues as well .
feelings of impotence anne-christin b. , who prefered not to use her last name due to the stigma of postpartum depression , is a 33-year-old mother from berlin .
for the first day or two after her daughter was born four months ago , she felt happy , but that quickly changed .
" then came the feeling that i could n't do things .
i was afraid .
i could n't do things for the child - for whatever reason , " she remembered .
" and then i started to withdraw , i could n't go out or talk with friends on the telephone and this increased very quickly to the point where i could n't be by myself anymore . "
anne-christin is n't the only one .
millions of german women also experience the baby blues .
in her case , she was one of 15 percent of women who develop postpartum depression .
she went to her local doctor , but he did n't take her seriously , so she sought professional psychiatric help .
the source of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decreased serotonin levels are believed to be a culprit of postpartum depression dr. julia sacher , from the max planck institute for human cognitive and brain sciences in leipzig , said it 's well-documented that a sharp drop in estrogen levels and a big change in environment contribute to the baby blues .
that 's why research in this area is incredibly important .
" what we do know is that those women who have severe symptoms of postpartum blues have a higher risk of experiencing a full-blown episode later on , " sacher said .
sacher and her colleagues published the results of their study in the peer-reviewed journal , archives of general psychiatry , earlier this summer .
they found that there is a neurological cause for the baby blues .
" we see an increase in monoamine oxidase a and this can lead to a loss of serotonin , and a loss of serotonin has been associated with low mood , " sacher explained .
feeling sad after childbirth is socially unacceptable other medical professionals , like dr. stephanie krueger , said that this new study may prompt obstetricians to keep an eye on a mother 's moods both before and after childbirth .
krueger is a professor of psychiatry at the charite in berlin , one of the largest university hospitals in europe .
she treated anne-christin for post-partum depression . krueger - who was n't part of the study - said most women who feel depressed after their child is born do n't seek necessary help , because it 's not socially acceptable to feel sad at this time .
" in our culture , women who have just given birth are supposed to be happy , and if they are not , then there 's something wrong with them and they are actually treated as some kind of an outlaw , " krueger said , adding , " in many cases they are being told : why are n't you happy ? "
krueger believes there needs to be more education and support for new mothers .
" families and gps -lsb- general practitioner -rsb- should not take these things lightly and not say , ' well yeah i understand you 've just given birth - everything will be fine ' , " krueger said .
" physicians and families should take any symptoms of depression seriously and go to someone who knows what they are doing , meaning a psychiatrist , for example . "
berlin mother anne-christin b. said she wished her doctors and other medical professionals had talked to her about the baby blues during the pregnancy .
" it would have been better if , even in a midwifery course , there was perhaps 30 minutes or an hour discussion in preparation for pregnancy , where it was explained , where you explain the symptoms and also tell people where they can call for help , " anne-christin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the dramatic life changes brought by babies contribute to depression dietary supplements could help while the baby blues usually goes away by itself after a couple of days , dr. sacher from the max planck institute said treating this temporary condition could be an important step in preventing postpartum depression .
she thinks the baby blues could be treated with medication or dietary supplements , which could counter the increase in the enzyme monoamine oxidase a. but not everyone agrees the baby blues can be prevented so easily .
lisa fehrenbach has been a midwife for 35 years .
she said feeling a bit down after childbirth is a natural thing because childbirth is a physically and emotionally life-changing experience .
many women go from working full-time to being at home with a crying baby - often by themselves .
" you had a completely independent life and you organized everything and you had everything under control and suddenly there 's a little baby , " said fehrenbach , " it clings to your body 24 hours and you have to care for it 24 hours and you can not do what you want , but you have to do what the baby wants . "
fehrenbach said even if women took dietary supplements to counter the enzyme increase , they still have to adjust to this new baby in their lives .
beyond making pregnant women aware of the physiological and psychological changes in their bodies , both sacher and krueger agree this problem needs to be discussed openly in order to fight the stigma of postpartum blues and depression .
" postpartum disorders are nothing the woman is responsible for .
they ca n't help it , " krueger said .
" it has biological reasons for the most part and it can be treated effectively and it should be treated effectively . "
sacher 's next step will be to test for the elevated enzyme in postpartum depression .

berlin mother anne-christin b. said she wished her doctors and other medical professionals had talked to her about the baby blues during the pregnancy .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the dramatic life changes brought by babies contribute to depression dietary supplements could help while the baby blues usually goes away by itself after a couple of days , dr. sacher from the max planck institute said treating this temporary condition could be an important step in preventing postpartum depression .
she thinks the baby blues could be treated with medication or dietary supplements , which could counter the increase in the enzyme monoamine oxidase a. but not everyone agrees the baby blues can be prevented so easily .
lisa fehrenbach has been a midwife for 35 years .
she said feeling a bit down after childbirth is a natural thing because childbirth is a physically and emotionally life-changing experience .
many women go from working full-time to being at home with a crying baby - often by themselves .
" you had a completely independent life and you organized everything and you had everything under control and suddenly there 's a little baby , " said fehrenbach , " it clings to your body 24 hours and you have to care for it 24 hours and you can not do what you want , but you have to do what the baby wants . "
fehrenbach said even if women took dietary supplements to counter the enzyme increase , they still have to adjust to this new baby in their lives .
beyond making pregnant women aware of the physiological and psychological changes in their bodies , both sacher and krueger agree this problem needs to be discussed openly in order to fight the stigma of postpartum blues and depression .
" postpartum disorders are nothing the woman is responsible for .
they ca n't help it , " krueger said .
" it has biological reasons for the most part and it can be treated effectively and it should be treated effectively . "
sacher 's next step will be to test for the elevated enzyme in postpartum depression .

new research shows that there 's a physiological cause that could be treated with dietary supplements . after the relative calm of pregnancy , giving birth is a physically and emotionally draining experience .
but the changes do n't stop there .
a woman 's estrogen levels drop significantly , and she now has to care for a crying baby 24 hours a day .
given these circumstances it 's no wonder that up to 75 percent of new mothers around the world feel down for a few days after giving birth .
but new research has found there 's an additional neurological cause to the baby blues as well .
feelings of impotence anne-christin b. , who prefered not to use her last name due to the stigma of postpartum depression , is a 33-year-old mother from berlin .
for the first day or two after her daughter was born four months ago , she felt happy , but that quickly changed .
" then came the feeling that i could n't do things .
i was afraid .
i could n't do things for the child - for whatever reason , " she remembered .
" and then i started to withdraw , i could n't go out or talk with friends on the telephone and this increased very quickly to the point where i could n't be by myself anymore . "
anne-christin is n't the only one .
millions of german women also experience the baby blues .
in her case , she was one of 15 percent of women who develop postpartum depression .
she went to her local doctor , but he did n't take her seriously , so she sought professional psychiatric help .
the source of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decreased serotonin levels are believed to be a culprit of postpartum depression dr. julia sacher , from the max planck institute for human cognitive and brain sciences in leipzig , said it 's well-documented that a sharp drop in estrogen levels and a big change in environment contribute to the baby blues .
that 's why research in this area is incredibly important .
" what we do know is that those women who have severe symptoms of postpartum blues have a higher risk of experiencing a full-blown episode later on , " sacher said .
sacher and her colleagues published the results of their study in the peer-reviewed journal , archives of general psychiatry , earlier this summer .
they found that there is a neurological cause for the baby blues .
" we see an increase in monoamine oxidase a and this can lead to a loss of serotonin , and a loss of serotonin has been associated with low mood , " sacher explained .
feeling sad after childbirth is socially unacceptable other medical professionals , like dr. stephanie krueger , said that this new study may prompt obstetricians to keep an eye on a mother 's moods both before and after childbirth .
krueger is a professor of psychiatry at the charite in berlin , one of the largest university hospitals in europe .
she treated anne-christin for post-partum depression . krueger - who was n't part of the study - said most women who feel depressed after their child is born do n't seek necessary help , because it 's not socially acceptable to feel sad at this time .
" in our culture , women who have just given birth are supposed to be happy , and if they are not , then there 's something wrong with them and they are actually treated as some kind of an outlaw , " krueger said , adding , " in many cases they are being told : why are n't you happy ? "
krueger believes there needs to be more education and support for new mothers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 25.08.2010 germans are falling in love with tango großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emotion and speed are crucial in tango the germans may not be famous for passionate physical expression , but many are swooning for argentinean tango .
last year , it was added to unesco 's world heritage list and for 2010 it has been named dance of the year . as the sound of bandoneons and violins emanates sensuously from the loudspeakers , a man puts his arm around his partner 's waist , pressing her against him .
from the hips up , the two are welded together like one body , while their legs artistically entangle and detangle themselves . it 's a scene that can be found in any number of dance schools across germany that offer the so-called milonga - the insiders ' term for a tango evening . from munich to hamburg , the tango scene has become so well organized that not having a partner is not an excuse not to join in .
networking services are available to help dancers find partners and travel agencies offer special holiday packages for tango fans . not as easy as it looks despite all the enthusiasm , going from the beginners ' class to being able to glide across the dance floor like a professional is quite a lot of work and takes more than a little talent . " the tango is one of the most difficult dances in the world , " norma raimondi said , a teacher at the don tango club in cologne .
" of course it depends on each person 's talent , but it generally takes a good three years to be able to dance spontaneously , without having to think about each step in advance . " " at the beginning i was just curious , but now it 's like a drug , i have to dance more and more , " said johanna , one of raimondi 's dance student 's , who preferred not to give her last name .
and a certain addiction is necessary to invest so much time into perfecting the dance . bildunterschrift : being comfortable with the steps can take years born out of trials prominent argentinean tango composer enrique santos discepolo -lrb- 1901-1951 -rrb- once said , " the tango is a sad thought that you can dance . "
indeed , that melancholy aspect is inseparably tied to the birthplace of the dance : buenos aires ' old port district , la boca . toward the end of the 19th century , this neighborhood became a gathering place for immigrants who had come to the city on the rio de la plata in search of a better life . tango blended the folklore and the instruments of the immigrants ' homelands to create a completely new sound that would become a symbol of their adopted home : buenos aires . " tango reflects all elements of life , " said 80-year-old luis stazo , a bandoneon player who performed for decades all over the globe with the legendary sexteto mayor .
" it tells how the man betrays the woman and the woman the man .
tango knows horse races , gambling - everything in life .
that 's why tango is much more than a dance . " stazo explained that tango was originally played only with guitar and flute .
later , the bandoneon was added .
the bandoneon - which looks somewhat like an accordion - was invented in the mid-19th century by heinrich band and was initially intended for religious and popular music . " we bandoneon players can thank germany , because the instrument that is so typical for tango and is so important to its soul was invented there , " said stazo . bildunterschrift : a hundred years ago , tango was deamed too sexy for high society frowned upon by the elite corazon , amor y sangre - heart , love and blood - was the immigrants ' motto and describes the soul of the dance .
in the beginning , the big-city argentinean elite rejected the " obscene " tango , which embodied the betrayal , loneliness and failures of the immigrant population . when the foreigners did n't find the riches they had hoped for , many became resigned , turning to gambling or prostitution .
it took many years before tango became socially acceptable . in 1904 , the police even warned against the dance , saying it promoted rivalry among people who , in the end , " always reached for the knife . "
in 1913 , pope st. pius x even condemned the dance . it was , however , too late ; tango had already caught hold .
the roaring twenties ushered in a comeback and in the 21st century it has experienced a revival . " i think that , with tango , many people are looking for a closeness to other people that we are missing in today 's society , " said daniel perusin , an argentinean tango teacher in cologne .
being able to embrace and be embraced is part of what makes tango so fascinating , he added . adjusting to gender roles getting to the point of being able to enjoy the embrace is the first hurdle . " it took me a while to get used to the fact that the man leads , " said dance student johanna .
" as an emancipated european woman , i often tend to want to take the reins . " perusin , on the other hand , said that german men tend to be passive and hesitant and have to learn to take the lead : " they probably think that if they take the active role the women will get upset . " nevertheless , whatever may be holding germans back from expressing themselves fully in this type of dance is still not stopping many of them from giving it a try . author : suzanne cords -lrb- ew / kjb -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and it 's not that far away , galactically speaking . scientists at the european southern observatory , or eso , announced the discovery of the richest known extrasolar planetary system on tuesday .
after six years of study , eso published its findings that at least five confirmed exoplanets , or extrasolar planets , are orbiting a star only 127 light years away from earth . the five exoplanets all have approximately the mass of neptune - between 13 and 25 times the mass of earth - but orbit much closer to their star , with orbital periods between six and 600 days -lrb- neptune takes 164.79 years to orbit the sun -rrb- . in addition to the five neptune-sized planets , eso astronomers have " tantalizing " evidence of two more exoplanets in the system .
one is saturn-sized , with an orbital period of 2,200 days and the other is the smallest known exoplanet with merely 1.4 earth masses and an orbital period of only 1.18 days . the sun-like star , which is called hd 10180 , is located in the southern constellation hydrus , and has been studied closely since its discovery with the harps spectrograph in la silla , chile .
the existence of the exoplanets was discovered through gravitational wobbles in the behavior of the star caused by the passage of the planets . bildunterschrift : the newly discovered system is only 127 light years from earth familiar traits observed using data from this new discovery as well as data from other planetary systems , the researchers found evidence of the titius-bode law that exists in our solar system : the distances of the planets from their star seem to follow a regular pattern . " this could be a signature of the formation process of these planetary systems , " team member michel mayor said in the eso press release . eso astronomer christophe lovis also acknowledged that this discovery highlights the changes in the field of exoplanet research . " we are now entering a new era in exoplanet research : the study of complex planetary systems and not just of individual planets , " lovis said .
" studies of planetary motions in the new system reveal complex gravitational interactions between the planets and give us insights into the long-term evolution of the system . " through further study of the system around hd 10180 , eso astronomers hope to learn more about planetary formation and about how the solar system was developed , as well as what its future may look like . author : stuart tiffen -lrb- ap / afp -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and it 's not that far away , galactically speaking . scientists at the european southern observatory , or eso , announced the discovery of the richest known extrasolar planetary system on tuesday .
after six years of study , eso published its findings that at least five confirmed exoplanets , or extrasolar planets , are orbiting a star only 127 light years away from earth . the five exoplanets all have approximately the mass of neptune - between 13 and 25 times the mass of earth - but orbit much closer to their star , with orbital periods between six and 600 days -lrb- neptune takes 164.79 years to orbit the sun -rrb- . in addition to the five neptune-sized planets , eso astronomers have " tantalizing " evidence of two more exoplanets in the system .
one is saturn-sized , with an orbital period of 2,200 days and the other is the smallest known exoplanet with merely 1.4 earth masses and an orbital period of only 1.18 days . the sun-like star , which is called hd 10180 , is located in the southern constellation hydrus , and has been studied closely since its discovery with the harps spectrograph in la silla , chile .

germany would become the first country to forbid facebook content to be used for hiring purposes . undercover spies and hidden video cameras - it sounds like the stuff of a james bond movie .
but for some german employees , it 's just another day at work . in recent years , a series of workplace spying scandals have come to light , several involving high-profile companies like the telecommunications firm deutsche telekom , the discount retailer lidl and the national railway operator deutsche bahn . " until now , it has not been regulated , in what capacity and under what conditions an employer can use video surveillance to collect information about his employees , " parliamentarian christian ahrendt of the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- told deutsche welle . in response to the scandals , the governing coalition has proposed a draft law on wednesday that would better regulate workplace privacy .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said the new law would be beneficial for both parties .

paris is standing by on the policy , rejecting criticism . the european union 's top justice official expressed concern on wednesday over france 's decision to repatriate roma people to romania and bulgaria , but stopped short of directly criticising the expulsions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reding will report her findings next week " it is clear that those who break the law need to face consequences , " commissioner viviane reding said in a statement .
" it is equally clear that nobody should face expulsion just for being roma . "
reding said her office was analyzing the situation in france to determine whether the repatriation complied with eu laws on free movement of people .
she also said she regretted " that some of the rhetoric that has been used in some member states in the past weeks has been openly discriminatory and inflammatory . "
the commission 's findings will be released next week .
transitional agreement applies to roma france has faced international criticism since it began dismantling roma camps and sending ethnic roma found to be living in france illegally back to bulgaria and romania in exchange for a 300 euro -lrb- 385 dollar -rrb- payout .
as part of a transitional agreement for bulgaria and romania , which both joined the eu in 2007 , romanians and bulgarians can travel freely to france but can also be expelled after three months if they can not show they have the financial means to stay in the country .
that arrangement ends in 2014 after the two countries have been in the eu for seven years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said the camps had " profoundly shocking living standards " french president nicolas sarkozy told his ministers to stay strong and brace for further protests as his government moves to enact more unpopular reforms , including raising the retirement age .
" none of these issues is easy and none of the solutions can be expected to escape criticism or secure unanimous approval , " the president said , in remarks passed on to the press by government spokesman luc chatel .
when he announced the repatriation operation in late july , sarkozy said the camps were " sources of illegal trafficking , of profoundly shocking living standards , of exploitation of children for begging , of prostitution and of crime . "
asylum talks coming up on wedndesday , french interior minister brice hortefeux defended the operation .
he told rtl radio that 117 camps had so far been dismantled , and 630 people sent home , with 300 more explusions expected by the end of the month .
french officials insist that their policy towards the roma is legitimate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is giving deported roma a 300 euro payout in september , french , spanish , italian , british and german interior ministers will gather along with international officials to discuss migration .
french immigration minister eric besson said the talks were called to discuss " asylum issues and the fight against irregular migration " and would not be " specifically covering a specific nationality or ethnic community . "
he said sarkozy had urged his team " not to get sidetracked by useless controversies . "
the talks start in paris on september 6 .
the meeting has been called ahead of a european conference on asylum , scheduled for september 13-14 in brussels .

paris is standing by on the policy , rejecting criticism . the european union 's top justice official expressed concern on wednesday over france 's decision to repatriate roma people to romania and bulgaria , but stopped short of directly criticising the expulsions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reding will report her findings next week " it is clear that those who break the law need to face consequences , " commissioner viviane reding said in a statement .
" it is equally clear that nobody should face expulsion just for being roma . "
reding said her office was analyzing the situation in france to determine whether the repatriation complied with eu laws on free movement of people .
she also said she regretted " that some of the rhetoric that has been used in some member states in the past weeks has been openly discriminatory and inflammatory . "
the commission 's findings will be released next week .
transitional agreement applies to roma france has faced international criticism since it began dismantling roma camps and sending ethnic roma found to be living in france illegally back to bulgaria and romania in exchange for a 300 euro -lrb- 385 dollar -rrb- payout .
as part of a transitional agreement for bulgaria and romania , which both joined the eu in 2007 , romanians and bulgarians can travel freely to france but can also be expelled after three months if they can not show they have the financial means to stay in the country .
that arrangement ends in 2014 after the two countries have been in the eu for seven years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said the camps had " profoundly shocking living standards " french president nicolas sarkozy told his ministers to stay strong and brace for further protests as his government moves to enact more unpopular reforms , including raising the retirement age .
" none of these issues is easy and none of the solutions can be expected to escape criticism or secure unanimous approval , " the president said , in remarks passed on to the press by government spokesman luc chatel .
when he announced the repatriation operation in late july , sarkozy said the camps were " sources of illegal trafficking , of profoundly shocking living standards , of exploitation of children for begging , of prostitution and of crime . "
asylum talks coming up on wedndesday , french interior minister brice hortefeux defended the operation .
he told rtl radio that 117 camps had so far been dismantled , and 630 people sent home , with 300 more explusions expected by the end of the month .
french officials insist that their policy towards the roma is legitimate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is giving deported roma a 300 euro payout in september , french , spanish , italian , british and german interior ministers will gather along with international officials to discuss migration .
french immigration minister eric besson said the talks were called to discuss " asylum issues and the fight against irregular migration " and would not be " specifically covering a specific nationality or ethnic community . "
he said sarkozy had urged his team " not to get sidetracked by useless controversies . "
the talks start in paris on september 6 .
the meeting has been called ahead of a european conference on asylum , scheduled for september 13-14 in brussels .

tango knows horse races , gambling - everything in life .
that 's why tango is much more than a dance . " stazo explained that tango was originally played only with guitar and flute .

the bandoneon - which looks somewhat like an accordion - was invented in the mid-19th century by heinrich band and was initially intended for religious and popular music .

the roaring twenties ushered in a comeback and in the 21st century it has experienced a revival . " i think that , with tango , many people are looking for a closeness to other people that we are missing in today 's society , " said daniel perusin , an argentinean tango teacher in cologne .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 25.08.2010 economic recovery at stake in latvian elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is heated debate about the future path of latvia latvia is just weeks away from its next general election .
one of the key issues is the country 's fledgling economic recovery .
but the party that is leading in the opinion polls wants to forge closer ties with russia . latvia is slowly emerging from recession with the help of money from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the european union .
the economic recovery is likely to play a central role in the parliamentary elections in october .
latvians will effectively be voting either to continue the government 's austerity program , or to refuse help from international donors , and instead increase the country 's dependency on russia .
october 2nd is decision time come election day , latvians will choose between 10 parties , or alliances , running for the 100-seat parliament , or saeima .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the latvian economy is recovering with help from the imf and the eu recent opinion polls show that the pro-kremlin " harmony centre " bloc is currently the most popular party .
it was formed in april this year , and polls indicate that around 20 percent of people intend to vote for it .
nellija locmele is the editor of the weekly news and current affairs magazine " ir . "
she is alarmed at the prospect of " harmony centre " winning the most seats in parliament : " harmony centre is … not a stable party , " locmele said .
" it 's new and has n't proved itself over the years , so we are not able to assess its policies and ideology in practice . "
locmele is concerned that there are politicians with very differing views on how to boost the economy within the party .
the country is at a crossroads latvia is at a crossroads in terms of its further economic and political development .
in order to keep the economic recovery on track , locmele feels the country needs to stick to its structural reforms .
but " harmony centre " wants latvia to have closer economic and political ties with russia .
political scientist janis ikstens says this is part of an increasing trend in latvia , but he warns that this could be dangerous : " what is striking is that this discourse has barely changed after one of the leaders of " harmony centre " openly threatened to stage bloodshed à la bishkek in riga if his political platform is not fulfilled .
this is i think absolutely unacceptable in a democratic society . "
current government is struggling despite the fact that the present government managed to halt the economic recession under prime minister valdia dombrovskis , his pro-western alliance " unity " is falling behind in the polls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current prime minister is struggling in opinion polls liga stafecka of delna , the latvian chapter of transparency international , says that voters do n't appreciate the gravity of the situation .
" people in latvia are perplexed and confused because many political unions or blocs have been established , " she said . " the voters find it very hard to distinguish one bloc from the other . "
the latest figures show that around 20 per cent of voters in latvia have n't still decided who they will vote for .

the draft bill hopes to stabilize the banking system by charging higher fees for banks who engage in riskier behavior .
the law could bring in more than 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- per year , which would go into a fund to help bail out banks in the case of another financial crisis .
france and britain have collaborated on similar laws with merkel , who brought the idea up to other global leaders at a group of 8 summit in canada in june but failed to gather broad support .
multi-front opposition the law has gained criticism from several fronts , including economic analysts , who have said the fee must be adopted on a global level to truly stabilize the world financial system .
savings and loan institutions have also opposed the bill , claiming that the most recent crisis has already punished banks , and that they have since modified their own policies to protect against crises .
and opposition parties have also attacked the draft law , saying it is too low and that banks would pass on the costs to consumers .
but german private banks - including the nation 's largest , deutsche bank - have supported the law , saying it would shore up bankruptcy proceedings for the german banking sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 25.08.2010 electronic devices speed up international development work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handheld devices are helping wfp workers in the field the world food program is using technology to speed efforts to learn where food aid is needed .
with handheld devices , the organization is able to get more accurate data and transmit it wirelessly back to headquarters . the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- in burundi is using handheld personal digital assistants , or pdas , to help keep tabs on the country 's food situation .
the technology has helped speed up the process of data collection and improve the accuracy of the organization 's food security surveys .
staff members organize fact-finding missions to gauge the country 's food supply .
when wfp arrived in burundi in 1968 , the organization was using pen and paper to conduct their food surveys .
now , wfp uses small palmtop computers , only slightly larger than normal cell phones and light enough to carry .
the devices have held up against the strong burundian heat and can last for days before needing a recharge .
" so you have the speed of gathering data , which means you can expand your survey area , and that makes it more valid by interviewing more people , " marc neilson said , a public information officer for wfp burundi .
the organization provides food assistance to more than 600,000 " food-insecure " burundians and some 90 million people around the world every year .
wfp plans to provide about 3.7 million tons of food in 73 countries to those unable to produce or obtain enough food for themselves and their families .
bildunterschrift : wfp provides food assistance to about 90 million people worldwide a welcome development in bihogo village in northern burundi , wfp program assistant gerard bisman uses his pda to conduct a 20-question survey with local residents about their food needs and living standards .
" it 's very interesting to use the device because it 's a lot faster , " he said .
" it used to take us about an hour-and-a-half to complete the entire interview with paper , and now it takes only half-an-hour . "
since he started using the device in march , bisman has eliminated prep time , paper shuffling and the need to decipher sloppy hand writing , which has reduced the margin of error .
the wfp staffer said residents also appreciate the technology , noting that survey-takers used to get " very , very tired " back when the questionnaire was conducted by hand .
bihogo resident elisabeth tembaidai had never been interviewed by wfp before .
the 56-year-old primary school teacher said it is the first time she has seen a pda - and the device shows the country is making progress .
a few years ago , tembaidai received food aid from wfp during a drought .
she said she hopes wfp will provide her with food this year , too .
" well , we will probably need some help in regards to food this year because the water that used to come from up north does n't come anymore , " she said .
" it 's the dry season also , and we are short of food at the moment , and we are asking wfp for some food now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pdas allow wfp to transmit data wirelessly high-speed , wireless transmission information is currently collected on a memory card and sent to the main wfp office in bujumbura , but soon wfp field staff will be able to transmit their findings wirelessly .
burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world , with annual per capita income averaging about $ 300 , or 236 euros .
in 2006 , the country emerged from a 13-year civil war ; one rebel group laid down its arms just last year .
now , however , the country has a new high-speed 3g wireless network .
by sending data wirelessly to the central database for analysis , wfp staff can provide up-to-date information from around the country , helping streamline planning on food shipments . the pda 's price tag is about $ 200 , or 158 euros - and providing two devices in each of burundi 's 15 provinces costs about $ 6,000 , or 4728 euros , not including training costs .
but neilson said the devices are a good investment : " any time you can save doing that , it means those most at risk - the poor - are getting the assistance faster and more effectively , and you 're not perhaps going in an area where you really should n't be , " he said .
" wfp needs to be in the areas that are most at risk .
that 's the bottom line . "
bildunterschrift : scratch card ' e-vouchers ' allow beneficiaries more options to receive food aid scratch card ' e-vouchers ' wfp has put the pdas to use elsewhere in africa , including the congo and mozambique .
in zambia , wfp distributes " e-voucher " scratch cards to improve the food voucher program .
instead of lining up for food aid , people can now choose when and where to pick up their monthly assistance .
the scratch card codes are entered into a mobile phone upon delivery of the food .
wfp said the program reduces transaction costs and increases the " efficiency and effectiveness " of food distribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wfp 's scratch card program reduces the transaction costs of food distribution in syria , 130,000 iraqi refugees receiving food aid are able to get the wfp 's " virtual vouchers " via text message .
the electronic vouchers can be exchanged for items not normally included in conventional aid baskets , such as rice , wheat flour , lentils , chickpeas , oil and canned fish , as well as cheese and eggs .
other organizations are also taking advantage of the new technologies in the field .
in the west african countries of togo and niger , the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- has worked with pdas equipped with gps capabilities to help prevent malaria .
a team of scientists used the electronic devices to collect high-quality data on the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets . in the asia-pacific region , un children 's fund staff use pda questionnaires to provide rapid assessments in emergency situations .
local statistical data on livelihood , poverty , health and nutrition can help inform situation reports , as well as high-level government officials .

" it used to take us about an hour-and-a-half to complete the entire interview with paper , and now it takes only half-an-hour . "
since he started using the device in march , bisman has eliminated prep time , paper shuffling and the need to decipher sloppy hand writing , which has reduced the margin of error .
the wfp staffer said residents also appreciate the technology , noting that survey-takers used to get " very , very tired " back when the questionnaire was conducted by hand .
bihogo resident elisabeth tembaidai had never been interviewed by wfp before .
the 56-year-old primary school teacher said it is the first time she has seen a pda - and the device shows the country is making progress .
a few years ago , tembaidai received food aid from wfp during a drought .
she said she hopes wfp will provide her with food this year , too .
" well , we will probably need some help in regards to food this year because the water that used to come from up north does n't come anymore , " she said .
" it 's the dry season also , and we are short of food at the moment , and we are asking wfp for some food now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pdas allow wfp to transmit data wirelessly high-speed , wireless transmission information is currently collected on a memory card and sent to the main wfp office in bujumbura , but soon wfp field staff will be able to transmit their findings wirelessly .
burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world , with annual per capita income averaging about $ 300 , or 236 euros .
in 2006 , the country emerged from a 13-year civil war ; one rebel group laid down its arms just last year .
now , however , the country has a new high-speed 3g wireless network .
by sending data wirelessly to the central database for analysis , wfp staff can provide up-to-date information from around the country , helping streamline planning on food shipments . the pda 's price tag is about $ 200 , or 158 euros - and providing two devices in each of burundi 's 15 provinces costs about $ 6,000 , or 4728 euros , not including training costs .
but neilson said the devices are a good investment : " any time you can save doing that , it means those most at risk - the poor - are getting the assistance faster and more effectively , and you 're not perhaps going in an area where you really should n't be , " he said .
" wfp needs to be in the areas that are most at risk .
that 's the bottom line . "
bildunterschrift : scratch card ' e-vouchers ' allow beneficiaries more options to receive food aid scratch card ' e-vouchers ' wfp has put the pdas to use elsewhere in africa , including the congo and mozambique .
in zambia , wfp distributes " e-voucher " scratch cards to improve the food voucher program .
instead of lining up for food aid , people can now choose when and where to pick up their monthly assistance .
the scratch card codes are entered into a mobile phone upon delivery of the food .
wfp said the program reduces transaction costs and increases the " efficiency and effectiveness " of food distribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wfp 's scratch card program reduces the transaction costs of food distribution in syria , 130,000 iraqi refugees receiving food aid are able to get the wfp 's " virtual vouchers " via text message .
the electronic vouchers can be exchanged for items not normally included in conventional aid baskets , such as rice , wheat flour , lentils , chickpeas , oil and canned fish , as well as cheese and eggs .
other organizations are also taking advantage of the new technologies in the field .
in the west african countries of togo and niger , the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- has worked with pdas equipped with gps capabilities to help prevent malaria .
a team of scientists used the electronic devices to collect high-quality data on the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets . in the asia-pacific region , un children 's fund staff use pda questionnaires to provide rapid assessments in emergency situations .

with handheld devices , the organization is able to get more accurate data and transmit it wirelessly back to headquarters . the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- in burundi is using handheld personal digital assistants , or pdas , to help keep tabs on the country 's food situation .
the technology has helped speed up the process of data collection and improve the accuracy of the organization 's food security surveys .
staff members organize fact-finding missions to gauge the country 's food supply .
when wfp arrived in burundi in 1968 , the organization was using pen and paper to conduct their food surveys .
now , wfp uses small palmtop computers , only slightly larger than normal cell phones and light enough to carry .
the devices have held up against the strong burundian heat and can last for days before needing a recharge .
" so you have the speed of gathering data , which means you can expand your survey area , and that makes it more valid by interviewing more people , " marc neilson said , a public information officer for wfp burundi .
the organization provides food assistance to more than 600,000 " food-insecure " burundians and some 90 million people around the world every year .
wfp plans to provide about 3.7 million tons of food in 73 countries to those unable to produce or obtain enough food for themselves and their families .

third infant death heats debate about hygiene in german hospitals i have lived in germany for 15 years and during that time my family and i have been to a number of german hospitals , clinics and doctors for everything from back surgery to tonsil surgery , child birth , emergency room enrollments and the flu .
the care has been outstanding and the medical staffs have been top notch .
my biggest observation concerns hygiene .
i have had my blood taken by nurses who did not wear gloves .
i have seen doctors remove bandages with their bare hands .
this is not always the rule , but it has happened enough to make me acknowledge the systemic nature of this oversight .
outside of this , i have never had a major concern that any facility does not meet or exceed standards in the us -lrb- my only comparative standard -rrb- .
i would definitely agree , however , that all medical facilities , wherever they may be , should ratchet up any-and-all policies put in place to avoid a recurrence of the mainz tragedy . - scott , us i spent three months in germany late last year and my girlfriend at the time was a registered nurse .
i visited the hospital where she worked on numerous occasions and from an outsider 's point of view there were numerous signs informing everyone how important it was to maintain a clean and sterile working environment .
i noted how much cleaner the hospital was compared to those back in australia . - paul , australia wow , that 's sad .
i 'm glad germany is taking lax standards seriously though .
i think other countries should as well .
doctors get paid very well ; the least they can do is obey the hygiene standards that would make a computer chip manufacturer laugh .
medicine does n't have the highest hygiene standards , electronics does . - fergal via facebook it was long ago , but i went in with measles as an adult and was there for two weeks .
it was different from my experiences in the us and japan , but i was well treated , pampered by the orderlies -lrb- who pitied my bad vacation luck -rrb- , and left with ... a bill that was only a minor fraction of what it would have been in the us .
my only complaint was the bells from the church across the street from my room .

westerwelle had words of encouragement but said accession rules would remain firm . german foreign minister guido westerwelle met with croatian leaders in zagreb on wednesday , kicking off his three-day trip to the balkans .
on arrival , westerwelle met with president ivo josipovic , prime minister jadranka kosor and foreign minister gordan jandrokovic .
he then gave a speech to the academy of sciences encouraging the country to make the necessary reforms for european union accession .
" if croatia musters all its strength for the final sprint , then -lsb- eu -rsb- membership could be wrapped up soon , perhaps as soon as next year , " westerwelle said .
he added , however , that there would be no concessions on the accession criteria , especially in light of this year 's greek budget crisis .
" if we loosened the rules , we would only sow concerns about taking on new members . "
croatia is set to join the eu in 2012 , and is seen as the least problematic balkan country seeking accession .
westerwelle praised croatia for recently resolving a border conflict with slovenia , the only country from the former yugoslavia that has joined the union .
diplomatic challenge on thursday , westerwelle travels to the serbian capital of belgrade , where he will face the tricky task of dissuading serbia from seeking a new united nations resolution on the status of kosovo .
" he wo n't put too much pressure on serbia , " westerwelle 's spokesman stephan bredohl , who is traveling with him , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is in line with international law " but we 're very clear on kosovo : germany has accepted its independence and it 's very important for us that if serbia wants to join the european union , it needs to be constructive and toe the eu 's line , " he explained .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 and is now officially recognized by 69 countries .
in july , the international court of justice , which serbia had called on to rule on kosovo 's status , declared that its declaration of independence was in line with international law .
serbia refuses to accept the verdict , pressing instead for a un resolution to reopen talks on the status of what it considers the serbian province of kosovo .
germany was one of the first countries to recognize kosovo as an independent state .
five eu member states , however , do not recognize kosovo , meaning the eu can not make it a precondition for serbia to join the eu .
deadlock in bosnia westerwelle is also to visit bosnia-herzegovina on thursday .
nearly 15 years after the dayton peace agreement , which ended the fighting and split bosnia-herzegovina into two largely autonomous entities , the political situation there remains challenging . many serbs , muslims and croats remain pitted against each other ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for october 3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik seeks independence for bosnian serbs while the ruling on kosovo by the international court of justice was well-received in germany , it has also fanned the flames of separatism in the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , the mainly serb bosnian entity .
its leader milorad dodik has threatened secession from bosnia since he came into power in 2006 .
after the verdict on kosovo , he declared that he would start discussions on independence after the elections .
" in bosnia , the foreign minister 's visit will be largely symbolic and he will try to call on voters to be moderate , " bodo weber , an expert on the region at the democratization policy council , told deutsche welle .
focus on the region germany has been criticized for not making the balkans a focus of its foreign policy , not least because it did not send a representative to the eu-balkan summit in sarajevo in june . many are hoping westerwelle 's trip will change that .
" these countries -lsb- in the balkans -rsb- are already part of europe , that 's why their problems are our problems , " said bernd posselt , mep for germany 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in brussels .
" i would hope that the foreign minister will not just see this trip as a photo opportunity , but see it as the start of a much greater focus of his foreign policy , " he added .

westerwelle had words of encouragement but said accession rules would remain firm . german foreign minister guido westerwelle met with croatian leaders in zagreb on wednesday , kicking off his three-day trip to the balkans .
on arrival , westerwelle met with president ivo josipovic , prime minister jadranka kosor and foreign minister gordan jandrokovic .
he then gave a speech to the academy of sciences encouraging the country to make the necessary reforms for european union accession .
" if croatia musters all its strength for the final sprint , then -lsb- eu -rsb- membership could be wrapped up soon , perhaps as soon as next year , " westerwelle said .
he added , however , that there would be no concessions on the accession criteria , especially in light of this year 's greek budget crisis .
" if we loosened the rules , we would only sow concerns about taking on new members . "
croatia is set to join the eu in 2012 , and is seen as the least problematic balkan country seeking accession .
westerwelle praised croatia for recently resolving a border conflict with slovenia , the only country from the former yugoslavia that has joined the union .
diplomatic challenge on thursday , westerwelle travels to the serbian capital of belgrade , where he will face the tricky task of dissuading serbia from seeking a new united nations resolution on the status of kosovo .

many groups worked with our committees on this theme .
the literature and arts committee joined forces .
and then a multitude of graffiti and murals with literary quotes from well-known indonesian writers were created in various places around the city .

achieving the right balance between the choir , the soloists and the orchestra is hard - especially when conducting pieces that were n't written for bayreuth . have you always been steeped in wager , or what path led you to his work ? wagner was actually one of the first composers i got to know - the first opera i saw was " tannhaeuser " when i was five years old .
ever since then , i 've been listening to and analyzing his operas and been in love with his music . i think starting with wagner also opened my eyes for other composers .
approaching the philosophical and emotional components of wagner 's music helped me understand many other composers , including beethoven .
since wagner was the first i was introduced to , i viewed every other composer from a different perspective . bildunterschrift : the young conductor already has an impressive list of engagements it 's been said that you 're able to have a kind of empathy with each member of an orchestra .
how would you describe the process of bringing together so many different elements when conducting ? that process is what 's magical about being a conductor .
you 're dealing with orchestras and choirs composed of individuals who are each wonderful musicians and who each have their own ideas about how the music should be . everybody has an ego - in a good sense .
you need an artistic ego to perform music , but you have to focus those egos toward one result . when the members of an orchestra forget about the global result , it 's dangerous , and that 's a very real possibility in opera .
it should be like a family , though - everyone has a very important place and part in the family .
if some member of the family thinks someone else is more important , then it does n't work .
that seems to relate to wagner 's intentions with bayreuth - to have people focus on the music and not on themselves .
have you found the bayreuth setting encourages that artistic ideal ? i agree that there is something special about this place both practically and theoretically .
wagner really is the only star here .
for one thing , the audience ca n't even see the conductor in the orchestra pit , so there 's no possibility of the conductor stealing the show . that means the music starts without applause - it starts from scratch in a way .
everything is set up to be just about music . there 's a mystical quality to being here , which i experienced three years ago in the audience when i was invited to conduct " lohengrin . "
everyone comes to this mountain , and everyone is concentrated on the music .
that 's particular to bayreuth , but i wish it were that way everywhere - that the composer would be the one put on the podium . bildunterschrift : nelsons conducted a new production of " lohengrin " by hans neuenfels that was heavy on rodents where do think " lohengrin " stands in wagner 's oeuvre - is it the point where wagner comes into his own as a composer ? i think one notices that " lohengrin " is still an early opera in the oeuvre .

achieving the right balance between the choir , the soloists and the orchestra is hard - especially when conducting pieces that were n't written for bayreuth . have you always been steeped in wager , or what path led you to his work ? wagner was actually one of the first composers i got to know - the first opera i saw was " tannhaeuser " when i was five years old .
ever since then , i 've been listening to and analyzing his operas and been in love with his music . i think starting with wagner also opened my eyes for other composers .
approaching the philosophical and emotional components of wagner 's music helped me understand many other composers , including beethoven .
since wagner was the first i was introduced to , i viewed every other composer from a different perspective . bildunterschrift : the young conductor already has an impressive list of engagements it 's been said that you 're able to have a kind of empathy with each member of an orchestra .
how would you describe the process of bringing together so many different elements when conducting ? that process is what 's magical about being a conductor .
you 're dealing with orchestras and choirs composed of individuals who are each wonderful musicians and who each have their own ideas about how the music should be . everybody has an ego - in a good sense .
you need an artistic ego to perform music , but you have to focus those egos toward one result . when the members of an orchestra forget about the global result , it 's dangerous , and that 's a very real possibility in opera .
it should be like a family , though - everyone has a very important place and part in the family .
if some member of the family thinks someone else is more important , then it does n't work .
that seems to relate to wagner 's intentions with bayreuth - to have people focus on the music and not on themselves .
have you found the bayreuth setting encourages that artistic ideal ? i agree that there is something special about this place both practically and theoretically .
wagner really is the only star here .
for one thing , the audience ca n't even see the conductor in the orchestra pit , so there 's no possibility of the conductor stealing the show . that means the music starts without applause - it starts from scratch in a way .
everything is set up to be just about music . there 's a mystical quality to being here , which i experienced three years ago in the audience when i was invited to conduct " lohengrin . "
everyone comes to this mountain , and everyone is concentrated on the music .
that 's particular to bayreuth , but i wish it were that way everywhere - that the composer would be the one put on the podium . bildunterschrift : nelsons conducted a new production of " lohengrin " by hans neuenfels that was heavy on rodents where do think " lohengrin " stands in wagner 's oeuvre - is it the point where wagner comes into his own as a composer ? i think one notices that " lohengrin " is still an early opera in the oeuvre .
but wagner is so clever , and you can feel from the work that he very consciously knows how to use his powers and to manipulate people in writing music .
i think act two of " lohengrin " contains one of wagner 's greatest masterpieces .
there , he creates the atmosphere so dramatically , and you think , " everything can be so beautiful in life , if you just make the right decisions . "
but then , you also know , " no , no , the ending wo n't be nice . " in act two of the opera , you know that the future could be so great , but wagner knows it will never happen and shows that in the music .
it 's so sad and so beautiful at the same time . interview : rick fulker -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the draft bill hopes to stabilize the banking system by charging higher fees for banks who engage in riskier behavior .
the law could bring in more than 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- per year , which would go into a fund to help bail out banks in the case of another financial crisis .
france and britain have collaborated on similar laws with merkel , who brought the idea up to other global leaders at a group of 8 summit in canada in june but failed to gather broad support .
multi-front opposition the law has gained criticism from several fronts , including economic analysts , who have said the fee must be adopted on a global level to truly stabilize the world financial system .
savings and loan institutions have also opposed the bill , claiming that the most recent crisis has already punished banks , and that they have since modified their own policies to protect against crises .
and opposition parties have also attacked the draft law , saying it is too low and that banks would pass on the costs to consumers .
but german private banks - including the nation 's largest , deutsche bank - have supported the law , saying it would shore up bankruptcy proceedings for the german banking sector .

westerwelle had words of encouragement but said accession rules would remain firm . german foreign minister guido westerwelle met with croatian leaders in zagreb on wednesday , kicking off his three-day trip to the balkans .
on arrival , westerwelle met with president ivo josipovic , prime minister jadranka kosor and foreign minister gordan jandrokovic .
he then gave a speech to the academy of sciences encouraging the country to make the necessary reforms for european union accession .
" if croatia musters all its strength for the final sprint , then -lsb- eu -rsb- membership could be wrapped up soon , perhaps as soon as next year , " westerwelle said .
he added , however , that there would be no concessions on the accession criteria , especially in light of this year 's greek budget crisis .
" if we loosened the rules , we would only sow concerns about taking on new members . "
croatia is set to join the eu in 2012 , and is seen as the least problematic balkan country seeking accession .
westerwelle praised croatia for recently resolving a border conflict with slovenia , the only country from the former yugoslavia that has joined the union .
diplomatic challenge on thursday , westerwelle travels to the serbian capital of belgrade , where he will face the tricky task of dissuading serbia from seeking a new united nations resolution on the status of kosovo .
" he wo n't put too much pressure on serbia , " westerwelle 's spokesman stephan bredohl , who is traveling with him , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is in line with international law " but we 're very clear on kosovo : germany has accepted its independence and it 's very important for us that if serbia wants to join the european union , it needs to be constructive and toe the eu 's line , " he explained .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 and is now officially recognized by 69 countries .
in july , the international court of justice , which serbia had called on to rule on kosovo 's status , declared that its declaration of independence was in line with international law .
serbia refuses to accept the verdict , pressing instead for a un resolution to reopen talks on the status of what it considers the serbian province of kosovo .
germany was one of the first countries to recognize kosovo as an independent state .
five eu member states , however , do not recognize kosovo , meaning the eu can not make it a precondition for serbia to join the eu .
deadlock in bosnia westerwelle is also to visit bosnia-herzegovina on thursday .
nearly 15 years after the dayton peace agreement , which ended the fighting and split bosnia-herzegovina into two largely autonomous entities , the political situation there remains challenging . many serbs , muslims and croats remain pitted against each other ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for october 3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik seeks independence for bosnian serbs while the ruling on kosovo by the international court of justice was well-received in germany , it has also fanned the flames of separatism in the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , the mainly serb bosnian entity .

westerwelle had words of encouragement but said accession rules would remain firm . german foreign minister guido westerwelle met with croatian leaders in zagreb on wednesday , kicking off his three-day trip to the balkans .
on arrival , westerwelle met with president ivo josipovic , prime minister jadranka kosor and foreign minister gordan jandrokovic .
he then gave a speech to the academy of sciences encouraging the country to make the necessary reforms for european union accession .
" if croatia musters all its strength for the final sprint , then -lsb- eu -rsb- membership could be wrapped up soon , perhaps as soon as next year , " westerwelle said .
he added , however , that there would be no concessions on the accession criteria , especially in light of this year 's greek budget crisis .
" if we loosened the rules , we would only sow concerns about taking on new members . "
croatia is set to join the eu in 2012 , and is seen as the least problematic balkan country seeking accession .
westerwelle praised croatia for recently resolving a border conflict with slovenia , the only country from the former yugoslavia that has joined the union .
diplomatic challenge on thursday , westerwelle travels to the serbian capital of belgrade , where he will face the tricky task of dissuading serbia from seeking a new united nations resolution on the status of kosovo .
" he wo n't put too much pressure on serbia , " westerwelle 's spokesman stephan bredohl , who is traveling with him , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is in line with international law " but we 're very clear on kosovo : germany has accepted its independence and it 's very important for us that if serbia wants to join the european union , it needs to be constructive and toe the eu 's line , " he explained .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 and is now officially recognized by 69 countries .
in july , the international court of justice , which serbia had called on to rule on kosovo 's status , declared that its declaration of independence was in line with international law .
serbia refuses to accept the verdict , pressing instead for a un resolution to reopen talks on the status of what it considers the serbian province of kosovo .
germany was one of the first countries to recognize kosovo as an independent state .
five eu member states , however , do not recognize kosovo , meaning the eu can not make it a precondition for serbia to join the eu .
deadlock in bosnia westerwelle is also to visit bosnia-herzegovina on thursday .
nearly 15 years after the dayton peace agreement , which ended the fighting and split bosnia-herzegovina into two largely autonomous entities , the political situation there remains challenging . many serbs , muslims and croats remain pitted against each other ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for october 3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik seeks independence for bosnian serbs while the ruling on kosovo by the international court of justice was well-received in germany , it has also fanned the flames of separatism in the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , the mainly serb bosnian entity .
its leader milorad dodik has threatened secession from bosnia since he came into power in 2006 .
after the verdict on kosovo , he declared that he would start discussions on independence after the elections .
" in bosnia , the foreign minister 's visit will be largely symbolic and he will try to call on voters to be moderate , " bodo weber , an expert on the region at the democratization policy council , told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 25.08.2010 neurological cause found for the baby blues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postpartum depression affects 15 percent of new mothers the baby blues affects up to three-quarters of new mothers .
new research shows that there 's a physiological cause that could be treated with dietary supplements . after the relative calm of pregnancy , giving birth is a physically and emotionally draining experience .
but the changes do n't stop there .
a woman 's estrogen levels drop significantly , and she now has to care for a crying baby 24 hours a day .
given these circumstances it 's no wonder that up to 75 percent of new mothers around the world feel down for a few days after giving birth .
but new research has found there 's an additional neurological cause to the baby blues as well .
feelings of impotence anne-christin b. , who prefered not to use her last name due to the stigma of postpartum depression , is a 33-year-old mother from berlin .
for the first day or two after her daughter was born four months ago , she felt happy , but that quickly changed .
" then came the feeling that i could n't do things .
i was afraid .
i could n't do things for the child - for whatever reason , " she remembered .
" and then i started to withdraw , i could n't go out or talk with friends on the telephone and this increased very quickly to the point where i could n't be by myself anymore . "
anne-christin is n't the only one .
millions of german women also experience the baby blues .
in her case , she was one of 15 percent of women who develop postpartum depression .
she went to her local doctor , but he did n't take her seriously , so she sought professional psychiatric help .
the source of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decreased serotonin levels are believed to be a culprit of postpartum depression dr. julia sacher , from the max planck institute for human cognitive and brain sciences in leipzig , said it 's well-documented that a sharp drop in estrogen levels and a big change in environment contribute to the baby blues .
that 's why research in this area is incredibly important .
" what we do know is that those women who have severe symptoms of postpartum blues have a higher risk of experiencing a full-blown episode later on , " sacher said .
sacher and her colleagues published the results of their study in the peer-reviewed journal , archives of general psychiatry , earlier this summer .
they found that there is a neurological cause for the baby blues .
" we see an increase in monoamine oxidase a and this can lead to a loss of serotonin , and a loss of serotonin has been associated with low mood , " sacher explained .
feeling sad after childbirth is socially unacceptable other medical professionals , like dr. stephanie krueger , said that this new study may prompt obstetricians to keep an eye on a mother 's moods both before and after childbirth .
krueger is a professor of psychiatry at the charite in berlin , one of the largest university hospitals in europe .
she treated anne-christin for post-partum depression . krueger - who was n't part of the study - said most women who feel depressed after their child is born do n't seek necessary help , because it 's not socially acceptable to feel sad at this time .
" in our culture , women who have just given birth are supposed to be happy , and if they are not , then there 's something wrong with them and they are actually treated as some kind of an outlaw , " krueger said , adding , " in many cases they are being told : why are n't you happy ? "
krueger believes there needs to be more education and support for new mothers .
" families and gps -lsb- general practitioner -rsb- should not take these things lightly and not say , ' well yeah i understand you 've just given birth - everything will be fine ' , " krueger said .
" physicians and families should take any symptoms of depression seriously and go to someone who knows what they are doing , meaning a psychiatrist , for example . "
berlin mother anne-christin b. said she wished her doctors and other medical professionals had talked to her about the baby blues during the pregnancy .
" it would have been better if , even in a midwifery course , there was perhaps 30 minutes or an hour discussion in preparation for pregnancy , where it was explained , where you explain the symptoms and also tell people where they can call for help , " anne-christin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the dramatic life changes brought by babies contribute to depression dietary supplements could help while the baby blues usually goes away by itself after a couple of days , dr. sacher from the max planck institute said treating this temporary condition could be an important step in preventing postpartum depression .
she thinks the baby blues could be treated with medication or dietary supplements , which could counter the increase in the enzyme monoamine oxidase a. but not everyone agrees the baby blues can be prevented so easily .
lisa fehrenbach has been a midwife for 35 years .
she said feeling a bit down after childbirth is a natural thing because childbirth is a physically and emotionally life-changing experience .
many women go from working full-time to being at home with a crying baby - often by themselves .
" you had a completely independent life and you organized everything and you had everything under control and suddenly there 's a little baby , " said fehrenbach , " it clings to your body 24 hours and you have to care for it 24 hours and you can not do what you want , but you have to do what the baby wants . "
fehrenbach said even if women took dietary supplements to counter the enzyme increase , they still have to adjust to this new baby in their lives .
beyond making pregnant women aware of the physiological and psychological changes in their bodies , both sacher and krueger agree this problem needs to be discussed openly in order to fight the stigma of postpartum blues and depression .
" postpartum disorders are nothing the woman is responsible for .
they ca n't help it , " krueger said .
" it has biological reasons for the most part and it can be treated effectively and it should be treated effectively . "
sacher 's next step will be to test for the elevated enzyme in postpartum depression .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 25.08.2010 neurological cause found for the baby blues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postpartum depression affects 15 percent of new mothers the baby blues affects up to three-quarters of new mothers .
new research shows that there 's a physiological cause that could be treated with dietary supplements . after the relative calm of pregnancy , giving birth is a physically and emotionally draining experience .
but the changes do n't stop there .
a woman 's estrogen levels drop significantly , and she now has to care for a crying baby 24 hours a day .
given these circumstances it 's no wonder that up to 75 percent of new mothers around the world feel down for a few days after giving birth .
but new research has found there 's an additional neurological cause to the baby blues as well .
feelings of impotence anne-christin b. , who prefered not to use her last name due to the stigma of postpartum depression , is a 33-year-old mother from berlin .
for the first day or two after her daughter was born four months ago , she felt happy , but that quickly changed .
" then came the feeling that i could n't do things .
i was afraid .
i could n't do things for the child - for whatever reason , " she remembered .
" and then i started to withdraw , i could n't go out or talk with friends on the telephone and this increased very quickly to the point where i could n't be by myself anymore . "
anne-christin is n't the only one .
millions of german women also experience the baby blues .
in her case , she was one of 15 percent of women who develop postpartum depression .
she went to her local doctor , but he did n't take her seriously , so she sought professional psychiatric help .
the source of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decreased serotonin levels are believed to be a culprit of postpartum depression dr. julia sacher , from the max planck institute for human cognitive and brain sciences in leipzig , said it 's well-documented that a sharp drop in estrogen levels and a big change in environment contribute to the baby blues .
that 's why research in this area is incredibly important .
" what we do know is that those women who have severe symptoms of postpartum blues have a higher risk of experiencing a full-blown episode later on , " sacher said .
sacher and her colleagues published the results of their study in the peer-reviewed journal , archives of general psychiatry , earlier this summer .
they found that there is a neurological cause for the baby blues .
" we see an increase in monoamine oxidase a and this can lead to a loss of serotonin , and a loss of serotonin has been associated with low mood , " sacher explained .
feeling sad after childbirth is socially unacceptable other medical professionals , like dr. stephanie krueger , said that this new study may prompt obstetricians to keep an eye on a mother 's moods both before and after childbirth .
krueger is a professor of psychiatry at the charite in berlin , one of the largest university hospitals in europe .
she treated anne-christin for post-partum depression . krueger - who was n't part of the study - said most women who feel depressed after their child is born do n't seek necessary help , because it 's not socially acceptable to feel sad at this time .
" in our culture , women who have just given birth are supposed to be happy , and if they are not , then there 's something wrong with them and they are actually treated as some kind of an outlaw , " krueger said , adding , " in many cases they are being told : why are n't you happy ? "
krueger believes there needs to be more education and support for new mothers .
" families and gps -lsb- general practitioner -rsb- should not take these things lightly and not say , ' well yeah i understand you 've just given birth - everything will be fine ' , " krueger said .
" physicians and families should take any symptoms of depression seriously and go to someone who knows what they are doing , meaning a psychiatrist , for example . "
berlin mother anne-christin b. said she wished her doctors and other medical professionals had talked to her about the baby blues during the pregnancy .
" it would have been better if , even in a midwifery course , there was perhaps 30 minutes or an hour discussion in preparation for pregnancy , where it was explained , where you explain the symptoms and also tell people where they can call for help , " anne-christin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the dramatic life changes brought by babies contribute to depression dietary supplements could help while the baby blues usually goes away by itself after a couple of days , dr. sacher from the max planck institute said treating this temporary condition could be an important step in preventing postpartum depression .
she thinks the baby blues could be treated with medication or dietary supplements , which could counter the increase in the enzyme monoamine oxidase a. but not everyone agrees the baby blues can be prevented so easily .
lisa fehrenbach has been a midwife for 35 years .
she said feeling a bit down after childbirth is a natural thing because childbirth is a physically and emotionally life-changing experience .
many women go from working full-time to being at home with a crying baby - often by themselves .
" you had a completely independent life and you organized everything and you had everything under control and suddenly there 's a little baby , " said fehrenbach , " it clings to your body 24 hours and you have to care for it 24 hours and you can not do what you want , but you have to do what the baby wants . "
fehrenbach said even if women took dietary supplements to counter the enzyme increase , they still have to adjust to this new baby in their lives .
beyond making pregnant women aware of the physiological and psychological changes in their bodies , both sacher and krueger agree this problem needs to be discussed openly in order to fight the stigma of postpartum blues and depression .
" postpartum disorders are nothing the woman is responsible for .
they ca n't help it , " krueger said .
" it has biological reasons for the most part and it can be treated effectively and it should be treated effectively . "
sacher 's next step will be to test for the elevated enzyme in postpartum depression .

in her case , she was one of 15 percent of women who develop postpartum depression .
she went to her local doctor , but he did n't take her seriously , so she sought professional psychiatric help .
the source of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decreased serotonin levels are believed to be a culprit of postpartum depression dr. julia sacher , from the max planck institute for human cognitive and brain sciences in leipzig , said it 's well-documented that a sharp drop in estrogen levels and a big change in environment contribute to the baby blues .
that 's why research in this area is incredibly important .
" what we do know is that those women who have severe symptoms of postpartum blues have a higher risk of experiencing a full-blown episode later on , " sacher said .
sacher and her colleagues published the results of their study in the peer-reviewed journal , archives of general psychiatry , earlier this summer .
they found that there is a neurological cause for the baby blues .
" we see an increase in monoamine oxidase a and this can lead to a loss of serotonin , and a loss of serotonin has been associated with low mood , " sacher explained .
feeling sad after childbirth is socially unacceptable other medical professionals , like dr. stephanie krueger , said that this new study may prompt obstetricians to keep an eye on a mother 's moods both before and after childbirth .
krueger is a professor of psychiatry at the charite in berlin , one of the largest university hospitals in europe .
she treated anne-christin for post-partum depression . krueger - who was n't part of the study - said most women who feel depressed after their child is born do n't seek necessary help , because it 's not socially acceptable to feel sad at this time .
" in our culture , women who have just given birth are supposed to be happy , and if they are not , then there 's something wrong with them and they are actually treated as some kind of an outlaw , " krueger said , adding , " in many cases they are being told : why are n't you happy ? "
krueger believes there needs to be more education and support for new mothers .
" families and gps -lsb- general practitioner -rsb- should not take these things lightly and not say , ' well yeah i understand you 've just given birth - everything will be fine ' , " krueger said .
" physicians and families should take any symptoms of depression seriously and go to someone who knows what they are doing , meaning a psychiatrist , for example . "
berlin mother anne-christin b. said she wished her doctors and other medical professionals had talked to her about the baby blues during the pregnancy .
" it would have been better if , even in a midwifery course , there was perhaps 30 minutes or an hour discussion in preparation for pregnancy , where it was explained , where you explain the symptoms and also tell people where they can call for help , " anne-christin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the dramatic life changes brought by babies contribute to depression dietary supplements could help while the baby blues usually goes away by itself after a couple of days , dr. sacher from the max planck institute said treating this temporary condition could be an important step in preventing postpartum depression .
she thinks the baby blues could be treated with medication or dietary supplements , which could counter the increase in the enzyme monoamine oxidase a. but not everyone agrees the baby blues can be prevented so easily .
lisa fehrenbach has been a midwife for 35 years .
she said feeling a bit down after childbirth is a natural thing because childbirth is a physically and emotionally life-changing experience .
many women go from working full-time to being at home with a crying baby - often by themselves .
" you had a completely independent life and you organized everything and you had everything under control and suddenly there 's a little baby , " said fehrenbach , " it clings to your body 24 hours and you have to care for it 24 hours and you can not do what you want , but you have to do what the baby wants . "
fehrenbach said even if women took dietary supplements to counter the enzyme increase , they still have to adjust to this new baby in their lives .
beyond making pregnant women aware of the physiological and psychological changes in their bodies , both sacher and krueger agree this problem needs to be discussed openly in order to fight the stigma of postpartum blues and depression .
" postpartum disorders are nothing the woman is responsible for .
they ca n't help it , " krueger said .
" it has biological reasons for the most part and it can be treated effectively and it should be treated effectively . "
sacher 's next step will be to test for the elevated enzyme in postpartum depression .

one of the key issues is the country 's fledgling economic recovery .
but the party that is leading in the opinion polls wants to forge closer ties with russia . latvia is slowly emerging from recession with the help of money from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the european union .
the economic recovery is likely to play a central role in the parliamentary elections in october .
latvians will effectively be voting either to continue the government 's austerity program , or to refuse help from international donors , and instead increase the country 's dependency on russia .
october 2nd is decision time come election day , latvians will choose between 10 parties , or alliances , running for the 100-seat parliament , or saeima .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the latvian economy is recovering with help from the imf and the eu recent opinion polls show that the pro-kremlin " harmony centre " bloc is currently the most popular party .
it was formed in april this year , and polls indicate that around 20 percent of people intend to vote for it .
nellija locmele is the editor of the weekly news and current affairs magazine " ir . "
she is alarmed at the prospect of " harmony centre " winning the most seats in parliament : " harmony centre is … not a stable party , " locmele said .
" it 's new and has n't proved itself over the years , so we are not able to assess its policies and ideology in practice . "
locmele is concerned that there are politicians with very differing views on how to boost the economy within the party .
the country is at a crossroads latvia is at a crossroads in terms of its further economic and political development .
in order to keep the economic recovery on track , locmele feels the country needs to stick to its structural reforms .
but " harmony centre " wants latvia to have closer economic and political ties with russia .
political scientist janis ikstens says this is part of an increasing trend in latvia , but he warns that this could be dangerous : " what is striking is that this discourse has barely changed after one of the leaders of " harmony centre " openly threatened to stage bloodshed à la bishkek in riga if his political platform is not fulfilled .
this is i think absolutely unacceptable in a democratic society . "
current government is struggling despite the fact that the present government managed to halt the economic recession under prime minister valdia dombrovskis , his pro-western alliance " unity " is falling behind in the polls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current prime minister is struggling in opinion polls liga stafecka of delna , the latvian chapter of transparency international , says that voters do n't appreciate the gravity of the situation .
" people in latvia are perplexed and confused because many political unions or blocs have been established , " she said . " the voters find it very hard to distinguish one bloc from the other . "
the latest figures show that around 20 per cent of voters in latvia have n't still decided who they will vote for .
and about one fifth intend to ignore the general election altogether . the politicians have just five weeks left to change this .

and it 's not that far away , galactically speaking . scientists at the european southern observatory , or eso , announced the discovery of the richest known extrasolar planetary system on tuesday .
after six years of study , eso published its findings that at least five confirmed exoplanets , or extrasolar planets , are orbiting a star only 127 light years away from earth . the five exoplanets all have approximately the mass of neptune - between 13 and 25 times the mass of earth - but orbit much closer to their star , with orbital periods between six and 600 days -lrb- neptune takes 164.79 years to orbit the sun -rrb- . in addition to the five neptune-sized planets , eso astronomers have " tantalizing " evidence of two more exoplanets in the system .
one is saturn-sized , with an orbital period of 2,200 days and the other is the smallest known exoplanet with merely 1.4 earth masses and an orbital period of only 1.18 days . the sun-like star , which is called hd 10180 , is located in the southern constellation hydrus , and has been studied closely since its discovery with the harps spectrograph in la silla , chile .
the existence of the exoplanets was discovered through gravitational wobbles in the behavior of the star caused by the passage of the planets . bildunterschrift : the newly discovered system is only 127 light years from earth familiar traits observed using data from this new discovery as well as data from other planetary systems , the researchers found evidence of the titius-bode law that exists in our solar system : the distances of the planets from their star seem to follow a regular pattern . " this could be a signature of the formation process of these planetary systems , " team member michel mayor said in the eso press release . eso astronomer christophe lovis also acknowledged that this discovery highlights the changes in the field of exoplanet research . " we are now entering a new era in exoplanet research : the study of complex planetary systems and not just of individual planets , " lovis said .
" studies of planetary motions in the new system reveal complex gravitational interactions between the planets and give us insights into the long-term evolution of the system . " through further study of the system around hd 10180 , eso astronomers hope to learn more about planetary formation and about how the solar system was developed , as well as what its future may look like . author : stuart tiffen -lrb- ap / afp -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

third infant death heats debate about hygiene in german hospitals i have lived in germany for 15 years and during that time my family and i have been to a number of german hospitals , clinics and doctors for everything from back surgery to tonsil surgery , child birth , emergency room enrollments and the flu .
the care has been outstanding and the medical staffs have been top notch .
my biggest observation concerns hygiene .
i have had my blood taken by nurses who did not wear gloves .
i have seen doctors remove bandages with their bare hands .
this is not always the rule , but it has happened enough to make me acknowledge the systemic nature of this oversight .
outside of this , i have never had a major concern that any facility does not meet or exceed standards in the us -lrb- my only comparative standard -rrb- .
i would definitely agree , however , that all medical facilities , wherever they may be , should ratchet up any-and-all policies put in place to avoid a recurrence of the mainz tragedy . - scott , us i spent three months in germany late last year and my girlfriend at the time was a registered nurse .

third infant death heats debate about hygiene in german hospitals i have lived in germany for 15 years and during that time my family and i have been to a number of german hospitals , clinics and doctors for everything from back surgery to tonsil surgery , child birth , emergency room enrollments and the flu .
the care has been outstanding and the medical staffs have been top notch .
my biggest observation concerns hygiene .
i have had my blood taken by nurses who did not wear gloves .
i have seen doctors remove bandages with their bare hands .
this is not always the rule , but it has happened enough to make me acknowledge the systemic nature of this oversight .
outside of this , i have never had a major concern that any facility does not meet or exceed standards in the us -lrb- my only comparative standard -rrb- .
i would definitely agree , however , that all medical facilities , wherever they may be , should ratchet up any-and-all policies put in place to avoid a recurrence of the mainz tragedy . - scott , us i spent three months in germany late last year and my girlfriend at the time was a registered nurse .
i visited the hospital where she worked on numerous occasions and from an outsider 's point of view there were numerous signs informing everyone how important it was to maintain a clean and sterile working environment .
i noted how much cleaner the hospital was compared to those back in australia . - paul , australia wow , that 's sad .
i 'm glad germany is taking lax standards seriously though .
i think other countries should as well .
doctors get paid very well ; the least they can do is obey the hygiene standards that would make a computer chip manufacturer laugh .
medicine does n't have the highest hygiene standards , electronics does . - fergal via facebook it was long ago , but i went in with measles as an adult and was there for two weeks .
it was different from my experiences in the us and japan , but i was well treated , pampered by the orderlies -lrb- who pitied my bad vacation luck -rrb- , and left with ... a bill that was only a minor fraction of what it would have been in the us .
my only complaint was the bells from the church across the street from my room .
they were so … odd - a rather avant garde sound to them that was not particularly pleasant . - rickford via facebook two babies dead , five critical from bacteria at german hospital apparently , they did the test after giving the infusion to the babies .
daily lab tests should have been done before using the equipment .
how can such a simple requirement be missed ?
it is also an unlucky situation that the babies were already in intensive care with weaker immune systems than that of a healthy baby .
i send my deepest sympathy to the parents of unlucky babies . - nevres , turkey compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 25.08.2010 electronic devices speed up international development work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handheld devices are helping wfp workers in the field the world food program is using technology to speed efforts to learn where food aid is needed .
with handheld devices , the organization is able to get more accurate data and transmit it wirelessly back to headquarters . the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- in burundi is using handheld personal digital assistants , or pdas , to help keep tabs on the country 's food situation .
the technology has helped speed up the process of data collection and improve the accuracy of the organization 's food security surveys .
staff members organize fact-finding missions to gauge the country 's food supply .
when wfp arrived in burundi in 1968 , the organization was using pen and paper to conduct their food surveys .
now , wfp uses small palmtop computers , only slightly larger than normal cell phones and light enough to carry .
the devices have held up against the strong burundian heat and can last for days before needing a recharge .
" so you have the speed of gathering data , which means you can expand your survey area , and that makes it more valid by interviewing more people , " marc neilson said , a public information officer for wfp burundi .
the organization provides food assistance to more than 600,000 " food-insecure " burundians and some 90 million people around the world every year .
wfp plans to provide about 3.7 million tons of food in 73 countries to those unable to produce or obtain enough food for themselves and their families .
bildunterschrift : wfp provides food assistance to about 90 million people worldwide a welcome development in bihogo village in northern burundi , wfp program assistant gerard bisman uses his pda to conduct a 20-question survey with local residents about their food needs and living standards .
" it 's very interesting to use the device because it 's a lot faster , " he said .
" it used to take us about an hour-and-a-half to complete the entire interview with paper , and now it takes only half-an-hour . "
since he started using the device in march , bisman has eliminated prep time , paper shuffling and the need to decipher sloppy hand writing , which has reduced the margin of error .
the wfp staffer said residents also appreciate the technology , noting that survey-takers used to get " very , very tired " back when the questionnaire was conducted by hand .
bihogo resident elisabeth tembaidai had never been interviewed by wfp before .
the 56-year-old primary school teacher said it is the first time she has seen a pda - and the device shows the country is making progress .
a few years ago , tembaidai received food aid from wfp during a drought .
she said she hopes wfp will provide her with food this year , too .
" well , we will probably need some help in regards to food this year because the water that used to come from up north does n't come anymore , " she said .
" it 's the dry season also , and we are short of food at the moment , and we are asking wfp for some food now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pdas allow wfp to transmit data wirelessly high-speed , wireless transmission information is currently collected on a memory card and sent to the main wfp office in bujumbura , but soon wfp field staff will be able to transmit their findings wirelessly .
burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world , with annual per capita income averaging about $ 300 , or 236 euros .
in 2006 , the country emerged from a 13-year civil war ; one rebel group laid down its arms just last year .
now , however , the country has a new high-speed 3g wireless network .
by sending data wirelessly to the central database for analysis , wfp staff can provide up-to-date information from around the country , helping streamline planning on food shipments . the pda 's price tag is about $ 200 , or 158 euros - and providing two devices in each of burundi 's 15 provinces costs about $ 6,000 , or 4728 euros , not including training costs .
but neilson said the devices are a good investment : " any time you can save doing that , it means those most at risk - the poor - are getting the assistance faster and more effectively , and you 're not perhaps going in an area where you really should n't be , " he said .
" wfp needs to be in the areas that are most at risk .
that 's the bottom line . "
bildunterschrift : scratch card ' e-vouchers ' allow beneficiaries more options to receive food aid scratch card ' e-vouchers ' wfp has put the pdas to use elsewhere in africa , including the congo and mozambique .
in zambia , wfp distributes " e-voucher " scratch cards to improve the food voucher program .
instead of lining up for food aid , people can now choose when and where to pick up their monthly assistance .
the scratch card codes are entered into a mobile phone upon delivery of the food .
wfp said the program reduces transaction costs and increases the " efficiency and effectiveness " of food distribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wfp 's scratch card program reduces the transaction costs of food distribution in syria , 130,000 iraqi refugees receiving food aid are able to get the wfp 's " virtual vouchers " via text message .
the electronic vouchers can be exchanged for items not normally included in conventional aid baskets , such as rice , wheat flour , lentils , chickpeas , oil and canned fish , as well as cheese and eggs .
other organizations are also taking advantage of the new technologies in the field .
in the west african countries of togo and niger , the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- has worked with pdas equipped with gps capabilities to help prevent malaria .
a team of scientists used the electronic devices to collect high-quality data on the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets . in the asia-pacific region , un children 's fund staff use pda questionnaires to provide rapid assessments in emergency situations .
local statistical data on livelihood , poverty , health and nutrition can help inform situation reports , as well as high-level government officials .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 25.08.2010 electronic devices speed up international development work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handheld devices are helping wfp workers in the field the world food program is using technology to speed efforts to learn where food aid is needed .
with handheld devices , the organization is able to get more accurate data and transmit it wirelessly back to headquarters . the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- in burundi is using handheld personal digital assistants , or pdas , to help keep tabs on the country 's food situation .
the technology has helped speed up the process of data collection and improve the accuracy of the organization 's food security surveys .
staff members organize fact-finding missions to gauge the country 's food supply .
when wfp arrived in burundi in 1968 , the organization was using pen and paper to conduct their food surveys .
now , wfp uses small palmtop computers , only slightly larger than normal cell phones and light enough to carry .
the devices have held up against the strong burundian heat and can last for days before needing a recharge .
" so you have the speed of gathering data , which means you can expand your survey area , and that makes it more valid by interviewing more people , " marc neilson said , a public information officer for wfp burundi .
the organization provides food assistance to more than 600,000 " food-insecure " burundians and some 90 million people around the world every year .
wfp plans to provide about 3.7 million tons of food in 73 countries to those unable to produce or obtain enough food for themselves and their families .
bildunterschrift : wfp provides food assistance to about 90 million people worldwide a welcome development in bihogo village in northern burundi , wfp program assistant gerard bisman uses his pda to conduct a 20-question survey with local residents about their food needs and living standards .
" it 's very interesting to use the device because it 's a lot faster , " he said .
" it used to take us about an hour-and-a-half to complete the entire interview with paper , and now it takes only half-an-hour . "
since he started using the device in march , bisman has eliminated prep time , paper shuffling and the need to decipher sloppy hand writing , which has reduced the margin of error .
the wfp staffer said residents also appreciate the technology , noting that survey-takers used to get " very , very tired " back when the questionnaire was conducted by hand .
bihogo resident elisabeth tembaidai had never been interviewed by wfp before .
the 56-year-old primary school teacher said it is the first time she has seen a pda - and the device shows the country is making progress .
a few years ago , tembaidai received food aid from wfp during a drought .
she said she hopes wfp will provide her with food this year , too .
" well , we will probably need some help in regards to food this year because the water that used to come from up north does n't come anymore , " she said .
" it 's the dry season also , and we are short of food at the moment , and we are asking wfp for some food now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pdas allow wfp to transmit data wirelessly high-speed , wireless transmission information is currently collected on a memory card and sent to the main wfp office in bujumbura , but soon wfp field staff will be able to transmit their findings wirelessly .
burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world , with annual per capita income averaging about $ 300 , or 236 euros .
in 2006 , the country emerged from a 13-year civil war ; one rebel group laid down its arms just last year .
now , however , the country has a new high-speed 3g wireless network .
by sending data wirelessly to the central database for analysis , wfp staff can provide up-to-date information from around the country , helping streamline planning on food shipments . the pda 's price tag is about $ 200 , or 158 euros - and providing two devices in each of burundi 's 15 provinces costs about $ 6,000 , or 4728 euros , not including training costs .
but neilson said the devices are a good investment : " any time you can save doing that , it means those most at risk - the poor - are getting the assistance faster and more effectively , and you 're not perhaps going in an area where you really should n't be , " he said .
" wfp needs to be in the areas that are most at risk .
that 's the bottom line . "
bildunterschrift : scratch card ' e-vouchers ' allow beneficiaries more options to receive food aid scratch card ' e-vouchers ' wfp has put the pdas to use elsewhere in africa , including the congo and mozambique .
in zambia , wfp distributes " e-voucher " scratch cards to improve the food voucher program .
instead of lining up for food aid , people can now choose when and where to pick up their monthly assistance .
the scratch card codes are entered into a mobile phone upon delivery of the food .
wfp said the program reduces transaction costs and increases the " efficiency and effectiveness " of food distribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wfp 's scratch card program reduces the transaction costs of food distribution in syria , 130,000 iraqi refugees receiving food aid are able to get the wfp 's " virtual vouchers " via text message .
the electronic vouchers can be exchanged for items not normally included in conventional aid baskets , such as rice , wheat flour , lentils , chickpeas , oil and canned fish , as well as cheese and eggs .
other organizations are also taking advantage of the new technologies in the field .
in the west african countries of togo and niger , the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- has worked with pdas equipped with gps capabilities to help prevent malaria .
a team of scientists used the electronic devices to collect high-quality data on the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets . in the asia-pacific region , un children 's fund staff use pda questionnaires to provide rapid assessments in emergency situations .
local statistical data on livelihood , poverty , health and nutrition can help inform situation reports , as well as high-level government officials .

networking services are available to help dancers find partners and travel agencies offer special holiday packages for tango fans . not as easy as it looks despite all the enthusiasm , going from the beginners ' class to being able to glide across the dance floor like a professional is quite a lot of work and takes more than a little talent . " the tango is one of the most difficult dances in the world , " norma raimondi said , a teacher at the don tango club in cologne .
" of course it depends on each person 's talent , but it generally takes a good three years to be able to dance spontaneously , without having to think about each step in advance . " " at the beginning i was just curious , but now it 's like a drug , i have to dance more and more , " said johanna , one of raimondi 's dance student 's , who preferred not to give her last name .

" tango reflects all elements of life , " said 80-year-old luis stazo , a bandoneon player who performed for decades all over the globe with the legendary sexteto mayor .
" it tells how the man betrays the woman and the woman the man .
tango knows horse races , gambling - everything in life .
that 's why tango is much more than a dance . " stazo explained that tango was originally played only with guitar and flute .
later , the bandoneon was added .
the bandoneon - which looks somewhat like an accordion - was invented in the mid-19th century by heinrich band and was initially intended for religious and popular music . " we bandoneon players can thank germany , because the instrument that is so typical for tango and is so important to its soul was invented there , " said stazo . bildunterschrift : a hundred years ago , tango was deamed too sexy for high society frowned upon by the elite corazon , amor y sangre - heart , love and blood - was the immigrants ' motto and describes the soul of the dance .

the roaring twenties ushered in a comeback and in the 21st century it has experienced a revival . " i think that , with tango , many people are looking for a closeness to other people that we are missing in today 's society , " said daniel perusin , an argentinean tango teacher in cologne .
being able to embrace and be embraced is part of what makes tango so fascinating , he added . adjusting to gender roles getting to the point of being able to enjoy the embrace is the first hurdle . " it took me a while to get used to the fact that the man leads , " said dance student johanna .
" as an emancipated european woman , i often tend to want to take the reins . " perusin , on the other hand , said that german men tend to be passive and hesitant and have to learn to take the lead : " they probably think that if they take the active role the women will get upset . " nevertheless , whatever may be holding germans back from expressing themselves fully in this type of dance is still not stopping many of them from giving it a try . author : suzanne cords -lrb- ew / kjb -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

being able to embrace and be embraced is part of what makes tango so fascinating , he added . adjusting to gender roles getting to the point of being able to enjoy the embrace is the first hurdle . " it took me a while to get used to the fact that the man leads , " said dance student johanna .
" as an emancipated european woman , i often tend to want to take the reins . " perusin , on the other hand , said that german men tend to be passive and hesitant and have to learn to take the lead : " they probably think that if they take the active role the women will get upset . " nevertheless , whatever may be holding germans back from expressing themselves fully in this type of dance is still not stopping many of them from giving it a try . author : suzanne cords -lrb- ew / kjb -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i visited the hospital where she worked on numerous occasions and from an outsider 's point of view there were numerous signs informing everyone how important it was to maintain a clean and sterile working environment .
i noted how much cleaner the hospital was compared to those back in australia . - paul , australia wow , that 's sad .
i 'm glad germany is taking lax standards seriously though .
i think other countries should as well .
doctors get paid very well ; the least they can do is obey the hygiene standards that would make a computer chip manufacturer laugh .
medicine does n't have the highest hygiene standards , electronics does . - fergal via facebook it was long ago , but i went in with measles as an adult and was there for two weeks .
it was different from my experiences in the us and japan , but i was well treated , pampered by the orderlies -lrb- who pitied my bad vacation luck -rrb- , and left with ... a bill that was only a minor fraction of what it would have been in the us .
my only complaint was the bells from the church across the street from my room .
they were so … odd - a rather avant garde sound to them that was not particularly pleasant . - rickford via facebook two babies dead , five critical from bacteria at german hospital apparently , they did the test after giving the infusion to the babies .
daily lab tests should have been done before using the equipment .
how can such a simple requirement be missed ?
it is also an unlucky situation that the babies were already in intensive care with weaker immune systems than that of a healthy baby .
i send my deepest sympathy to the parents of unlucky babies . - nevres , turkey compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

paris is standing by on the policy , rejecting criticism . the european union 's top justice official expressed concern on wednesday over france 's decision to repatriate roma people to romania and bulgaria , but stopped short of directly criticising the expulsions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reding will report her findings next week " it is clear that those who break the law need to face consequences , " commissioner viviane reding said in a statement .
" it is equally clear that nobody should face expulsion just for being roma . "
reding said her office was analyzing the situation in france to determine whether the repatriation complied with eu laws on free movement of people .
she also said she regretted " that some of the rhetoric that has been used in some member states in the past weeks has been openly discriminatory and inflammatory . "
the commission 's findings will be released next week .
transitional agreement applies to roma france has faced international criticism since it began dismantling roma camps and sending ethnic roma found to be living in france illegally back to bulgaria and romania in exchange for a 300 euro -lrb- 385 dollar -rrb- payout .
as part of a transitional agreement for bulgaria and romania , which both joined the eu in 2007 , romanians and bulgarians can travel freely to france but can also be expelled after three months if they can not show they have the financial means to stay in the country .

" none of these issues is easy and none of the solutions can be expected to escape criticism or secure unanimous approval , " the president said , in remarks passed on to the press by government spokesman luc chatel .
when he announced the repatriation operation in late july , sarkozy said the camps were " sources of illegal trafficking , of profoundly shocking living standards , of exploitation of children for begging , of prostitution and of crime . "
asylum talks coming up on wedndesday , french interior minister brice hortefeux defended the operation .
he told rtl radio that 117 camps had so far been dismantled , and 630 people sent home , with 300 more explusions expected by the end of the month .

the talks start in paris on september 6 .

this year , he took the podium as conductor of wagner 's opera " lohengrin " at the bayreuth festival . andris nelsons is a shooting star in the classical music scene .
as the youngest conductor in the history of the bayreuth festival , the 31-year-old latvian has reaped praise from critics across germany and beyond .
this fall , he will see premieres with two of the world 's major orchestras - the berlin and the vienna philharmonics .
deutsche welle spoke with the conductor about his bayreuth debut . deutsche welle : how do you feel after your first performance this year in bayreuth ? andris nelsons : i 'm very excited because it 's such a special place and atmosphere .
it 's a great pleasure to be here ; everybody 's motivation is just to make the best possible music . but it 's also quite difficult for a conductor in this orchestra pit .
achieving the right balance between the choir , the soloists and the orchestra is hard - especially when conducting pieces that were n't written for bayreuth . have you always been steeped in wager , or what path led you to his work ? wagner was actually one of the first composers i got to know - the first opera i saw was " tannhaeuser " when i was five years old .
ever since then , i 've been listening to and analyzing his operas and been in love with his music . i think starting with wagner also opened my eyes for other composers .
approaching the philosophical and emotional components of wagner 's music helped me understand many other composers , including beethoven .
since wagner was the first i was introduced to , i viewed every other composer from a different perspective . bildunterschrift : the young conductor already has an impressive list of engagements it 's been said that you 're able to have a kind of empathy with each member of an orchestra .
how would you describe the process of bringing together so many different elements when conducting ? that process is what 's magical about being a conductor .
you 're dealing with orchestras and choirs composed of individuals who are each wonderful musicians and who each have their own ideas about how the music should be . everybody has an ego - in a good sense .
you need an artistic ego to perform music , but you have to focus those egos toward one result . when the members of an orchestra forget about the global result , it 's dangerous , and that 's a very real possibility in opera .
it should be like a family , though - everyone has a very important place and part in the family .
if some member of the family thinks someone else is more important , then it does n't work .
that seems to relate to wagner 's intentions with bayreuth - to have people focus on the music and not on themselves .
have you found the bayreuth setting encourages that artistic ideal ? i agree that there is something special about this place both practically and theoretically .
wagner really is the only star here .
for one thing , the audience ca n't even see the conductor in the orchestra pit , so there 's no possibility of the conductor stealing the show . that means the music starts without applause - it starts from scratch in a way .
everything is set up to be just about music . there 's a mystical quality to being here , which i experienced three years ago in the audience when i was invited to conduct " lohengrin . "
everyone comes to this mountain , and everyone is concentrated on the music .
that 's particular to bayreuth , but i wish it were that way everywhere - that the composer would be the one put on the podium . bildunterschrift : nelsons conducted a new production of " lohengrin " by hans neuenfels that was heavy on rodents where do think " lohengrin " stands in wagner 's oeuvre - is it the point where wagner comes into his own as a composer ? i think one notices that " lohengrin " is still an early opera in the oeuvre .
but wagner is so clever , and you can feel from the work that he very consciously knows how to use his powers and to manipulate people in writing music .
i think act two of " lohengrin " contains one of wagner 's greatest masterpieces .
there , he creates the atmosphere so dramatically , and you think , " everything can be so beautiful in life , if you just make the right decisions . "
but then , you also know , " no , no , the ending wo n't be nice . " in act two of the opera , you know that the future could be so great , but wagner knows it will never happen and shows that in the music .

this year , he took the podium as conductor of wagner 's opera " lohengrin " at the bayreuth festival . andris nelsons is a shooting star in the classical music scene .
as the youngest conductor in the history of the bayreuth festival , the 31-year-old latvian has reaped praise from critics across germany and beyond .
this fall , he will see premieres with two of the world 's major orchestras - the berlin and the vienna philharmonics .
deutsche welle spoke with the conductor about his bayreuth debut . deutsche welle : how do you feel after your first performance this year in bayreuth ? andris nelsons : i 'm very excited because it 's such a special place and atmosphere .
it 's a great pleasure to be here ; everybody 's motivation is just to make the best possible music . but it 's also quite difficult for a conductor in this orchestra pit .
achieving the right balance between the choir , the soloists and the orchestra is hard - especially when conducting pieces that were n't written for bayreuth . have you always been steeped in wager , or what path led you to his work ? wagner was actually one of the first composers i got to know - the first opera i saw was " tannhaeuser " when i was five years old .
ever since then , i 've been listening to and analyzing his operas and been in love with his music . i think starting with wagner also opened my eyes for other composers .
approaching the philosophical and emotional components of wagner 's music helped me understand many other composers , including beethoven .
since wagner was the first i was introduced to , i viewed every other composer from a different perspective . bildunterschrift : the young conductor already has an impressive list of engagements it 's been said that you 're able to have a kind of empathy with each member of an orchestra .
how would you describe the process of bringing together so many different elements when conducting ? that process is what 's magical about being a conductor .
you 're dealing with orchestras and choirs composed of individuals who are each wonderful musicians and who each have their own ideas about how the music should be . everybody has an ego - in a good sense .
you need an artistic ego to perform music , but you have to focus those egos toward one result . when the members of an orchestra forget about the global result , it 's dangerous , and that 's a very real possibility in opera .
it should be like a family , though - everyone has a very important place and part in the family .
if some member of the family thinks someone else is more important , then it does n't work .
that seems to relate to wagner 's intentions with bayreuth - to have people focus on the music and not on themselves .
have you found the bayreuth setting encourages that artistic ideal ? i agree that there is something special about this place both practically and theoretically .
wagner really is the only star here .
for one thing , the audience ca n't even see the conductor in the orchestra pit , so there 's no possibility of the conductor stealing the show . that means the music starts without applause - it starts from scratch in a way .
everything is set up to be just about music . there 's a mystical quality to being here , which i experienced three years ago in the audience when i was invited to conduct " lohengrin . "
everyone comes to this mountain , and everyone is concentrated on the music .
that 's particular to bayreuth , but i wish it were that way everywhere - that the composer would be the one put on the podium . bildunterschrift : nelsons conducted a new production of " lohengrin " by hans neuenfels that was heavy on rodents where do think " lohengrin " stands in wagner 's oeuvre - is it the point where wagner comes into his own as a composer ? i think one notices that " lohengrin " is still an early opera in the oeuvre .
but wagner is so clever , and you can feel from the work that he very consciously knows how to use his powers and to manipulate people in writing music .
i think act two of " lohengrin " contains one of wagner 's greatest masterpieces .
there , he creates the atmosphere so dramatically , and you think , " everything can be so beautiful in life , if you just make the right decisions . "
but then , you also know , " no , no , the ending wo n't be nice . " in act two of the opera , you know that the future could be so great , but wagner knows it will never happen and shows that in the music .

and it 's not that far away , galactically speaking . scientists at the european southern observatory , or eso , announced the discovery of the richest known extrasolar planetary system on tuesday .
after six years of study , eso published its findings that at least five confirmed exoplanets , or extrasolar planets , are orbiting a star only 127 light years away from earth . the five exoplanets all have approximately the mass of neptune - between 13 and 25 times the mass of earth - but orbit much closer to their star , with orbital periods between six and 600 days -lrb- neptune takes 164.79 years to orbit the sun -rrb- . in addition to the five neptune-sized planets , eso astronomers have " tantalizing " evidence of two more exoplanets in the system .
one is saturn-sized , with an orbital period of 2,200 days and the other is the smallest known exoplanet with merely 1.4 earth masses and an orbital period of only 1.18 days . the sun-like star , which is called hd 10180 , is located in the southern constellation hydrus , and has been studied closely since its discovery with the harps spectrograph in la silla , chile .

" we are now entering a new era in exoplanet research : the study of complex planetary systems and not just of individual planets , " lovis said .
" studies of planetary motions in the new system reveal complex gravitational interactions between the planets and give us insights into the long-term evolution of the system .

and it 's not that far away , galactically speaking . scientists at the european southern observatory , or eso , announced the discovery of the richest known extrasolar planetary system on tuesday .
after six years of study , eso published its findings that at least five confirmed exoplanets , or extrasolar planets , are orbiting a star only 127 light years away from earth . the five exoplanets all have approximately the mass of neptune - between 13 and 25 times the mass of earth - but orbit much closer to their star , with orbital periods between six and 600 days -lrb- neptune takes 164.79 years to orbit the sun -rrb- . in addition to the five neptune-sized planets , eso astronomers have " tantalizing " evidence of two more exoplanets in the system .
one is saturn-sized , with an orbital period of 2,200 days and the other is the smallest known exoplanet with merely 1.4 earth masses and an orbital period of only 1.18 days . the sun-like star , which is called hd 10180 , is located in the southern constellation hydrus , and has been studied closely since its discovery with the harps spectrograph in la silla , chile .
the existence of the exoplanets was discovered through gravitational wobbles in the behavior of the star caused by the passage of the planets . bildunterschrift : the newly discovered system is only 127 light years from earth familiar traits observed using data from this new discovery as well as data from other planetary systems , the researchers found evidence of the titius-bode law that exists in our solar system : the distances of the planets from their star seem to follow a regular pattern . " this could be a signature of the formation process of these planetary systems , " team member michel mayor said in the eso press release . eso astronomer christophe lovis also acknowledged that this discovery highlights the changes in the field of exoplanet research . " we are now entering a new era in exoplanet research : the study of complex planetary systems and not just of individual planets , " lovis said .
" studies of planetary motions in the new system reveal complex gravitational interactions between the planets and give us insights into the long-term evolution of the system . " through further study of the system around hd 10180 , eso astronomers hope to learn more about planetary formation and about how the solar system was developed , as well as what its future may look like . author : stuart tiffen -lrb- ap / afp -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 25.08.2010 germany weighs bill to outlaw spying on employees großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new law will prohibit clandestine surveillance at work a draft bill in germany would crack down on employers who use hidden cameras or social networking to spy on employees .
germany would become the first country to forbid facebook content to be used for hiring purposes . undercover spies and hidden video cameras - it sounds like the stuff of a james bond movie .
but for some german employees , it 's just another day at work . in recent years , a series of workplace spying scandals have come to light , several involving high-profile companies like the telecommunications firm deutsche telekom , the discount retailer lidl and the national railway operator deutsche bahn . " until now , it has not been regulated , in what capacity and under what conditions an employer can use video surveillance to collect information about his employees , " parliamentarian christian ahrendt of the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- told deutsche welle . in response to the scandals , the governing coalition has proposed a draft law on wednesday that would better regulate workplace privacy .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said the new law would be beneficial for both parties . " it 's a balanced compromise among the various interests and will foster more trust in the workplace between employer and employee , " de maiziere told reporters . no more secret cameras bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security cameras will still be allowed , but not hidden ones a central point of the proposal is that employers can no longer use video surveillance on workers without their knowledge . " there has to be a justifiable reason on the employer 's behalf .
and if video surveillance is going on , there has to be a sign informing people about it , " ahrendt told deutsche welle . retailers in germany have been known to use hidden cameras to catch employees they believe are stealing .
according to the new bill , video surveillance will be forbidden in private areas such as changing rooms , break rooms and bathrooms . however , employers will still be permitted to use cameras as anti-shoplifting measures in public areas , such as around the cash register or the entrance to a supermarket . critics of the bill say secret video surveillance is an important tool to protect against theft and corruption by employees .
the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- said the new bill prevents the fight against corruption and criminality in the workplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spying on employees via facebook will be forbidden ' friending ' the boss the law also protects employees ' online privacy on social networking sites such as facebook and myspace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 25.08.2010 germany weighs bill to outlaw spying on employees großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new law will prohibit clandestine surveillance at work a draft bill in germany would crack down on employers who use hidden cameras or social networking to spy on employees .
germany would become the first country to forbid facebook content to be used for hiring purposes . undercover spies and hidden video cameras - it sounds like the stuff of a james bond movie .
but for some german employees , it 's just another day at work . in recent years , a series of workplace spying scandals have come to light , several involving high-profile companies like the telecommunications firm deutsche telekom , the discount retailer lidl and the national railway operator deutsche bahn . " until now , it has not been regulated , in what capacity and under what conditions an employer can use video surveillance to collect information about his employees , " parliamentarian christian ahrendt of the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- told deutsche welle . in response to the scandals , the governing coalition has proposed a draft law on wednesday that would better regulate workplace privacy .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said the new law would be beneficial for both parties . " it 's a balanced compromise among the various interests and will foster more trust in the workplace between employer and employee , " de maiziere told reporters . no more secret cameras bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security cameras will still be allowed , but not hidden ones a central point of the proposal is that employers can no longer use video surveillance on workers without their knowledge . " there has to be a justifiable reason on the employer 's behalf .
and if video surveillance is going on , there has to be a sign informing people about it , " ahrendt told deutsche welle . retailers in germany have been known to use hidden cameras to catch employees they believe are stealing .
according to the new bill , video surveillance will be forbidden in private areas such as changing rooms , break rooms and bathrooms . however , employers will still be permitted to use cameras as anti-shoplifting measures in public areas , such as around the cash register or the entrance to a supermarket . critics of the bill say secret video surveillance is an important tool to protect against theft and corruption by employees .
the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- said the new bill prevents the fight against corruption and criminality in the workplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spying on employees via facebook will be forbidden ' friending ' the boss the law also protects employees ' online privacy on social networking sites such as facebook and myspace .
at a press conference in berlin , de maiziere emphasized employers would still be permitted to gather information about employees via publicly accessible sources , such as search engines . " what an employer ca n't do is befriend someone on a closed social network and then use the ' friend ' status to access private data and then use that information against the applicant , " de maiziere said . if the bill is passed into law , germany will become the first country to slap legal restrictions on the use of personal information in private social networking sites . the law still has to go before parliament for debate and a final vote .

our readers shared some of their own observations . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
third infant death heats debate about hygiene in german hospitals i have lived in germany for 15 years and during that time my family and i have been to a number of german hospitals , clinics and doctors for everything from back surgery to tonsil surgery , child birth , emergency room enrollments and the flu .
the care has been outstanding and the medical staffs have been top notch .
my biggest observation concerns hygiene .
i have had my blood taken by nurses who did not wear gloves .
i have seen doctors remove bandages with their bare hands .
this is not always the rule , but it has happened enough to make me acknowledge the systemic nature of this oversight .
outside of this , i have never had a major concern that any facility does not meet or exceed standards in the us -lrb- my only comparative standard -rrb- .
i would definitely agree , however , that all medical facilities , wherever they may be , should ratchet up any-and-all policies put in place to avoid a recurrence of the mainz tragedy . - scott , us i spent three months in germany late last year and my girlfriend at the time was a registered nurse .
i visited the hospital where she worked on numerous occasions and from an outsider 's point of view there were numerous signs informing everyone how important it was to maintain a clean and sterile working environment .
i noted how much cleaner the hospital was compared to those back in australia . - paul , australia wow , that 's sad .
i 'm glad germany is taking lax standards seriously though .
i think other countries should as well .
doctors get paid very well ; the least they can do is obey the hygiene standards that would make a computer chip manufacturer laugh .
medicine does n't have the highest hygiene standards , electronics does . - fergal via facebook it was long ago , but i went in with measles as an adult and was there for two weeks .
it was different from my experiences in the us and japan , but i was well treated , pampered by the orderlies -lrb- who pitied my bad vacation luck -rrb- , and left with ... a bill that was only a minor fraction of what it would have been in the us .
my only complaint was the bells from the church across the street from my room .
they were so … odd - a rather avant garde sound to them that was not particularly pleasant . - rickford via facebook two babies dead , five critical from bacteria at german hospital apparently , they did the test after giving the infusion to the babies .
daily lab tests should have been done before using the equipment .
how can such a simple requirement be missed ?
it is also an unlucky situation that the babies were already in intensive care with weaker immune systems than that of a healthy baby .
i send my deepest sympathy to the parents of unlucky babies . - nevres , turkey compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year , he took the podium as conductor of wagner 's opera " lohengrin " at the bayreuth festival . andris nelsons is a shooting star in the classical music scene .
as the youngest conductor in the history of the bayreuth festival , the 31-year-old latvian has reaped praise from critics across germany and beyond .
this fall , he will see premieres with two of the world 's major orchestras - the berlin and the vienna philharmonics .
deutsche welle spoke with the conductor about his bayreuth debut . deutsche welle : how do you feel after your first performance this year in bayreuth ? andris nelsons : i 'm very excited because it 's such a special place and atmosphere .
it 's a great pleasure to be here ; everybody 's motivation is just to make the best possible music . but it 's also quite difficult for a conductor in this orchestra pit .
achieving the right balance between the choir , the soloists and the orchestra is hard - especially when conducting pieces that were n't written for bayreuth . have you always been steeped in wager , or what path led you to his work ? wagner was actually one of the first composers i got to know - the first opera i saw was " tannhaeuser " when i was five years old .
ever since then , i 've been listening to and analyzing his operas and been in love with his music . i think starting with wagner also opened my eyes for other composers .
approaching the philosophical and emotional components of wagner 's music helped me understand many other composers , including beethoven .
since wagner was the first i was introduced to , i viewed every other composer from a different perspective . bildunterschrift : the young conductor already has an impressive list of engagements it 's been said that you 're able to have a kind of empathy with each member of an orchestra .
how would you describe the process of bringing together so many different elements when conducting ? that process is what 's magical about being a conductor .
you 're dealing with orchestras and choirs composed of individuals who are each wonderful musicians and who each have their own ideas about how the music should be . everybody has an ego - in a good sense .
you need an artistic ego to perform music , but you have to focus those egos toward one result . when the members of an orchestra forget about the global result , it 's dangerous , and that 's a very real possibility in opera .
it should be like a family , though - everyone has a very important place and part in the family .
if some member of the family thinks someone else is more important , then it does n't work .
that seems to relate to wagner 's intentions with bayreuth - to have people focus on the music and not on themselves .
have you found the bayreuth setting encourages that artistic ideal ? i agree that there is something special about this place both practically and theoretically .
wagner really is the only star here .
for one thing , the audience ca n't even see the conductor in the orchestra pit , so there 's no possibility of the conductor stealing the show . that means the music starts without applause - it starts from scratch in a way .
everything is set up to be just about music . there 's a mystical quality to being here , which i experienced three years ago in the audience when i was invited to conduct " lohengrin . "
everyone comes to this mountain , and everyone is concentrated on the music .
that 's particular to bayreuth , but i wish it were that way everywhere - that the composer would be the one put on the podium . bildunterschrift : nelsons conducted a new production of " lohengrin " by hans neuenfels that was heavy on rodents where do think " lohengrin " stands in wagner 's oeuvre - is it the point where wagner comes into his own as a composer ? i think one notices that " lohengrin " is still an early opera in the oeuvre .
but wagner is so clever , and you can feel from the work that he very consciously knows how to use his powers and to manipulate people in writing music .
i think act two of " lohengrin " contains one of wagner 's greatest masterpieces .
there , he creates the atmosphere so dramatically , and you think , " everything can be so beautiful in life , if you just make the right decisions . "
but then , you also know , " no , no , the ending wo n't be nice . " in act two of the opera , you know that the future could be so great , but wagner knows it will never happen and shows that in the music .
it 's so sad and so beautiful at the same time . interview : rick fulker -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year , he took the podium as conductor of wagner 's opera " lohengrin " at the bayreuth festival . andris nelsons is a shooting star in the classical music scene .
as the youngest conductor in the history of the bayreuth festival , the 31-year-old latvian has reaped praise from critics across germany and beyond .
this fall , he will see premieres with two of the world 's major orchestras - the berlin and the vienna philharmonics .
deutsche welle spoke with the conductor about his bayreuth debut . deutsche welle : how do you feel after your first performance this year in bayreuth ? andris nelsons : i 'm very excited because it 's such a special place and atmosphere .
it 's a great pleasure to be here ; everybody 's motivation is just to make the best possible music . but it 's also quite difficult for a conductor in this orchestra pit .
achieving the right balance between the choir , the soloists and the orchestra is hard - especially when conducting pieces that were n't written for bayreuth . have you always been steeped in wager , or what path led you to his work ? wagner was actually one of the first composers i got to know - the first opera i saw was " tannhaeuser " when i was five years old .
ever since then , i 've been listening to and analyzing his operas and been in love with his music . i think starting with wagner also opened my eyes for other composers .
approaching the philosophical and emotional components of wagner 's music helped me understand many other composers , including beethoven .
since wagner was the first i was introduced to , i viewed every other composer from a different perspective . bildunterschrift : the young conductor already has an impressive list of engagements it 's been said that you 're able to have a kind of empathy with each member of an orchestra .
how would you describe the process of bringing together so many different elements when conducting ? that process is what 's magical about being a conductor .
you 're dealing with orchestras and choirs composed of individuals who are each wonderful musicians and who each have their own ideas about how the music should be . everybody has an ego - in a good sense .
you need an artistic ego to perform music , but you have to focus those egos toward one result . when the members of an orchestra forget about the global result , it 's dangerous , and that 's a very real possibility in opera .
it should be like a family , though - everyone has a very important place and part in the family .
if some member of the family thinks someone else is more important , then it does n't work .
that seems to relate to wagner 's intentions with bayreuth - to have people focus on the music and not on themselves .
have you found the bayreuth setting encourages that artistic ideal ? i agree that there is something special about this place both practically and theoretically .
wagner really is the only star here .
for one thing , the audience ca n't even see the conductor in the orchestra pit , so there 's no possibility of the conductor stealing the show . that means the music starts without applause - it starts from scratch in a way .
everything is set up to be just about music . there 's a mystical quality to being here , which i experienced three years ago in the audience when i was invited to conduct " lohengrin . "
everyone comes to this mountain , and everyone is concentrated on the music .
that 's particular to bayreuth , but i wish it were that way everywhere - that the composer would be the one put on the podium . bildunterschrift : nelsons conducted a new production of " lohengrin " by hans neuenfels that was heavy on rodents where do think " lohengrin " stands in wagner 's oeuvre - is it the point where wagner comes into his own as a composer ? i think one notices that " lohengrin " is still an early opera in the oeuvre .
but wagner is so clever , and you can feel from the work that he very consciously knows how to use his powers and to manipulate people in writing music .
i think act two of " lohengrin " contains one of wagner 's greatest masterpieces .
there , he creates the atmosphere so dramatically , and you think , " everything can be so beautiful in life , if you just make the right decisions . "
but then , you also know , " no , no , the ending wo n't be nice . " in act two of the opera , you know that the future could be so great , but wagner knows it will never happen and shows that in the music .

last year , it was added to unesco 's world heritage list and for 2010 it has been named dance of the year . as the sound of bandoneons and violins emanates sensuously from the loudspeakers , a man puts his arm around his partner 's waist , pressing her against him .
from the hips up , the two are welded together like one body , while their legs artistically entangle and detangle themselves . it 's a scene that can be found in any number of dance schools across germany that offer the so-called milonga - the insiders ' term for a tango evening . from munich to hamburg , the tango scene has become so well organized that not having a partner is not an excuse not to join in .
networking services are available to help dancers find partners and travel agencies offer special holiday packages for tango fans . not as easy as it looks despite all the enthusiasm , going from the beginners ' class to being able to glide across the dance floor like a professional is quite a lot of work and takes more than a little talent . " the tango is one of the most difficult dances in the world , " norma raimondi said , a teacher at the don tango club in cologne .
" of course it depends on each person 's talent , but it generally takes a good three years to be able to dance spontaneously , without having to think about each step in advance . " " at the beginning i was just curious , but now it 's like a drug , i have to dance more and more , " said johanna , one of raimondi 's dance student 's , who preferred not to give her last name .
and a certain addiction is necessary to invest so much time into perfecting the dance . bildunterschrift : being comfortable with the steps can take years born out of trials prominent argentinean tango composer enrique santos discepolo -lrb- 1901-1951 -rrb- once said , " the tango is a sad thought that you can dance . "
indeed , that melancholy aspect is inseparably tied to the birthplace of the dance : buenos aires ' old port district , la boca . toward the end of the 19th century , this neighborhood became a gathering place for immigrants who had come to the city on the rio de la plata in search of a better life . tango blended the folklore and the instruments of the immigrants ' homelands to create a completely new sound that would become a symbol of their adopted home : buenos aires . " tango reflects all elements of life , " said 80-year-old luis stazo , a bandoneon player who performed for decades all over the globe with the legendary sexteto mayor .
" it tells how the man betrays the woman and the woman the man .
tango knows horse races , gambling - everything in life .
that 's why tango is much more than a dance . " stazo explained that tango was originally played only with guitar and flute .
later , the bandoneon was added .
the bandoneon - which looks somewhat like an accordion - was invented in the mid-19th century by heinrich band and was initially intended for religious and popular music . " we bandoneon players can thank germany , because the instrument that is so typical for tango and is so important to its soul was invented there , " said stazo . bildunterschrift : a hundred years ago , tango was deamed too sexy for high society frowned upon by the elite corazon , amor y sangre - heart , love and blood - was the immigrants ' motto and describes the soul of the dance .
in the beginning , the big-city argentinean elite rejected the " obscene " tango , which embodied the betrayal , loneliness and failures of the immigrant population . when the foreigners did n't find the riches they had hoped for , many became resigned , turning to gambling or prostitution .
it took many years before tango became socially acceptable . in 1904 , the police even warned against the dance , saying it promoted rivalry among people who , in the end , " always reached for the knife . "
in 1913 , pope st. pius x even condemned the dance . it was , however , too late ; tango had already caught hold .
the roaring twenties ushered in a comeback and in the 21st century it has experienced a revival . " i think that , with tango , many people are looking for a closeness to other people that we are missing in today 's society , " said daniel perusin , an argentinean tango teacher in cologne .
being able to embrace and be embraced is part of what makes tango so fascinating , he added . adjusting to gender roles getting to the point of being able to enjoy the embrace is the first hurdle . " it took me a while to get used to the fact that the man leads , " said dance student johanna .
" as an emancipated european woman , i often tend to want to take the reins . " perusin , on the other hand , said that german men tend to be passive and hesitant and have to learn to take the lead : " they probably think that if they take the active role the women will get upset . " nevertheless , whatever may be holding germans back from expressing themselves fully in this type of dance is still not stopping many of them from giving it a try . author : suzanne cords -lrb- ew / kjb -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

westerwelle had words of encouragement but said accession rules would remain firm . german foreign minister guido westerwelle met with croatian leaders in zagreb on wednesday , kicking off his three-day trip to the balkans .
on arrival , westerwelle met with president ivo josipovic , prime minister jadranka kosor and foreign minister gordan jandrokovic .
he then gave a speech to the academy of sciences encouraging the country to make the necessary reforms for european union accession .
" if croatia musters all its strength for the final sprint , then -lsb- eu -rsb- membership could be wrapped up soon , perhaps as soon as next year , " westerwelle said .
he added , however , that there would be no concessions on the accession criteria , especially in light of this year 's greek budget crisis .
" if we loosened the rules , we would only sow concerns about taking on new members . "
croatia is set to join the eu in 2012 , and is seen as the least problematic balkan country seeking accession .
westerwelle praised croatia for recently resolving a border conflict with slovenia , the only country from the former yugoslavia that has joined the union .
diplomatic challenge on thursday , westerwelle travels to the serbian capital of belgrade , where he will face the tricky task of dissuading serbia from seeking a new united nations resolution on the status of kosovo .
" he wo n't put too much pressure on serbia , " westerwelle 's spokesman stephan bredohl , who is traveling with him , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is in line with international law " but we 're very clear on kosovo : germany has accepted its independence and it 's very important for us that if serbia wants to join the european union , it needs to be constructive and toe the eu 's line , " he explained .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 and is now officially recognized by 69 countries .
in july , the international court of justice , which serbia had called on to rule on kosovo 's status , declared that its declaration of independence was in line with international law .
serbia refuses to accept the verdict , pressing instead for a un resolution to reopen talks on the status of what it considers the serbian province of kosovo .
germany was one of the first countries to recognize kosovo as an independent state .
five eu member states , however , do not recognize kosovo , meaning the eu can not make it a precondition for serbia to join the eu .
deadlock in bosnia westerwelle is also to visit bosnia-herzegovina on thursday .
nearly 15 years after the dayton peace agreement , which ended the fighting and split bosnia-herzegovina into two largely autonomous entities , the political situation there remains challenging . many serbs , muslims and croats remain pitted against each other ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for october 3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik seeks independence for bosnian serbs while the ruling on kosovo by the international court of justice was well-received in germany , it has also fanned the flames of separatism in the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , the mainly serb bosnian entity .
its leader milorad dodik has threatened secession from bosnia since he came into power in 2006 .
after the verdict on kosovo , he declared that he would start discussions on independence after the elections .
" in bosnia , the foreign minister 's visit will be largely symbolic and he will try to call on voters to be moderate , " bodo weber , an expert on the region at the democratization policy council , told deutsche welle .
focus on the region germany has been criticized for not making the balkans a focus of its foreign policy , not least because it did not send a representative to the eu-balkan summit in sarajevo in june . many are hoping westerwelle 's trip will change that .
" these countries -lsb- in the balkans -rsb- are already part of europe , that 's why their problems are our problems , " said bernd posselt , mep for germany 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in brussels .
" i would hope that the foreign minister will not just see this trip as a photo opportunity , but see it as the start of a much greater focus of his foreign policy , " he added .

the draft bill hopes to stabilize the banking system by charging higher fees for banks who engage in riskier behavior .
the law could bring in more than 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- per year , which would go into a fund to help bail out banks in the case of another financial crisis .
france and britain have collaborated on similar laws with merkel , who brought the idea up to other global leaders at a group of 8 summit in canada in june but failed to gather broad support .
multi-front opposition the law has gained criticism from several fronts , including economic analysts , who have said the fee must be adopted on a global level to truly stabilize the world financial system .
savings and loan institutions have also opposed the bill , claiming that the most recent crisis has already punished banks , and that they have since modified their own policies to protect against crises .
and opposition parties have also attacked the draft law , saying it is too low and that banks would pass on the costs to consumers .
but german private banks - including the nation 's largest , deutsche bank - have supported the law , saying it would shore up bankruptcy proceedings for the german banking sector .

one of the key issues is the country 's fledgling economic recovery .
but the party that is leading in the opinion polls wants to forge closer ties with russia . latvia is slowly emerging from recession with the help of money from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the european union .
the economic recovery is likely to play a central role in the parliamentary elections in october .
latvians will effectively be voting either to continue the government 's austerity program , or to refuse help from international donors , and instead increase the country 's dependency on russia .
october 2nd is decision time come election day , latvians will choose between 10 parties , or alliances , running for the 100-seat parliament , or saeima .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the latvian economy is recovering with help from the imf and the eu recent opinion polls show that the pro-kremlin " harmony centre " bloc is currently the most popular party .
it was formed in april this year , and polls indicate that around 20 percent of people intend to vote for it .
nellija locmele is the editor of the weekly news and current affairs magazine " ir . "
she is alarmed at the prospect of " harmony centre " winning the most seats in parliament : " harmony centre is … not a stable party , " locmele said .
" it 's new and has n't proved itself over the years , so we are not able to assess its policies and ideology in practice . "
locmele is concerned that there are politicians with very differing views on how to boost the economy within the party .
the country is at a crossroads latvia is at a crossroads in terms of its further economic and political development .
in order to keep the economic recovery on track , locmele feels the country needs to stick to its structural reforms .
but " harmony centre " wants latvia to have closer economic and political ties with russia .
political scientist janis ikstens says this is part of an increasing trend in latvia , but he warns that this could be dangerous : " what is striking is that this discourse has barely changed after one of the leaders of " harmony centre " openly threatened to stage bloodshed à la bishkek in riga if his political platform is not fulfilled .
this is i think absolutely unacceptable in a democratic society . "
current government is struggling despite the fact that the present government managed to halt the economic recession under prime minister valdia dombrovskis , his pro-western alliance " unity " is falling behind in the polls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current prime minister is struggling in opinion polls liga stafecka of delna , the latvian chapter of transparency international , says that voters do n't appreciate the gravity of the situation .
" people in latvia are perplexed and confused because many political unions or blocs have been established , " she said . " the voters find it very hard to distinguish one bloc from the other . "
the latest figures show that around 20 per cent of voters in latvia have n't still decided who they will vote for .
and about one fifth intend to ignore the general election altogether . the politicians have just five weeks left to change this .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 25.08.2010 germans are falling in love with tango großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emotion and speed are crucial in tango the germans may not be famous for passionate physical expression , but many are swooning for argentinean tango .
last year , it was added to unesco 's world heritage list and for 2010 it has been named dance of the year . as the sound of bandoneons and violins emanates sensuously from the loudspeakers , a man puts his arm around his partner 's waist , pressing her against him .
from the hips up , the two are welded together like one body , while their legs artistically entangle and detangle themselves . it 's a scene that can be found in any number of dance schools across germany that offer the so-called milonga - the insiders ' term for a tango evening . from munich to hamburg , the tango scene has become so well organized that not having a partner is not an excuse not to join in .
networking services are available to help dancers find partners and travel agencies offer special holiday packages for tango fans . not as easy as it looks despite all the enthusiasm , going from the beginners ' class to being able to glide across the dance floor like a professional is quite a lot of work and takes more than a little talent . " the tango is one of the most difficult dances in the world , " norma raimondi said , a teacher at the don tango club in cologne .
" of course it depends on each person 's talent , but it generally takes a good three years to be able to dance spontaneously , without having to think about each step in advance . " " at the beginning i was just curious , but now it 's like a drug , i have to dance more and more , " said johanna , one of raimondi 's dance student 's , who preferred not to give her last name .
and a certain addiction is necessary to invest so much time into perfecting the dance . bildunterschrift : being comfortable with the steps can take years born out of trials prominent argentinean tango composer enrique santos discepolo -lrb- 1901-1951 -rrb- once said , " the tango is a sad thought that you can dance . "
indeed , that melancholy aspect is inseparably tied to the birthplace of the dance : buenos aires ' old port district , la boca . toward the end of the 19th century , this neighborhood became a gathering place for immigrants who had come to the city on the rio de la plata in search of a better life . tango blended the folklore and the instruments of the immigrants ' homelands to create a completely new sound that would become a symbol of their adopted home : buenos aires . " tango reflects all elements of life , " said 80-year-old luis stazo , a bandoneon player who performed for decades all over the globe with the legendary sexteto mayor .
" it tells how the man betrays the woman and the woman the man .
tango knows horse races , gambling - everything in life .
that 's why tango is much more than a dance . " stazo explained that tango was originally played only with guitar and flute .
later , the bandoneon was added .
the bandoneon - which looks somewhat like an accordion - was invented in the mid-19th century by heinrich band and was initially intended for religious and popular music . " we bandoneon players can thank germany , because the instrument that is so typical for tango and is so important to its soul was invented there , " said stazo . bildunterschrift : a hundred years ago , tango was deamed too sexy for high society frowned upon by the elite corazon , amor y sangre - heart , love and blood - was the immigrants ' motto and describes the soul of the dance .
in the beginning , the big-city argentinean elite rejected the " obscene " tango , which embodied the betrayal , loneliness and failures of the immigrant population . when the foreigners did n't find the riches they had hoped for , many became resigned , turning to gambling or prostitution .
it took many years before tango became socially acceptable . in 1904 , the police even warned against the dance , saying it promoted rivalry among people who , in the end , " always reached for the knife . "
in 1913 , pope st. pius x even condemned the dance . it was , however , too late ; tango had already caught hold .
the roaring twenties ushered in a comeback and in the 21st century it has experienced a revival . " i think that , with tango , many people are looking for a closeness to other people that we are missing in today 's society , " said daniel perusin , an argentinean tango teacher in cologne .
being able to embrace and be embraced is part of what makes tango so fascinating , he added . adjusting to gender roles getting to the point of being able to enjoy the embrace is the first hurdle . " it took me a while to get used to the fact that the man leads , " said dance student johanna .
" as an emancipated european woman , i often tend to want to take the reins . " perusin , on the other hand , said that german men tend to be passive and hesitant and have to learn to take the lead : " they probably think that if they take the active role the women will get upset . " nevertheless , whatever may be holding germans back from expressing themselves fully in this type of dance is still not stopping many of them from giving it a try . author : suzanne cords -lrb- ew / kjb -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany would become the first country to forbid facebook content to be used for hiring purposes . undercover spies and hidden video cameras - it sounds like the stuff of a james bond movie .
but for some german employees , it 's just another day at work . in recent years , a series of workplace spying scandals have come to light , several involving high-profile companies like the telecommunications firm deutsche telekom , the discount retailer lidl and the national railway operator deutsche bahn . " until now , it has not been regulated , in what capacity and under what conditions an employer can use video surveillance to collect information about his employees , " parliamentarian christian ahrendt of the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- told deutsche welle . in response to the scandals , the governing coalition has proposed a draft law on wednesday that would better regulate workplace privacy .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said the new law would be beneficial for both parties . " it 's a balanced compromise among the various interests and will foster more trust in the workplace between employer and employee , " de maiziere told reporters . no more secret cameras bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security cameras will still be allowed , but not hidden ones a central point of the proposal is that employers can no longer use video surveillance on workers without their knowledge . " there has to be a justifiable reason on the employer 's behalf .
and if video surveillance is going on , there has to be a sign informing people about it , " ahrendt told deutsche welle . retailers in germany have been known to use hidden cameras to catch employees they believe are stealing .
according to the new bill , video surveillance will be forbidden in private areas such as changing rooms , break rooms and bathrooms . however , employers will still be permitted to use cameras as anti-shoplifting measures in public areas , such as around the cash register or the entrance to a supermarket . critics of the bill say secret video surveillance is an important tool to protect against theft and corruption by employees .
the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- said the new bill prevents the fight against corruption and criminality in the workplace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spying on employees via facebook will be forbidden ' friending ' the boss the law also protects employees ' online privacy on social networking sites such as facebook and myspace .
at a press conference in berlin , de maiziere emphasized employers would still be permitted to gather information about employees via publicly accessible sources , such as search engines . " what an employer ca n't do is befriend someone on a closed social network and then use the ' friend ' status to access private data and then use that information against the applicant , " de maiziere said . if the bill is passed into law , germany will become the first country to slap legal restrictions on the use of personal information in private social networking sites . the law still has to go before parliament for debate and a final vote .

the economic recovery is likely to play a central role in the parliamentary elections in october .

the former student activist deals with the megacity 's contradictions in her texts .
the writer says jakarta is not friendly to those who have little . " oh darn it , i scratched too deep .
crazy … this wall is crumbly .
look !
here !
under this layer of colour .
this is it .
this is the layer of that mural with the literature quote , " ayu utami explains jubilantly . we are standing on a sidewalk facing a wall at cikini railway station - a small station in the middle of the city .
trains swelling over with commuters from jakarta 's suburbs stop here . under the layer of paint that ayu utami has scratched away , a poem has been written in black against a yellow background .
the poem is titled " ktp , " the abbreviation for identity card in indonesia . " ktp " was written by goenawan mohammad , a poet , writer , thinker , and one of indonesia 's best known cultural critics , with whom ayu utami worked a great deal . bildunterschrift : the indonesian poet goenawan mohammad is very interested in identity the poem speaks of the multiple identities of jakarta 's inhabitants .
each year , at least 300,000 more people arrive in the city , from all over indonesia .
but the city does not change them very much .
nor do they change the city .
most come here to work and do not bring their traditions with them .
so jakarta , this city where languages and cultures live side by side , never really becomes their home . twenty languages spoken we go back to the car , where our driver is speaking in javanese to his wife on his mobile phone .
in jakarta , at least 20 languages are spoken .
like the driver , ayu utami was not born in the capital but came as a child .
her family hails from bogor , where people speak mostly sundanese . she wrote her first novel " saman " in the national language bahasa indonesia .
it quickly became a bestseller in this modern babylon and was then translated into many other languages . ayu utami tries her hand at reading aloud : " he looked at me .
then deep into my eyes , before sitting down next to rosano .
it was actually a very brief contact .
as if he were shy , but at the same time proud , manly … he looked at my tray and said ' you do n't eat much . '
sihar situmorang .
he smiled .
sihar mostly spoke in the jakarta dialect .
occasionally a batak expression came through , usually when he got excited .
to her ears , it sounded warm and comfortable … " bringing literature to public spaces " saman " tells the story of a catholic priest who sides with the poor .
he then falls in love and gives up his priesthood .
it is also the story of a group of women , who break out of their traditional roles .
published in 1988 , it was named best novel by the jakarta arts council . ayu utami is now a member of jakarta arts council and tells me about the projects .
" last year , we focused on the subject of cities .
many groups worked with our committees on this theme .
the literature and arts committee joined forces .
and then a multitude of graffiti and murals with literary quotes from well-known indonesian writers were created in various places around the city .
behind it was the idea of how to take art and culture out of museums and bring it to the public ?
the graffiti and murals were supposed to become part of people 's daily life . " literature and art in public spaces ?
not locked up behind walls ?
is this ayu utami ’ s comment on the politics of this megacity ? bildunterschrift : ayu utami insists on writing about the problems of indonesia she replies that politics in jakarta are more and more for the rich .
many laws criminalize the poor , and then they are thrown in jail .
political issues are a natural part of her stories and articles . " i ca n't just separate my writing with problems faced by the people , the problems of indonesia .
i can not write in an ivory tower . " ' like a huge river , with no beginning or end ' now jakarta is full of graffiti , protest drawings and some of the literary murals have not been painted over , yet .
the dynamism of these changes tells stories about what is on people 's minds . 15 minutes away by car , there is another mural with jakarta 's skyline under a bright blue sky .
there is a young man sporting a crimson shirt in the picture .
he is wearing sunglasses and looking at a piece of paper .
on it is a poem by sitor situmorang , called " jabotabek , " which talks about the semanggi bridge , jakarta 's first modern bridge . " semanggi , from here , from this clover-leaf shaped concrete bridge ; i look at this large city , and at the traffic today , which flows underneath this bridge , like a huge river , with no beginning , nor an end .

new research shows that there 's a physiological cause that could be treated with dietary supplements . after the relative calm of pregnancy , giving birth is a physically and emotionally draining experience .
but the changes do n't stop there .
a woman 's estrogen levels drop significantly , and she now has to care for a crying baby 24 hours a day .
given these circumstances it 's no wonder that up to 75 percent of new mothers around the world feel down for a few days after giving birth .
but new research has found there 's an additional neurological cause to the baby blues as well .
feelings of impotence anne-christin b. , who prefered not to use her last name due to the stigma of postpartum depression , is a 33-year-old mother from berlin .
for the first day or two after her daughter was born four months ago , she felt happy , but that quickly changed .
" then came the feeling that i could n't do things .
i was afraid .
i could n't do things for the child - for whatever reason , " she remembered .
" and then i started to withdraw , i could n't go out or talk with friends on the telephone and this increased very quickly to the point where i could n't be by myself anymore . "
anne-christin is n't the only one .
millions of german women also experience the baby blues .
in her case , she was one of 15 percent of women who develop postpartum depression .
she went to her local doctor , but he did n't take her seriously , so she sought professional psychiatric help .
the source of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decreased serotonin levels are believed to be a culprit of postpartum depression dr. julia sacher , from the max planck institute for human cognitive and brain sciences in leipzig , said it 's well-documented that a sharp drop in estrogen levels and a big change in environment contribute to the baby blues .
that 's why research in this area is incredibly important .
" what we do know is that those women who have severe symptoms of postpartum blues have a higher risk of experiencing a full-blown episode later on , " sacher said .
sacher and her colleagues published the results of their study in the peer-reviewed journal , archives of general psychiatry , earlier this summer .
they found that there is a neurological cause for the baby blues .
" we see an increase in monoamine oxidase a and this can lead to a loss of serotonin , and a loss of serotonin has been associated with low mood , " sacher explained .
feeling sad after childbirth is socially unacceptable other medical professionals , like dr. stephanie krueger , said that this new study may prompt obstetricians to keep an eye on a mother 's moods both before and after childbirth .
krueger is a professor of psychiatry at the charite in berlin , one of the largest university hospitals in europe .
she treated anne-christin for post-partum depression . krueger - who was n't part of the study - said most women who feel depressed after their child is born do n't seek necessary help , because it 's not socially acceptable to feel sad at this time .
" in our culture , women who have just given birth are supposed to be happy , and if they are not , then there 's something wrong with them and they are actually treated as some kind of an outlaw , " krueger said , adding , " in many cases they are being told : why are n't you happy ? "
krueger believes there needs to be more education and support for new mothers .
" families and gps -lsb- general practitioner -rsb- should not take these things lightly and not say , ' well yeah i understand you 've just given birth - everything will be fine ' , " krueger said .
" physicians and families should take any symptoms of depression seriously and go to someone who knows what they are doing , meaning a psychiatrist , for example . "
berlin mother anne-christin b. said she wished her doctors and other medical professionals had talked to her about the baby blues during the pregnancy .
" it would have been better if , even in a midwifery course , there was perhaps 30 minutes or an hour discussion in preparation for pregnancy , where it was explained , where you explain the symptoms and also tell people where they can call for help , " anne-christin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the dramatic life changes brought by babies contribute to depression dietary supplements could help while the baby blues usually goes away by itself after a couple of days , dr. sacher from the max planck institute said treating this temporary condition could be an important step in preventing postpartum depression .
she thinks the baby blues could be treated with medication or dietary supplements , which could counter the increase in the enzyme monoamine oxidase a. but not everyone agrees the baby blues can be prevented so easily .
lisa fehrenbach has been a midwife for 35 years .
she said feeling a bit down after childbirth is a natural thing because childbirth is a physically and emotionally life-changing experience .
many women go from working full-time to being at home with a crying baby - often by themselves .
" you had a completely independent life and you organized everything and you had everything under control and suddenly there 's a little baby , " said fehrenbach , " it clings to your body 24 hours and you have to care for it 24 hours and you can not do what you want , but you have to do what the baby wants . "
fehrenbach said even if women took dietary supplements to counter the enzyme increase , they still have to adjust to this new baby in their lives .
beyond making pregnant women aware of the physiological and psychological changes in their bodies , both sacher and krueger agree this problem needs to be discussed openly in order to fight the stigma of postpartum blues and depression .
" postpartum disorders are nothing the woman is responsible for .
they ca n't help it , " krueger said .
" it has biological reasons for the most part and it can be treated effectively and it should be treated effectively . "
sacher 's next step will be to test for the elevated enzyme in postpartum depression .

westerwelle had words of encouragement but said accession rules would remain firm . german foreign minister guido westerwelle met with croatian leaders in zagreb on wednesday , kicking off his three-day trip to the balkans .
on arrival , westerwelle met with president ivo josipovic , prime minister jadranka kosor and foreign minister gordan jandrokovic .
he then gave a speech to the academy of sciences encouraging the country to make the necessary reforms for european union accession .
" if croatia musters all its strength for the final sprint , then -lsb- eu -rsb- membership could be wrapped up soon , perhaps as soon as next year , " westerwelle said .
he added , however , that there would be no concessions on the accession criteria , especially in light of this year 's greek budget crisis .
" if we loosened the rules , we would only sow concerns about taking on new members . "
croatia is set to join the eu in 2012 , and is seen as the least problematic balkan country seeking accession .
westerwelle praised croatia for recently resolving a border conflict with slovenia , the only country from the former yugoslavia that has joined the union .
diplomatic challenge on thursday , westerwelle travels to the serbian capital of belgrade , where he will face the tricky task of dissuading serbia from seeking a new united nations resolution on the status of kosovo .
" he wo n't put too much pressure on serbia , " westerwelle 's spokesman stephan bredohl , who is traveling with him , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is in line with international law " but we 're very clear on kosovo : germany has accepted its independence and it 's very important for us that if serbia wants to join the european union , it needs to be constructive and toe the eu 's line , " he explained .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 and is now officially recognized by 69 countries .
in july , the international court of justice , which serbia had called on to rule on kosovo 's status , declared that its declaration of independence was in line with international law .
serbia refuses to accept the verdict , pressing instead for a un resolution to reopen talks on the status of what it considers the serbian province of kosovo .
germany was one of the first countries to recognize kosovo as an independent state .

westerwelle had words of encouragement but said accession rules would remain firm . german foreign minister guido westerwelle met with croatian leaders in zagreb on wednesday , kicking off his three-day trip to the balkans .
on arrival , westerwelle met with president ivo josipovic , prime minister jadranka kosor and foreign minister gordan jandrokovic .
he then gave a speech to the academy of sciences encouraging the country to make the necessary reforms for european union accession .
" if croatia musters all its strength for the final sprint , then -lsb- eu -rsb- membership could be wrapped up soon , perhaps as soon as next year , " westerwelle said .
he added , however , that there would be no concessions on the accession criteria , especially in light of this year 's greek budget crisis .
" if we loosened the rules , we would only sow concerns about taking on new members . "
croatia is set to join the eu in 2012 , and is seen as the least problematic balkan country seeking accession .
westerwelle praised croatia for recently resolving a border conflict with slovenia , the only country from the former yugoslavia that has joined the union .
diplomatic challenge on thursday , westerwelle travels to the serbian capital of belgrade , where he will face the tricky task of dissuading serbia from seeking a new united nations resolution on the status of kosovo .
" he wo n't put too much pressure on serbia , " westerwelle 's spokesman stephan bredohl , who is traveling with him , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is in line with international law " but we 're very clear on kosovo : germany has accepted its independence and it 's very important for us that if serbia wants to join the european union , it needs to be constructive and toe the eu 's line , " he explained .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 and is now officially recognized by 69 countries .
in july , the international court of justice , which serbia had called on to rule on kosovo 's status , declared that its declaration of independence was in line with international law .
serbia refuses to accept the verdict , pressing instead for a un resolution to reopen talks on the status of what it considers the serbian province of kosovo .
germany was one of the first countries to recognize kosovo as an independent state .
five eu member states , however , do not recognize kosovo , meaning the eu can not make it a precondition for serbia to join the eu .

this year , he took the podium as conductor of wagner 's opera " lohengrin " at the bayreuth festival . andris nelsons is a shooting star in the classical music scene .
as the youngest conductor in the history of the bayreuth festival , the 31-year-old latvian has reaped praise from critics across germany and beyond .
this fall , he will see premieres with two of the world 's major orchestras - the berlin and the vienna philharmonics .
deutsche welle spoke with the conductor about his bayreuth debut . deutsche welle : how do you feel after your first performance this year in bayreuth ? andris nelsons : i 'm very excited because it 's such a special place and atmosphere .
it 's a great pleasure to be here ; everybody 's motivation is just to make the best possible music . but it 's also quite difficult for a conductor in this orchestra pit .
achieving the right balance between the choir , the soloists and the orchestra is hard - especially when conducting pieces that were n't written for bayreuth . have you always been steeped in wager , or what path led you to his work ? wagner was actually one of the first composers i got to know - the first opera i saw was " tannhaeuser " when i was five years old .
ever since then , i 've been listening to and analyzing his operas and been in love with his music . i think starting with wagner also opened my eyes for other composers .
approaching the philosophical and emotional components of wagner 's music helped me understand many other composers , including beethoven .
since wagner was the first i was introduced to , i viewed every other composer from a different perspective . bildunterschrift : the young conductor already has an impressive list of engagements it 's been said that you 're able to have a kind of empathy with each member of an orchestra .
how would you describe the process of bringing together so many different elements when conducting ? that process is what 's magical about being a conductor .
you 're dealing with orchestras and choirs composed of individuals who are each wonderful musicians and who each have their own ideas about how the music should be . everybody has an ego - in a good sense .
you need an artistic ego to perform music , but you have to focus those egos toward one result . when the members of an orchestra forget about the global result , it 's dangerous , and that 's a very real possibility in opera .
it should be like a family , though - everyone has a very important place and part in the family .
if some member of the family thinks someone else is more important , then it does n't work .
that seems to relate to wagner 's intentions with bayreuth - to have people focus on the music and not on themselves .
have you found the bayreuth setting encourages that artistic ideal ? i agree that there is something special about this place both practically and theoretically .
wagner really is the only star here .
for one thing , the audience ca n't even see the conductor in the orchestra pit , so there 's no possibility of the conductor stealing the show . that means the music starts without applause - it starts from scratch in a way .
everything is set up to be just about music . there 's a mystical quality to being here , which i experienced three years ago in the audience when i was invited to conduct " lohengrin . "
everyone comes to this mountain , and everyone is concentrated on the music .
that 's particular to bayreuth , but i wish it were that way everywhere - that the composer would be the one put on the podium . bildunterschrift : nelsons conducted a new production of " lohengrin " by hans neuenfels that was heavy on rodents where do think " lohengrin " stands in wagner 's oeuvre - is it the point where wagner comes into his own as a composer ? i think one notices that " lohengrin " is still an early opera in the oeuvre .
but wagner is so clever , and you can feel from the work that he very consciously knows how to use his powers and to manipulate people in writing music .
i think act two of " lohengrin " contains one of wagner 's greatest masterpieces .
there , he creates the atmosphere so dramatically , and you think , " everything can be so beautiful in life , if you just make the right decisions . "
but then , you also know , " no , no , the ending wo n't be nice . " in act two of the opera , you know that the future could be so great , but wagner knows it will never happen and shows that in the music .
it 's so sad and so beautiful at the same time . interview : rick fulker -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 25.08.2010 electronic devices speed up international development work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handheld devices are helping wfp workers in the field the world food program is using technology to speed efforts to learn where food aid is needed .
with handheld devices , the organization is able to get more accurate data and transmit it wirelessly back to headquarters . the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- in burundi is using handheld personal digital assistants , or pdas , to help keep tabs on the country 's food situation .
the technology has helped speed up the process of data collection and improve the accuracy of the organization 's food security surveys .
staff members organize fact-finding missions to gauge the country 's food supply .
when wfp arrived in burundi in 1968 , the organization was using pen and paper to conduct their food surveys .
now , wfp uses small palmtop computers , only slightly larger than normal cell phones and light enough to carry .
the devices have held up against the strong burundian heat and can last for days before needing a recharge .
" so you have the speed of gathering data , which means you can expand your survey area , and that makes it more valid by interviewing more people , " marc neilson said , a public information officer for wfp burundi .
the organization provides food assistance to more than 600,000 " food-insecure " burundians and some 90 million people around the world every year .
wfp plans to provide about 3.7 million tons of food in 73 countries to those unable to produce or obtain enough food for themselves and their families .
bildunterschrift : wfp provides food assistance to about 90 million people worldwide a welcome development in bihogo village in northern burundi , wfp program assistant gerard bisman uses his pda to conduct a 20-question survey with local residents about their food needs and living standards .
" it 's very interesting to use the device because it 's a lot faster , " he said .
" it used to take us about an hour-and-a-half to complete the entire interview with paper , and now it takes only half-an-hour . "
since he started using the device in march , bisman has eliminated prep time , paper shuffling and the need to decipher sloppy hand writing , which has reduced the margin of error .
the wfp staffer said residents also appreciate the technology , noting that survey-takers used to get " very , very tired " back when the questionnaire was conducted by hand .
bihogo resident elisabeth tembaidai had never been interviewed by wfp before .
the 56-year-old primary school teacher said it is the first time she has seen a pda - and the device shows the country is making progress .
a few years ago , tembaidai received food aid from wfp during a drought .
she said she hopes wfp will provide her with food this year , too .
" well , we will probably need some help in regards to food this year because the water that used to come from up north does n't come anymore , " she said .
" it 's the dry season also , and we are short of food at the moment , and we are asking wfp for some food now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pdas allow wfp to transmit data wirelessly high-speed , wireless transmission information is currently collected on a memory card and sent to the main wfp office in bujumbura , but soon wfp field staff will be able to transmit their findings wirelessly .
burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world , with annual per capita income averaging about $ 300 , or 236 euros .
in 2006 , the country emerged from a 13-year civil war ; one rebel group laid down its arms just last year .
now , however , the country has a new high-speed 3g wireless network .
by sending data wirelessly to the central database for analysis , wfp staff can provide up-to-date information from around the country , helping streamline planning on food shipments . the pda 's price tag is about $ 200 , or 158 euros - and providing two devices in each of burundi 's 15 provinces costs about $ 6,000 , or 4728 euros , not including training costs .
but neilson said the devices are a good investment : " any time you can save doing that , it means those most at risk - the poor - are getting the assistance faster and more effectively , and you 're not perhaps going in an area where you really should n't be , " he said .
" wfp needs to be in the areas that are most at risk .
that 's the bottom line . "
bildunterschrift : scratch card ' e-vouchers ' allow beneficiaries more options to receive food aid scratch card ' e-vouchers ' wfp has put the pdas to use elsewhere in africa , including the congo and mozambique .
in zambia , wfp distributes " e-voucher " scratch cards to improve the food voucher program .
instead of lining up for food aid , people can now choose when and where to pick up their monthly assistance .
the scratch card codes are entered into a mobile phone upon delivery of the food .
wfp said the program reduces transaction costs and increases the " efficiency and effectiveness " of food distribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wfp 's scratch card program reduces the transaction costs of food distribution in syria , 130,000 iraqi refugees receiving food aid are able to get the wfp 's " virtual vouchers " via text message .
the electronic vouchers can be exchanged for items not normally included in conventional aid baskets , such as rice , wheat flour , lentils , chickpeas , oil and canned fish , as well as cheese and eggs .
other organizations are also taking advantage of the new technologies in the field .
in the west african countries of togo and niger , the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- has worked with pdas equipped with gps capabilities to help prevent malaria .
a team of scientists used the electronic devices to collect high-quality data on the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets . in the asia-pacific region , un children 's fund staff use pda questionnaires to provide rapid assessments in emergency situations .
local statistical data on livelihood , poverty , health and nutrition can help inform situation reports , as well as high-level government officials .

westerwelle had words of encouragement but said accession rules would remain firm . german foreign minister guido westerwelle met with croatian leaders in zagreb on wednesday , kicking off his three-day trip to the balkans .
on arrival , westerwelle met with president ivo josipovic , prime minister jadranka kosor and foreign minister gordan jandrokovic .
he then gave a speech to the academy of sciences encouraging the country to make the necessary reforms for european union accession .
" if croatia musters all its strength for the final sprint , then -lsb- eu -rsb- membership could be wrapped up soon , perhaps as soon as next year , " westerwelle said .
he added , however , that there would be no concessions on the accession criteria , especially in light of this year 's greek budget crisis .
" if we loosened the rules , we would only sow concerns about taking on new members . "
croatia is set to join the eu in 2012 , and is seen as the least problematic balkan country seeking accession .
westerwelle praised croatia for recently resolving a border conflict with slovenia , the only country from the former yugoslavia that has joined the union .
diplomatic challenge on thursday , westerwelle travels to the serbian capital of belgrade , where he will face the tricky task of dissuading serbia from seeking a new united nations resolution on the status of kosovo .
" he wo n't put too much pressure on serbia , " westerwelle 's spokesman stephan bredohl , who is traveling with him , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is in line with international law " but we 're very clear on kosovo : germany has accepted its independence and it 's very important for us that if serbia wants to join the european union , it needs to be constructive and toe the eu 's line , " he explained .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 and is now officially recognized by 69 countries .
in july , the international court of justice , which serbia had called on to rule on kosovo 's status , declared that its declaration of independence was in line with international law .
serbia refuses to accept the verdict , pressing instead for a un resolution to reopen talks on the status of what it considers the serbian province of kosovo .
germany was one of the first countries to recognize kosovo as an independent state .
five eu member states , however , do not recognize kosovo , meaning the eu can not make it a precondition for serbia to join the eu .
deadlock in bosnia westerwelle is also to visit bosnia-herzegovina on thursday .
nearly 15 years after the dayton peace agreement , which ended the fighting and split bosnia-herzegovina into two largely autonomous entities , the political situation there remains challenging . many serbs , muslims and croats remain pitted against each other ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for october 3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik seeks independence for bosnian serbs while the ruling on kosovo by the international court of justice was well-received in germany , it has also fanned the flames of separatism in the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , the mainly serb bosnian entity .
its leader milorad dodik has threatened secession from bosnia since he came into power in 2006 .
after the verdict on kosovo , he declared that he would start discussions on independence after the elections .
" in bosnia , the foreign minister 's visit will be largely symbolic and he will try to call on voters to be moderate , " bodo weber , an expert on the region at the democratization policy council , told deutsche welle .
focus on the region germany has been criticized for not making the balkans a focus of its foreign policy , not least because it did not send a representative to the eu-balkan summit in sarajevo in june . many are hoping westerwelle 's trip will change that .
" these countries -lsb- in the balkans -rsb- are already part of europe , that 's why their problems are our problems , " said bernd posselt , mep for germany 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in brussels .
" i would hope that the foreign minister will not just see this trip as a photo opportunity , but see it as the start of a much greater focus of his foreign policy , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 25.08.2010 electronic devices speed up international development work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handheld devices are helping wfp workers in the field the world food program is using technology to speed efforts to learn where food aid is needed .
with handheld devices , the organization is able to get more accurate data and transmit it wirelessly back to headquarters . the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- in burundi is using handheld personal digital assistants , or pdas , to help keep tabs on the country 's food situation .
the technology has helped speed up the process of data collection and improve the accuracy of the organization 's food security surveys .
staff members organize fact-finding missions to gauge the country 's food supply .
when wfp arrived in burundi in 1968 , the organization was using pen and paper to conduct their food surveys .
now , wfp uses small palmtop computers , only slightly larger than normal cell phones and light enough to carry .
the devices have held up against the strong burundian heat and can last for days before needing a recharge .
" so you have the speed of gathering data , which means you can expand your survey area , and that makes it more valid by interviewing more people , " marc neilson said , a public information officer for wfp burundi .
the organization provides food assistance to more than 600,000 " food-insecure " burundians and some 90 million people around the world every year .
wfp plans to provide about 3.7 million tons of food in 73 countries to those unable to produce or obtain enough food for themselves and their families .
bildunterschrift : wfp provides food assistance to about 90 million people worldwide a welcome development in bihogo village in northern burundi , wfp program assistant gerard bisman uses his pda to conduct a 20-question survey with local residents about their food needs and living standards .
" it 's very interesting to use the device because it 's a lot faster , " he said .
" it used to take us about an hour-and-a-half to complete the entire interview with paper , and now it takes only half-an-hour . "
since he started using the device in march , bisman has eliminated prep time , paper shuffling and the need to decipher sloppy hand writing , which has reduced the margin of error .
the wfp staffer said residents also appreciate the technology , noting that survey-takers used to get " very , very tired " back when the questionnaire was conducted by hand .
bihogo resident elisabeth tembaidai had never been interviewed by wfp before .
the 56-year-old primary school teacher said it is the first time she has seen a pda - and the device shows the country is making progress .
a few years ago , tembaidai received food aid from wfp during a drought .
she said she hopes wfp will provide her with food this year , too .
" well , we will probably need some help in regards to food this year because the water that used to come from up north does n't come anymore , " she said .
" it 's the dry season also , and we are short of food at the moment , and we are asking wfp for some food now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pdas allow wfp to transmit data wirelessly high-speed , wireless transmission information is currently collected on a memory card and sent to the main wfp office in bujumbura , but soon wfp field staff will be able to transmit their findings wirelessly .
burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world , with annual per capita income averaging about $ 300 , or 236 euros .
in 2006 , the country emerged from a 13-year civil war ; one rebel group laid down its arms just last year .
now , however , the country has a new high-speed 3g wireless network .
by sending data wirelessly to the central database for analysis , wfp staff can provide up-to-date information from around the country , helping streamline planning on food shipments . the pda 's price tag is about $ 200 , or 158 euros - and providing two devices in each of burundi 's 15 provinces costs about $ 6,000 , or 4728 euros , not including training costs .
but neilson said the devices are a good investment : " any time you can save doing that , it means those most at risk - the poor - are getting the assistance faster and more effectively , and you 're not perhaps going in an area where you really should n't be , " he said .
" wfp needs to be in the areas that are most at risk .
that 's the bottom line . "
bildunterschrift : scratch card ' e-vouchers ' allow beneficiaries more options to receive food aid scratch card ' e-vouchers ' wfp has put the pdas to use elsewhere in africa , including the congo and mozambique .
in zambia , wfp distributes " e-voucher " scratch cards to improve the food voucher program .
instead of lining up for food aid , people can now choose when and where to pick up their monthly assistance .
the scratch card codes are entered into a mobile phone upon delivery of the food .
wfp said the program reduces transaction costs and increases the " efficiency and effectiveness " of food distribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wfp 's scratch card program reduces the transaction costs of food distribution in syria , 130,000 iraqi refugees receiving food aid are able to get the wfp 's " virtual vouchers " via text message .
the electronic vouchers can be exchanged for items not normally included in conventional aid baskets , such as rice , wheat flour , lentils , chickpeas , oil and canned fish , as well as cheese and eggs .
other organizations are also taking advantage of the new technologies in the field .
in the west african countries of togo and niger , the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- has worked with pdas equipped with gps capabilities to help prevent malaria .
a team of scientists used the electronic devices to collect high-quality data on the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets . in the asia-pacific region , un children 's fund staff use pda questionnaires to provide rapid assessments in emergency situations .
local statistical data on livelihood , poverty , health and nutrition can help inform situation reports , as well as high-level government officials .

westerwelle had words of encouragement but said accession rules would remain firm . german foreign minister guido westerwelle met with croatian leaders in zagreb on wednesday , kicking off his three-day trip to the balkans .
on arrival , westerwelle met with president ivo josipovic , prime minister jadranka kosor and foreign minister gordan jandrokovic .
he then gave a speech to the academy of sciences encouraging the country to make the necessary reforms for european union accession .
" if croatia musters all its strength for the final sprint , then -lsb- eu -rsb- membership could be wrapped up soon , perhaps as soon as next year , " westerwelle said .
he added , however , that there would be no concessions on the accession criteria , especially in light of this year 's greek budget crisis .
" if we loosened the rules , we would only sow concerns about taking on new members . "
croatia is set to join the eu in 2012 , and is seen as the least problematic balkan country seeking accession .
westerwelle praised croatia for recently resolving a border conflict with slovenia , the only country from the former yugoslavia that has joined the union .
diplomatic challenge on thursday , westerwelle travels to the serbian capital of belgrade , where he will face the tricky task of dissuading serbia from seeking a new united nations resolution on the status of kosovo .
" he wo n't put too much pressure on serbia , " westerwelle 's spokesman stephan bredohl , who is traveling with him , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is in line with international law " but we 're very clear on kosovo : germany has accepted its independence and it 's very important for us that if serbia wants to join the european union , it needs to be constructive and toe the eu 's line , " he explained .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 and is now officially recognized by 69 countries .
in july , the international court of justice , which serbia had called on to rule on kosovo 's status , declared that its declaration of independence was in line with international law .
serbia refuses to accept the verdict , pressing instead for a un resolution to reopen talks on the status of what it considers the serbian province of kosovo .
germany was one of the first countries to recognize kosovo as an independent state .
five eu member states , however , do not recognize kosovo , meaning the eu can not make it a precondition for serbia to join the eu .
deadlock in bosnia westerwelle is also to visit bosnia-herzegovina on thursday .
nearly 15 years after the dayton peace agreement , which ended the fighting and split bosnia-herzegovina into two largely autonomous entities , the political situation there remains challenging . many serbs , muslims and croats remain pitted against each other ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for october 3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik seeks independence for bosnian serbs while the ruling on kosovo by the international court of justice was well-received in germany , it has also fanned the flames of separatism in the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , the mainly serb bosnian entity .
its leader milorad dodik has threatened secession from bosnia since he came into power in 2006 .
after the verdict on kosovo , he declared that he would start discussions on independence after the elections .
" in bosnia , the foreign minister 's visit will be largely symbolic and he will try to call on voters to be moderate , " bodo weber , an expert on the region at the democratization policy council , told deutsche welle .
focus on the region germany has been criticized for not making the balkans a focus of its foreign policy , not least because it did not send a representative to the eu-balkan summit in sarajevo in june . many are hoping westerwelle 's trip will change that .
" these countries -lsb- in the balkans -rsb- are already part of europe , that 's why their problems are our problems , " said bernd posselt , mep for germany 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in brussels .
" i would hope that the foreign minister will not just see this trip as a photo opportunity , but see it as the start of a much greater focus of his foreign policy , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 25.08.2010 electronic devices speed up international development work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handheld devices are helping wfp workers in the field the world food program is using technology to speed efforts to learn where food aid is needed .
with handheld devices , the organization is able to get more accurate data and transmit it wirelessly back to headquarters . the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- in burundi is using handheld personal digital assistants , or pdas , to help keep tabs on the country 's food situation .
the technology has helped speed up the process of data collection and improve the accuracy of the organization 's food security surveys .
staff members organize fact-finding missions to gauge the country 's food supply .
when wfp arrived in burundi in 1968 , the organization was using pen and paper to conduct their food surveys .
now , wfp uses small palmtop computers , only slightly larger than normal cell phones and light enough to carry .
the devices have held up against the strong burundian heat and can last for days before needing a recharge .
" so you have the speed of gathering data , which means you can expand your survey area , and that makes it more valid by interviewing more people , " marc neilson said , a public information officer for wfp burundi .
the organization provides food assistance to more than 600,000 " food-insecure " burundians and some 90 million people around the world every year .
wfp plans to provide about 3.7 million tons of food in 73 countries to those unable to produce or obtain enough food for themselves and their families .
bildunterschrift : wfp provides food assistance to about 90 million people worldwide a welcome development in bihogo village in northern burundi , wfp program assistant gerard bisman uses his pda to conduct a 20-question survey with local residents about their food needs and living standards .
" it 's very interesting to use the device because it 's a lot faster , " he said .
" it used to take us about an hour-and-a-half to complete the entire interview with paper , and now it takes only half-an-hour . "
since he started using the device in march , bisman has eliminated prep time , paper shuffling and the need to decipher sloppy hand writing , which has reduced the margin of error .
the wfp staffer said residents also appreciate the technology , noting that survey-takers used to get " very , very tired " back when the questionnaire was conducted by hand .
bihogo resident elisabeth tembaidai had never been interviewed by wfp before .
the 56-year-old primary school teacher said it is the first time she has seen a pda - and the device shows the country is making progress .
a few years ago , tembaidai received food aid from wfp during a drought .
she said she hopes wfp will provide her with food this year , too .
" well , we will probably need some help in regards to food this year because the water that used to come from up north does n't come anymore , " she said .
" it 's the dry season also , and we are short of food at the moment , and we are asking wfp for some food now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pdas allow wfp to transmit data wirelessly high-speed , wireless transmission information is currently collected on a memory card and sent to the main wfp office in bujumbura , but soon wfp field staff will be able to transmit their findings wirelessly .
burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world , with annual per capita income averaging about $ 300 , or 236 euros .
in 2006 , the country emerged from a 13-year civil war ; one rebel group laid down its arms just last year .
now , however , the country has a new high-speed 3g wireless network .
by sending data wirelessly to the central database for analysis , wfp staff can provide up-to-date information from around the country , helping streamline planning on food shipments . the pda 's price tag is about $ 200 , or 158 euros - and providing two devices in each of burundi 's 15 provinces costs about $ 6,000 , or 4728 euros , not including training costs .
but neilson said the devices are a good investment : " any time you can save doing that , it means those most at risk - the poor - are getting the assistance faster and more effectively , and you 're not perhaps going in an area where you really should n't be , " he said .
" wfp needs to be in the areas that are most at risk .
that 's the bottom line . "
bildunterschrift : scratch card ' e-vouchers ' allow beneficiaries more options to receive food aid scratch card ' e-vouchers ' wfp has put the pdas to use elsewhere in africa , including the congo and mozambique .
in zambia , wfp distributes " e-voucher " scratch cards to improve the food voucher program .
instead of lining up for food aid , people can now choose when and where to pick up their monthly assistance .
the scratch card codes are entered into a mobile phone upon delivery of the food .
wfp said the program reduces transaction costs and increases the " efficiency and effectiveness " of food distribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wfp 's scratch card program reduces the transaction costs of food distribution in syria , 130,000 iraqi refugees receiving food aid are able to get the wfp 's " virtual vouchers " via text message .
the electronic vouchers can be exchanged for items not normally included in conventional aid baskets , such as rice , wheat flour , lentils , chickpeas , oil and canned fish , as well as cheese and eggs .
other organizations are also taking advantage of the new technologies in the field .
in the west african countries of togo and niger , the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- has worked with pdas equipped with gps capabilities to help prevent malaria .
a team of scientists used the electronic devices to collect high-quality data on the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets . in the asia-pacific region , un children 's fund staff use pda questionnaires to provide rapid assessments in emergency situations .
local statistical data on livelihood , poverty , health and nutrition can help inform situation reports , as well as high-level government officials .

the draft bill hopes to stabilize the banking system by charging higher fees for banks who engage in riskier behavior .
the law could bring in more than 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- per year , which would go into a fund to help bail out banks in the case of another financial crisis .
france and britain have collaborated on similar laws with merkel , who brought the idea up to other global leaders at a group of 8 summit in canada in june but failed to gather broad support .
multi-front opposition the law has gained criticism from several fronts , including economic analysts , who have said the fee must be adopted on a global level to truly stabilize the world financial system .
savings and loan institutions have also opposed the bill , claiming that the most recent crisis has already punished banks , and that they have since modified their own policies to protect against crises .
and opposition parties have also attacked the draft law , saying it is too low and that banks would pass on the costs to consumers .
but german private banks - including the nation 's largest , deutsche bank - have supported the law , saying it would shore up bankruptcy proceedings for the german banking sector .

new research shows that there 's a physiological cause that could be treated with dietary supplements . after the relative calm of pregnancy , giving birth is a physically and emotionally draining experience .
but the changes do n't stop there .
a woman 's estrogen levels drop significantly , and she now has to care for a crying baby 24 hours a day .
given these circumstances it 's no wonder that up to 75 percent of new mothers around the world feel down for a few days after giving birth .
but new research has found there 's an additional neurological cause to the baby blues as well .
feelings of impotence anne-christin b. , who prefered not to use her last name due to the stigma of postpartum depression , is a 33-year-old mother from berlin .
for the first day or two after her daughter was born four months ago , she felt happy , but that quickly changed .
" then came the feeling that i could n't do things .
i was afraid .
i could n't do things for the child - for whatever reason , " she remembered .
" and then i started to withdraw , i could n't go out or talk with friends on the telephone and this increased very quickly to the point where i could n't be by myself anymore . "
anne-christin is n't the only one .
millions of german women also experience the baby blues .
in her case , she was one of 15 percent of women who develop postpartum depression .
she went to her local doctor , but he did n't take her seriously , so she sought professional psychiatric help .
the source of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decreased serotonin levels are believed to be a culprit of postpartum depression dr. julia sacher , from the max planck institute for human cognitive and brain sciences in leipzig , said it 's well-documented that a sharp drop in estrogen levels and a big change in environment contribute to the baby blues .
that 's why research in this area is incredibly important .
" what we do know is that those women who have severe symptoms of postpartum blues have a higher risk of experiencing a full-blown episode later on , " sacher said .
sacher and her colleagues published the results of their study in the peer-reviewed journal , archives of general psychiatry , earlier this summer .
they found that there is a neurological cause for the baby blues .
" we see an increase in monoamine oxidase a and this can lead to a loss of serotonin , and a loss of serotonin has been associated with low mood , " sacher explained .
feeling sad after childbirth is socially unacceptable other medical professionals , like dr. stephanie krueger , said that this new study may prompt obstetricians to keep an eye on a mother 's moods both before and after childbirth .
krueger is a professor of psychiatry at the charite in berlin , one of the largest university hospitals in europe .
she treated anne-christin for post-partum depression . krueger - who was n't part of the study - said most women who feel depressed after their child is born do n't seek necessary help , because it 's not socially acceptable to feel sad at this time .
" in our culture , women who have just given birth are supposed to be happy , and if they are not , then there 's something wrong with them and they are actually treated as some kind of an outlaw , " krueger said , adding , " in many cases they are being told : why are n't you happy ? "
krueger believes there needs to be more education and support for new mothers .
" families and gps -lsb- general practitioner -rsb- should not take these things lightly and not say , ' well yeah i understand you 've just given birth - everything will be fine ' , " krueger said .
" physicians and families should take any symptoms of depression seriously and go to someone who knows what they are doing , meaning a psychiatrist , for example . "
berlin mother anne-christin b. said she wished her doctors and other medical professionals had talked to her about the baby blues during the pregnancy .
" it would have been better if , even in a midwifery course , there was perhaps 30 minutes or an hour discussion in preparation for pregnancy , where it was explained , where you explain the symptoms and also tell people where they can call for help , " anne-christin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the dramatic life changes brought by babies contribute to depression dietary supplements could help while the baby blues usually goes away by itself after a couple of days , dr. sacher from the max planck institute said treating this temporary condition could be an important step in preventing postpartum depression .
she thinks the baby blues could be treated with medication or dietary supplements , which could counter the increase in the enzyme monoamine oxidase a. but not everyone agrees the baby blues can be prevented so easily .
lisa fehrenbach has been a midwife for 35 years .
she said feeling a bit down after childbirth is a natural thing because childbirth is a physically and emotionally life-changing experience .
many women go from working full-time to being at home with a crying baby - often by themselves .
" you had a completely independent life and you organized everything and you had everything under control and suddenly there 's a little baby , " said fehrenbach , " it clings to your body 24 hours and you have to care for it 24 hours and you can not do what you want , but you have to do what the baby wants . "
fehrenbach said even if women took dietary supplements to counter the enzyme increase , they still have to adjust to this new baby in their lives .
beyond making pregnant women aware of the physiological and psychological changes in their bodies , both sacher and krueger agree this problem needs to be discussed openly in order to fight the stigma of postpartum blues and depression .
" postpartum disorders are nothing the woman is responsible for .
they ca n't help it , " krueger said .
" it has biological reasons for the most part and it can be treated effectively and it should be treated effectively . "
sacher 's next step will be to test for the elevated enzyme in postpartum depression .

feeling sad after childbirth is socially unacceptable other medical professionals , like dr. stephanie krueger , said that this new study may prompt obstetricians to keep an eye on a mother 's moods both before and after childbirth .
krueger is a professor of psychiatry at the charite in berlin , one of the largest university hospitals in europe .
she treated anne-christin for post-partum depression . krueger - who was n't part of the study - said most women who feel depressed after their child is born do n't seek necessary help , because it 's not socially acceptable to feel sad at this time .
" in our culture , women who have just given birth are supposed to be happy , and if they are not , then there 's something wrong with them and they are actually treated as some kind of an outlaw , " krueger said , adding , " in many cases they are being told : why are n't you happy ? "
krueger believes there needs to be more education and support for new mothers .
" families and gps -lsb- general practitioner -rsb- should not take these things lightly and not say , ' well yeah i understand you 've just given birth - everything will be fine ' , " krueger said .
" physicians and families should take any symptoms of depression seriously and go to someone who knows what they are doing , meaning a psychiatrist , for example . "
berlin mother anne-christin b. said she wished her doctors and other medical professionals had talked to her about the baby blues during the pregnancy .
" it would have been better if , even in a midwifery course , there was perhaps 30 minutes or an hour discussion in preparation for pregnancy , where it was explained , where you explain the symptoms and also tell people where they can call for help , " anne-christin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the dramatic life changes brought by babies contribute to depression dietary supplements could help while the baby blues usually goes away by itself after a couple of days , dr. sacher from the max planck institute said treating this temporary condition could be an important step in preventing postpartum depression .
she thinks the baby blues could be treated with medication or dietary supplements , which could counter the increase in the enzyme monoamine oxidase a. but not everyone agrees the baby blues can be prevented so easily .
lisa fehrenbach has been a midwife for 35 years .
she said feeling a bit down after childbirth is a natural thing because childbirth is a physically and emotionally life-changing experience .
many women go from working full-time to being at home with a crying baby - often by themselves .
" you had a completely independent life and you organized everything and you had everything under control and suddenly there 's a little baby , " said fehrenbach , " it clings to your body 24 hours and you have to care for it 24 hours and you can not do what you want , but you have to do what the baby wants . "
fehrenbach said even if women took dietary supplements to counter the enzyme increase , they still have to adjust to this new baby in their lives .
beyond making pregnant women aware of the physiological and psychological changes in their bodies , both sacher and krueger agree this problem needs to be discussed openly in order to fight the stigma of postpartum blues and depression .
" postpartum disorders are nothing the woman is responsible for .
they ca n't help it , " krueger said .
" it has biological reasons for the most part and it can be treated effectively and it should be treated effectively . "
sacher 's next step will be to test for the elevated enzyme in postpartum depression .

new research shows that there 's a physiological cause that could be treated with dietary supplements . after the relative calm of pregnancy , giving birth is a physically and emotionally draining experience .
but the changes do n't stop there .
a woman 's estrogen levels drop significantly , and she now has to care for a crying baby 24 hours a day .
given these circumstances it 's no wonder that up to 75 percent of new mothers around the world feel down for a few days after giving birth .
but new research has found there 's an additional neurological cause to the baby blues as well .
feelings of impotence anne-christin b. , who prefered not to use her last name due to the stigma of postpartum depression , is a 33-year-old mother from berlin .
for the first day or two after her daughter was born four months ago , she felt happy , but that quickly changed .
" then came the feeling that i could n't do things .
i was afraid .
i could n't do things for the child - for whatever reason , " she remembered .
" and then i started to withdraw , i could n't go out or talk with friends on the telephone and this increased very quickly to the point where i could n't be by myself anymore . "
anne-christin is n't the only one .
millions of german women also experience the baby blues .
in her case , she was one of 15 percent of women who develop postpartum depression .
she went to her local doctor , but he did n't take her seriously , so she sought professional psychiatric help .
the source of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decreased serotonin levels are believed to be a culprit of postpartum depression dr. julia sacher , from the max planck institute for human cognitive and brain sciences in leipzig , said it 's well-documented that a sharp drop in estrogen levels and a big change in environment contribute to the baby blues .
that 's why research in this area is incredibly important .
" what we do know is that those women who have severe symptoms of postpartum blues have a higher risk of experiencing a full-blown episode later on , " sacher said .
sacher and her colleagues published the results of their study in the peer-reviewed journal , archives of general psychiatry , earlier this summer .
they found that there is a neurological cause for the baby blues .
" we see an increase in monoamine oxidase a and this can lead to a loss of serotonin , and a loss of serotonin has been associated with low mood , " sacher explained .
feeling sad after childbirth is socially unacceptable other medical professionals , like dr. stephanie krueger , said that this new study may prompt obstetricians to keep an eye on a mother 's moods both before and after childbirth .

trains swelling over with commuters from jakarta 's suburbs stop here . under the layer of paint that ayu utami has scratched away , a poem has been written in black against a yellow background .
the poem is titled " ktp , " the abbreviation for identity card in indonesia .

the former student activist deals with the megacity 's contradictions in her texts .
the writer says jakarta is not friendly to those who have little . " oh darn it , i scratched too deep .
crazy … this wall is crumbly .
look !
here !
under this layer of colour .
this is it .
this is the layer of that mural with the literature quote , " ayu utami explains jubilantly . we are standing on a sidewalk facing a wall at cikini railway station - a small station in the middle of the city .
trains swelling over with commuters from jakarta 's suburbs stop here . under the layer of paint that ayu utami has scratched away , a poem has been written in black against a yellow background .
the poem is titled " ktp , " the abbreviation for identity card in indonesia . " ktp " was written by goenawan mohammad , a poet , writer , thinker , and one of indonesia 's best known cultural critics , with whom ayu utami worked a great deal . bildunterschrift : the indonesian poet goenawan mohammad is very interested in identity the poem speaks of the multiple identities of jakarta 's inhabitants .
each year , at least 300,000 more people arrive in the city , from all over indonesia .
but the city does not change them very much .
nor do they change the city .
most come here to work and do not bring their traditions with them .
so jakarta , this city where languages and cultures live side by side , never really becomes their home . twenty languages spoken we go back to the car , where our driver is speaking in javanese to his wife on his mobile phone .
in jakarta , at least 20 languages are spoken .
like the driver , ayu utami was not born in the capital but came as a child .
her family hails from bogor , where people speak mostly sundanese . she wrote her first novel " saman " in the national language bahasa indonesia .
it quickly became a bestseller in this modern babylon and was then translated into many other languages . ayu utami tries her hand at reading aloud : " he looked at me .
then deep into my eyes , before sitting down next to rosano .
it was actually a very brief contact .
as if he were shy , but at the same time proud , manly … he looked at my tray and said ' you do n't eat much . '
sihar situmorang .
he smiled .
sihar mostly spoke in the jakarta dialect .
occasionally a batak expression came through , usually when he got excited .
to her ears , it sounded warm and comfortable … " bringing literature to public spaces " saman " tells the story of a catholic priest who sides with the poor .
he then falls in love and gives up his priesthood .
it is also the story of a group of women , who break out of their traditional roles .
published in 1988 , it was named best novel by the jakarta arts council . ayu utami is now a member of jakarta arts council and tells me about the projects .
" last year , we focused on the subject of cities .
many groups worked with our committees on this theme .
the literature and arts committee joined forces .
and then a multitude of graffiti and murals with literary quotes from well-known indonesian writers were created in various places around the city .
behind it was the idea of how to take art and culture out of museums and bring it to the public ?
the graffiti and murals were supposed to become part of people 's daily life . " literature and art in public spaces ?
not locked up behind walls ?
is this ayu utami ’ s comment on the politics of this megacity ? bildunterschrift : ayu utami insists on writing about the problems of indonesia she replies that politics in jakarta are more and more for the rich .
many laws criminalize the poor , and then they are thrown in jail .
political issues are a natural part of her stories and articles . " i ca n't just separate my writing with problems faced by the people , the problems of indonesia .
i can not write in an ivory tower . " ' like a huge river , with no beginning or end ' now jakarta is full of graffiti , protest drawings and some of the literary murals have not been painted over , yet .
the dynamism of these changes tells stories about what is on people 's minds . 15 minutes away by car , there is another mural with jakarta 's skyline under a bright blue sky .
there is a young man sporting a crimson shirt in the picture .
he is wearing sunglasses and looking at a piece of paper .
on it is a poem by sitor situmorang , called " jabotabek , " which talks about the semanggi bridge , jakarta 's first modern bridge . " semanggi , from here , from this clover-leaf shaped concrete bridge ; i look at this large city , and at the traffic today , which flows underneath this bridge , like a huge river , with no beginning , nor an end .

the graffiti and murals were supposed to become part of people 's daily life . " literature and art in public spaces ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 25.08.2010 electronic devices speed up international development work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handheld devices are helping wfp workers in the field the world food program is using technology to speed efforts to learn where food aid is needed .
with handheld devices , the organization is able to get more accurate data and transmit it wirelessly back to headquarters . the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- in burundi is using handheld personal digital assistants , or pdas , to help keep tabs on the country 's food situation .
the technology has helped speed up the process of data collection and improve the accuracy of the organization 's food security surveys .
staff members organize fact-finding missions to gauge the country 's food supply .
when wfp arrived in burundi in 1968 , the organization was using pen and paper to conduct their food surveys .
now , wfp uses small palmtop computers , only slightly larger than normal cell phones and light enough to carry .
the devices have held up against the strong burundian heat and can last for days before needing a recharge .
" so you have the speed of gathering data , which means you can expand your survey area , and that makes it more valid by interviewing more people , " marc neilson said , a public information officer for wfp burundi .
the organization provides food assistance to more than 600,000 " food-insecure " burundians and some 90 million people around the world every year .
wfp plans to provide about 3.7 million tons of food in 73 countries to those unable to produce or obtain enough food for themselves and their families .
bildunterschrift : wfp provides food assistance to about 90 million people worldwide a welcome development in bihogo village in northern burundi , wfp program assistant gerard bisman uses his pda to conduct a 20-question survey with local residents about their food needs and living standards .
" it 's very interesting to use the device because it 's a lot faster , " he said .
" it used to take us about an hour-and-a-half to complete the entire interview with paper , and now it takes only half-an-hour . "
since he started using the device in march , bisman has eliminated prep time , paper shuffling and the need to decipher sloppy hand writing , which has reduced the margin of error .
the wfp staffer said residents also appreciate the technology , noting that survey-takers used to get " very , very tired " back when the questionnaire was conducted by hand .
bihogo resident elisabeth tembaidai had never been interviewed by wfp before .
the 56-year-old primary school teacher said it is the first time she has seen a pda - and the device shows the country is making progress .
a few years ago , tembaidai received food aid from wfp during a drought .
she said she hopes wfp will provide her with food this year , too .
" well , we will probably need some help in regards to food this year because the water that used to come from up north does n't come anymore , " she said .
" it 's the dry season also , and we are short of food at the moment , and we are asking wfp for some food now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pdas allow wfp to transmit data wirelessly high-speed , wireless transmission information is currently collected on a memory card and sent to the main wfp office in bujumbura , but soon wfp field staff will be able to transmit their findings wirelessly .
burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world , with annual per capita income averaging about $ 300 , or 236 euros .
in 2006 , the country emerged from a 13-year civil war ; one rebel group laid down its arms just last year .
now , however , the country has a new high-speed 3g wireless network .
by sending data wirelessly to the central database for analysis , wfp staff can provide up-to-date information from around the country , helping streamline planning on food shipments . the pda 's price tag is about $ 200 , or 158 euros - and providing two devices in each of burundi 's 15 provinces costs about $ 6,000 , or 4728 euros , not including training costs .
but neilson said the devices are a good investment : " any time you can save doing that , it means those most at risk - the poor - are getting the assistance faster and more effectively , and you 're not perhaps going in an area where you really should n't be , " he said .
" wfp needs to be in the areas that are most at risk .
that 's the bottom line . "
bildunterschrift : scratch card ' e-vouchers ' allow beneficiaries more options to receive food aid scratch card ' e-vouchers ' wfp has put the pdas to use elsewhere in africa , including the congo and mozambique .
in zambia , wfp distributes " e-voucher " scratch cards to improve the food voucher program .
instead of lining up for food aid , people can now choose when and where to pick up their monthly assistance .
the scratch card codes are entered into a mobile phone upon delivery of the food .
wfp said the program reduces transaction costs and increases the " efficiency and effectiveness " of food distribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wfp 's scratch card program reduces the transaction costs of food distribution in syria , 130,000 iraqi refugees receiving food aid are able to get the wfp 's " virtual vouchers " via text message .
the electronic vouchers can be exchanged for items not normally included in conventional aid baskets , such as rice , wheat flour , lentils , chickpeas , oil and canned fish , as well as cheese and eggs .
other organizations are also taking advantage of the new technologies in the field .
in the west african countries of togo and niger , the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- has worked with pdas equipped with gps capabilities to help prevent malaria .
a team of scientists used the electronic devices to collect high-quality data on the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets . in the asia-pacific region , un children 's fund staff use pda questionnaires to provide rapid assessments in emergency situations .
local statistical data on livelihood , poverty , health and nutrition can help inform situation reports , as well as high-level government officials .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 25.08.2010 electronic devices speed up international development work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handheld devices are helping wfp workers in the field the world food program is using technology to speed efforts to learn where food aid is needed .
with handheld devices , the organization is able to get more accurate data and transmit it wirelessly back to headquarters . the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- in burundi is using handheld personal digital assistants , or pdas , to help keep tabs on the country 's food situation .
the technology has helped speed up the process of data collection and improve the accuracy of the organization 's food security surveys .
staff members organize fact-finding missions to gauge the country 's food supply .
when wfp arrived in burundi in 1968 , the organization was using pen and paper to conduct their food surveys .
now , wfp uses small palmtop computers , only slightly larger than normal cell phones and light enough to carry .
the devices have held up against the strong burundian heat and can last for days before needing a recharge .
" so you have the speed of gathering data , which means you can expand your survey area , and that makes it more valid by interviewing more people , " marc neilson said , a public information officer for wfp burundi .
the organization provides food assistance to more than 600,000 " food-insecure " burundians and some 90 million people around the world every year .
wfp plans to provide about 3.7 million tons of food in 73 countries to those unable to produce or obtain enough food for themselves and their families .
bildunterschrift : wfp provides food assistance to about 90 million people worldwide a welcome development in bihogo village in northern burundi , wfp program assistant gerard bisman uses his pda to conduct a 20-question survey with local residents about their food needs and living standards .
" it 's very interesting to use the device because it 's a lot faster , " he said .
" it used to take us about an hour-and-a-half to complete the entire interview with paper , and now it takes only half-an-hour . "
since he started using the device in march , bisman has eliminated prep time , paper shuffling and the need to decipher sloppy hand writing , which has reduced the margin of error .
the wfp staffer said residents also appreciate the technology , noting that survey-takers used to get " very , very tired " back when the questionnaire was conducted by hand .
bihogo resident elisabeth tembaidai had never been interviewed by wfp before .
the 56-year-old primary school teacher said it is the first time she has seen a pda - and the device shows the country is making progress .
a few years ago , tembaidai received food aid from wfp during a drought .
she said she hopes wfp will provide her with food this year , too .
" well , we will probably need some help in regards to food this year because the water that used to come from up north does n't come anymore , " she said .
" it 's the dry season also , and we are short of food at the moment , and we are asking wfp for some food now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pdas allow wfp to transmit data wirelessly high-speed , wireless transmission information is currently collected on a memory card and sent to the main wfp office in bujumbura , but soon wfp field staff will be able to transmit their findings wirelessly .
burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world , with annual per capita income averaging about $ 300 , or 236 euros .
in 2006 , the country emerged from a 13-year civil war ; one rebel group laid down its arms just last year .
now , however , the country has a new high-speed 3g wireless network .
by sending data wirelessly to the central database for analysis , wfp staff can provide up-to-date information from around the country , helping streamline planning on food shipments . the pda 's price tag is about $ 200 , or 158 euros - and providing two devices in each of burundi 's 15 provinces costs about $ 6,000 , or 4728 euros , not including training costs .
but neilson said the devices are a good investment : " any time you can save doing that , it means those most at risk - the poor - are getting the assistance faster and more effectively , and you 're not perhaps going in an area where you really should n't be , " he said .
" wfp needs to be in the areas that are most at risk .
that 's the bottom line . "
bildunterschrift : scratch card ' e-vouchers ' allow beneficiaries more options to receive food aid scratch card ' e-vouchers ' wfp has put the pdas to use elsewhere in africa , including the congo and mozambique .
in zambia , wfp distributes " e-voucher " scratch cards to improve the food voucher program .
instead of lining up for food aid , people can now choose when and where to pick up their monthly assistance .
the scratch card codes are entered into a mobile phone upon delivery of the food .
wfp said the program reduces transaction costs and increases the " efficiency and effectiveness " of food distribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wfp 's scratch card program reduces the transaction costs of food distribution in syria , 130,000 iraqi refugees receiving food aid are able to get the wfp 's " virtual vouchers " via text message .
the electronic vouchers can be exchanged for items not normally included in conventional aid baskets , such as rice , wheat flour , lentils , chickpeas , oil and canned fish , as well as cheese and eggs .
other organizations are also taking advantage of the new technologies in the field .
in the west african countries of togo and niger , the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- has worked with pdas equipped with gps capabilities to help prevent malaria .
a team of scientists used the electronic devices to collect high-quality data on the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets . in the asia-pacific region , un children 's fund staff use pda questionnaires to provide rapid assessments in emergency situations .
local statistical data on livelihood , poverty , health and nutrition can help inform situation reports , as well as high-level government officials .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 25.08.2010 germans are falling in love with tango großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emotion and speed are crucial in tango the germans may not be famous for passionate physical expression , but many are swooning for argentinean tango .
last year , it was added to unesco 's world heritage list and for 2010 it has been named dance of the year . as the sound of bandoneons and violins emanates sensuously from the loudspeakers , a man puts his arm around his partner 's waist , pressing her against him .
from the hips up , the two are welded together like one body , while their legs artistically entangle and detangle themselves . it 's a scene that can be found in any number of dance schools across germany that offer the so-called milonga - the insiders ' term for a tango evening . from munich to hamburg , the tango scene has become so well organized that not having a partner is not an excuse not to join in .
networking services are available to help dancers find partners and travel agencies offer special holiday packages for tango fans . not as easy as it looks despite all the enthusiasm , going from the beginners ' class to being able to glide across the dance floor like a professional is quite a lot of work and takes more than a little talent . " the tango is one of the most difficult dances in the world , " norma raimondi said , a teacher at the don tango club in cologne .
" of course it depends on each person 's talent , but it generally takes a good three years to be able to dance spontaneously , without having to think about each step in advance . " " at the beginning i was just curious , but now it 's like a drug , i have to dance more and more , " said johanna , one of raimondi 's dance student 's , who preferred not to give her last name .
and a certain addiction is necessary to invest so much time into perfecting the dance . bildunterschrift : being comfortable with the steps can take years born out of trials prominent argentinean tango composer enrique santos discepolo -lrb- 1901-1951 -rrb- once said , " the tango is a sad thought that you can dance . "
indeed , that melancholy aspect is inseparably tied to the birthplace of the dance : buenos aires ' old port district , la boca . toward the end of the 19th century , this neighborhood became a gathering place for immigrants who had come to the city on the rio de la plata in search of a better life . tango blended the folklore and the instruments of the immigrants ' homelands to create a completely new sound that would become a symbol of their adopted home : buenos aires . " tango reflects all elements of life , " said 80-year-old luis stazo , a bandoneon player who performed for decades all over the globe with the legendary sexteto mayor .
" it tells how the man betrays the woman and the woman the man .
tango knows horse races , gambling - everything in life .
that 's why tango is much more than a dance . " stazo explained that tango was originally played only with guitar and flute .
later , the bandoneon was added .
the bandoneon - which looks somewhat like an accordion - was invented in the mid-19th century by heinrich band and was initially intended for religious and popular music . " we bandoneon players can thank germany , because the instrument that is so typical for tango and is so important to its soul was invented there , " said stazo . bildunterschrift : a hundred years ago , tango was deamed too sexy for high society frowned upon by the elite corazon , amor y sangre - heart , love and blood - was the immigrants ' motto and describes the soul of the dance .
in the beginning , the big-city argentinean elite rejected the " obscene " tango , which embodied the betrayal , loneliness and failures of the immigrant population . when the foreigners did n't find the riches they had hoped for , many became resigned , turning to gambling or prostitution .
it took many years before tango became socially acceptable . in 1904 , the police even warned against the dance , saying it promoted rivalry among people who , in the end , " always reached for the knife . "
in 1913 , pope st. pius x even condemned the dance . it was , however , too late ; tango had already caught hold .
the roaring twenties ushered in a comeback and in the 21st century it has experienced a revival . " i think that , with tango , many people are looking for a closeness to other people that we are missing in today 's society , " said daniel perusin , an argentinean tango teacher in cologne .
being able to embrace and be embraced is part of what makes tango so fascinating , he added . adjusting to gender roles getting to the point of being able to enjoy the embrace is the first hurdle . " it took me a while to get used to the fact that the man leads , " said dance student johanna .
" as an emancipated european woman , i often tend to want to take the reins . " perusin , on the other hand , said that german men tend to be passive and hesitant and have to learn to take the lead : " they probably think that if they take the active role the women will get upset . " nevertheless , whatever may be holding germans back from expressing themselves fully in this type of dance is still not stopping many of them from giving it a try . author : suzanne cords -lrb- ew / kjb -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

paris is standing by on the policy , rejecting criticism . the european union 's top justice official expressed concern on wednesday over france 's decision to repatriate roma people to romania and bulgaria , but stopped short of directly criticising the expulsions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reding will report her findings next week " it is clear that those who break the law need to face consequences , " commissioner viviane reding said in a statement .
" it is equally clear that nobody should face expulsion just for being roma . "
reding said her office was analyzing the situation in france to determine whether the repatriation complied with eu laws on free movement of people .

paris is standing by on the policy , rejecting criticism . the european union 's top justice official expressed concern on wednesday over france 's decision to repatriate roma people to romania and bulgaria , but stopped short of directly criticising the expulsions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reding will report her findings next week " it is clear that those who break the law need to face consequences , " commissioner viviane reding said in a statement .
" it is equally clear that nobody should face expulsion just for being roma . "
reding said her office was analyzing the situation in france to determine whether the repatriation complied with eu laws on free movement of people .
she also said she regretted " that some of the rhetoric that has been used in some member states in the past weeks has been openly discriminatory and inflammatory . "
the commission 's findings will be released next week .
transitional agreement applies to roma france has faced international criticism since it began dismantling roma camps and sending ethnic roma found to be living in france illegally back to bulgaria and romania in exchange for a 300 euro -lrb- 385 dollar -rrb- payout .
as part of a transitional agreement for bulgaria and romania , which both joined the eu in 2007 , romanians and bulgarians can travel freely to france but can also be expelled after three months if they can not show they have the financial means to stay in the country .

" none of these issues is easy and none of the solutions can be expected to escape criticism or secure unanimous approval , " the president said , in remarks passed on to the press by government spokesman luc chatel .
when he announced the repatriation operation in late july , sarkozy said the camps were " sources of illegal trafficking , of profoundly shocking living standards , of exploitation of children for begging , of prostitution and of crime . "
asylum talks coming up on wedndesday , french interior minister brice hortefeux defended the operation .
he told rtl radio that 117 camps had so far been dismantled , and 630 people sent home , with 300 more explusions expected by the end of the month .
french officials insist that their policy towards the roma is legitimate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is giving deported roma a 300 euro payout in september , french , spanish , italian , british and german interior ministers will gather along with international officials to discuss migration .
french immigration minister eric besson said the talks were called to discuss " asylum issues and the fight against irregular migration " and would not be " specifically covering a specific nationality or ethnic community . "
he said sarkozy had urged his team " not to get sidetracked by useless controversies . "
the talks start in paris on september 6 .
the meeting has been called ahead of a european conference on asylum , scheduled for september 13-14 in brussels .

paris is standing by on the policy , rejecting criticism . the european union 's top justice official expressed concern on wednesday over france 's decision to repatriate roma people to romania and bulgaria , but stopped short of directly criticising the expulsions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reding will report her findings next week " it is clear that those who break the law need to face consequences , " commissioner viviane reding said in a statement .
" it is equally clear that nobody should face expulsion just for being roma . "
reding said her office was analyzing the situation in france to determine whether the repatriation complied with eu laws on free movement of people .
she also said she regretted " that some of the rhetoric that has been used in some member states in the past weeks has been openly discriminatory and inflammatory . "
the commission 's findings will be released next week .
transitional agreement applies to roma france has faced international criticism since it began dismantling roma camps and sending ethnic roma found to be living in france illegally back to bulgaria and romania in exchange for a 300 euro -lrb- 385 dollar -rrb- payout .
as part of a transitional agreement for bulgaria and romania , which both joined the eu in 2007 , romanians and bulgarians can travel freely to france but can also be expelled after three months if they can not show they have the financial means to stay in the country .
that arrangement ends in 2014 after the two countries have been in the eu for seven years .

" none of these issues is easy and none of the solutions can be expected to escape criticism or secure unanimous approval , " the president said , in remarks passed on to the press by government spokesman luc chatel .
when he announced the repatriation operation in late july , sarkozy said the camps were " sources of illegal trafficking , of profoundly shocking living standards , of exploitation of children for begging , of prostitution and of crime . "
asylum talks coming up on wedndesday , french interior minister brice hortefeux defended the operation .
he told rtl radio that 117 camps had so far been dismantled , and 630 people sent home , with 300 more explusions expected by the end of the month .
french officials insist that their policy towards the roma is legitimate .

french immigration minister eric besson said the talks were called to discuss " asylum issues and the fight against irregular migration " and would not be " specifically covering a specific nationality or ethnic community . "
he said sarkozy had urged his team " not to get sidetracked by useless controversies . "
the talks start in paris on september 6 .

that arrangement ends in 2014 after the two countries have been in the eu for seven years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said the camps had " profoundly shocking living standards " french president nicolas sarkozy told his ministers to stay strong and brace for further protests as his government moves to enact more unpopular reforms , including raising the retirement age .
" none of these issues is easy and none of the solutions can be expected to escape criticism or secure unanimous approval , " the president said , in remarks passed on to the press by government spokesman luc chatel .
when he announced the repatriation operation in late july , sarkozy said the camps were " sources of illegal trafficking , of profoundly shocking living standards , of exploitation of children for begging , of prostitution and of crime . "
asylum talks coming up on wedndesday , french interior minister brice hortefeux defended the operation .
he told rtl radio that 117 camps had so far been dismantled , and 630 people sent home , with 300 more explusions expected by the end of the month .
french officials insist that their policy towards the roma is legitimate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is giving deported roma a 300 euro payout in september , french , spanish , italian , british and german interior ministers will gather along with international officials to discuss migration .
french immigration minister eric besson said the talks were called to discuss " asylum issues and the fight against irregular migration " and would not be " specifically covering a specific nationality or ethnic community . "
he said sarkozy had urged his team " not to get sidetracked by useless controversies . "
the talks start in paris on september 6 .
the meeting has been called ahead of a european conference on asylum , scheduled for september 13-14 in brussels .

reding said her office was analyzing the situation in france to determine whether the repatriation complied with eu laws on free movement of people .
she also said she regretted " that some of the rhetoric that has been used in some member states in the past weeks has been openly discriminatory and inflammatory . "

westerwelle had words of encouragement but said accession rules would remain firm . german foreign minister guido westerwelle met with croatian leaders in zagreb on wednesday , kicking off his three-day trip to the balkans .
on arrival , westerwelle met with president ivo josipovic , prime minister jadranka kosor and foreign minister gordan jandrokovic .
he then gave a speech to the academy of sciences encouraging the country to make the necessary reforms for european union accession .
" if croatia musters all its strength for the final sprint , then -lsb- eu -rsb- membership could be wrapped up soon , perhaps as soon as next year , " westerwelle said .
he added , however , that there would be no concessions on the accession criteria , especially in light of this year 's greek budget crisis .
" if we loosened the rules , we would only sow concerns about taking on new members . "
croatia is set to join the eu in 2012 , and is seen as the least problematic balkan country seeking accession .
westerwelle praised croatia for recently resolving a border conflict with slovenia , the only country from the former yugoslavia that has joined the union .
diplomatic challenge on thursday , westerwelle travels to the serbian capital of belgrade , where he will face the tricky task of dissuading serbia from seeking a new united nations resolution on the status of kosovo .
" he wo n't put too much pressure on serbia , " westerwelle 's spokesman stephan bredohl , who is traveling with him , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is in line with international law " but we 're very clear on kosovo : germany has accepted its independence and it 's very important for us that if serbia wants to join the european union , it needs to be constructive and toe the eu 's line , " he explained .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 and is now officially recognized by 69 countries .
in july , the international court of justice , which serbia had called on to rule on kosovo 's status , declared that its declaration of independence was in line with international law .
serbia refuses to accept the verdict , pressing instead for a un resolution to reopen talks on the status of what it considers the serbian province of kosovo .
germany was one of the first countries to recognize kosovo as an independent state .
five eu member states , however , do not recognize kosovo , meaning the eu can not make it a precondition for serbia to join the eu .
deadlock in bosnia westerwelle is also to visit bosnia-herzegovina on thursday .
nearly 15 years after the dayton peace agreement , which ended the fighting and split bosnia-herzegovina into two largely autonomous entities , the political situation there remains challenging . many serbs , muslims and croats remain pitted against each other ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for october 3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik seeks independence for bosnian serbs while the ruling on kosovo by the international court of justice was well-received in germany , it has also fanned the flames of separatism in the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , the mainly serb bosnian entity .
its leader milorad dodik has threatened secession from bosnia since he came into power in 2006 .
after the verdict on kosovo , he declared that he would start discussions on independence after the elections .
" in bosnia , the foreign minister 's visit will be largely symbolic and he will try to call on voters to be moderate , " bodo weber , an expert on the region at the democratization policy council , told deutsche welle .
focus on the region germany has been criticized for not making the balkans a focus of its foreign policy , not least because it did not send a representative to the eu-balkan summit in sarajevo in june . many are hoping westerwelle 's trip will change that .
" these countries -lsb- in the balkans -rsb- are already part of europe , that 's why their problems are our problems , " said bernd posselt , mep for germany 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in brussels .
" i would hope that the foreign minister will not just see this trip as a photo opportunity , but see it as the start of a much greater focus of his foreign policy , " he added .

with handheld devices , the organization is able to get more accurate data and transmit it wirelessly back to headquarters . the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- in burundi is using handheld personal digital assistants , or pdas , to help keep tabs on the country 's food situation .
the technology has helped speed up the process of data collection and improve the accuracy of the organization 's food security surveys .
staff members organize fact-finding missions to gauge the country 's food supply .
when wfp arrived in burundi in 1968 , the organization was using pen and paper to conduct their food surveys .
now , wfp uses small palmtop computers , only slightly larger than normal cell phones and light enough to carry .
the devices have held up against the strong burundian heat and can last for days before needing a recharge .
" so you have the speed of gathering data , which means you can expand your survey area , and that makes it more valid by interviewing more people , " marc neilson said , a public information officer for wfp burundi .
the organization provides food assistance to more than 600,000 " food-insecure " burundians and some 90 million people around the world every year .
wfp plans to provide about 3.7 million tons of food in 73 countries to those unable to produce or obtain enough food for themselves and their families .
bildunterschrift : wfp provides food assistance to about 90 million people worldwide a welcome development in bihogo village in northern burundi , wfp program assistant gerard bisman uses his pda to conduct a 20-question survey with local residents about their food needs and living standards .
" it 's very interesting to use the device because it 's a lot faster , " he said .
" it used to take us about an hour-and-a-half to complete the entire interview with paper , and now it takes only half-an-hour . "
since he started using the device in march , bisman has eliminated prep time , paper shuffling and the need to decipher sloppy hand writing , which has reduced the margin of error .
the wfp staffer said residents also appreciate the technology , noting that survey-takers used to get " very , very tired " back when the questionnaire was conducted by hand .
bihogo resident elisabeth tembaidai had never been interviewed by wfp before .
the 56-year-old primary school teacher said it is the first time she has seen a pda - and the device shows the country is making progress .
a few years ago , tembaidai received food aid from wfp during a drought .
she said she hopes wfp will provide her with food this year , too .
" well , we will probably need some help in regards to food this year because the water that used to come from up north does n't come anymore , " she said .
" it 's the dry season also , and we are short of food at the moment , and we are asking wfp for some food now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pdas allow wfp to transmit data wirelessly high-speed , wireless transmission information is currently collected on a memory card and sent to the main wfp office in bujumbura , but soon wfp field staff will be able to transmit their findings wirelessly .
burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world , with annual per capita income averaging about $ 300 , or 236 euros .
in 2006 , the country emerged from a 13-year civil war ; one rebel group laid down its arms just last year .
now , however , the country has a new high-speed 3g wireless network .
by sending data wirelessly to the central database for analysis , wfp staff can provide up-to-date information from around the country , helping streamline planning on food shipments . the pda 's price tag is about $ 200 , or 158 euros - and providing two devices in each of burundi 's 15 provinces costs about $ 6,000 , or 4728 euros , not including training costs .
but neilson said the devices are a good investment : " any time you can save doing that , it means those most at risk - the poor - are getting the assistance faster and more effectively , and you 're not perhaps going in an area where you really should n't be , " he said .
" wfp needs to be in the areas that are most at risk .
that 's the bottom line . "
bildunterschrift : scratch card ' e-vouchers ' allow beneficiaries more options to receive food aid scratch card ' e-vouchers ' wfp has put the pdas to use elsewhere in africa , including the congo and mozambique .
in zambia , wfp distributes " e-voucher " scratch cards to improve the food voucher program .
instead of lining up for food aid , people can now choose when and where to pick up their monthly assistance .
the scratch card codes are entered into a mobile phone upon delivery of the food .
wfp said the program reduces transaction costs and increases the " efficiency and effectiveness " of food distribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wfp 's scratch card program reduces the transaction costs of food distribution in syria , 130,000 iraqi refugees receiving food aid are able to get the wfp 's " virtual vouchers " via text message .
the electronic vouchers can be exchanged for items not normally included in conventional aid baskets , such as rice , wheat flour , lentils , chickpeas , oil and canned fish , as well as cheese and eggs .
other organizations are also taking advantage of the new technologies in the field .
in the west african countries of togo and niger , the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- has worked with pdas equipped with gps capabilities to help prevent malaria .
a team of scientists used the electronic devices to collect high-quality data on the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets . in the asia-pacific region , un children 's fund staff use pda questionnaires to provide rapid assessments in emergency situations .
local statistical data on livelihood , poverty , health and nutrition can help inform situation reports , as well as high-level government officials .

with handheld devices , the organization is able to get more accurate data and transmit it wirelessly back to headquarters . the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- in burundi is using handheld personal digital assistants , or pdas , to help keep tabs on the country 's food situation .
the technology has helped speed up the process of data collection and improve the accuracy of the organization 's food security surveys .
staff members organize fact-finding missions to gauge the country 's food supply .
when wfp arrived in burundi in 1968 , the organization was using pen and paper to conduct their food surveys .
now , wfp uses small palmtop computers , only slightly larger than normal cell phones and light enough to carry .
the devices have held up against the strong burundian heat and can last for days before needing a recharge .
" so you have the speed of gathering data , which means you can expand your survey area , and that makes it more valid by interviewing more people , " marc neilson said , a public information officer for wfp burundi .
the organization provides food assistance to more than 600,000 " food-insecure " burundians and some 90 million people around the world every year .
wfp plans to provide about 3.7 million tons of food in 73 countries to those unable to produce or obtain enough food for themselves and their families .
bildunterschrift : wfp provides food assistance to about 90 million people worldwide a welcome development in bihogo village in northern burundi , wfp program assistant gerard bisman uses his pda to conduct a 20-question survey with local residents about their food needs and living standards .
" it 's very interesting to use the device because it 's a lot faster , " he said .
" it used to take us about an hour-and-a-half to complete the entire interview with paper , and now it takes only half-an-hour . "
since he started using the device in march , bisman has eliminated prep time , paper shuffling and the need to decipher sloppy hand writing , which has reduced the margin of error .
the wfp staffer said residents also appreciate the technology , noting that survey-takers used to get " very , very tired " back when the questionnaire was conducted by hand .
bihogo resident elisabeth tembaidai had never been interviewed by wfp before .
the 56-year-old primary school teacher said it is the first time she has seen a pda - and the device shows the country is making progress .
a few years ago , tembaidai received food aid from wfp during a drought .
she said she hopes wfp will provide her with food this year , too .
" well , we will probably need some help in regards to food this year because the water that used to come from up north does n't come anymore , " she said .
" it 's the dry season also , and we are short of food at the moment , and we are asking wfp for some food now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pdas allow wfp to transmit data wirelessly high-speed , wireless transmission information is currently collected on a memory card and sent to the main wfp office in bujumbura , but soon wfp field staff will be able to transmit their findings wirelessly .
burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world , with annual per capita income averaging about $ 300 , or 236 euros .
in 2006 , the country emerged from a 13-year civil war ; one rebel group laid down its arms just last year .
now , however , the country has a new high-speed 3g wireless network .
by sending data wirelessly to the central database for analysis , wfp staff can provide up-to-date information from around the country , helping streamline planning on food shipments . the pda 's price tag is about $ 200 , or 158 euros - and providing two devices in each of burundi 's 15 provinces costs about $ 6,000 , or 4728 euros , not including training costs .
but neilson said the devices are a good investment : " any time you can save doing that , it means those most at risk - the poor - are getting the assistance faster and more effectively , and you 're not perhaps going in an area where you really should n't be , " he said .
" wfp needs to be in the areas that are most at risk .
that 's the bottom line . "
bildunterschrift : scratch card ' e-vouchers ' allow beneficiaries more options to receive food aid scratch card ' e-vouchers ' wfp has put the pdas to use elsewhere in africa , including the congo and mozambique .
in zambia , wfp distributes " e-voucher " scratch cards to improve the food voucher program .
instead of lining up for food aid , people can now choose when and where to pick up their monthly assistance .
the scratch card codes are entered into a mobile phone upon delivery of the food .
wfp said the program reduces transaction costs and increases the " efficiency and effectiveness " of food distribution .

and it 's not that far away , galactically speaking . scientists at the european southern observatory , or eso , announced the discovery of the richest known extrasolar planetary system on tuesday .
after six years of study , eso published its findings that at least five confirmed exoplanets , or extrasolar planets , are orbiting a star only 127 light years away from earth . the five exoplanets all have approximately the mass of neptune - between 13 and 25 times the mass of earth - but orbit much closer to their star , with orbital periods between six and 600 days -lrb- neptune takes 164.79 years to orbit the sun -rrb- . in addition to the five neptune-sized planets , eso astronomers have " tantalizing " evidence of two more exoplanets in the system .
one is saturn-sized , with an orbital period of 2,200 days and the other is the smallest known exoplanet with merely 1.4 earth masses and an orbital period of only 1.18 days . the sun-like star , which is called hd 10180 , is located in the southern constellation hydrus , and has been studied closely since its discovery with the harps spectrograph in la silla , chile .
the existence of the exoplanets was discovered through gravitational wobbles in the behavior of the star caused by the passage of the planets . bildunterschrift : the newly discovered system is only 127 light years from earth familiar traits observed using data from this new discovery as well as data from other planetary systems , the researchers found evidence of the titius-bode law that exists in our solar system : the distances of the planets from their star seem to follow a regular pattern . " this could be a signature of the formation process of these planetary systems , " team member michel mayor said in the eso press release . eso astronomer christophe lovis also acknowledged that this discovery highlights the changes in the field of exoplanet research . " we are now entering a new era in exoplanet research : the study of complex planetary systems and not just of individual planets , " lovis said .
" studies of planetary motions in the new system reveal complex gravitational interactions between the planets and give us insights into the long-term evolution of the system . " through further study of the system around hd 10180 , eso astronomers hope to learn more about planetary formation and about how the solar system was developed , as well as what its future may look like . author : stuart tiffen -lrb- ap / afp -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with handheld devices , the organization is able to get more accurate data and transmit it wirelessly back to headquarters . the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- in burundi is using handheld personal digital assistants , or pdas , to help keep tabs on the country 's food situation .
the technology has helped speed up the process of data collection and improve the accuracy of the organization 's food security surveys .
staff members organize fact-finding missions to gauge the country 's food supply .
when wfp arrived in burundi in 1968 , the organization was using pen and paper to conduct their food surveys .
now , wfp uses small palmtop computers , only slightly larger than normal cell phones and light enough to carry .
the devices have held up against the strong burundian heat and can last for days before needing a recharge .
" so you have the speed of gathering data , which means you can expand your survey area , and that makes it more valid by interviewing more people , " marc neilson said , a public information officer for wfp burundi .
the organization provides food assistance to more than 600,000 " food-insecure " burundians and some 90 million people around the world every year .
wfp plans to provide about 3.7 million tons of food in 73 countries to those unable to produce or obtain enough food for themselves and their families .
bildunterschrift : wfp provides food assistance to about 90 million people worldwide a welcome development in bihogo village in northern burundi , wfp program assistant gerard bisman uses his pda to conduct a 20-question survey with local residents about their food needs and living standards .
" it 's very interesting to use the device because it 's a lot faster , " he said .
" it used to take us about an hour-and-a-half to complete the entire interview with paper , and now it takes only half-an-hour . "
since he started using the device in march , bisman has eliminated prep time , paper shuffling and the need to decipher sloppy hand writing , which has reduced the margin of error .
the wfp staffer said residents also appreciate the technology , noting that survey-takers used to get " very , very tired " back when the questionnaire was conducted by hand .
bihogo resident elisabeth tembaidai had never been interviewed by wfp before .
the 56-year-old primary school teacher said it is the first time she has seen a pda - and the device shows the country is making progress .
a few years ago , tembaidai received food aid from wfp during a drought .
she said she hopes wfp will provide her with food this year , too .
" well , we will probably need some help in regards to food this year because the water that used to come from up north does n't come anymore , " she said .
" it 's the dry season also , and we are short of food at the moment , and we are asking wfp for some food now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pdas allow wfp to transmit data wirelessly high-speed , wireless transmission information is currently collected on a memory card and sent to the main wfp office in bujumbura , but soon wfp field staff will be able to transmit their findings wirelessly .
burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world , with annual per capita income averaging about $ 300 , or 236 euros .
in 2006 , the country emerged from a 13-year civil war ; one rebel group laid down its arms just last year .
now , however , the country has a new high-speed 3g wireless network .
by sending data wirelessly to the central database for analysis , wfp staff can provide up-to-date information from around the country , helping streamline planning on food shipments . the pda 's price tag is about $ 200 , or 158 euros - and providing two devices in each of burundi 's 15 provinces costs about $ 6,000 , or 4728 euros , not including training costs .
but neilson said the devices are a good investment : " any time you can save doing that , it means those most at risk - the poor - are getting the assistance faster and more effectively , and you 're not perhaps going in an area where you really should n't be , " he said .
" wfp needs to be in the areas that are most at risk .
that 's the bottom line . "
bildunterschrift : scratch card ' e-vouchers ' allow beneficiaries more options to receive food aid scratch card ' e-vouchers ' wfp has put the pdas to use elsewhere in africa , including the congo and mozambique .
in zambia , wfp distributes " e-voucher " scratch cards to improve the food voucher program .
instead of lining up for food aid , people can now choose when and where to pick up their monthly assistance .
the scratch card codes are entered into a mobile phone upon delivery of the food .
wfp said the program reduces transaction costs and increases the " efficiency and effectiveness " of food distribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wfp 's scratch card program reduces the transaction costs of food distribution in syria , 130,000 iraqi refugees receiving food aid are able to get the wfp 's " virtual vouchers " via text message .
the electronic vouchers can be exchanged for items not normally included in conventional aid baskets , such as rice , wheat flour , lentils , chickpeas , oil and canned fish , as well as cheese and eggs .
other organizations are also taking advantage of the new technologies in the field .
in the west african countries of togo and niger , the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- has worked with pdas equipped with gps capabilities to help prevent malaria .
a team of scientists used the electronic devices to collect high-quality data on the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets . in the asia-pacific region , un children 's fund staff use pda questionnaires to provide rapid assessments in emergency situations .
local statistical data on livelihood , poverty , health and nutrition can help inform situation reports , as well as high-level government officials .

and it 's not that far away , galactically speaking . scientists at the european southern observatory , or eso , announced the discovery of the richest known extrasolar planetary system on tuesday .
after six years of study , eso published its findings that at least five confirmed exoplanets , or extrasolar planets , are orbiting a star only 127 light years away from earth . the five exoplanets all have approximately the mass of neptune - between 13 and 25 times the mass of earth - but orbit much closer to their star , with orbital periods between six and 600 days -lrb- neptune takes 164.79 years to orbit the sun -rrb- . in addition to the five neptune-sized planets , eso astronomers have " tantalizing " evidence of two more exoplanets in the system .
one is saturn-sized , with an orbital period of 2,200 days and the other is the smallest known exoplanet with merely 1.4 earth masses and an orbital period of only 1.18 days . the sun-like star , which is called hd 10180 , is located in the southern constellation hydrus , and has been studied closely since its discovery with the harps spectrograph in la silla , chile .
the existence of the exoplanets was discovered through gravitational wobbles in the behavior of the star caused by the passage of the planets . bildunterschrift : the newly discovered system is only 127 light years from earth familiar traits observed using data from this new discovery as well as data from other planetary systems , the researchers found evidence of the titius-bode law that exists in our solar system : the distances of the planets from their star seem to follow a regular pattern . " this could be a signature of the formation process of these planetary systems , " team member michel mayor said in the eso press release . eso astronomer christophe lovis also acknowledged that this discovery highlights the changes in the field of exoplanet research . " we are now entering a new era in exoplanet research : the study of complex planetary systems and not just of individual planets , " lovis said .
" studies of planetary motions in the new system reveal complex gravitational interactions between the planets and give us insights into the long-term evolution of the system . " through further study of the system around hd 10180 , eso astronomers hope to learn more about planetary formation and about how the solar system was developed , as well as what its future may look like . author : stuart tiffen -lrb- ap / afp -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

westerwelle had words of encouragement but said accession rules would remain firm . german foreign minister guido westerwelle met with croatian leaders in zagreb on wednesday , kicking off his three-day trip to the balkans .
on arrival , westerwelle met with president ivo josipovic , prime minister jadranka kosor and foreign minister gordan jandrokovic .
he then gave a speech to the academy of sciences encouraging the country to make the necessary reforms for european union accession .
" if croatia musters all its strength for the final sprint , then -lsb- eu -rsb- membership could be wrapped up soon , perhaps as soon as next year , " westerwelle said .
he added , however , that there would be no concessions on the accession criteria , especially in light of this year 's greek budget crisis .
" if we loosened the rules , we would only sow concerns about taking on new members . "
croatia is set to join the eu in 2012 , and is seen as the least problematic balkan country seeking accession .
westerwelle praised croatia for recently resolving a border conflict with slovenia , the only country from the former yugoslavia that has joined the union .
diplomatic challenge on thursday , westerwelle travels to the serbian capital of belgrade , where he will face the tricky task of dissuading serbia from seeking a new united nations resolution on the status of kosovo .
" he wo n't put too much pressure on serbia , " westerwelle 's spokesman stephan bredohl , who is traveling with him , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is in line with international law " but we 're very clear on kosovo : germany has accepted its independence and it 's very important for us that if serbia wants to join the european union , it needs to be constructive and toe the eu 's line , " he explained .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 and is now officially recognized by 69 countries .
in july , the international court of justice , which serbia had called on to rule on kosovo 's status , declared that its declaration of independence was in line with international law .
serbia refuses to accept the verdict , pressing instead for a un resolution to reopen talks on the status of what it considers the serbian province of kosovo .
germany was one of the first countries to recognize kosovo as an independent state .
five eu member states , however , do not recognize kosovo , meaning the eu can not make it a precondition for serbia to join the eu .
deadlock in bosnia westerwelle is also to visit bosnia-herzegovina on thursday .
nearly 15 years after the dayton peace agreement , which ended the fighting and split bosnia-herzegovina into two largely autonomous entities , the political situation there remains challenging . many serbs , muslims and croats remain pitted against each other ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for october 3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik seeks independence for bosnian serbs while the ruling on kosovo by the international court of justice was well-received in germany , it has also fanned the flames of separatism in the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , the mainly serb bosnian entity .
its leader milorad dodik has threatened secession from bosnia since he came into power in 2006 .
after the verdict on kosovo , he declared that he would start discussions on independence after the elections .
" in bosnia , the foreign minister 's visit will be largely symbolic and he will try to call on voters to be moderate , " bodo weber , an expert on the region at the democratization policy council , told deutsche welle .
focus on the region germany has been criticized for not making the balkans a focus of its foreign policy , not least because it did not send a representative to the eu-balkan summit in sarajevo in june . many are hoping westerwelle 's trip will change that .

" i would hope that the foreign minister will not just see this trip as a photo opportunity , but see it as the start of a much greater focus of his foreign policy , " he added .

new research shows that there 's a physiological cause that could be treated with dietary supplements . after the relative calm of pregnancy , giving birth is a physically and emotionally draining experience .
but the changes do n't stop there .
a woman 's estrogen levels drop significantly , and she now has to care for a crying baby 24 hours a day .
given these circumstances it 's no wonder that up to 75 percent of new mothers around the world feel down for a few days after giving birth .
but new research has found there 's an additional neurological cause to the baby blues as well .
feelings of impotence anne-christin b. , who prefered not to use her last name due to the stigma of postpartum depression , is a 33-year-old mother from berlin .
for the first day or two after her daughter was born four months ago , she felt happy , but that quickly changed .
" then came the feeling that i could n't do things .
i was afraid .
i could n't do things for the child - for whatever reason , " she remembered .
" and then i started to withdraw , i could n't go out or talk with friends on the telephone and this increased very quickly to the point where i could n't be by myself anymore . "
anne-christin is n't the only one .
millions of german women also experience the baby blues .
in her case , she was one of 15 percent of women who develop postpartum depression .
she went to her local doctor , but he did n't take her seriously , so she sought professional psychiatric help .
the source of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decreased serotonin levels are believed to be a culprit of postpartum depression dr. julia sacher , from the max planck institute for human cognitive and brain sciences in leipzig , said it 's well-documented that a sharp drop in estrogen levels and a big change in environment contribute to the baby blues .
that 's why research in this area is incredibly important .
" what we do know is that those women who have severe symptoms of postpartum blues have a higher risk of experiencing a full-blown episode later on , " sacher said .
sacher and her colleagues published the results of their study in the peer-reviewed journal , archives of general psychiatry , earlier this summer .
they found that there is a neurological cause for the baby blues .
" we see an increase in monoamine oxidase a and this can lead to a loss of serotonin , and a loss of serotonin has been associated with low mood , " sacher explained .
feeling sad after childbirth is socially unacceptable other medical professionals , like dr. stephanie krueger , said that this new study may prompt obstetricians to keep an eye on a mother 's moods both before and after childbirth .
krueger is a professor of psychiatry at the charite in berlin , one of the largest university hospitals in europe .
she treated anne-christin for post-partum depression . krueger - who was n't part of the study - said most women who feel depressed after their child is born do n't seek necessary help , because it 's not socially acceptable to feel sad at this time .
" in our culture , women who have just given birth are supposed to be happy , and if they are not , then there 's something wrong with them and they are actually treated as some kind of an outlaw , " krueger said , adding , " in many cases they are being told : why are n't you happy ? "
krueger believes there needs to be more education and support for new mothers .
" families and gps -lsb- general practitioner -rsb- should not take these things lightly and not say , ' well yeah i understand you 've just given birth - everything will be fine ' , " krueger said .
" physicians and families should take any symptoms of depression seriously and go to someone who knows what they are doing , meaning a psychiatrist , for example . "
berlin mother anne-christin b. said she wished her doctors and other medical professionals had talked to her about the baby blues during the pregnancy .
" it would have been better if , even in a midwifery course , there was perhaps 30 minutes or an hour discussion in preparation for pregnancy , where it was explained , where you explain the symptoms and also tell people where they can call for help , " anne-christin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the dramatic life changes brought by babies contribute to depression dietary supplements could help while the baby blues usually goes away by itself after a couple of days , dr. sacher from the max planck institute said treating this temporary condition could be an important step in preventing postpartum depression .
she thinks the baby blues could be treated with medication or dietary supplements , which could counter the increase in the enzyme monoamine oxidase a. but not everyone agrees the baby blues can be prevented so easily .
lisa fehrenbach has been a midwife for 35 years .
she said feeling a bit down after childbirth is a natural thing because childbirth is a physically and emotionally life-changing experience .
many women go from working full-time to being at home with a crying baby - often by themselves .
" you had a completely independent life and you organized everything and you had everything under control and suddenly there 's a little baby , " said fehrenbach , " it clings to your body 24 hours and you have to care for it 24 hours and you can not do what you want , but you have to do what the baby wants . "
fehrenbach said even if women took dietary supplements to counter the enzyme increase , they still have to adjust to this new baby in their lives .
beyond making pregnant women aware of the physiological and psychological changes in their bodies , both sacher and krueger agree this problem needs to be discussed openly in order to fight the stigma of postpartum blues and depression .
" postpartum disorders are nothing the woman is responsible for .
they ca n't help it , " krueger said .
" it has biological reasons for the most part and it can be treated effectively and it should be treated effectively . "
sacher 's next step will be to test for the elevated enzyme in postpartum depression .

lisa fehrenbach has been a midwife for 35 years .
she said feeling a bit down after childbirth is a natural thing because childbirth is a physically and emotionally life-changing experience .
many women go from working full-time to being at home with a crying baby - often by themselves .
" you had a completely independent life and you organized everything and you had everything under control and suddenly there 's a little baby , " said fehrenbach , " it clings to your body 24 hours and you have to care for it 24 hours and you can not do what you want , but you have to do what the baby wants . "
fehrenbach said even if women took dietary supplements to counter the enzyme increase , they still have to adjust to this new baby in their lives .
beyond making pregnant women aware of the physiological and psychological changes in their bodies , both sacher and krueger agree this problem needs to be discussed openly in order to fight the stigma of postpartum blues and depression .
" postpartum disorders are nothing the woman is responsible for .
they ca n't help it , " krueger said .
" it has biological reasons for the most part and it can be treated effectively and it should be treated effectively . "
sacher 's next step will be to test for the elevated enzyme in postpartum depression .

new research shows that there 's a physiological cause that could be treated with dietary supplements . after the relative calm of pregnancy , giving birth is a physically and emotionally draining experience .
but the changes do n't stop there .
a woman 's estrogen levels drop significantly , and she now has to care for a crying baby 24 hours a day .
given these circumstances it 's no wonder that up to 75 percent of new mothers around the world feel down for a few days after giving birth .
but new research has found there 's an additional neurological cause to the baby blues as well .
feelings of impotence anne-christin b. , who prefered not to use her last name due to the stigma of postpartum depression , is a 33-year-old mother from berlin .
for the first day or two after her daughter was born four months ago , she felt happy , but that quickly changed .
" then came the feeling that i could n't do things .
i was afraid .
i could n't do things for the child - for whatever reason , " she remembered .
" and then i started to withdraw , i could n't go out or talk with friends on the telephone and this increased very quickly to the point where i could n't be by myself anymore . "
anne-christin is n't the only one .
millions of german women also experience the baby blues .
in her case , she was one of 15 percent of women who develop postpartum depression .
she went to her local doctor , but he did n't take her seriously , so she sought professional psychiatric help .
the source of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decreased serotonin levels are believed to be a culprit of postpartum depression dr. julia sacher , from the max planck institute for human cognitive and brain sciences in leipzig , said it 's well-documented that a sharp drop in estrogen levels and a big change in environment contribute to the baby blues .
that 's why research in this area is incredibly important .
" what we do know is that those women who have severe symptoms of postpartum blues have a higher risk of experiencing a full-blown episode later on , " sacher said .
sacher and her colleagues published the results of their study in the peer-reviewed journal , archives of general psychiatry , earlier this summer .
they found that there is a neurological cause for the baby blues .
" we see an increase in monoamine oxidase a and this can lead to a loss of serotonin , and a loss of serotonin has been associated with low mood , " sacher explained .
feeling sad after childbirth is socially unacceptable other medical professionals , like dr. stephanie krueger , said that this new study may prompt obstetricians to keep an eye on a mother 's moods both before and after childbirth .
krueger is a professor of psychiatry at the charite in berlin , one of the largest university hospitals in europe .
she treated anne-christin for post-partum depression . krueger - who was n't part of the study - said most women who feel depressed after their child is born do n't seek necessary help , because it 's not socially acceptable to feel sad at this time .
" in our culture , women who have just given birth are supposed to be happy , and if they are not , then there 's something wrong with them and they are actually treated as some kind of an outlaw , " krueger said , adding , " in many cases they are being told : why are n't you happy ? "
krueger believes there needs to be more education and support for new mothers .
" families and gps -lsb- general practitioner -rsb- should not take these things lightly and not say , ' well yeah i understand you 've just given birth - everything will be fine ' , " krueger said .
" physicians and families should take any symptoms of depression seriously and go to someone who knows what they are doing , meaning a psychiatrist , for example . "
berlin mother anne-christin b. said she wished her doctors and other medical professionals had talked to her about the baby blues during the pregnancy .

i could n't do things for the child - for whatever reason , " she remembered .
" and then i started to withdraw , i could n't go out or talk with friends on the telephone and this increased very quickly to the point where i could n't be by myself anymore . "
anne-christin is n't the only one .
millions of german women also experience the baby blues .
in her case , she was one of 15 percent of women who develop postpartum depression .
she went to her local doctor , but he did n't take her seriously , so she sought professional psychiatric help .
the source of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decreased serotonin levels are believed to be a culprit of postpartum depression dr. julia sacher , from the max planck institute for human cognitive and brain sciences in leipzig , said it 's well-documented that a sharp drop in estrogen levels and a big change in environment contribute to the baby blues .
that 's why research in this area is incredibly important .
" what we do know is that those women who have severe symptoms of postpartum blues have a higher risk of experiencing a full-blown episode later on , " sacher said .
sacher and her colleagues published the results of their study in the peer-reviewed journal , archives of general psychiatry , earlier this summer .
they found that there is a neurological cause for the baby blues .
" we see an increase in monoamine oxidase a and this can lead to a loss of serotonin , and a loss of serotonin has been associated with low mood , " sacher explained .
feeling sad after childbirth is socially unacceptable other medical professionals , like dr. stephanie krueger , said that this new study may prompt obstetricians to keep an eye on a mother 's moods both before and after childbirth .
krueger is a professor of psychiatry at the charite in berlin , one of the largest university hospitals in europe .
she treated anne-christin for post-partum depression . krueger - who was n't part of the study - said most women who feel depressed after their child is born do n't seek necessary help , because it 's not socially acceptable to feel sad at this time .
" in our culture , women who have just given birth are supposed to be happy , and if they are not , then there 's something wrong with them and they are actually treated as some kind of an outlaw , " krueger said , adding , " in many cases they are being told : why are n't you happy ? "
krueger believes there needs to be more education and support for new mothers .
" families and gps -lsb- general practitioner -rsb- should not take these things lightly and not say , ' well yeah i understand you 've just given birth - everything will be fine ' , " krueger said .
" physicians and families should take any symptoms of depression seriously and go to someone who knows what they are doing , meaning a psychiatrist , for example . "
berlin mother anne-christin b. said she wished her doctors and other medical professionals had talked to her about the baby blues during the pregnancy .
" it would have been better if , even in a midwifery course , there was perhaps 30 minutes or an hour discussion in preparation for pregnancy , where it was explained , where you explain the symptoms and also tell people where they can call for help , " anne-christin said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the dramatic life changes brought by babies contribute to depression dietary supplements could help while the baby blues usually goes away by itself after a couple of days , dr. sacher from the max planck institute said treating this temporary condition could be an important step in preventing postpartum depression .
she thinks the baby blues could be treated with medication or dietary supplements , which could counter the increase in the enzyme monoamine oxidase a. but not everyone agrees the baby blues can be prevented so easily .
lisa fehrenbach has been a midwife for 35 years .
she said feeling a bit down after childbirth is a natural thing because childbirth is a physically and emotionally life-changing experience .
many women go from working full-time to being at home with a crying baby - often by themselves .
" you had a completely independent life and you organized everything and you had everything under control and suddenly there 's a little baby , " said fehrenbach , " it clings to your body 24 hours and you have to care for it 24 hours and you can not do what you want , but you have to do what the baby wants . "
fehrenbach said even if women took dietary supplements to counter the enzyme increase , they still have to adjust to this new baby in their lives .
beyond making pregnant women aware of the physiological and psychological changes in their bodies , both sacher and krueger agree this problem needs to be discussed openly in order to fight the stigma of postpartum blues and depression .
" postpartum disorders are nothing the woman is responsible for .
they ca n't help it , " krueger said .
" it has biological reasons for the most part and it can be treated effectively and it should be treated effectively . "
sacher 's next step will be to test for the elevated enzyme in postpartum depression .

after six years of study , eso published its findings that at least five confirmed exoplanets , or extrasolar planets , are orbiting a star only 127 light years away from earth . the five exoplanets all have approximately the mass of neptune - between 13 and 25 times the mass of earth - but orbit much closer to their star , with orbital periods between six and 600 days -lrb- neptune takes 164.79 years to orbit the sun -rrb- . in addition to the five neptune-sized planets , eso astronomers have " tantalizing " evidence of two more exoplanets in the system .

one of the key issues is the country 's fledgling economic recovery .
but the party that is leading in the opinion polls wants to forge closer ties with russia . latvia is slowly emerging from recession with the help of money from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the european union .
the economic recovery is likely to play a central role in the parliamentary elections in october .
latvians will effectively be voting either to continue the government 's austerity program , or to refuse help from international donors , and instead increase the country 's dependency on russia .
october 2nd is decision time come election day , latvians will choose between 10 parties , or alliances , running for the 100-seat parliament , or saeima .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the latvian economy is recovering with help from the imf and the eu recent opinion polls show that the pro-kremlin " harmony centre " bloc is currently the most popular party .
it was formed in april this year , and polls indicate that around 20 percent of people intend to vote for it .
nellija locmele is the editor of the weekly news and current affairs magazine " ir . "
she is alarmed at the prospect of " harmony centre " winning the most seats in parliament : " harmony centre is … not a stable party , " locmele said .
" it 's new and has n't proved itself over the years , so we are not able to assess its policies and ideology in practice . "
locmele is concerned that there are politicians with very differing views on how to boost the economy within the party .
the country is at a crossroads latvia is at a crossroads in terms of its further economic and political development .
in order to keep the economic recovery on track , locmele feels the country needs to stick to its structural reforms .
but " harmony centre " wants latvia to have closer economic and political ties with russia .
political scientist janis ikstens says this is part of an increasing trend in latvia , but he warns that this could be dangerous : " what is striking is that this discourse has barely changed after one of the leaders of " harmony centre " openly threatened to stage bloodshed à la bishkek in riga if his political platform is not fulfilled .
this is i think absolutely unacceptable in a democratic society . "
current government is struggling despite the fact that the present government managed to halt the economic recession under prime minister valdia dombrovskis , his pro-western alliance " unity " is falling behind in the polls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current prime minister is struggling in opinion polls liga stafecka of delna , the latvian chapter of transparency international , says that voters do n't appreciate the gravity of the situation .
" people in latvia are perplexed and confused because many political unions or blocs have been established , " she said . " the voters find it very hard to distinguish one bloc from the other . "
the latest figures show that around 20 per cent of voters in latvia have n't still decided who they will vote for .
and about one fifth intend to ignore the general election altogether . the politicians have just five weeks left to change this .

our readers shared some of their own observations . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
third infant death heats debate about hygiene in german hospitals i have lived in germany for 15 years and during that time my family and i have been to a number of german hospitals , clinics and doctors for everything from back surgery to tonsil surgery , child birth , emergency room enrollments and the flu .
the care has been outstanding and the medical staffs have been top notch .
my biggest observation concerns hygiene .
i have had my blood taken by nurses who did not wear gloves .
i have seen doctors remove bandages with their bare hands .
this is not always the rule , but it has happened enough to make me acknowledge the systemic nature of this oversight .
outside of this , i have never had a major concern that any facility does not meet or exceed standards in the us -lrb- my only comparative standard -rrb- .
i would definitely agree , however , that all medical facilities , wherever they may be , should ratchet up any-and-all policies put in place to avoid a recurrence of the mainz tragedy . - scott , us i spent three months in germany late last year and my girlfriend at the time was a registered nurse .
i visited the hospital where she worked on numerous occasions and from an outsider 's point of view there were numerous signs informing everyone how important it was to maintain a clean and sterile working environment .
i noted how much cleaner the hospital was compared to those back in australia . - paul , australia wow , that 's sad .
i 'm glad germany is taking lax standards seriously though .
i think other countries should as well .
doctors get paid very well ; the least they can do is obey the hygiene standards that would make a computer chip manufacturer laugh .
medicine does n't have the highest hygiene standards , electronics does . - fergal via facebook it was long ago , but i went in with measles as an adult and was there for two weeks .
it was different from my experiences in the us and japan , but i was well treated , pampered by the orderlies -lrb- who pitied my bad vacation luck -rrb- , and left with ... a bill that was only a minor fraction of what it would have been in the us .
my only complaint was the bells from the church across the street from my room .
they were so … odd - a rather avant garde sound to them that was not particularly pleasant . - rickford via facebook two babies dead , five critical from bacteria at german hospital apparently , they did the test after giving the infusion to the babies .
daily lab tests should have been done before using the equipment .
how can such a simple requirement be missed ?
it is also an unlucky situation that the babies were already in intensive care with weaker immune systems than that of a healthy baby .
i send my deepest sympathy to the parents of unlucky babies . - nevres , turkey compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

third infant death heats debate about hygiene in german hospitals i have lived in germany for 15 years and during that time my family and i have been to a number of german hospitals , clinics and doctors for everything from back surgery to tonsil surgery , child birth , emergency room enrollments and the flu .
the care has been outstanding and the medical staffs have been top notch .
my biggest observation concerns hygiene .
i have had my blood taken by nurses who did not wear gloves .
i have seen doctors remove bandages with their bare hands .
this is not always the rule , but it has happened enough to make me acknowledge the systemic nature of this oversight .
outside of this , i have never had a major concern that any facility does not meet or exceed standards in the us -lrb- my only comparative standard -rrb- .
i would definitely agree , however , that all medical facilities , wherever they may be , should ratchet up any-and-all policies put in place to avoid a recurrence of the mainz tragedy . - scott , us i spent three months in germany late last year and my girlfriend at the time was a registered nurse .
i visited the hospital where she worked on numerous occasions and from an outsider 's point of view there were numerous signs informing everyone how important it was to maintain a clean and sterile working environment .
i noted how much cleaner the hospital was compared to those back in australia . - paul , australia wow , that 's sad .
i 'm glad germany is taking lax standards seriously though .
i think other countries should as well .
doctors get paid very well ; the least they can do is obey the hygiene standards that would make a computer chip manufacturer laugh .
medicine does n't have the highest hygiene standards , electronics does . - fergal via facebook it was long ago , but i went in with measles as an adult and was there for two weeks .
it was different from my experiences in the us and japan , but i was well treated , pampered by the orderlies -lrb- who pitied my bad vacation luck -rrb- , and left with ... a bill that was only a minor fraction of what it would have been in the us .
my only complaint was the bells from the church across the street from my room .
they were so … odd - a rather avant garde sound to them that was not particularly pleasant . - rickford via facebook two babies dead , five critical from bacteria at german hospital apparently , they did the test after giving the infusion to the babies .
daily lab tests should have been done before using the equipment .
how can such a simple requirement be missed ?
it is also an unlucky situation that the babies were already in intensive care with weaker immune systems than that of a healthy baby .
i send my deepest sympathy to the parents of unlucky babies . - nevres , turkey compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i would definitely agree , however , that all medical facilities , wherever they may be , should ratchet up any-and-all policies put in place to avoid a recurrence of the mainz tragedy . - scott , us i spent three months in germany late last year and my girlfriend at the time was a registered nurse .
i visited the hospital where she worked on numerous occasions and from an outsider 's point of view there were numerous signs informing everyone how important it was to maintain a clean and sterile working environment .
i noted how much cleaner the hospital was compared to those back in australia . - paul , australia wow , that 's sad .
i 'm glad germany is taking lax standards seriously though .
i think other countries should as well .
doctors get paid very well ; the least they can do is obey the hygiene standards that would make a computer chip manufacturer laugh .
medicine does n't have the highest hygiene standards , electronics does . - fergal via facebook it was long ago , but i went in with measles as an adult and was there for two weeks .
it was different from my experiences in the us and japan , but i was well treated , pampered by the orderlies -lrb- who pitied my bad vacation luck -rrb- , and left with ... a bill that was only a minor fraction of what it would have been in the us .
my only complaint was the bells from the church across the street from my room .
they were so … odd - a rather avant garde sound to them that was not particularly pleasant . - rickford via facebook two babies dead , five critical from bacteria at german hospital apparently , they did the test after giving the infusion to the babies .
daily lab tests should have been done before using the equipment .
how can such a simple requirement be missed ?
it is also an unlucky situation that the babies were already in intensive care with weaker immune systems than that of a healthy baby .
i send my deepest sympathy to the parents of unlucky babies . - nevres , turkey compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 25.08.2010 economic recovery at stake in latvian elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is heated debate about the future path of latvia latvia is just weeks away from its next general election .
one of the key issues is the country 's fledgling economic recovery .
but the party that is leading in the opinion polls wants to forge closer ties with russia . latvia is slowly emerging from recession with the help of money from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the european union .
the economic recovery is likely to play a central role in the parliamentary elections in october .
latvians will effectively be voting either to continue the government 's austerity program , or to refuse help from international donors , and instead increase the country 's dependency on russia .
october 2nd is decision time come election day , latvians will choose between 10 parties , or alliances , running for the 100-seat parliament , or saeima .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the latvian economy is recovering with help from the imf and the eu recent opinion polls show that the pro-kremlin " harmony centre " bloc is currently the most popular party .
it was formed in april this year , and polls indicate that around 20 percent of people intend to vote for it .
nellija locmele is the editor of the weekly news and current affairs magazine " ir . "
she is alarmed at the prospect of " harmony centre " winning the most seats in parliament : " harmony centre is … not a stable party , " locmele said .
" it 's new and has n't proved itself over the years , so we are not able to assess its policies and ideology in practice . "
locmele is concerned that there are politicians with very differing views on how to boost the economy within the party .
the country is at a crossroads latvia is at a crossroads in terms of its further economic and political development .
in order to keep the economic recovery on track , locmele feels the country needs to stick to its structural reforms .
but " harmony centre " wants latvia to have closer economic and political ties with russia .
political scientist janis ikstens says this is part of an increasing trend in latvia , but he warns that this could be dangerous : " what is striking is that this discourse has barely changed after one of the leaders of " harmony centre " openly threatened to stage bloodshed à la bishkek in riga if his political platform is not fulfilled .
this is i think absolutely unacceptable in a democratic society . "
current government is struggling despite the fact that the present government managed to halt the economic recession under prime minister valdia dombrovskis , his pro-western alliance " unity " is falling behind in the polls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current prime minister is struggling in opinion polls liga stafecka of delna , the latvian chapter of transparency international , says that voters do n't appreciate the gravity of the situation .
" people in latvia are perplexed and confused because many political unions or blocs have been established , " she said . " the voters find it very hard to distinguish one bloc from the other . "
the latest figures show that around 20 per cent of voters in latvia have n't still decided who they will vote for .
and about one fifth intend to ignore the general election altogether . the politicians have just five weeks left to change this .

and it 's not that far away , galactically speaking . scientists at the european southern observatory , or eso , announced the discovery of the richest known extrasolar planetary system on tuesday .
after six years of study , eso published its findings that at least five confirmed exoplanets , or extrasolar planets , are orbiting a star only 127 light years away from earth . the five exoplanets all have approximately the mass of neptune - between 13 and 25 times the mass of earth - but orbit much closer to their star , with orbital periods between six and 600 days -lrb- neptune takes 164.79 years to orbit the sun -rrb- . in addition to the five neptune-sized planets , eso astronomers have " tantalizing " evidence of two more exoplanets in the system .
one is saturn-sized , with an orbital period of 2,200 days and the other is the smallest known exoplanet with merely 1.4 earth masses and an orbital period of only 1.18 days . the sun-like star , which is called hd 10180 , is located in the southern constellation hydrus , and has been studied closely since its discovery with the harps spectrograph in la silla , chile .
the existence of the exoplanets was discovered through gravitational wobbles in the behavior of the star caused by the passage of the planets . bildunterschrift : the newly discovered system is only 127 light years from earth familiar traits observed using data from this new discovery as well as data from other planetary systems , the researchers found evidence of the titius-bode law that exists in our solar system : the distances of the planets from their star seem to follow a regular pattern . " this could be a signature of the formation process of these planetary systems , " team member michel mayor said in the eso press release . eso astronomer christophe lovis also acknowledged that this discovery highlights the changes in the field of exoplanet research . " we are now entering a new era in exoplanet research : the study of complex planetary systems and not just of individual planets , " lovis said .
" studies of planetary motions in the new system reveal complex gravitational interactions between the planets and give us insights into the long-term evolution of the system .

last year , it was added to unesco 's world heritage list and for 2010 it has been named dance of the year . as the sound of bandoneons and violins emanates sensuously from the loudspeakers , a man puts his arm around his partner 's waist , pressing her against him .
from the hips up , the two are welded together like one body , while their legs artistically entangle and detangle themselves . it 's a scene that can be found in any number of dance schools across germany that offer the so-called milonga - the insiders ' term for a tango evening . from munich to hamburg , the tango scene has become so well organized that not having a partner is not an excuse not to join in .
networking services are available to help dancers find partners and travel agencies offer special holiday packages for tango fans . not as easy as it looks despite all the enthusiasm , going from the beginners ' class to being able to glide across the dance floor like a professional is quite a lot of work and takes more than a little talent . " the tango is one of the most difficult dances in the world , " norma raimondi said , a teacher at the don tango club in cologne .
" of course it depends on each person 's talent , but it generally takes a good three years to be able to dance spontaneously , without having to think about each step in advance . " " at the beginning i was just curious , but now it 's like a drug , i have to dance more and more , " said johanna , one of raimondi 's dance student 's , who preferred not to give her last name .

"
indeed , that melancholy aspect is inseparably tied to the birthplace of the dance : buenos aires ' old port district , la boca . toward the end of the 19th century , this neighborhood became a gathering place for immigrants who had come to the city on the rio de la plata in search of a better life . tango blended the folklore and the instruments of the immigrants ' homelands to create a completely new sound that would become a symbol of their adopted home : buenos aires . " tango reflects all elements of life , " said 80-year-old luis stazo , a bandoneon player who performed for decades all over the globe with the legendary sexteto mayor .
" it tells how the man betrays the woman and the woman the man .
tango knows horse races , gambling - everything in life .
that 's why tango is much more than a dance . " stazo explained that tango was originally played only with guitar and flute .
later , the bandoneon was added .
the bandoneon - which looks somewhat like an accordion - was invented in the mid-19th century by heinrich band and was initially intended for religious and popular music . " we bandoneon players can thank germany , because the instrument that is so typical for tango and is so important to its soul was invented there , " said stazo . bildunterschrift : a hundred years ago , tango was deamed too sexy for high society frowned upon by the elite corazon , amor y sangre - heart , love and blood - was the immigrants ' motto and describes the soul of the dance .
in the beginning , the big-city argentinean elite rejected the " obscene " tango , which embodied the betrayal , loneliness and failures of the immigrant population . when the foreigners did n't find the riches they had hoped for , many became resigned , turning to gambling or prostitution .
it took many years before tango became socially acceptable . in 1904 , the police even warned against the dance , saying it promoted rivalry among people who , in the end , " always reached for the knife . "
in 1913 , pope st. pius x even condemned the dance . it was , however , too late ; tango had already caught hold .

and it 's not that far away , galactically speaking . scientists at the european southern observatory , or eso , announced the discovery of the richest known extrasolar planetary system on tuesday .
after six years of study , eso published its findings that at least five confirmed exoplanets , or extrasolar planets , are orbiting a star only 127 light years away from earth . the five exoplanets all have approximately the mass of neptune - between 13 and 25 times the mass of earth - but orbit much closer to their star , with orbital periods between six and 600 days -lrb- neptune takes 164.79 years to orbit the sun -rrb- . in addition to the five neptune-sized planets , eso astronomers have " tantalizing " evidence of two more exoplanets in the system .
one is saturn-sized , with an orbital period of 2,200 days and the other is the smallest known exoplanet with merely 1.4 earth masses and an orbital period of only 1.18 days . the sun-like star , which is called hd 10180 , is located in the southern constellation hydrus , and has been studied closely since its discovery with the harps spectrograph in la silla , chile .
the existence of the exoplanets was discovered through gravitational wobbles in the behavior of the star caused by the passage of the planets . bildunterschrift : the newly discovered system is only 127 light years from earth familiar traits observed using data from this new discovery as well as data from other planetary systems , the researchers found evidence of the titius-bode law that exists in our solar system : the distances of the planets from their star seem to follow a regular pattern . " this could be a signature of the formation process of these planetary systems , " team member michel mayor said in the eso press release . eso astronomer christophe lovis also acknowledged that this discovery highlights the changes in the field of exoplanet research . " we are now entering a new era in exoplanet research : the study of complex planetary systems and not just of individual planets , " lovis said .
" studies of planetary motions in the new system reveal complex gravitational interactions between the planets and give us insights into the long-term evolution of the system .

and it 's not that far away , galactically speaking . scientists at the european southern observatory , or eso , announced the discovery of the richest known extrasolar planetary system on tuesday .
after six years of study , eso published its findings that at least five confirmed exoplanets , or extrasolar planets , are orbiting a star only 127 light years away from earth . the five exoplanets all have approximately the mass of neptune - between 13 and 25 times the mass of earth - but orbit much closer to their star , with orbital periods between six and 600 days -lrb- neptune takes 164.79 years to orbit the sun -rrb- . in addition to the five neptune-sized planets , eso astronomers have " tantalizing " evidence of two more exoplanets in the system .
one is saturn-sized , with an orbital period of 2,200 days and the other is the smallest known exoplanet with merely 1.4 earth masses and an orbital period of only 1.18 days . the sun-like star , which is called hd 10180 , is located in the southern constellation hydrus , and has been studied closely since its discovery with the harps spectrograph in la silla , chile .
the existence of the exoplanets was discovered through gravitational wobbles in the behavior of the star caused by the passage of the planets . bildunterschrift : the newly discovered system is only 127 light years from earth familiar traits observed using data from this new discovery as well as data from other planetary systems , the researchers found evidence of the titius-bode law that exists in our solar system : the distances of the planets from their star seem to follow a regular pattern . " this could be a signature of the formation process of these planetary systems , " team member michel mayor said in the eso press release . eso astronomer christophe lovis also acknowledged that this discovery highlights the changes in the field of exoplanet research . " we are now entering a new era in exoplanet research : the study of complex planetary systems and not just of individual planets , " lovis said .
" studies of planetary motions in the new system reveal complex gravitational interactions between the planets and give us insights into the long-term evolution of the system . " through further study of the system around hd 10180 , eso astronomers hope to learn more about planetary formation and about how the solar system was developed , as well as what its future may look like . author : stuart tiffen -lrb- ap / afp -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 25.08.2010 electronic devices speed up international development work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handheld devices are helping wfp workers in the field the world food program is using technology to speed efforts to learn where food aid is needed .
with handheld devices , the organization is able to get more accurate data and transmit it wirelessly back to headquarters . the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- in burundi is using handheld personal digital assistants , or pdas , to help keep tabs on the country 's food situation .
the technology has helped speed up the process of data collection and improve the accuracy of the organization 's food security surveys .
staff members organize fact-finding missions to gauge the country 's food supply .
when wfp arrived in burundi in 1968 , the organization was using pen and paper to conduct their food surveys .
now , wfp uses small palmtop computers , only slightly larger than normal cell phones and light enough to carry .
the devices have held up against the strong burundian heat and can last for days before needing a recharge .
" so you have the speed of gathering data , which means you can expand your survey area , and that makes it more valid by interviewing more people , " marc neilson said , a public information officer for wfp burundi .
the organization provides food assistance to more than 600,000 " food-insecure " burundians and some 90 million people around the world every year .
wfp plans to provide about 3.7 million tons of food in 73 countries to those unable to produce or obtain enough food for themselves and their families .
bildunterschrift : wfp provides food assistance to about 90 million people worldwide a welcome development in bihogo village in northern burundi , wfp program assistant gerard bisman uses his pda to conduct a 20-question survey with local residents about their food needs and living standards .
" it 's very interesting to use the device because it 's a lot faster , " he said .
" it used to take us about an hour-and-a-half to complete the entire interview with paper , and now it takes only half-an-hour . "
since he started using the device in march , bisman has eliminated prep time , paper shuffling and the need to decipher sloppy hand writing , which has reduced the margin of error .
the wfp staffer said residents also appreciate the technology , noting that survey-takers used to get " very , very tired " back when the questionnaire was conducted by hand .
bihogo resident elisabeth tembaidai had never been interviewed by wfp before .
the 56-year-old primary school teacher said it is the first time she has seen a pda - and the device shows the country is making progress .
a few years ago , tembaidai received food aid from wfp during a drought .
she said she hopes wfp will provide her with food this year , too .
" well , we will probably need some help in regards to food this year because the water that used to come from up north does n't come anymore , " she said .
" it 's the dry season also , and we are short of food at the moment , and we are asking wfp for some food now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pdas allow wfp to transmit data wirelessly high-speed , wireless transmission information is currently collected on a memory card and sent to the main wfp office in bujumbura , but soon wfp field staff will be able to transmit their findings wirelessly .
burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world , with annual per capita income averaging about $ 300 , or 236 euros .
in 2006 , the country emerged from a 13-year civil war ; one rebel group laid down its arms just last year .
now , however , the country has a new high-speed 3g wireless network .
by sending data wirelessly to the central database for analysis , wfp staff can provide up-to-date information from around the country , helping streamline planning on food shipments . the pda 's price tag is about $ 200 , or 158 euros - and providing two devices in each of burundi 's 15 provinces costs about $ 6,000 , or 4728 euros , not including training costs .
but neilson said the devices are a good investment : " any time you can save doing that , it means those most at risk - the poor - are getting the assistance faster and more effectively , and you 're not perhaps going in an area where you really should n't be , " he said .
" wfp needs to be in the areas that are most at risk .
that 's the bottom line . "
bildunterschrift : scratch card ' e-vouchers ' allow beneficiaries more options to receive food aid scratch card ' e-vouchers ' wfp has put the pdas to use elsewhere in africa , including the congo and mozambique .
in zambia , wfp distributes " e-voucher " scratch cards to improve the food voucher program .
instead of lining up for food aid , people can now choose when and where to pick up their monthly assistance .
the scratch card codes are entered into a mobile phone upon delivery of the food .
wfp said the program reduces transaction costs and increases the " efficiency and effectiveness " of food distribution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wfp 's scratch card program reduces the transaction costs of food distribution in syria , 130,000 iraqi refugees receiving food aid are able to get the wfp 's " virtual vouchers " via text message .
the electronic vouchers can be exchanged for items not normally included in conventional aid baskets , such as rice , wheat flour , lentils , chickpeas , oil and canned fish , as well as cheese and eggs .
other organizations are also taking advantage of the new technologies in the field .
in the west african countries of togo and niger , the us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- has worked with pdas equipped with gps capabilities to help prevent malaria .
a team of scientists used the electronic devices to collect high-quality data on the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets . in the asia-pacific region , un children 's fund staff use pda questionnaires to provide rapid assessments in emergency situations .
local statistical data on livelihood , poverty , health and nutrition can help inform situation reports , as well as high-level government officials .

our readers shared some of their own observations . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
third infant death heats debate about hygiene in german hospitals i have lived in germany for 15 years and during that time my family and i have been to a number of german hospitals , clinics and doctors for everything from back surgery to tonsil surgery , child birth , emergency room enrollments and the flu .
the care has been outstanding and the medical staffs have been top notch .
my biggest observation concerns hygiene .
i have had my blood taken by nurses who did not wear gloves .
i have seen doctors remove bandages with their bare hands .
this is not always the rule , but it has happened enough to make me acknowledge the systemic nature of this oversight .
outside of this , i have never had a major concern that any facility does not meet or exceed standards in the us -lrb- my only comparative standard -rrb- .
i would definitely agree , however , that all medical facilities , wherever they may be , should ratchet up any-and-all policies put in place to avoid a recurrence of the mainz tragedy . - scott , us i spent three months in germany late last year and my girlfriend at the time was a registered nurse .
i visited the hospital where she worked on numerous occasions and from an outsider 's point of view there were numerous signs informing everyone how important it was to maintain a clean and sterile working environment .
i noted how much cleaner the hospital was compared to those back in australia . - paul , australia wow , that 's sad .
i 'm glad germany is taking lax standards seriously though .
i think other countries should as well .
doctors get paid very well ; the least they can do is obey the hygiene standards that would make a computer chip manufacturer laugh .
medicine does n't have the highest hygiene standards , electronics does . - fergal via facebook it was long ago , but i went in with measles as an adult and was there for two weeks .
it was different from my experiences in the us and japan , but i was well treated , pampered by the orderlies -lrb- who pitied my bad vacation luck -rrb- , and left with ... a bill that was only a minor fraction of what it would have been in the us .
my only complaint was the bells from the church across the street from my room .
they were so … odd - a rather avant garde sound to them that was not particularly pleasant . - rickford via facebook two babies dead , five critical from bacteria at german hospital apparently , they did the test after giving the infusion to the babies .
daily lab tests should have been done before using the equipment .
how can such a simple requirement be missed ?
it is also an unlucky situation that the babies were already in intensive care with weaker immune systems than that of a healthy baby .
i send my deepest sympathy to the parents of unlucky babies . - nevres , turkey compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

third infant death heats debate about hygiene in german hospitals i have lived in germany for 15 years and during that time my family and i have been to a number of german hospitals , clinics and doctors for everything from back surgery to tonsil surgery , child birth , emergency room enrollments and the flu .
the care has been outstanding and the medical staffs have been top notch .
my biggest observation concerns hygiene .
i have had my blood taken by nurses who did not wear gloves .
i have seen doctors remove bandages with their bare hands .
this is not always the rule , but it has happened enough to make me acknowledge the systemic nature of this oversight .
outside of this , i have never had a major concern that any facility does not meet or exceed standards in the us -lrb- my only comparative standard -rrb- .
i would definitely agree , however , that all medical facilities , wherever they may be , should ratchet up any-and-all policies put in place to avoid a recurrence of the mainz tragedy . - scott , us i spent three months in germany late last year and my girlfriend at the time was a registered nurse .
i visited the hospital where she worked on numerous occasions and from an outsider 's point of view there were numerous signs informing everyone how important it was to maintain a clean and sterile working environment .
i noted how much cleaner the hospital was compared to those back in australia . - paul , australia wow , that 's sad .
i 'm glad germany is taking lax standards seriously though .
i think other countries should as well .
doctors get paid very well ; the least they can do is obey the hygiene standards that would make a computer chip manufacturer laugh .
medicine does n't have the highest hygiene standards , electronics does . - fergal via facebook it was long ago , but i went in with measles as an adult and was there for two weeks .
it was different from my experiences in the us and japan , but i was well treated , pampered by the orderlies -lrb- who pitied my bad vacation luck -rrb- , and left with ... a bill that was only a minor fraction of what it would have been in the us .
my only complaint was the bells from the church across the street from my room .
they were so … odd - a rather avant garde sound to them that was not particularly pleasant . - rickford via facebook two babies dead , five critical from bacteria at german hospital apparently , they did the test after giving the infusion to the babies .
daily lab tests should have been done before using the equipment .
how can such a simple requirement be missed ?
it is also an unlucky situation that the babies were already in intensive care with weaker immune systems than that of a healthy baby .

the draft bill hopes to stabilize the banking system by charging higher fees for banks who engage in riskier behavior .
the law could bring in more than 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- per year , which would go into a fund to help bail out banks in the case of another financial crisis .
france and britain have collaborated on similar laws with merkel , who brought the idea up to other global leaders at a group of 8 summit in canada in june but failed to gather broad support .
multi-front opposition the law has gained criticism from several fronts , including economic analysts , who have said the fee must be adopted on a global level to truly stabilize the world financial system .
savings and loan institutions have also opposed the bill , claiming that the most recent crisis has already punished banks , and that they have since modified their own policies to protect against crises .
and opposition parties have also attacked the draft law , saying it is too low and that banks would pass on the costs to consumers .
but german private banks - including the nation 's largest , deutsche bank - have supported the law , saying it would shore up bankruptcy proceedings for the german banking sector .

the draft bill hopes to stabilize the banking system by charging higher fees for banks who engage in riskier behavior .
the law could bring in more than 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- per year , which would go into a fund to help bail out banks in the case of another financial crisis .
france and britain have collaborated on similar laws with merkel , who brought the idea up to other global leaders at a group of 8 summit in canada in june but failed to gather broad support .
multi-front opposition the law has gained criticism from several fronts , including economic analysts , who have said the fee must be adopted on a global level to truly stabilize the world financial system .
savings and loan institutions have also opposed the bill , claiming that the most recent crisis has already punished banks , and that they have since modified their own policies to protect against crises .
and opposition parties have also attacked the draft law , saying it is too low and that banks would pass on the costs to consumers .
but german private banks - including the nation 's largest , deutsche bank - have supported the law , saying it would shore up bankruptcy proceedings for the german banking sector .

westerwelle had words of encouragement but said accession rules would remain firm . german foreign minister guido westerwelle met with croatian leaders in zagreb on wednesday , kicking off his three-day trip to the balkans .
on arrival , westerwelle met with president ivo josipovic , prime minister jadranka kosor and foreign minister gordan jandrokovic .
he then gave a speech to the academy of sciences encouraging the country to make the necessary reforms for european union accession .
" if croatia musters all its strength for the final sprint , then -lsb- eu -rsb- membership could be wrapped up soon , perhaps as soon as next year , " westerwelle said .
he added , however , that there would be no concessions on the accession criteria , especially in light of this year 's greek budget crisis .
" if we loosened the rules , we would only sow concerns about taking on new members . "
croatia is set to join the eu in 2012 , and is seen as the least problematic balkan country seeking accession .
westerwelle praised croatia for recently resolving a border conflict with slovenia , the only country from the former yugoslavia that has joined the union .
diplomatic challenge on thursday , westerwelle travels to the serbian capital of belgrade , where he will face the tricky task of dissuading serbia from seeking a new united nations resolution on the status of kosovo .
" he wo n't put too much pressure on serbia , " westerwelle 's spokesman stephan bredohl , who is traveling with him , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is in line with international law " but we 're very clear on kosovo : germany has accepted its independence and it 's very important for us that if serbia wants to join the european union , it needs to be constructive and toe the eu 's line , " he explained .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 and is now officially recognized by 69 countries .
in july , the international court of justice , which serbia had called on to rule on kosovo 's status , declared that its declaration of independence was in line with international law .
serbia refuses to accept the verdict , pressing instead for a un resolution to reopen talks on the status of what it considers the serbian province of kosovo .
germany was one of the first countries to recognize kosovo as an independent state .
five eu member states , however , do not recognize kosovo , meaning the eu can not make it a precondition for serbia to join the eu .
deadlock in bosnia westerwelle is also to visit bosnia-herzegovina on thursday .
nearly 15 years after the dayton peace agreement , which ended the fighting and split bosnia-herzegovina into two largely autonomous entities , the political situation there remains challenging . many serbs , muslims and croats remain pitted against each other ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for october 3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik seeks independence for bosnian serbs while the ruling on kosovo by the international court of justice was well-received in germany , it has also fanned the flames of separatism in the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , the mainly serb bosnian entity .
its leader milorad dodik has threatened secession from bosnia since he came into power in 2006 .
after the verdict on kosovo , he declared that he would start discussions on independence after the elections .
" in bosnia , the foreign minister 's visit will be largely symbolic and he will try to call on voters to be moderate , " bodo weber , an expert on the region at the democratization policy council , told deutsche welle .
focus on the region germany has been criticized for not making the balkans a focus of its foreign policy , not least because it did not send a representative to the eu-balkan summit in sarajevo in june . many are hoping westerwelle 's trip will change that .
" these countries -lsb- in the balkans -rsb- are already part of europe , that 's why their problems are our problems , " said bernd posselt , mep for germany 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in brussels .
" i would hope that the foreign minister will not just see this trip as a photo opportunity , but see it as the start of a much greater focus of his foreign policy , " he added .

westerwelle had words of encouragement but said accession rules would remain firm . german foreign minister guido westerwelle met with croatian leaders in zagreb on wednesday , kicking off his three-day trip to the balkans .
on arrival , westerwelle met with president ivo josipovic , prime minister jadranka kosor and foreign minister gordan jandrokovic .
he then gave a speech to the academy of sciences encouraging the country to make the necessary reforms for european union accession .
" if croatia musters all its strength for the final sprint , then -lsb- eu -rsb- membership could be wrapped up soon , perhaps as soon as next year , " westerwelle said .
he added , however , that there would be no concessions on the accession criteria , especially in light of this year 's greek budget crisis .
" if we loosened the rules , we would only sow concerns about taking on new members . "
croatia is set to join the eu in 2012 , and is seen as the least problematic balkan country seeking accession .
westerwelle praised croatia for recently resolving a border conflict with slovenia , the only country from the former yugoslavia that has joined the union .
diplomatic challenge on thursday , westerwelle travels to the serbian capital of belgrade , where he will face the tricky task of dissuading serbia from seeking a new united nations resolution on the status of kosovo .
" he wo n't put too much pressure on serbia , " westerwelle 's spokesman stephan bredohl , who is traveling with him , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence is in line with international law " but we 're very clear on kosovo : germany has accepted its independence and it 's very important for us that if serbia wants to join the european union , it needs to be constructive and toe the eu 's line , " he explained .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in 2008 and is now officially recognized by 69 countries .
in july , the international court of justice , which serbia had called on to rule on kosovo 's status , declared that its declaration of independence was in line with international law .
serbia refuses to accept the verdict , pressing instead for a un resolution to reopen talks on the status of what it considers the serbian province of kosovo .
germany was one of the first countries to recognize kosovo as an independent state .
five eu member states , however , do not recognize kosovo , meaning the eu can not make it a precondition for serbia to join the eu .
deadlock in bosnia westerwelle is also to visit bosnia-herzegovina on thursday .
nearly 15 years after the dayton peace agreement , which ended the fighting and split bosnia-herzegovina into two largely autonomous entities , the political situation there remains challenging . many serbs , muslims and croats remain pitted against each other ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for october 3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dodik seeks independence for bosnian serbs while the ruling on kosovo by the international court of justice was well-received in germany , it has also fanned the flames of separatism in the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- , the mainly serb bosnian entity .
its leader milorad dodik has threatened secession from bosnia since he came into power in 2006 .
after the verdict on kosovo , he declared that he would start discussions on independence after the elections .
" in bosnia , the foreign minister 's visit will be largely symbolic and he will try to call on voters to be moderate , " bodo weber , an expert on the region at the democratization policy council , told deutsche welle .
focus on the region germany has been criticized for not making the balkans a focus of its foreign policy , not least because it did not send a representative to the eu-balkan summit in sarajevo in june . many are hoping westerwelle 's trip will change that .
" these countries -lsb- in the balkans -rsb- are already part of europe , that 's why their problems are our problems , " said bernd posselt , mep for germany 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- in brussels .
" i would hope that the foreign minister will not just see this trip as a photo opportunity , but see it as the start of a much greater focus of his foreign policy , " he added .

this year , he took the podium as conductor of wagner 's opera " lohengrin " at the bayreuth festival . andris nelsons is a shooting star in the classical music scene .
as the youngest conductor in the history of the bayreuth festival , the 31-year-old latvian has reaped praise from critics across germany and beyond .
this fall , he will see premieres with two of the world 's major orchestras - the berlin and the vienna philharmonics .
deutsche welle spoke with the conductor about his bayreuth debut . deutsche welle : how do you feel after your first performance this year in bayreuth ? andris nelsons : i 'm very excited because it 's such a special place and atmosphere .
it 's a great pleasure to be here ; everybody 's motivation is just to make the best possible music . but it 's also quite difficult for a conductor in this orchestra pit .
achieving the right balance between the choir , the soloists and the orchestra is hard - especially when conducting pieces that were n't written for bayreuth . have you always been steeped in wager , or what path led you to his work ? wagner was actually one of the first composers i got to know - the first opera i saw was " tannhaeuser " when i was five years old .
ever since then , i 've been listening to and analyzing his operas and been in love with his music . i think starting with wagner also opened my eyes for other composers .
approaching the philosophical and emotional components of wagner 's music helped me understand many other composers , including beethoven .
since wagner was the first i was introduced to , i viewed every other composer from a different perspective . bildunterschrift : the young conductor already has an impressive list of engagements it 's been said that you 're able to have a kind of empathy with each member of an orchestra .
how would you describe the process of bringing together so many different elements when conducting ? that process is what 's magical about being a conductor .
you 're dealing with orchestras and choirs composed of individuals who are each wonderful musicians and who each have their own ideas about how the music should be . everybody has an ego - in a good sense .
you need an artistic ego to perform music , but you have to focus those egos toward one result . when the members of an orchestra forget about the global result , it 's dangerous , and that 's a very real possibility in opera .
it should be like a family , though - everyone has a very important place and part in the family .
if some member of the family thinks someone else is more important , then it does n't work .
that seems to relate to wagner 's intentions with bayreuth - to have people focus on the music and not on themselves .
have you found the bayreuth setting encourages that artistic ideal ? i agree that there is something special about this place both practically and theoretically .
wagner really is the only star here .
for one thing , the audience ca n't even see the conductor in the orchestra pit , so there 's no possibility of the conductor stealing the show . that means the music starts without applause - it starts from scratch in a way .
everything is set up to be just about music . there 's a mystical quality to being here , which i experienced three years ago in the audience when i was invited to conduct " lohengrin . "
everyone comes to this mountain , and everyone is concentrated on the music .
that 's particular to bayreuth , but i wish it were that way everywhere - that the composer would be the one put on the podium . bildunterschrift : nelsons conducted a new production of " lohengrin " by hans neuenfels that was heavy on rodents where do think " lohengrin " stands in wagner 's oeuvre - is it the point where wagner comes into his own as a composer ? i think one notices that " lohengrin " is still an early opera in the oeuvre .
but wagner is so clever , and you can feel from the work that he very consciously knows how to use his powers and to manipulate people in writing music .
i think act two of " lohengrin " contains one of wagner 's greatest masterpieces .
there , he creates the atmosphere so dramatically , and you think , " everything can be so beautiful in life , if you just make the right decisions . "
but then , you also know , " no , no , the ending wo n't be nice . " in act two of the opera , you know that the future could be so great , but wagner knows it will never happen and shows that in the music .
