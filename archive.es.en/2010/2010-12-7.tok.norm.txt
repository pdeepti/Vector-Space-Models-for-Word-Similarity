russia now appears to be on its way to membership , despite the longest running negotiations in history . on tuesday , european union commission president jose manuel barroso announced a breakthrough to clear the way for russia 's entry to the world trade organization .
" our difficult bilateral issues are resolved .
we signed a memorandum of understanding to this end today , " barroso said at the brussels summit .
as part of the agreement , russia has pledged to lower export duties on timber and asian freight that travels to europe via russian railways .
the road to wto membership is usually long and paved with obstacles - but russia 's ongoing 17-year journey is a world record .
the nation with a 90 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- economy is the largest outside the wto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower export duties on russian timber will benefit eu paper makers the blame game frustrated russian politicians blame politically-motivated delay tactics employed by the us and the eu , while trade diplomats in geneva fault russia for failing to understand the rules of the organization .
the key to speeding up the process now lies in moscow , according to wto spokesman keith rockwell .
" the pace of accession is in almost every instance driven by the capital of the country that is acceding , " rockwell said .
in many instances the reforms that are required to join the wto are politically difficult - which is certainly the case in russia , he added .
" there are sectors of the russian economy that find the process of joining the wto very difficult . "
making nice with the neighbors moscow must now get approval from the other members of the wto , a process that includes entering talks with any of the 153 wto members that wish to negotiate .
on monday , russian president dmitri medvedev made the first state visit by a kremlin leader to poland in nine years , and secured poland 's support for russia 's wto accession .
but not all bilateral talks have been constructive .
georgia , russia 's neighbor to the south , has been a wto member for ten years , and has blocked the russian accession process since the armed conflict in the summer of 2008 .
ukraine , too , still has not given a green light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland supports russia 's accession to the wto a veto , however , is unlikely , says alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations .
" in my opinion , in doing so , georgia would harm itself , given the fact that the eu and the us both want russia in the wto and not out of it .
such a move by the georgians would jeopardize the agenda which the west has set up with russia , " rahr told deutche welle .
a powerful partner the european union , with 500 million people , is russia 's largest trading partner .
if russia joins the world trade organization , the nation will be unable to impose arbitrary import bans , drastic tariff increases , and import restrictions without risking sanctions .
exporting nations such as germany would benefit from easier market access , says wto spokesman rockwell , adding that membership for russia would provide german exporters , as well as their japanese and american counterparts , with " a certain sense of predictability " when they enter into business transactions in that country .
" that makes the country a more attractive place for doing business , " said rockwell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keith rockwell speaks for the wto which represents more than 97 percent of global trade a rocky start in the past , russia has been less than committed to the process of joining the wto .
in june 2009 , prime minister vladimir putin declared out of the blue that russia was withdrawing its application for accession to the wto .
instead , his country would join the world trade organization as a customs union , together with kazakhstan and belarus .
in 2007 , in his capacity as president , putin lost patience with geneva 's trade diplomacy , labeling the wto as " archaic , undemocratic and inflexible . "
but the wto wo n't hold a grudge , said keith rockwell .
" we are very thick-skinned in the wto , " the spokesman said , adding mr. putin would be welcome for a visit any time . " we would be very happy to see him here . "

the redd scheme aims to reward developing nations for preserving their forests . a pact on reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries - known to negotiators as redd or " reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation " - appears to be close to an international agreement at the un framework convention on climate change in cancun .
" there 's a really strong chance that we will get a solid agreement , " said rane cortez , the senior forest carbon advisor for the nature conservancy environmental group .
" there is a lot of consensus coming on the text , but we need a few tweaks to get everyone onboard , " she added .
the programme was launched in september 2008 and consists largely of offering financial incentives to developing countries such as brazil , indonesia or the democratic republic of congo to save their tropical forests .
deforestation accounts for almost one-fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions , which is more than the entire global transport sector causes .
co2 released into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels like oil and coal can be absorbed and stored by forests until the forest dies .
yet even though that 's a well established fact , deforestation is continuing at a rapid pace .
each year , an estimated 13 million hectares of forest - mainly rain forest - is destroyed .
that 's equivalent to the area of a country like greece .
bildunterschrift : sources of greenhouse gasses - deforestation accounts for 17 percent of global emissions a simple concept the principle behind redd is simple .
the idea is to reward developing nations that preserve their forests , boost the carbon stock , and have sustainable forestry management .
currently , forests in developing countries are often cleared to make way for plantations , agricultural land or livestock .
in order to give people there the chance to make a different living , developed countries would under the redd scheme have to pay for the environmental services which these forests perform if they are left intact .
a fair deal , one might think - not least in view of the fact that developed nations are historically responsible for the ever-increasing co2 in the atmosphere - and thus for global climate change .
since a hectare of a palm oil plantation or arable land brings in more money than a hectare of rainforest , compensation should be agreed on an international level , according to the reasoning behind the redd concept .
bildunterschrift : cumulative co2 emissions -lrb- 1850-2000 -rrb- show usa and europe have been the biggest poluters money money money but even if it sounds like a logical solution , the simplicity ends when money comes into play .
what form this compensation should take and who should finance it are in dispute .
some negotiators say that only public money should go to redd .
but others say it is more realistic to set up a market approach that would allow nations to swap assistance for credits in emission reduction goals .
sha zukang , the un undersecretary for economic and social affairs , said funding so far has been insufficient even though the forest issue was critical for the " protection of the environment , social development and the fight against poverty . "
developed nations have pledged some 4.5 billion dollars for redd .
the leading financial contributor is norway , which among other projects has committed to provide one billion dollars for indonesia which plans a two-year moratorium on new clearing of natural forests and peat lands from 2011 .
what is a forest ?
but even before negotiators get to the sticky issue of money , " the debate about the redd agreement begins with the definition of the term ' forest ' , " said christoph thies of greenpeace .
to date no agreement has been reached in the negotiations : some also want plantations to count as forests , while others think the term should only refer to primary forests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace does n't want plantations to be counted as " forests " " for us at greenpeace it ' quite clear : a forest is a natural ecosystem that is dominated by trees - but not a plantation .
a tree plantation follows the principles of agriculture and is more of a tree farm for us , " thies said .
a tree farm or a plantation hardly stores any co2 .
even worse : to make room for the plantation , rain forest has to be cleared - and in this way co2 and methane is released into the atmosphere .
if this were rewarded in a redd agreement , thies thinks it would lose all credibility .
who does the forest belong to ?
worldwide , over a billion people live off the forest - many of them belong to indigenous people that have not only lived in the forest , but also from the forest .
the norwegian rainforest foundation wants to support and strengthen precisely this population , said lars loevold .
he said that involving indigenous peoples in the debate was not just an ethical question but a strategic decision .
" we are 100 percent convinced that forest protection will only work if we recognize the traditional communal rights of these people , " loevold said .
" for centuries they have maintained and protected the forests .
what looks to us in the west like untouched rain forest , is in fact the result of a very complex ecosystem within which humans have also played a role for centuries .
in this life cycle , a richer biodiversity has been created than if no people had lived there , " loevold added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies show that indigenous people can look after forest better than national parks local administration is more successful than national parks new research supports loevold 's argument that forests which are managed by indigenous peoples and local communities are better protected and have a greater biodiversity than , for example , national parks .
to enable people who actually live from and with the forests to have their voice heard at international climate negotiations , the norwegian rainforest foundation have paid the travel costs of indigenous representatives from all around the world .
the demands of indigenous peoples have become an essential part of climate negotiations .
the point for the director of the norwegian rainforest foundation at redd negotiations in cancun is that the forests should not just degenerate into a short-term investment .
" until now it has been profitable to destroy the rain forest .
some earned money with deforestation , but they did n't have to pay for the costs of the destruction .
the redd agreement is about finding mechanisms which reward people who protect forests , and punish those who destroy the forest , " said lars loevold .
this issue is being addressed by the 194 member countries at the un climate summit in cancun , mexico .
an agreement seems within reach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 07.12.2010 no real breakthrough as 5 + 1 talks on iran end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 5 + 1 and iran returned to negotiations after 13 months nuclear talks between the 5 + 1 group and iran have ended in geneva with little sign of progress .
although the two sides have agreed to meet again , the sticking point is the demand for iran to suspend uranium enrichment . the negotiations between un security council heavyweights the united states , russia , china , france and britain along with germany - the so called 5 + 1 group - with an iranian delegation were the first in 13 months .
the negotiation teams , headed by eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton for the 5 + 1 and iran 's secretary of the national security council saaed jalili , agreed that a further round of talks would take place at the end of january in turkey . however , iran has already made it clear that it will not discuss its uranium enrichment program , which it insists is for peaceful purposes while western powers fear the fuel would be used for nuclear warheads .
at the last meeting in october 2009 , the 5 + 1 agreed to a proposal that would have allowed iran to ship a major portion of the uranium they had enriched to 3.5 percent to an external destination to undergo further enrichment and to be converted into fuel rods for the small tehran research reactor .
that would remove the potential threat of weapons-grade material being siphoned off within iran for military purposes .
iran originally agreed to this proposal but later reneged on it , having scored a major point by having the 5 + 1 tacitly agree to iran engaging in enrichment , a practice forbidden by security council resolutions .
then in may this year , brazil and turkey tried to re-broker the deal but this attempt was scuppered by the united states which claimed higher levels of uranium had been enriched in iran since the original offer in 2009 and that the new export deal would leave too much material behind in iran .
iran 's stance on enrichment levels proving obstructive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's saeed jalili will present a similar stance to that of 2009 " if iran agrees to suspend further enrichment , up to the 17.5 percent which it has already stated it was pressing ahead with , then there are a whole series of economic incentives which are on the table , " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , told deutsche welle .
" if , on the other hand , as ahmadinejad has said , iran does not want to address the issue of enrichment or make any concessions or compromises on that account , there will be no alternative at this stage but the consideration of further punitive sanctions . "
chances of reaching any agreements or compromises seem very bleak at this time , khonsari added , but there are clear signs that because economic and other pressures are making life very difficult for the iranian regime , ahmadinejad may be looking for a way out without losing face .
" for ahmadinejad and his supporters there are two main reasons for an engagement with washington , " professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" first , they know that an understanding with the us would be popular , particularly among the educated youth and the business community .
the second reason is that ahmadinejad and the political leadership feel that the regime is under serious threat by the united states , and only by the united states . "
perthes said iran 's threat perception , and its deep suspicion of us intentions , are often underestimated in washington despite these issues being driving factors in iranian politics .
while the regime elite still appears to be divided over the prospect of a full-scale rapprochement with the united states , it is believed many share this fear of the us and there is a real desire to avoid further isolation .
with this in mind , the 5 + 1 may consider lessened sanctions - along with other incentives - as a way to achieve progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has so far dismissed the western incentives incentives on offer but tehran remains steadfast " the western powers along with russia and china are offering iran lessened sanctions , the chance to fix world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership in return for explanations of what has gone on in regard to tehran 's nuclear program and realistic assurances that it has no military nuclear intentions , " simon henderson , director of the gulf and energy policy program at the washington institute for near east policy , told deutsche welle .
" the best hope for agreement lies on the possibility of reaching an acceptable compromise regarding the shipment of already enriched uranium from iran to an outside destination , " khonsari said .
" if agreement could be reached on the quantity , and there is a minute chance given past turkish and brazilian mediation that this is possible , there may still be a way out though it will be very difficult . "
there were concerns that the geneva negotiations would be made even more problematic by the latest wikileaks revelations which exposed the level of international concern and distrust of iran , especially among its persian gulf neighbors , and the consideration of many that military action is the best option when it comes to stopping tehran 's nuclear program .
however , experts believe there is little new information in the wikileaks revelations and that all the parties involved in the talks with iran are already aware of the delicate nature of relations .
wikileaks revelations unlikely to add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks revelations on iran are unlikely to affect talks " there is nothing in the wikileaks revelations that the islamic authorities have been unaware of , " khonsari said .
" the iranian regime understands that matters will be ratcheted up if they are unable to reach an agreement and they are aware that , irrespective of all factors , the likelihood of military confrontation is a very real possibility . "
khonsari believes the consensus among iran 's opponents , that confronting an ambitious iran with all its downsides might be a cheaper option than living with a nuclear iran - as highlighted in the wikileaks cables - might possibly alter tehran 's previous calculations .
those gambled on the belief that the americans would never dare to embark on another military adventure in the aftermath of the iraq and afghanistan conflicts .
options running out if current talks fail " the 5 + 1 diplomats think that sanctions will eventually work , " said simon henderson .
" however , it 's hard to say what iran will do next in response . iran might calculate that if it tests a bomb , there would be some condemnation but then the world would have to get used to a new status quo , much in the same way as it did after the indian and pakistani tests in 1998 . "
mehrdad khonsari said the general consensus is that ahmadinejad wants to escalate matters and essentially go to the very brink of war in a bid to shore up his own leadership , which has been under pressure since the opposition protests in 2009 .
" it is believed that ahmadinejad feels a military conflict might help him consolidate his position inside the country , " he concluded .
" in such a case , his major aim is to buy time as it is unlikely that anything positive can be achieved as a result of these negotiations . "

although the two sides have agreed to meet again , the sticking point is the demand for iran to suspend uranium enrichment . the negotiations between un security council heavyweights the united states , russia , china , france and britain along with germany - the so called 5 + 1 group - with an iranian delegation were the first in 13 months .
the negotiation teams , headed by eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton for the 5 + 1 and iran 's secretary of the national security council saaed jalili , agreed that a further round of talks would take place at the end of january in turkey . however , iran has already made it clear that it will not discuss its uranium enrichment program , which it insists is for peaceful purposes while western powers fear the fuel would be used for nuclear warheads .
at the last meeting in october 2009 , the 5 + 1 agreed to a proposal that would have allowed iran to ship a major portion of the uranium they had enriched to 3.5 percent to an external destination to undergo further enrichment and to be converted into fuel rods for the small tehran research reactor .
that would remove the potential threat of weapons-grade material being siphoned off within iran for military purposes .
iran originally agreed to this proposal but later reneged on it , having scored a major point by having the 5 + 1 tacitly agree to iran engaging in enrichment , a practice forbidden by security council resolutions .
then in may this year , brazil and turkey tried to re-broker the deal but this attempt was scuppered by the united states which claimed higher levels of uranium had been enriched in iran since the original offer in 2009 and that the new export deal would leave too much material behind in iran .
iran 's stance on enrichment levels proving obstructive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's saeed jalili will present a similar stance to that of 2009 " if iran agrees to suspend further enrichment , up to the 17.5 percent which it has already stated it was pressing ahead with , then there are a whole series of economic incentives which are on the table , " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , told deutsche welle .
" if , on the other hand , as ahmadinejad has said , iran does not want to address the issue of enrichment or make any concessions or compromises on that account , there will be no alternative at this stage but the consideration of further punitive sanctions . "
chances of reaching any agreements or compromises seem very bleak at this time , khonsari added , but there are clear signs that because economic and other pressures are making life very difficult for the iranian regime , ahmadinejad may be looking for a way out without losing face .
" for ahmadinejad and his supporters there are two main reasons for an engagement with washington , " professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" first , they know that an understanding with the us would be popular , particularly among the educated youth and the business community .
the second reason is that ahmadinejad and the political leadership feel that the regime is under serious threat by the united states , and only by the united states . "
perthes said iran 's threat perception , and its deep suspicion of us intentions , are often underestimated in washington despite these issues being driving factors in iranian politics .
while the regime elite still appears to be divided over the prospect of a full-scale rapprochement with the united states , it is believed many share this fear of the us and there is a real desire to avoid further isolation .
with this in mind , the 5 + 1 may consider lessened sanctions - along with other incentives - as a way to achieve progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has so far dismissed the western incentives incentives on offer but tehran remains steadfast " the western powers along with russia and china are offering iran lessened sanctions , the chance to fix world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership in return for explanations of what has gone on in regard to tehran 's nuclear program and realistic assurances that it has no military nuclear intentions , " simon henderson , director of the gulf and energy policy program at the washington institute for near east policy , told deutsche welle .
" the best hope for agreement lies on the possibility of reaching an acceptable compromise regarding the shipment of already enriched uranium from iran to an outside destination , " khonsari said .
" if agreement could be reached on the quantity , and there is a minute chance given past turkish and brazilian mediation that this is possible , there may still be a way out though it will be very difficult . "
there were concerns that the geneva negotiations would be made even more problematic by the latest wikileaks revelations which exposed the level of international concern and distrust of iran , especially among its persian gulf neighbors , and the consideration of many that military action is the best option when it comes to stopping tehran 's nuclear program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 07.12.2010 less bureaucracy , more efficiency as europe ponders aid future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid agencies worry about whether the money will continue to flow diverse and often contradictory interests between donor nations and aid organizations were on ample display at the european development days .
and no one seems to know exactly what role the european union will play . the fifth edition of the european development days , a two-day eu-sponsored conference in brussels that brings together representatives of governments , humanitarian ngos and others , was the first to take place after the creation of the european external action service , the eu equivalent of a foreign ministry .
not surprisingly , much of the focus of the discussions was what impact increasing eu coordination and involvement would have on the aid handed out by some of the world 's wealthiest countries to some of its poorest .
no one seemed particularly optimistic .
deputy chairman of the africa commission erastus mwencha , for example , said the body had too little power , asking for instance why the eu failed to have single coordinated positions at groups like the world trade organization .
representatives of aid groups , meanwhile , said they feared that more power in brussels would simply bring increased bureaucracy .
bildunterschrift : investing in education pays big long-term dividends " again there are also problems with red tape , " said philomena johnson , the director of the charity group caritas in ghana .
" what we call long processes and procedures that make it impossible for developing countries to make optimal benefits from the resources that come to them to reduce poverty . "
and the individual countries in the eu are also wary about handing over control of what have previously been national aid initiatives .
" as a member state with quite a lot of money and thereby quite a lot of responsibility , i have to see who is accountable , " said swedish development minister gunilla carlsson .
" that 's why it has been hard to devote all the money to brussels .
it has been rather anonymous , it 's really bureaucratic , and also as a donor , it 's very hard to have influence . "
carlsson was speaking from a position of moral high ground .
sweden is one of only five countries that have achieved aid targets formulated 40 years ago .
0.7 percent - not enough or too much ?
bildunterschrift : this ambulance is part of the millennium project , but larger aims are n't being met in 1970 , the un general assembly decided that the world 's wealthy countries should be devoting 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product to aid .
that goal was confirmed by the un millennium project , and the target date was set at 2015 .
the eu and its member states provide some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.6 billion -rrb- in aid annually , but in terms of percentage that figure does not come even close to the target .
oxfam says germany , for instance , spent only 0.35 percent of its 2009 gross domestic product on developmental assistance , slightly less than the year before , and is n't scheduled to meet the un goal until 2027 .
eu development commissioner andris piebalgs used the brussels event to remind eu members of their obligations .
" the real challenge is how europeans will use the 0.7 percent so that it really has the impact our taxpayers expect , " piebalgs said .
" our taxpayers expect that there is a visible change in the conditions of life in developing countries . "
but mentioning expectations and measureable effects also raises the sensitive issue of whether developmental aid truly works .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the money never gets to the poor aid , according to a famous quip attributed to british economist peter bauer , is " an excellent method for transferring money from poor people in rich countries to rich people in poor countries . "
and earlier this year , the free-market washington think-tank center for global development published a report claiming that the 0.7 percent figure was arbitrary , and that less money , if well spent , would do more to benefit poor people in , for instance , africa .
" the assumptions that in africa all aid becomes investment and all investment becomes growth have no empirical support , " the report 's authors concluded .
" the evidence is very strong that africa 's growth performance has been weak not from a lack of capital per se , but from low productivity of that capital . "
in other words , the problem is less about giving more money than about ensuring that money is used to generate lasting improvements .
for this reason , germany has been placing more and more emphasis on linking aid to good governance in recipient countries .
quid pro quo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel is among those who say that money is only as good as the results it yields although idealistic notions of human solidarity are one factor that motivates developmental aid , another is simple self-interest .
countries rich in natural resources such as libya , algeria and the central asia republics are increasingly becoming a focus of both german and european aid initiatives .
on a slightest less morally ambiguous note , most european countries see aid as a means of encouraging stability in poorer countries and thus a vastly cheaper alternative to military interventions .
germany 's development minister dirk niebel recently made this point with reference to afghanistan .
" we assume that , if we want to bring our soldiers home , our efforts have to put a clear emphasis on civilian support , " niebel told reporters .
" the citizens of afghanistan need a true peace dividend .
they have to see that our effort clearly betters their personal living conditions .
that will have on an effect on regions that are n't so secure and others where we would hope to see some quick improvements . "
this " butter versus guns " ideal is , of course , anything but new , but it does underscore a point that increasing numbers of european and world leaders are making .
where aid is concerned , delivery counts every bit as much as amount .

in brussels on tuesday , eu monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn expressed confidence that this money would not be lost .
" i 'm confident that ireland , with its smart , competent , and stubborn people - and its prospects of recovering -lsb- from -rsb- this situation - will overcome the current challenges . "
tough budget while the final stamp of approval for the bailout loan was being given in brussels , the irish government in dublin announced deep cuts in its 2011 budget .
tax hikes and spending cuts are expected to save the country around 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lenihan unveiled a tough budget on tuesday " as outlined in the plan , six billion euros of the overall adjustment is made in today 's budget .
the scale of this adjustment is demanding but it demonstrates the seriousness of our intent , " said finance minister brian lenihan in an address to ireland 's lower house of parliament .
the budget cuts were necessary to secure the bailout from the eu and the international monetary fund .
tapping the reserves ireland 's bailout comes from the 750 billion euro crisis fund established earlier this year after greece required similar aid .
now , the question is still being asked : will ireland be the only country to access the fund , or will portugal , spain or even italy need support soon ?
and if so , will 750 billion euros be enough ?
for spanish finance minister elena salgado , the problem simply does not exist .
“ the volume of the crisis mechanism seems reasonable to us , ” she said .
but from her , these words seem logical ; spain is trying to soothe the markets .
belgian finance minister didier reynders , who chaired the talks , is more cautious , saying debates on the size of the bailout mechanism will likely continue .

the eu ’ s foreign policy chief catherine ashton said the talks were detailed and substantive .
the meeting aimed to fix the framework for " several sessions " of future negotiations , with the next round of talks now planned for the end of january in istanbul .
the two-day meeting comes 14 months after the last attempt to temper iran 's uranium enrichment drive and clarify its nuclear capabilities .
the so-called 5 + 1 group of the united states , britain , france , russia , china and germany are worried iran could use its uranium enrichment plants to make fuel for warheads .
iran insists that it is seeking nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
before the talks started , iran made statements that their right to seek nuclear technology was " non-negotiable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says enrichment facilities like this , are just used for peaceful purposes however after repeated breakdowns in international inspections and the build up of uranium enrichment , western countries suspect iran is engaging in a covert program to build nuclear weapons .
the negotiating teams meet iran ’ s chief negotiator saeed jalili opened the talks on monday by making a vehement protest against the recent assassination of a top nuclear scientist in tehran , questioning why the international group did not condemn it .
he later held one-on-one meetings with the heads of the chinese , russian and british delegations as well as having a working dinner with ashton .
european sources said they were not expecting the geneva talks to produce instant results but hoping to re-engage iran over the longer term .
" we 've said all along that this was a starting point , and the aim was to have another meeting in which we can take things forward , " one eu diplomat told the news agency reuters .

deutsche welle spoke with tom kirchmaier of the london school of economics about the decision . eurozone finance ministers met on monday evening to discuss increasing the emergency fund but ultimately decided it was big enough .
is it ?
at the moment it is enough .
but the problem is a different one .
you arrange a fund like this to send a signal to the market that there is no point in speculating against the currency .
so by not increasing the fund , the eurozone finance ministers send a signal that there might actually be a point in speculating against larger countries like spain .
so in that way , they made the markets less stable , not more .
you do n't think markets are convinced yet that the debt crisis is contained ?
the funds are enough to support countries like greece and portugal , they are not enough to support countries like spain , or belgium , or italy .
it 's an arithmetic game , and you come up with a number that 's around one-and-a-half trillion , or two trillion euros and you come up with a guarantee where you can say , this is rock solid .
the number is just so big that it becomes clear to everybody that a speculator ca n't win .
another idea that had been floated prior to monday evening 's meeting , but was then not discussed , was that of bonds issued jointly by the eurozone countries .
is that a good idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the efsf is not big enough for markets to take it seriously " it 's a good idea in principle , but it 's very far-fetched politically .
one of the problems with the eurozone - and it 's a problem from birth - is that monetary policy is done by the european central bank , but fiscal policy is done by each of the member states .
and that creates almost perverse incentives for the individual member states to over-consume , which is what they have done .
one of the ways to solve this problem is to centralize fiscal policy , i.e. to make more fiscal decisions in brussels .
if you launch a euro bond , you essentially do exactly that because you then unify all the risks which you have in the eurozone .
for it to work , you have to have a centralized fiscal policy .
interestingly , china and sovereign wealth funds are very keen for europe to issue these bonds because they would be highly liquid and a good alternative to a us treasury bond .
both the bigger emergency fund and the euro bonds are supposed to convince markets of the " irreversibility " of the euro , as luxemberg 's prime minister jean claude juncker put it .
is the euro in fact " irreversible " or can you imagine a scenario in which this common currency would fold ?
nothing is irreversible .
it would unravel the minute that germany in particular were to make the tiniest suggestion about leaving .
it would be possible to reverse the euro , but it would have catastrophic consequences .
on one hand , you would see a bank run with weaker countries - everybody would try to get their money and put it in a german bank account and that would lead to an immediate collapse of the banking system in that country .
it would be catastrophic for the european idea , for these weak economies , and if germany were to decide to leave , it would not be good for germany either because the currency would appreciate dramatically .
next week at a eu summit , leaders are expected to agree on permanent eurozone rescue mechanisms , since the current emergency fund expires in 2013 .
what could or what should these permanent mechanisms look like ?
the issue of " permanent " only makes sense if the fund is large and credible enough .
at the moment i do n't see that we are getting any closer to making a credible long-term commitment to stability .
the only really credible commitment would be to integrate fiscal policy further .

deutsche welle spoke with tom kirchmaier of the london school of economics about the decision . eurozone finance ministers met on monday evening to discuss increasing the emergency fund but ultimately decided it was big enough .
is it ?
at the moment it is enough .
but the problem is a different one .
you arrange a fund like this to send a signal to the market that there is no point in speculating against the currency .
so by not increasing the fund , the eurozone finance ministers send a signal that there might actually be a point in speculating against larger countries like spain .
so in that way , they made the markets less stable , not more .
you do n't think markets are convinced yet that the debt crisis is contained ?
the funds are enough to support countries like greece and portugal , they are not enough to support countries like spain , or belgium , or italy .
it 's an arithmetic game , and you come up with a number that 's around one-and-a-half trillion , or two trillion euros and you come up with a guarantee where you can say , this is rock solid .
the number is just so big that it becomes clear to everybody that a speculator ca n't win .
another idea that had been floated prior to monday evening 's meeting , but was then not discussed , was that of bonds issued jointly by the eurozone countries .
is that a good idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the efsf is not big enough for markets to take it seriously " it 's a good idea in principle , but it 's very far-fetched politically .
one of the problems with the eurozone - and it 's a problem from birth - is that monetary policy is done by the european central bank , but fiscal policy is done by each of the member states .
and that creates almost perverse incentives for the individual member states to over-consume , which is what they have done .
one of the ways to solve this problem is to centralize fiscal policy , i.e. to make more fiscal decisions in brussels .
if you launch a euro bond , you essentially do exactly that because you then unify all the risks which you have in the eurozone .
for it to work , you have to have a centralized fiscal policy .
interestingly , china and sovereign wealth funds are very keen for europe to issue these bonds because they would be highly liquid and a good alternative to a us treasury bond .
both the bigger emergency fund and the euro bonds are supposed to convince markets of the " irreversibility " of the euro , as luxemberg 's prime minister jean claude juncker put it .
is the euro in fact " irreversible " or can you imagine a scenario in which this common currency would fold ?
nothing is irreversible .
it would unravel the minute that germany in particular were to make the tiniest suggestion about leaving .

but know-how , often protected by patents , is trickling way too slowly from industrialized nations to poorer regions . every few years , world leaders get together at high-profile conferences to discuss ways to reduce global warming and save the planet . the 2010 united nations climate change conference is currently being held in cancun , mexico .
but the talks are taking place amid low expectations , after the disappointment of the copenhagen summit last year – which memorably failed to produce any binding agreements .
this came as a particular blow to the g77 countries , which have in fact expanded to 131 mostly developing nations .
their demands include a relaxation , if not a general lifting , of patent protection laws governing renewable energies .
their argument is that it is first and foremost the industrialized nations that are responsible for climate change , while the poorer nations pay the price for the wealthier countries ' mistakes .
therefore industrialized nations should at least give them the benefit of their green energy know-how .
sharing their patents would go some way to paying off their climate debts , the g77 countries say .
the patent imbalance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patents get in the way of technology transfer between developed and developing nations according to a new study compiled by the un environment program , 80 percent of all patented innovations in the area of clean energy technologies are registered by companies in japan , germany , us , south korea , britain and france .
the report , which examines the role of patents in combating climate change , was jointly conducted with the european patent office and the international centre for trade and sustainable development .
" the fact that northern countries keep their expertise on regenerative energies to themselves , puts the south at an additional disadvantage , " says aileen kwa from south center , an intergovernmental policy think tank of developing countries .
as a climate-friendly , affordable alternative to fossil fuels , clean energy is key to the future of the developing world , and allows people to access energy supplies without having to rely on major providers .
moreover , it decentralizes the energy supply .
in countries where the majority of the population is rural , solar panels and geothermal heat pumps installed in individual homes are energy efficient solutions for people who would otherwise go without .
one problem , however , is the frequent lack of local expertise necessary not only to install the technology , but also to maintain it .
not only does the equipment therefore need to be imported – the know-how does to .
if patents are a factor , the whole process soon becomes very costly .
but it 's not only developing nations that have some catching-up to do on the clean energy front .
green technology is still very much in its infancy in croatia , for example , although grassroots projects are slowly beginning to gather momentum .
even in industrialized countries , it seems , introduction of climate protection measures comes with a high price tag . popular misconceptions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in cancun , debate is centering around mobilizing funds and technology transfer to cope with climate change one obstacle to globalized climate control is the general ignorance in the developed world of what exactly the developing world needs .
" indigenous knowledge on protecting natural resources and alternative energy supplies often exists , " points out kwa , stressing that all that 's then needed is a transfer of technology that can be implemented locally .
rainer osterwalder from the european patent office agrees , but says there 's plenty of room for improvement .
" the technology transfer from north to south is still unsatisfactory , " he says .
" one thing that should n't be forgotten is that emerging economies , and china in particular , are increasingly active when it comes to domestic innovation in the area of regenerative energy . "
" patents neither create problems nor solve them , " he says .
in his opinion , more urgent problems include inadequate infrastructure in the developing world ; the lack of an existing market for clean technologies and the lack of opportunity to build one .
adding to the problem is the popular misconception that patents are internationally valid .
in fact , if a patent is n't registered with the patent office of a specific country , then it does n't exist .
" a french company does n't necessarily register the patent for its photovoltaic technology in angola , say , if it believes that there 's no market for such a system in that country , " explains osterwalder .
in developing countries , however , few people are aware that many technologies are not actually patented in their country .
a spanner in the works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , local expertise is underestimated critics believe that ultimately , patent protection is a major stumbling block in fighting climate change .
in recent years , the european patent office has complained about the ‘ global patent warming , ' stressing that the increasing number of patent applications is slowing down the issue of patents .
the multitude of patent applications does not mean that the world is coming up with more innovations - rather , what is happening is that inventors and companies that already hold patents in one country are lining up at many other national patent offices to get patents for other markets .
ultimately , the purpose of securing a patent is to throw a spanner in the works of rival development .
the patents issue is one that results in the developing world feeling as though it has been left to deal with climate change by itself , by the very countries that are mainly responsible for it .
but industrialized nations retaliate by citing the free market and the necessary protection of intellectual property – and , needless to say , their own economic superiority . whether or not it is justifiable to privatize expertise in the field of regenerative energy is a question that will no doubt be raised at the current summit in cancun .

the multitude of patent applications does not mean that the world is coming up with more innovations - rather , what is happening is that inventors and companies that already hold patents in one country are lining up at many other national patent offices to get patents for other markets .

but know-how , often protected by patents , is trickling way too slowly from industrialized nations to poorer regions . every few years , world leaders get together at high-profile conferences to discuss ways to reduce global warming and save the planet . the 2010 united nations climate change conference is currently being held in cancun , mexico .
but the talks are taking place amid low expectations , after the disappointment of the copenhagen summit last year – which memorably failed to produce any binding agreements .
this came as a particular blow to the g77 countries , which have in fact expanded to 131 mostly developing nations .
their demands include a relaxation , if not a general lifting , of patent protection laws governing renewable energies .
their argument is that it is first and foremost the industrialized nations that are responsible for climate change , while the poorer nations pay the price for the wealthier countries ' mistakes .
therefore industrialized nations should at least give them the benefit of their green energy know-how .
sharing their patents would go some way to paying off their climate debts , the g77 countries say .
the patent imbalance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patents get in the way of technology transfer between developed and developing nations according to a new study compiled by the un environment program , 80 percent of all patented innovations in the area of clean energy technologies are registered by companies in japan , germany , us , south korea , britain and france .
the report , which examines the role of patents in combating climate change , was jointly conducted with the european patent office and the international centre for trade and sustainable development .
" the fact that northern countries keep their expertise on regenerative energies to themselves , puts the south at an additional disadvantage , " says aileen kwa from south center , an intergovernmental policy think tank of developing countries .
as a climate-friendly , affordable alternative to fossil fuels , clean energy is key to the future of the developing world , and allows people to access energy supplies without having to rely on major providers .
moreover , it decentralizes the energy supply .
in countries where the majority of the population is rural , solar panels and geothermal heat pumps installed in individual homes are energy efficient solutions for people who would otherwise go without .
one problem , however , is the frequent lack of local expertise necessary not only to install the technology , but also to maintain it .
not only does the equipment therefore need to be imported – the know-how does to .
if patents are a factor , the whole process soon becomes very costly .
but it 's not only developing nations that have some catching-up to do on the clean energy front .
green technology is still very much in its infancy in croatia , for example , although grassroots projects are slowly beginning to gather momentum .
even in industrialized countries , it seems , introduction of climate protection measures comes with a high price tag . popular misconceptions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in cancun , debate is centering around mobilizing funds and technology transfer to cope with climate change one obstacle to globalized climate control is the general ignorance in the developed world of what exactly the developing world needs .
" indigenous knowledge on protecting natural resources and alternative energy supplies often exists , " points out kwa , stressing that all that 's then needed is a transfer of technology that can be implemented locally .
rainer osterwalder from the european patent office agrees , but says there 's plenty of room for improvement .
" the technology transfer from north to south is still unsatisfactory , " he says .
" one thing that should n't be forgotten is that emerging economies , and china in particular , are increasingly active when it comes to domestic innovation in the area of regenerative energy . "
" patents neither create problems nor solve them , " he says .
in his opinion , more urgent problems include inadequate infrastructure in the developing world ; the lack of an existing market for clean technologies and the lack of opportunity to build one .

now , a jewish museum is being built near the site . the construction of warsaw 's jewish museum is currently the most extensive cultural project in poland , though few in neighboring germany even know about it . the museum is being built in what was the warsaw ghetto during the period of nazi occupation .
nearby is the memorial to the victims of the warsaw ghetto uprising , in front of which former german chancellor willy brandt spontaneously knelt 40 years ago , on december 7 , 1970 .
it was an unprecedented act of humility that would become a milestone in polish-german ties . moral obligation to support museum plans for the jewish museum began in 1994 when then german president roman herzog got behind the project and oversaw the launch of a development foundation to fund it .
though the idea for the museum initially came from poland , the country lacked the necessary resources at that time . " roman herzog suddenly endorsed he idea , " said josef thesing , chairman of the development foundation .
" our foundation was started in order to make the idea a reality .
if we had n't managed to secure funding from the beginning , it never would have happened . " so far , the foundation has managed to acquire some 6 million euros -lrb- about $ 8 million -rrb- for the museum project ; by its completion in 2013 , costs are expected to total 90 million euros . thesing added that germany had a moral responsibility to invest in the warsaw museum . " i think that we can demonstrate that there is a different germany now , " he said .
" and , together with poles - who are now our friends in the european community - we can work through our past instead of denying it and look , with our unique perspective , toward a common future . " bildunterschrift : chancellor willy brandt 's humble gesture at the memorial to the victims of the warsaw uprising in 1970 was unplanned , but went down in history rich jewish tradition in poland the path to the future leads first through the past .
few poles are aware that the first known reference to their country was made in hebrew .
poland 's jewish roots go back a thousand years , according to auschwitz survivor marian turski . " we have no jews in poland - almost no jews .
the jews are present in history , they 're present in literature but there 's a vacuum in society , hence , the interest in those topics , " said turski .
" this is why we estimate that this will be one of the most-visited museums in poland . " it was marian turski who conceived the idea for the museum in the early 1990s .
he chairs poland 's jewish historical institute and is now chairman of the jewish museum as well . for turski , there was only one possible location for the museum : the site of the warsaw ghetto and willy brandt 's 1970 gesture of reconciliation . " for a long time , as the chairman of the jewish historical institute , i was the owner of this land , " said turski .
" it was obvious to everybody that there was no better and no more appropriate place than this to build the museum . " bildunterschrift : jewish life is slowly returning to warsaw turning point in understanding history it was n't until a year and a half ago that construction finally began , under the auspices of museum director jerzy halbersztadt .
he said its completion , planned for 2013 , would be a new landmark in the often difficult relationship between germany and poland . " the construction of this museum is a very important turning point , " he said .
" it can not transform the whole country , but it will be a sign of the changes that took place in the last 20 years of democratic development . " the museum wo n't focus solely on the holocaust , but will span from the very beginning of poland 's jewish roots to the present day . that includes the kielce pogrom of 1946 , when townspeople and officials in the polish town turned against the jewish community , killing around 40 people .
the anti-semitic sentiment that sprung up in the late 1960s is also to be addressed , as is the gradual return of judaism in post-communist poland . " our mission is to reach those who do n't understand what it means in the contemporary world to have an open dialogue , revisit history , tell the truth about history whether it 's nice or not , " said halbersztadt .
" those who are not convinced today will be convinced tomorrow , i believe that . " the museum director is expecting some half a million visitors per year to come and contribute to a new understanding of history in the country . author : wolfram stahl -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the debt-ridden country needs to fill a six billion euro hole . ireland 's already unpopular ruling party , fianna fail , will on tuesday present the toughest budget in the country 's history .
finance minister brian lenihan has already announced that dublin will be looking to raise an extra six billion euros -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- in 2011 , through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts .
due to the domestic budget presentation , lenihan has been forced to skip the high profile eurogroup meeting in brussels this week addressing the eurozone 's debt woes , sending ministry officials in his place .
the irish government effectively issued an outline of its plans for the coming year two weeks ago , when ironing out a broad four-year national recovery plan in order to qualify for an 85 billion euro rescue deal from the european union and international monetary fund .
the first tranche of these emergency loans will not be released until the budget is passed .
to placate the eu and imf , ireland needs to generate an extra 15 billion euros by 2014 , as it battles to bring its annual budget deficit back within the prescribed eurozone limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
this year 's deficit , which has ballooned due to the government bailout of the country 's biggest moneylender , anglo irish bank , is likely to be 32 percent of gdp .
" the budget is usually the most eagerly anticipated event in the fiscal calendar , " economist dermot o 'leary at goodbody stockbrokers in dublin told the afp news agency .

ireland 's relatively generous welfare spending is likely to take a big hit , with child benefit and social welfare spending facing a reduction of at least 5 percent .
only state pensions are expected to remain unchanged .
thousands of public sector jobs will also be cut , and those civil servants who keep their jobs will face pay cuts or freezes .
changes in tax brackets will generate the rest of the revenue .
by lowering income tax brands and revising the country 's tax credit system , the government will be able to target thousands of irish adults on lower incomes who currently do not have to pay income tax .
a reduction in the country 's minimum wage , which is currently the second highest in the eu at 8.65 euros per hour , is also on the cards .

cowen 's coalition government no longer controls the lower house of parliament , the dail , and will need to find either independent or opposition support .
" the consequences of not passing a budget would be disastrous for ireland and its people , " independent mp michael lowry said in a statement on monday evening , pledging his reluctant support to the government 's proposal .
" despite some adverse reaction in my constituency to this decision i feel duty bound to put the country 's interests first . "

the debt-ridden country needs to fill a six billion euro hole . ireland 's already unpopular ruling party , fianna fail , will on tuesday present the toughest budget in the country 's history .
finance minister brian lenihan has already announced that dublin will be looking to raise an extra six billion euros -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- in 2011 , through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts .
due to the domestic budget presentation , lenihan has been forced to skip the high profile eurogroup meeting in brussels this week addressing the eurozone 's debt woes , sending ministry officials in his place .
the irish government effectively issued an outline of its plans for the coming year two weeks ago , when ironing out a broad four-year national recovery plan in order to qualify for an 85 billion euro rescue deal from the european union and international monetary fund .
the first tranche of these emergency loans will not be released until the budget is passed .
to placate the eu and imf , ireland needs to generate an extra 15 billion euros by 2014 , as it battles to bring its annual budget deficit back within the prescribed eurozone limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
this year 's deficit , which has ballooned due to the government bailout of the country 's biggest moneylender , anglo irish bank , is likely to be 32 percent of gdp .
" the budget is usually the most eagerly anticipated event in the fiscal calendar , " economist dermot o 'leary at goodbody stockbrokers in dublin told the afp news agency .
" this year though , the thunder has been stolen by the release of last week 's four-year plan .
we already know the broad parameters of what will be contained in the budget for 2011 . "
cuts in public sector , taxes to rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands protested when the initial recovery plan was announced roughly two-thirds of the savings are set to come from the public sector .
ireland 's relatively generous welfare spending is likely to take a big hit , with child benefit and social welfare spending facing a reduction of at least 5 percent .
only state pensions are expected to remain unchanged .
thousands of public sector jobs will also be cut , and those civil servants who keep their jobs will face pay cuts or freezes .
changes in tax brackets will generate the rest of the revenue .
by lowering income tax brands and revising the country 's tax credit system , the government will be able to target thousands of irish adults on lower incomes who currently do not have to pay income tax .
a reduction in the country 's minimum wage , which is currently the second highest in the eu at 8.65 euros per hour , is also on the cards .
government promises election once budget passes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even if ireland recovers , prime minister cowen is unlikely to irish prime minister brian cowen 's government might be forced into snap elections if the budget does not pass .
cowen , whose approval ratings are at an all-time low , has also pledged to call elections soon after parliament ratifies the austerity measures .
cowen 's coalition government no longer controls the lower house of parliament , the dail , and will need to find either independent or opposition support .
" the consequences of not passing a budget would be disastrous for ireland and its people , " independent mp michael lowry said in a statement on monday evening , pledging his reluctant support to the government 's proposal .
" despite some adverse reaction in my constituency to this decision i feel duty bound to put the country 's interests first . "
the dail 's other independent lawmaker , jackie healy-rae , has not yet revealed his position .
it 's unclear whether the main opposition group , the center-right fine gael and center-left labour parties , will attempt to thwart the budget in parliament or not .
barring a dramatic change in the public mood , these two parties look certain to rule in coalition once irish voters next go to the polls .

the specification supports both smart cards and future versions of smartphones .
mobile devices equipped with near-field communications -lrb- nfc -rrb- chips would enable customers to pay for their journey at a ticket turnstile with a wave of a cell phone .
known as " cipurse , " the standard was developed by a group of leading technology firms , which announced a new partnership , known as the open standard for public transport -lrb- ospt -rrb- alliance .
" for mobile device manufacturers , the open security standard will be the next ‘ must-have ' checklist item they include in all next-generation nfc implementations , " the group said in a statement .
the ospt alliance described its open system as offering an alternative to proprietary technologies , which the group said " limit choices , are potentially less secure and cost more to acquire , deploy and maintain . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chip maker infineon is a member of the ospt alliance collaborators welcome the developers of the open security standard say their alliance is also open to bringing new partners into the fold .
on tuesday , watchdata technologies ltd. and the open ticketing institute of the netherlands joined the group , which already included inside secure , oberthur technologies and giesecke & devrient , as well as german chip maker infineon technologies .
the cipurse system was welcomed by transit industry representatives - among them the fare system director for singapore 's land transport authority .
" cipurse is an important step towards establishing standardized , secure and interoperable fare collection for all public transport schemes , and we plan to adopt it for future releases of -lrb- singapore 's contactless e-purse application -rrb- cepas , " said silvester prakasam , singapore 's fare system director , in the same statement .
the vice president of engineering with cubic transportation systems , inc . , pradip mistry , also described his company as " thrilled " with the group 's new open security standard .
an eye toward security the alliance is now looking to finalize its new specification – which can be used for smart cards and contactless tickets , as well as mobile phones and other media . though smart card technology has been around for years , the companies behind the open standard wanted to take another look at security .
the mifare classic chip , the technology and security standard widely used in today 's smart cards , saw its encryption cracked in recent years . tilo pannenbaecker , infineon technologies ' vice president and general manager of business line personal and object id , told deutsche welle that the new security standard uses the advanced encryption standard -lrb- aes -rrb- 128 , which he called " a more advanced , more modern cryptography . " but the alliance also found fault with the proprietary nature of the mifare technology .
pannenbaecker said the group 's new specification would allow a range of vendors to offer nfc-capable sim cards and phones . " our security standard that we are proposing now is the ideal security concept for nfc because it is offering advanced security , so chances of fraud and counterfeiting are limited , " he said .
" and it is a technology available at fair and reasonable terms . " the future of financial transactions ? google plans to put an nfc-enabled smartphone on the market this month .
at a web 2.0 summit in san francisco this past november , google 's chief executive eric schmidt said the next-generation devices " will be able to do commerce . " the head of research in motion , the company behind the blackberry smartphone , also expressed interest during the summit in incorporating nfc chips into the firm 's product range - and soon . 2011 could be off to a strong start : charles walton , chief operating officer for inside secure , cited estimates of between 40 and 50 million payment-equipped phones hitting the market next year . " now that the industry is moving to nfc phones and guys like google and apple and others are getting on board with nfc , they are looking for some global standards , " he told news agency afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong and japan already have smart card transit payment systems in place winning over consumers still , some analysts suggest taking a step back - and looking beyond the buzz surrounding the " tap and pay " phenomenon when it comes to mobile phones . " it 's a move in the right direction , " said christophe uzureau , research director of banking and investment services at gartner research , " but we tend to forget the big picture . " uzureau told deutsche welle that mobile providers are keen to seize upon the potential of nfc-enabled phones - but the industry is creating " a lot of hype . " consumers in hong kong , with its " octopus card , " and japan , which has " suica , " are accustomed to using prepaid , contactless means for transit .
but replacing cards with phones is easier said than done . " this only works if all consumers have nfc-enabled phones , and if they are confident in using them , " uzureau said .
" and right now , most consumers are not . " that means mobile operators must convince their customers to increase their usage of nfc-enabled phones - and to do so , they must show them that the chips allow for better financial access and control . but companies might have trouble persuading customers to change their habits .
despite what uzureau called a " perfect supply-side arrangement , " in japan , cash-centric consumers there have been slow to latch on . " on the demand side , most customers do n't see the point of nfc-enabled mobile phones , " he said , adding that having a bit more speed at the point of sale still does n't outweigh the benefits of secure cash transactions . " it 's not going to replace the wallet , " uzureau said . author : amanda price -lrb- afp -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 07.12.2010 concern over politicization of top donor governments ’ aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philip tamminga an international organization , which evaluates the effectiveness of donor governments ’ aid for people suffering from conflicts , disasters and climate change , has released its 2010 humanitarian response index . the dara index -lrb- hri -rrb- assesses responses to crises by the world 's top donor governments – members of the disaster action committee of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
now in its fourth year , the hri examines performance under five “ pillars ” of donor practice : response to needs ; prevention , risk reduction and recovery ; working with partners ; protection and international humanitarian law ; and learning and accountability .
denmark tops the hri ranking list followed by ireland , new zealand , norway , and sweden , while the european commission comes in sixth .
the head of the hri team , philip tamminga , talked with deutsche welle about the latest index and how political priorities have impeded the delivery of humanitarian aid to millions .
deutsche welle : germany does n't appear to have done too well in your assessment .
why is that ?
philip tamminga : germany is ranked 14th -lsb- out of 20 -rsb- in the index this year , just after canada and australia , but before japan and france . germany spends a lot less on humanitarian assistance than other countries , and the percentage of its aid dedicated to humanitarian crises is about half of the average of other donors . so it lags somewhat behind other countries .
other factors that explain germany 's position in the ranking is that it has too many restrictive conditions on its aid funding .
this sometimes makes it difficult for the humanitarian organizations it funds to have enough flexibility to direct aid where it is needed or to adapt programmes if the situation changes on the ground - which happens quite often in a disaster or conflict .
germany could also do better at funding un and red cross appeals , and make better use of regular evaluations to improve the quality and effectiveness of the assistance it provides .
germany does have many strengths , though .
for instance , it tends to provide funding rapidly in cases of disasters , and it 's a strong supporter of ngos .
it is also one of the better donor governments in terms of its commitment towards accountability to people affected by crises - making sure aid is effective and responds to their needs . could you explain briefly how exactly the assessment is done – what are the key tools and methodology employed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid is much-needed in many corners of the globe we assess donors by looking at 35 different indicators of how well they support humanitarian action and apply good practices .
the indicators are based on the core concepts contained in the declaration of good humanitarian donorship , which was developed and signed by the world 's main donor governments - including germany - in 2003 .
what we want to see is if governments are respecting the commitments they made , so we send teams to different humanitarian crises and we talk to the different humanitarian organizations about how well the governments that fund their work are applying good practice .
we combine this with publicly available information from published sources on government aid funding , respect of international humanitarian law , and other elements of good donor practice .
this year , our teams visited 14 humanitarian crises areas like haiti , afghanistan , somalia , sudan and pakistan , and we spoke to over 500 senior officials working in these crises from the united nations , the red cross and the red crescent , ngos , donor governments and others .
we also collected nearly 2,000 survey responses .
this gives us a good basis to measure and compare donor governments each year on whether their policies and practices facilitate or impede an effective response to crises .
the report says that there 's ample evidence of politicization of aid .
exactly what evidence do you have to show that political interests have overtaken the commitment to good humanitarian donorship ?
in 10 of the 14 crises we visited , we saw and heard of evidence that donor governments were placing political interests above humanitarian objectives . in some cases , like afghanistan , the use of western military forces to provide humanitarian assistance is compromising the neutrality , impartiality and independence of humanitarian organizations , and putting humanitarian workers and civilians at risk .
we also saw in some places like somalia , the occupied palestinian territories or yemen , some donor governments are putting restrictions on humanitarian organizations that prevents them from working in areas controlled by certain groups like hamas , as part of the " war on terror . "
this means the people in need are not getting the aid they deserve .
in other crises , there are debates about how foreign aid can help win " hearts and minds " or achieve other foreign policy objectives .
one of the most basic humanitarian principles – which donor governments committed themselves to when they signed the good donorship declaration – is that humanitarian assistance should be given without discrimination , and based on needs alone – and not because it may or may not help a government achieve other objectives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastation left behind by the 2005 tsunami the hri report claims that there are gaps in the protection of civilians and that the lack of safe humanitarian access has put vulnerable groups at risk of harm .
basically , this refers to the promotion of international humanitarian law and goes beyond programming issues – is the report referring to diplomacy efforts in this direction ? yes , the report is clear that as a result of politicization , safe access by humanitarian organizations to people affected by crisis is being compromised . because of that , humanitarian workers are at risk , and civilian populations are not getting the protection and assistance they need .
a recent example of this lack of protection was seen in the mass rapes that took place in the democratic republic of the congo .
and the safety of humanitarian workers is also at stake : last year over 260 humanitarians were killed , kidnapped or injured while trying to carry out their work .
you have also accused donors of failing to improve transparency and accountability towards affected people .
which countries have fared well under this pillar and which poorly ?
donor governments are not doing enough to promote better accountability towards people affected by disasters and crises .
there are lots of requirements on humanitarian organizations to report on how they have spent the money they get , and what kind of results , but very few donor governments have in place requirements to monitor and ensure that aid money is being used to meet the needs and priorities of the actual people affected by the crisis .
most professional humanitarian organizations already do this to some extent , but donor governments are not monitoring and following up adequately , and supporting these efforts . another concern is that donor governments are not being transparent or accountable on the aid that they promise . for example , many governments have still not disbursed all the funds that they promised after the earthquake in haiti .
and while the promises are made in the media or in international conferences , most of the time , the people affected do n't receive any information about this , and do n't have any way to participate directly on how that aid will be prioritized or spent .
this is why we call on governments to improve their transparency and accountability . germany tends to do better than other donors in this area , and could perhaps take the lead in building more commitment amongst donor governments .
what 's been donor governments ' response to this ranking system – surely some are n't happy with the whole exercise ?
some governments have told us that they think a ranking system is counterproductive , and does n't encourage or motivate donor governments to do better .
but in fact , some of the lowest ranked donors have told us they appreciate having a tool like the humanitarian response index to benchmark their performance and to know where they stand compared to their peers . the ranking is only a minor part of the exercise , though .
we collect a lot of valuable information about how donors are performing , and we have always offered this information to governments , donor agencies and other stakeholders to use it to understand where a government may need to improve , and where they are doing well .
by visiting 14 crises areas – the biggest evaluation exercise of its kind in the humanitarian sector – we are able to identify trends that affect the quality and impact of aid .
so we have lots of valuable analysis to share with the international community , such as our increasing concerns about politicization of aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food for those who need it most you must have confronted questions relating to legitimacy , though – what gives dara the authority to rank donor performance ?
first of all , dara has a great multi-disciplinary team with extensive experience in the field of evaluating humanitarian action . we were part of the huge tsunami joint evaluation exercise on how the entire humanitarian system responded .
dara looked specifically at the area of donor funding , which gave us insights on how they took decisions , and why good practice was so difficult for them to apply .
that was the basis for us creating the humanitarian response index – to systematically measure donor practice and provide solid , empirical evidence on where donor governments need to improve further . since then , we have carried out hri evaluations in over 35 crises , along with our extensive evaluation experience in other areas .
we also felt it was absolutely critical for an independent , objective evaluation of donor governments .
until the hri was created , there was no way to monitor if donor governments were complying with their commitments .
most of the tools and processes used by donors to assess their own performance are not transparent enough , and do n't look at issues around the quality of their aid , or the relationship with the humanitarian organizations they fund .
we think the hri can be used to stimulate changes and improvements .
has the hri , since its inception in 2007 , had a measurable impact on donors ?
if so , could you give some examples ?
yes .
the index has helped to raise many issues and concerns facing the humanitarian sector in general , and several donor governments have now taken this up as an issue for discussion at the international level .
for example , our findings in the 2008 report called for improvements in the way that humanitarian needs are identified so that aid could be distributed more effectively and fairly .
now , many governments are working with humanitarian organizations to address this gap .
some governments have used our findings as part of their overall evaluation of their aid programs and policies .
and dara has also begun working with some donor governments to provide a more detailed assessment on how they are doing , with recommendations on where to change and improve . next year we hope to carry out an evaluation of the impact of the hri after its first five years , where we can show how and where it has had an influence .
in the meantime , we will continue to offer our support and analysis to governments and other stakeholders who are interested in making sure that aid efforts help people affected by crisis .

the vice president of engineering with cubic transportation systems , inc . , pradip mistry , also described his company as " thrilled " with the group 's new open security standard .
an eye toward security the alliance is now looking to finalize its new specification – which can be used for smart cards and contactless tickets , as well as mobile phones and other media . though smart card technology has been around for years , the companies behind the open standard wanted to take another look at security .
the mifare classic chip , the technology and security standard widely used in today 's smart cards , saw its encryption cracked in recent years . tilo pannenbaecker , infineon technologies ' vice president and general manager of business line personal and object id , told deutsche welle that the new security standard uses the advanced encryption standard -lrb- aes -rrb- 128 , which he called " a more advanced , more modern cryptography . " but the alliance also found fault with the proprietary nature of the mifare technology .
pannenbaecker said the group 's new specification would allow a range of vendors to offer nfc-capable sim cards and phones . " our security standard that we are proposing now is the ideal security concept for nfc because it is offering advanced security , so chances of fraud and counterfeiting are limited , " he said .
" and it is a technology available at fair and reasonable terms . " the future of financial transactions ? google plans to put an nfc-enabled smartphone on the market this month .
at a web 2.0 summit in san francisco this past november , google 's chief executive eric schmidt said the next-generation devices " will be able to do commerce . " the head of research in motion , the company behind the blackberry smartphone , also expressed interest during the summit in incorporating nfc chips into the firm 's product range - and soon . 2011 could be off to a strong start : charles walton , chief operating officer for inside secure , cited estimates of between 40 and 50 million payment-equipped phones hitting the market next year . " now that the industry is moving to nfc phones and guys like google and apple and others are getting on board with nfc , they are looking for some global standards , " he told news agency afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong and japan already have smart card transit payment systems in place winning over consumers still , some analysts suggest taking a step back - and looking beyond the buzz surrounding the " tap and pay " phenomenon when it comes to mobile phones . " it 's a move in the right direction , " said christophe uzureau , research director of banking and investment services at gartner research , " but we tend to forget the big picture . " uzureau told deutsche welle that mobile providers are keen to seize upon the potential of nfc-enabled phones - but the industry is creating " a lot of hype . " consumers in hong kong , with its " octopus card , " and japan , which has " suica , " are accustomed to using prepaid , contactless means for transit .
but replacing cards with phones is easier said than done . " this only works if all consumers have nfc-enabled phones , and if they are confident in using them , " uzureau said .
" and right now , most consumers are not . " that means mobile operators must convince their customers to increase their usage of nfc-enabled phones - and to do so , they must show them that the chips allow for better financial access and control . but companies might have trouble persuading customers to change their habits .
despite what uzureau called a " perfect supply-side arrangement , " in japan , cash-centric consumers there have been slow to latch on . " on the demand side , most customers do n't see the point of nfc-enabled mobile phones , " he said , adding that having a bit more speed at the point of sale still does n't outweigh the benefits of secure cash transactions . " it 's not going to replace the wallet , " uzureau said . author : amanda price -lrb- afp -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 07.12.2010 qatar 's economic vision translates into reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar 's sun is on its way up when qatar stepped into the ring on monday offering to buy shares in the german construction company hochtief , it was not only acting as a white knight , but was pushing ahead with its own dream . there is no doubt that the qatari offer to purchase a 9.1 percent stake in hochtief is good news for the german company seeking to thwart a hostile takeover bid from spanish rival actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- .
hochtief , which currently has five subsidiaries in qatar and employs more than five thousand people in the country , is to sell its shares at 57.114 euros a piece , which is less than the current stock price , but around the same as acs is offering .
the news of the deal between qatar and hochtief sent shares soaring , which as analysts were quick to point out , would make acs 's all-share offer considerably more expensive .
the group , headed by real madrid soccer club president florentino perez , has yet to comment on the latest twist in the takeover drama in which qatar shines as the white knight .
but there is nothing selfless about the oil-rich country 's intervention .
quite the reverse in fact .
" this is qatar 's moment and it has been working towards it for the past ten years , " kristian coates-ulrichsen , kuwait research fellow at the london school of economics told deutsche welle .
" it has been trying to diversify its name and create a brand ' qatar ' through the acquisition of high profile companies . "
sparkling portfolio among the country 's corporate portfolio are stakes in the german sports car manufacturer porsche , europe 's largest carmaker volkswagen , and arguably the most prestigious department store in the world , harrods .
and that is to name but a few .
bildunterschrift : harrods is one of qatar 's high-brand icons " they have been getting powerful external economies to buy into the image so as to reposition themselves , " coates-ulrichsen said .
" they plan to diversify away from being a gas and oil-based economy . "
and winning the bid for the 2022 soccer world cup has helped them on their way .
it means instant recognition and international acceptance of qatar as a global force , and it also puts the country ahead of its regional competitors .
" dubai and abu dhabi have been trying to do the same thing as qatar , but the world cup puts qatar to the front of the queue and overshadows everything else , " the economist added .
new infrastructure in the offing the gulf country 's stock exchange responded well to the news of the successful soccer bid , and taha abdel ghani , general manager of nama economic consulting told the afp news agency that it had " raised investors ' confidence in the qatari market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the qatar university stadium for the the 2022 world cup " there are huge sums of money that qatar has pledged to spend within a set period of time , " he said .
doubtless a lot of that money will go on infrastructure to make the first world cup to be held in the middle east a resounding success .
there is already talk of a joint venture between hochtief and qatar to build an entirely new city , designed to house 200,000 people and play a hosting role in the soccer championships .
hochtief ceo herbert luetkestratkoetter is optimistic that a construction boom is on the way .
" you need to be able to accommodate guests who come to the country , " he told reporters .
" it suits me just fine .
i 'm happy about it . "
strategic planning in that context , the decision to invest in the german construction company could be seen as highly strategic .
it would certainly sit with the country 's pattern of doing things .
a couple of years ago qatar invested in a shipyard in poland which was building tankers to transport its gas .
bildunterschrift : there 's much more to qatar than the sand on which it is built " it 's all part of a broader plan to diversify and meet the needs of the qatari economic strategy by investing in companies they can use , " coates-ulrichsen said .
" they match talent with economic niches . "
and as far as he is concerned they do it exceptionally well .
rather than bothering with speculative investment like some other gulf states , qatar has a clear vision of how it wants to diversify , namely into iconic western companies , construction and real estate .
this , the economist insists , will stand the country in great stead , opening not only economic , but political doors for what might once have been regarded as a small country in the middle of the desert .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 07.12.2010 qatar 's economic vision translates into reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar 's sun is on its way up when qatar stepped into the ring on monday offering to buy shares in the german construction company hochtief , it was not only acting as a white knight , but was pushing ahead with its own dream . there is no doubt that the qatari offer to purchase a 9.1 percent stake in hochtief is good news for the german company seeking to thwart a hostile takeover bid from spanish rival actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- .
hochtief , which currently has five subsidiaries in qatar and employs more than five thousand people in the country , is to sell its shares at 57.114 euros a piece , which is less than the current stock price , but around the same as acs is offering .
the news of the deal between qatar and hochtief sent shares soaring , which as analysts were quick to point out , would make acs 's all-share offer considerably more expensive .
the group , headed by real madrid soccer club president florentino perez , has yet to comment on the latest twist in the takeover drama in which qatar shines as the white knight .
but there is nothing selfless about the oil-rich country 's intervention .
quite the reverse in fact .
" this is qatar 's moment and it has been working towards it for the past ten years , " kristian coates-ulrichsen , kuwait research fellow at the london school of economics told deutsche welle .
" it has been trying to diversify its name and create a brand ' qatar ' through the acquisition of high profile companies . "
sparkling portfolio among the country 's corporate portfolio are stakes in the german sports car manufacturer porsche , europe 's largest carmaker volkswagen , and arguably the most prestigious department store in the world , harrods .
and that is to name but a few .
bildunterschrift : harrods is one of qatar 's high-brand icons " they have been getting powerful external economies to buy into the image so as to reposition themselves , " coates-ulrichsen said .
" they plan to diversify away from being a gas and oil-based economy . "
and winning the bid for the 2022 soccer world cup has helped them on their way .
it means instant recognition and international acceptance of qatar as a global force , and it also puts the country ahead of its regional competitors .
" dubai and abu dhabi have been trying to do the same thing as qatar , but the world cup puts qatar to the front of the queue and overshadows everything else , " the economist added .
new infrastructure in the offing the gulf country 's stock exchange responded well to the news of the successful soccer bid , and taha abdel ghani , general manager of nama economic consulting told the afp news agency that it had " raised investors ' confidence in the qatari market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the qatar university stadium for the the 2022 world cup " there are huge sums of money that qatar has pledged to spend within a set period of time , " he said .
doubtless a lot of that money will go on infrastructure to make the first world cup to be held in the middle east a resounding success .
there is already talk of a joint venture between hochtief and qatar to build an entirely new city , designed to house 200,000 people and play a hosting role in the soccer championships .
hochtief ceo herbert luetkestratkoetter is optimistic that a construction boom is on the way .
" you need to be able to accommodate guests who come to the country , " he told reporters .
" it suits me just fine .
i 'm happy about it . "
strategic planning in that context , the decision to invest in the german construction company could be seen as highly strategic .
it would certainly sit with the country 's pattern of doing things .
a couple of years ago qatar invested in a shipyard in poland which was building tankers to transport its gas .
bildunterschrift : there 's much more to qatar than the sand on which it is built " it 's all part of a broader plan to diversify and meet the needs of the qatari economic strategy by investing in companies they can use , " coates-ulrichsen said .
" they match talent with economic niches . "
and as far as he is concerned they do it exceptionally well .
rather than bothering with speculative investment like some other gulf states , qatar has a clear vision of how it wants to diversify , namely into iconic western companies , construction and real estate .
this , the economist insists , will stand the country in great stead , opening not only economic , but political doors for what might once have been regarded as a small country in the middle of the desert .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 07.12.2010 no real breakthrough as 5 + 1 talks on iran end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 5 + 1 and iran returned to negotiations after 13 months nuclear talks between the 5 + 1 group and iran have ended in geneva with little sign of progress .
although the two sides have agreed to meet again , the sticking point is the demand for iran to suspend uranium enrichment . the negotiations between un security council heavyweights the united states , russia , china , france and britain along with germany - the so called 5 + 1 group - with an iranian delegation were the first in 13 months .
the negotiation teams , headed by eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton for the 5 + 1 and iran 's secretary of the national security council saaed jalili , agreed that a further round of talks would take place at the end of january in turkey . however , iran has already made it clear that it will not discuss its uranium enrichment program , which it insists is for peaceful purposes while western powers fear the fuel would be used for nuclear warheads .
at the last meeting in october 2009 , the 5 + 1 agreed to a proposal that would have allowed iran to ship a major portion of the uranium they had enriched to 3.5 percent to an external destination to undergo further enrichment and to be converted into fuel rods for the small tehran research reactor .
that would remove the potential threat of weapons-grade material being siphoned off within iran for military purposes .
iran originally agreed to this proposal but later reneged on it , having scored a major point by having the 5 + 1 tacitly agree to iran engaging in enrichment , a practice forbidden by security council resolutions .
then in may this year , brazil and turkey tried to re-broker the deal but this attempt was scuppered by the united states which claimed higher levels of uranium had been enriched in iran since the original offer in 2009 and that the new export deal would leave too much material behind in iran .
iran 's stance on enrichment levels proving obstructive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's saeed jalili will present a similar stance to that of 2009 " if iran agrees to suspend further enrichment , up to the 17.5 percent which it has already stated it was pressing ahead with , then there are a whole series of economic incentives which are on the table , " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , told deutsche welle .
" if , on the other hand , as ahmadinejad has said , iran does not want to address the issue of enrichment or make any concessions or compromises on that account , there will be no alternative at this stage but the consideration of further punitive sanctions . "
chances of reaching any agreements or compromises seem very bleak at this time , khonsari added , but there are clear signs that because economic and other pressures are making life very difficult for the iranian regime , ahmadinejad may be looking for a way out without losing face .
" for ahmadinejad and his supporters there are two main reasons for an engagement with washington , " professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" first , they know that an understanding with the us would be popular , particularly among the educated youth and the business community .
the second reason is that ahmadinejad and the political leadership feel that the regime is under serious threat by the united states , and only by the united states . "
perthes said iran 's threat perception , and its deep suspicion of us intentions , are often underestimated in washington despite these issues being driving factors in iranian politics .
while the regime elite still appears to be divided over the prospect of a full-scale rapprochement with the united states , it is believed many share this fear of the us and there is a real desire to avoid further isolation .
with this in mind , the 5 + 1 may consider lessened sanctions - along with other incentives - as a way to achieve progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has so far dismissed the western incentives incentives on offer but tehran remains steadfast " the western powers along with russia and china are offering iran lessened sanctions , the chance to fix world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership in return for explanations of what has gone on in regard to tehran 's nuclear program and realistic assurances that it has no military nuclear intentions , " simon henderson , director of the gulf and energy policy program at the washington institute for near east policy , told deutsche welle .
" the best hope for agreement lies on the possibility of reaching an acceptable compromise regarding the shipment of already enriched uranium from iran to an outside destination , " khonsari said .
" if agreement could be reached on the quantity , and there is a minute chance given past turkish and brazilian mediation that this is possible , there may still be a way out though it will be very difficult . "
there were concerns that the geneva negotiations would be made even more problematic by the latest wikileaks revelations which exposed the level of international concern and distrust of iran , especially among its persian gulf neighbors , and the consideration of many that military action is the best option when it comes to stopping tehran 's nuclear program .
however , experts believe there is little new information in the wikileaks revelations and that all the parties involved in the talks with iran are already aware of the delicate nature of relations .
wikileaks revelations unlikely to add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks revelations on iran are unlikely to affect talks " there is nothing in the wikileaks revelations that the islamic authorities have been unaware of , " khonsari said .
" the iranian regime understands that matters will be ratcheted up if they are unable to reach an agreement and they are aware that , irrespective of all factors , the likelihood of military confrontation is a very real possibility . "
khonsari believes the consensus among iran 's opponents , that confronting an ambitious iran with all its downsides might be a cheaper option than living with a nuclear iran - as highlighted in the wikileaks cables - might possibly alter tehran 's previous calculations .
those gambled on the belief that the americans would never dare to embark on another military adventure in the aftermath of the iraq and afghanistan conflicts .
options running out if current talks fail " the 5 + 1 diplomats think that sanctions will eventually work , " said simon henderson .
" however , it 's hard to say what iran will do next in response . iran might calculate that if it tests a bomb , there would be some condemnation but then the world would have to get used to a new status quo , much in the same way as it did after the indian and pakistani tests in 1998 . "
mehrdad khonsari said the general consensus is that ahmadinejad wants to escalate matters and essentially go to the very brink of war in a bid to shore up his own leadership , which has been under pressure since the opposition protests in 2009 .
" it is believed that ahmadinejad feels a military conflict might help him consolidate his position inside the country , " he concluded .
" in such a case , his major aim is to buy time as it is unlikely that anything positive can be achieved as a result of these negotiations . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 07.12.2010 eu backs russia 's entry to world trade organization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and russia hold summits twice each year the eu agreed to a breakthrough deal to back russia 's entry to the world trade organisation at a summit tuesday .
russia now appears to be on its way to membership , despite the longest running negotiations in history . on tuesday , european union commission president jose manuel barroso announced a breakthrough to clear the way for russia 's entry to the world trade organization .
" our difficult bilateral issues are resolved .
we signed a memorandum of understanding to this end today , " barroso said at the brussels summit .
as part of the agreement , russia has pledged to lower export duties on timber and asian freight that travels to europe via russian railways .
the road to wto membership is usually long and paved with obstacles - but russia 's ongoing 17-year journey is a world record .
the nation with a 90 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- economy is the largest outside the wto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower export duties on russian timber will benefit eu paper makers the blame game frustrated russian politicians blame politically-motivated delay tactics employed by the us and the eu , while trade diplomats in geneva fault russia for failing to understand the rules of the organization .
the key to speeding up the process now lies in moscow , according to wto spokesman keith rockwell .
" the pace of accession is in almost every instance driven by the capital of the country that is acceding , " rockwell said .
in many instances the reforms that are required to join the wto are politically difficult - which is certainly the case in russia , he added .
" there are sectors of the russian economy that find the process of joining the wto very difficult . "
making nice with the neighbors moscow must now get approval from the other members of the wto , a process that includes entering talks with any of the 153 wto members that wish to negotiate .
on monday , russian president dmitri medvedev made the first state visit by a kremlin leader to poland in nine years , and secured poland 's support for russia 's wto accession .
but not all bilateral talks have been constructive .
georgia , russia 's neighbor to the south , has been a wto member for ten years , and has blocked the russian accession process since the armed conflict in the summer of 2008 .
ukraine , too , still has not given a green light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland supports russia 's accession to the wto a veto , however , is unlikely , says alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations .
" in my opinion , in doing so , georgia would harm itself , given the fact that the eu and the us both want russia in the wto and not out of it .
such a move by the georgians would jeopardize the agenda which the west has set up with russia , " rahr told deutche welle .
a powerful partner the european union , with 500 million people , is russia 's largest trading partner .
if russia joins the world trade organization , the nation will be unable to impose arbitrary import bans , drastic tariff increases , and import restrictions without risking sanctions .
exporting nations such as germany would benefit from easier market access , says wto spokesman rockwell , adding that membership for russia would provide german exporters , as well as their japanese and american counterparts , with " a certain sense of predictability " when they enter into business transactions in that country .
" that makes the country a more attractive place for doing business , " said rockwell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keith rockwell speaks for the wto which represents more than 97 percent of global trade a rocky start in the past , russia has been less than committed to the process of joining the wto .
in june 2009 , prime minister vladimir putin declared out of the blue that russia was withdrawing its application for accession to the wto .
instead , his country would join the world trade organization as a customs union , together with kazakhstan and belarus .
in 2007 , in his capacity as president , putin lost patience with geneva 's trade diplomacy , labeling the wto as " archaic , undemocratic and inflexible . "
but the wto wo n't hold a grudge , said keith rockwell .
" we are very thick-skinned in the wto , " the spokesman said , adding mr. putin would be welcome for a visit any time . " we would be very happy to see him here . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 07.12.2010 us-china truce signals a spirit of compromise in cancun climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global agreement on emissions targets may be in sight china has offered for the first time to submit its voluntary carbon emissions target to a binding un resolution , buoying climate talks as environment ministers from around the globe arrive in cancun . environment ministers from around the world arrived in cancun on tuesday , replacing their lower-level negotiators and hoping to wrap up a deal by friday night .
a major sticking point to any potential deal has been the fact that the us and china are not signed up to the accord .
" there is a challenge that not everyone is part of the kyoto protocol " , eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard told a press conference in cancun .
but as the talks enter the final stages , china and the us have confirmed their commitment to emissions reductions – a move that could save the talks .
developing countries have said they wo n't move towards any new treaty until members of the kyoto protocol agree to extend the treaty beyond 2012 .
but japan , russia and canada have refused to extend kyoto without the participation of the world 's two top polluters - china , which has no requirements as a developing country , and the united states , which rejected the treaty in 2001 .
together , china and the us emit about 40 percent of the world 's greenhouse gases .
japan , russia and canada want a separate agreement regulating all nations .
" there are huge concerns about the position of japan .
we 're seeing some signals of possible flexibility from the japanese , but the japanese have to not stand in the way of a decision that reaffirms a second commitment period , " alden meyer from the union of concerned scientists told a press conference in cancun .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer is concerned about japan 's position game-changer in an apparent about turn , which could potentially save the climate talks , china announced on monday that it would be prepared to make emissions reductions binding .
" we can create a resolution and that resolution can be binding on china , " said huang huikang , the chinese foreign ministry 's envoy for climate change talks , in an interview with reuters .
china 's offer to make its existing , domestic pledge to reduce its " carbon intensity " - the amount of the main greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , emitted for each dollar of economic growth - binding under a un resolution is a compromise it hopes will encourage developed countries to continue the existing kyoto protocol .
" china wants to avoid a collapse of the talks , " ruth davis from greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" they 're trying to create a landing space for japan to come back on board without losing face " .
china 's target would still be voluntary , stressed china 's chief negotiator xie zhenhua , in contrast to developed nation targets under kyoto .
targets for developed countries are imposed by the international community , but beijing 's targets would be offered to the community by china .
analysts were generally positive about china 's proposal .
" this is a game-changer , " said jennifer morgan from the washington-based world resources institute .
but the details of china ‘ s pledge remain unclear .
" china may ask for different conditions to developed countries whose emissions reductions are subject to international scrutiny and monitoring , " ruth davis told deutsche welle .
china in the past has refused to be part of a binding agreement involving outside verification that it is making good on its pledges to curb emissions .
low key us appearance us involvement is also seen as a linchpin for an international agreement .
" there can be no doubt that in the european union , we have time and again told our american friends why we thought it was very important that they engage in this agenda , " said eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chu reaffirmed obama 's commitment to fighting climate change on a brief visit to cancun , us energy secretary steven chu confirmed that president barack obama was committed to meeting us pledges made in copenhagen to curb carbon emissions from 2005 levels by 17 percent by 2020 .
" he absolutely feels that moving toward a clean energy economy is really about our energy security and about our financial security , " chu said .
" it 's about our economy ; it 's about the future of the planet . "
this is despite the republican party 's election victory last month , which says forced emission cuts would hurt a fragile economy .
some republicans also doubt the science behind climate change .
this all but ended the prospect of the united states approving legislation to restrict carbon emissions .
chu highlighted efforts by the obama administration to encourage low-carbon technology , including 90 billion dollars towards clean energy in its economic stimulus package .
the administration has set up research laboratories for green research and offered tax incentives to pursue eco-friendly energy .
air of optimism amid diplomatic leaks environmentalists seem to agree that there is a more hopeful tone at this year 's talks in cancun .
" over the past week , we have seen a vastly improved atmosphere in these talks than we 've seen over the past year , " said wendel trio , greenpeace international 's director of climate policy .
mexico has so far received plaudits for running an open process that has kept the mood at the cancun talks more positive than in copenhagen where major global powers negotiated behind closed doors , a move that irked many developing countries .
but disclosures by wikileaks this week threatened to sour the mood .
the leaked memos showed that the united states and european union worked together aggressively to sell the copenhagen deal last year .
bildunterschrift : delegates have until the end of the week to forge an agreement on how to tackle climate change in one cable , reported by the british newspaper the guardian , hedegaard is quoted as telling a us official that small island nations " could be our best allies " as they need financial assistance from wealthy states .
the goal would be to step up pressure on developing countries such as india and brazil to sign up .
such emerging powers have taken growing action on climate change but stated adamantly that the measures are voluntary and that rich nations bear historic responsibility for the problem .
a leaked cable also said the european union and united states looked at ways to " neutralize , co-opt or marginalize " countries seen as " unhelpful " - particularly venezuela and bolivia , which have raised persistent objections during climate negotiations on issues both of substance and process .
asked about the leaks , hedegaard said that the cables offered a " one-sided and selected " us account of conversations .
she denied any untoward pressure toward the most vulnerable nations such as maldives , saying : " for many reasons we want to work very much with them . "
hedegaard said she did not believe the disclosures would hurt the cancun talks , saying everyone knows " that you discuss a lot of things " in negotiations .
but bolivian negotiator pablo solon said he was " greatly concerned " by the disclosures .
the cables " confirm what we 've always been saying and the united states has been denying : the interference , pressure and blackmail regrettably conducted by the us administration , " he said .

russia now appears to be on its way to membership , despite the longest running negotiations in history . on tuesday , european union commission president jose manuel barroso announced a breakthrough to clear the way for russia 's entry to the world trade organization .
" our difficult bilateral issues are resolved .
we signed a memorandum of understanding to this end today , " barroso said at the brussels summit .
as part of the agreement , russia has pledged to lower export duties on timber and asian freight that travels to europe via russian railways .
the road to wto membership is usually long and paved with obstacles - but russia 's ongoing 17-year journey is a world record .
the nation with a 90 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- economy is the largest outside the wto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower export duties on russian timber will benefit eu paper makers the blame game frustrated russian politicians blame politically-motivated delay tactics employed by the us and the eu , while trade diplomats in geneva fault russia for failing to understand the rules of the organization .
the key to speeding up the process now lies in moscow , according to wto spokesman keith rockwell .
" the pace of accession is in almost every instance driven by the capital of the country that is acceding , " rockwell said .
in many instances the reforms that are required to join the wto are politically difficult - which is certainly the case in russia , he added .
" there are sectors of the russian economy that find the process of joining the wto very difficult . "
making nice with the neighbors moscow must now get approval from the other members of the wto , a process that includes entering talks with any of the 153 wto members that wish to negotiate .
on monday , russian president dmitri medvedev made the first state visit by a kremlin leader to poland in nine years , and secured poland 's support for russia 's wto accession .
but not all bilateral talks have been constructive .
georgia , russia 's neighbor to the south , has been a wto member for ten years , and has blocked the russian accession process since the armed conflict in the summer of 2008 .
ukraine , too , still has not given a green light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland supports russia 's accession to the wto a veto , however , is unlikely , says alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations .
" in my opinion , in doing so , georgia would harm itself , given the fact that the eu and the us both want russia in the wto and not out of it .
such a move by the georgians would jeopardize the agenda which the west has set up with russia , " rahr told deutche welle .
a powerful partner the european union , with 500 million people , is russia 's largest trading partner .
if russia joins the world trade organization , the nation will be unable to impose arbitrary import bans , drastic tariff increases , and import restrictions without risking sanctions .
exporting nations such as germany would benefit from easier market access , says wto spokesman rockwell , adding that membership for russia would provide german exporters , as well as their japanese and american counterparts , with " a certain sense of predictability " when they enter into business transactions in that country .
" that makes the country a more attractive place for doing business , " said rockwell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keith rockwell speaks for the wto which represents more than 97 percent of global trade a rocky start in the past , russia has been less than committed to the process of joining the wto .

instead , his country would join the world trade organization as a customs union , together with kazakhstan and belarus .
in 2007 , in his capacity as president , putin lost patience with geneva 's trade diplomacy , labeling the wto as " archaic , undemocratic and inflexible . "
but the wto wo n't hold a grudge , said keith rockwell .
" we are very thick-skinned in the wto , " the spokesman said , adding mr. putin would be welcome for a visit any time . " we would be very happy to see him here . "

but know-how , often protected by patents , is trickling way too slowly from industrialized nations to poorer regions . every few years , world leaders get together at high-profile conferences to discuss ways to reduce global warming and save the planet . the 2010 united nations climate change conference is currently being held in cancun , mexico .
but the talks are taking place amid low expectations , after the disappointment of the copenhagen summit last year – which memorably failed to produce any binding agreements .
this came as a particular blow to the g77 countries , which have in fact expanded to 131 mostly developing nations .
their demands include a relaxation , if not a general lifting , of patent protection laws governing renewable energies .
their argument is that it is first and foremost the industrialized nations that are responsible for climate change , while the poorer nations pay the price for the wealthier countries ' mistakes .
therefore industrialized nations should at least give them the benefit of their green energy know-how .
sharing their patents would go some way to paying off their climate debts , the g77 countries say .
the patent imbalance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patents get in the way of technology transfer between developed and developing nations according to a new study compiled by the un environment program , 80 percent of all patented innovations in the area of clean energy technologies are registered by companies in japan , germany , us , south korea , britain and france .
the report , which examines the role of patents in combating climate change , was jointly conducted with the european patent office and the international centre for trade and sustainable development .
" the fact that northern countries keep their expertise on regenerative energies to themselves , puts the south at an additional disadvantage , " says aileen kwa from south center , an intergovernmental policy think tank of developing countries .
as a climate-friendly , affordable alternative to fossil fuels , clean energy is key to the future of the developing world , and allows people to access energy supplies without having to rely on major providers .
moreover , it decentralizes the energy supply .
in countries where the majority of the population is rural , solar panels and geothermal heat pumps installed in individual homes are energy efficient solutions for people who would otherwise go without .
one problem , however , is the frequent lack of local expertise necessary not only to install the technology , but also to maintain it .
not only does the equipment therefore need to be imported – the know-how does to .
if patents are a factor , the whole process soon becomes very costly .
but it 's not only developing nations that have some catching-up to do on the clean energy front .
green technology is still very much in its infancy in croatia , for example , although grassroots projects are slowly beginning to gather momentum .
even in industrialized countries , it seems , introduction of climate protection measures comes with a high price tag . popular misconceptions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in cancun , debate is centering around mobilizing funds and technology transfer to cope with climate change one obstacle to globalized climate control is the general ignorance in the developed world of what exactly the developing world needs .
" indigenous knowledge on protecting natural resources and alternative energy supplies often exists , " points out kwa , stressing that all that 's then needed is a transfer of technology that can be implemented locally .
rainer osterwalder from the european patent office agrees , but says there 's plenty of room for improvement .
" the technology transfer from north to south is still unsatisfactory , " he says .
" one thing that should n't be forgotten is that emerging economies , and china in particular , are increasingly active when it comes to domestic innovation in the area of regenerative energy . "
" patents neither create problems nor solve them , " he says .
in his opinion , more urgent problems include inadequate infrastructure in the developing world ; the lack of an existing market for clean technologies and the lack of opportunity to build one .
adding to the problem is the popular misconception that patents are internationally valid .
in fact , if a patent is n't registered with the patent office of a specific country , then it does n't exist .
" a french company does n't necessarily register the patent for its photovoltaic technology in angola , say , if it believes that there 's no market for such a system in that country , " explains osterwalder .
in developing countries , however , few people are aware that many technologies are not actually patented in their country .
a spanner in the works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , local expertise is underestimated critics believe that ultimately , patent protection is a major stumbling block in fighting climate change .
in recent years , the european patent office has complained about the ‘ global patent warming , ' stressing that the increasing number of patent applications is slowing down the issue of patents .
the multitude of patent applications does not mean that the world is coming up with more innovations - rather , what is happening is that inventors and companies that already hold patents in one country are lining up at many other national patent offices to get patents for other markets .
ultimately , the purpose of securing a patent is to throw a spanner in the works of rival development .
the patents issue is one that results in the developing world feeling as though it has been left to deal with climate change by itself , by the very countries that are mainly responsible for it .
but industrialized nations retaliate by citing the free market and the necessary protection of intellectual property – and , needless to say , their own economic superiority . whether or not it is justifiable to privatize expertise in the field of regenerative energy is a question that will no doubt be raised at the current summit in cancun .

now , a jewish museum is being built near the site . the construction of warsaw 's jewish museum is currently the most extensive cultural project in poland , though few in neighboring germany even know about it . the museum is being built in what was the warsaw ghetto during the period of nazi occupation .
nearby is the memorial to the victims of the warsaw uprising , in front of which former german chancellor willy brandt spontaneously knelt 40 years ago , on december 7 , 1970 .
it was an unprecedented act of humility that would become a milestone in polish-german ties . moral obligation to support museum plans for the jewish museum began in 1994 when then german president roman herzog got behind the project and oversaw the launch of a development foundation to fund it .
though the idea for the museum initially came from poland , the country lacked the necessary resources at that time . " roman herzog suddenly endorsed he idea , " said josef thesing , chairman of the development foundation .
" our foundation was started in order to make the idea a reality .
if we had n't managed to secure funding from the beginning , it never would have happened . " so far , the foundation has managed to acquire some 6 million euros -lrb- about $ 8 million -rrb- for the museum project ; by its completion in 2013 , costs are expected to total 90 million euros . thesing added that germany had a moral responsibility to invest in the warsaw museum . " i think that we can demonstrate that there is a different germany now , " he said .
" and , together with poles - who are now our friends in the european community - we can work through our past instead of denying it and look , with our unique perspective , toward a common future . " bildunterschrift : chancellor willy brandt 's humble gesture at the memorial to the victims of the warsaw uprising in 1970 was unplanned , but went down in history rich jewish tradition in poland the path to the future leads first through the past .
few poles are aware that the first known reference to their country was made in hebrew .
poland 's jewish roots go back a thousand years , according to auschwitz survivor marian turski . " we have no jews in poland - almost no jews .
the jews are present in history , they 're present in literature but there 's a vacuum in society , hence , the interest in those topics , " said turski .
" this is why we estimate that this will be one of the most-visited museums in poland . " it was marian turski who conceived the idea for the museum in the early 1990s .
he chairs poland 's jewish historical institute and is now chairman of the jewish museum as well . for turski , there was only one possible location for the museum : the site of the warsaw ghetto and willy brandt 's 1970 gesture of reconciliation . " for a long time , as the chairman of the jewish historical institute , i was the owner of this land , " said turski .
" it was obvious to everybody that there was no better and no more appropriate place than this to build the museum . " bildunterschrift : jewish life is slowly returning to warsaw turning point in understanding history it was n't until a year and a half ago that construction finally began , under the auspices of museum director jerzy halbersztadt .
he said its completion , planned for 2013 , would be a new landmark in the often difficult relationship between germany and poland . " the construction of this museum is a very important turning point , " he said .
" it can not transform the whole country , but it will be a sign of the changes that took place in the last 20 years of democratic development . " the museum wo n't focus solely on the holocaust , but will span from the very beginning of poland 's jewish roots to the present day . that includes the kielce pogrom of 1946 , when townspeople and officials in the polish town turned against the jewish community , killing around 40 people .
the anti-semitic sentiment that sprung up in the late 1960s is also to be addressed , as is the gradual return of judaism in post-communist poland . " our mission is to reach those who do n't understand what it means in the contemporary world to have an open dialogue , revisit history , tell the truth about history whether it 's nice or not , " said halbersztadt .
" those who are not convinced today will be convinced tomorrow , i believe that . " the museum director is expecting some half a million visitors per year to come and contribute to a new understanding of history in the country . author : wolfram stahl -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so say the organizers of the pisa studies . an international study into the abilities of 15 year-old schoolchildren has shown that german children have been making steady progress in recent years .
however , germany 's results in the fourth program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- study , released on tuesday , were hardly stellar either .
like the inaugural study in 2000 , in which germany scored disastrously for a developed country , this 2009 investigation focused on literacy skills among students .
the german grade improved by 13 points to 497 , representing an average score for industrialized countries .
nevertheless , german 15 year-olds are roughly one school year behind their counterparts in table-topping countries like finland -lrb- 536 points -rrb- or south korea -lrb- 539 -rrb- .
" germany has been promoted from the second division to the top flight , " the berlin head of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , heino von meyer , said at a press conference on tuesday .
" but germany 's still a long way away from qualifying for the champions ' league . "
the oecd conducts the pisa study in 65 countries , testing almost half a million teenagers in the process .
roughly 5,000 randomly-selected german children from 230 schools took part in the study .
germany also made progress in the smaller mathematics and science sections of the study , and can now boast above-average performance against comparable countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students are as good as their teachers , the study concludes " germany has improved its status from ' horrendous ' to ' average , ' we are at least satisfied with that upward trend , " the chairwoman of the german government 's education committee , ulla burchardt said .
" but i do n't think this is cause for celebration , rather continued reflection .
we 're still struggling when it comes to literacy skills ; and these are the most important qualifications for young school leavers seeking a job and a place in society . "
shortly before the publication of the pisa results , education minister annette schavan pledged to implement a new program encouraging youngsters to read in their free time .
top teachers = top marks the pisa study highlighted the importance of placing quality teachers in the classroom .
" it 's crucial that schools try to secure the brightest available brains , " the coordinator of the pisa study , andreas schleicher , said in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" countries like finland are doing a great job of this . "
schleicher also criticized the syllabus-driven schooling system prevalent in the western world , likening the modern day teacher to an assembly line worker .
" somebody publishes a lesson plan , and then the teacher is expected to sit down in the classroom and follow it . "
in the first pisa study in 2000 , 22.6 percent of german 15 year-olds were at least two years behind the average level for literacy and numeracy , and that figure has only dropped to 18.5 percent in the interim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the word pisa has become a headache for students , teachers , and politicians alike " it is imperative that we reduce the size of this group of 15 year-olds whose reading , writing and arithmetic skills are still at an elementary school level , " education researcher at the university of muenster , professor ewald terhart said .
" this is only possible by changing the teaching methods in the relevant subjects , and to do that , we need to give additional training to our teachers .
it will cost time and money , but it 's the only way to meaningfully change the quality of teaching . "
social status still decisive factor the vast majority of the lowest scoring german students hail either from less wealthy families or from families with immigrant backgrounds , or both .
the gap in performance between children from these groups and the average german student remains greater than in most pisa participants .
however , the study also noted that the discrepancy had shrunk considerably in the past decade .
traditionally , german high schools have been split up into three tiers , and oecd officials praised initiatives in some german states to merge the bottom two tiers , saying this would help prevent children from falling adrift in the future .
pisa officials also recommended that germany consider restructuring class sizes in its school system .
currently , average class sizes tend to get progressively smaller as children get older .
however , the study notes that young children benefit more from small classes , while teenagers cope with larger groups more effectively .
the 2003 pisa study focused on mathematics , and in 2006 , science was the principal subject assessed .

library archivists finally unearthed the text fragment in the nantes public library late last week after being alerted to its possible presence by a reporter writing for a nantes newspaper , presse ocean .
local authorities say the fragment had sat undisturbed in the library 's archives , which was part of a collection of documents donated to the city in 1872 by a wealthy collector .
the text is written mirrored right to left script , which was da vinci 's style , as a way to keep his documents somewhat secret .
" he was most probably writing in 15th-century italian , and possibly in other languages , so it 's now got to be deciphered , " said agnes marcetteau , head of the nantes library where the manuscript was found , in an interview monday with the news agency reuters .
text mentions birds , flight on its website , presse ocean reported tuesday that it had confirmed the authenticity of the fragment with carlo pedretti , a da vinci expert based in los angeles .
" it has to do with the air and the wind , relating to a study of the flight of birds .
the fragment dates from around 1504 , " pedretti told the french newspaper .
if that estimation proves to be accurate , that would put the text fragment around the same time that da vinci painted the mona lisa , which is now held in the louvre museum in paris .
this is the second rare item uncovered in the 1872 collection , after the discovery in 2008 of a never-before-seen score by composer wolfgang amadeus mozart .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 07.12.2010 concern over politicization of top donor governments ’ aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philip tamminga an international organization , which evaluates the effectiveness of donor governments ’ aid for people suffering from conflicts , disasters and climate change , has released its 2010 humanitarian response index . the dara index -lrb- hri -rrb- assesses responses to crises by the world 's top donor governments – members of the disaster action committee of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
now in its fourth year , the hri examines performance under five “ pillars ” of donor practice : response to needs ; prevention , risk reduction and recovery ; working with partners ; protection and international humanitarian law ; and learning and accountability .
denmark tops the hri ranking list followed by ireland , new zealand , norway , and sweden , while the european commission comes in sixth .
the head of the hri team , philip tamminga , talked with deutsche welle about the latest index and how political priorities have impeded the delivery of humanitarian aid to millions .
deutsche welle : germany does n't appear to have done too well in your assessment .
why is that ?
philip tamminga : germany is ranked 14th -lsb- out of 20 -rsb- in the index this year , just after canada and australia , but before japan and france . germany spends a lot less on humanitarian assistance than other countries , and the percentage of its aid dedicated to humanitarian crises is about half of the average of other donors . so it lags somewhat behind other countries .
other factors that explain germany 's position in the ranking is that it has too many restrictive conditions on its aid funding .
this sometimes makes it difficult for the humanitarian organizations it funds to have enough flexibility to direct aid where it is needed or to adapt programmes if the situation changes on the ground - which happens quite often in a disaster or conflict .
germany could also do better at funding un and red cross appeals , and make better use of regular evaluations to improve the quality and effectiveness of the assistance it provides .
germany does have many strengths , though .
for instance , it tends to provide funding rapidly in cases of disasters , and it 's a strong supporter of ngos .
it is also one of the better donor governments in terms of its commitment towards accountability to people affected by crises - making sure aid is effective and responds to their needs . could you explain briefly how exactly the assessment is done – what are the key tools and methodology employed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid is much-needed in many corners of the globe we assess donors by looking at 35 different indicators of how well they support humanitarian action and apply good practices .
the indicators are based on the core concepts contained in the declaration of good humanitarian donorship , which was developed and signed by the world 's main donor governments - including germany - in 2003 .
what we want to see is if governments are respecting the commitments they made , so we send teams to different humanitarian crises and we talk to the different humanitarian organizations about how well the governments that fund their work are applying good practice .
we combine this with publicly available information from published sources on government aid funding , respect of international humanitarian law , and other elements of good donor practice .
this year , our teams visited 14 humanitarian crises areas like haiti , afghanistan , somalia , sudan and pakistan , and we spoke to over 500 senior officials working in these crises from the united nations , the red cross and the red crescent , ngos , donor governments and others .
we also collected nearly 2,000 survey responses .
this gives us a good basis to measure and compare donor governments each year on whether their policies and practices facilitate or impede an effective response to crises .
the report says that there 's ample evidence of politicization of aid .
exactly what evidence do you have to show that political interests have overtaken the commitment to good humanitarian donorship ?
in 10 of the 14 crises we visited , we saw and heard of evidence that donor governments were placing political interests above humanitarian objectives . in some cases , like afghanistan , the use of western military forces to provide humanitarian assistance is compromising the neutrality , impartiality and independence of humanitarian organizations , and putting humanitarian workers and civilians at risk .
we also saw in some places like somalia , the occupied palestinian territories or yemen , some donor governments are putting restrictions on humanitarian organizations that prevents them from working in areas controlled by certain groups like hamas , as part of the " war on terror . "
this means the people in need are not getting the aid they deserve .
in other crises , there are debates about how foreign aid can help win " hearts and minds " or achieve other foreign policy objectives .
one of the most basic humanitarian principles – which donor governments committed themselves to when they signed the good donorship declaration – is that humanitarian assistance should be given without discrimination , and based on needs alone – and not because it may or may not help a government achieve other objectives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastation left behind by the 2005 tsunami the hri report claims that there are gaps in the protection of civilians and that the lack of safe humanitarian access has put vulnerable groups at risk of harm .
basically , this refers to the promotion of international humanitarian law and goes beyond programming issues – is the report referring to diplomacy efforts in this direction ? yes , the report is clear that as a result of politicization , safe access by humanitarian organizations to people affected by crisis is being compromised . because of that , humanitarian workers are at risk , and civilian populations are not getting the protection and assistance they need .
a recent example of this lack of protection was seen in the mass rapes that took place in the democratic republic of the congo .
and the safety of humanitarian workers is also at stake : last year over 260 humanitarians were killed , kidnapped or injured while trying to carry out their work .
you have also accused donors of failing to improve transparency and accountability towards affected people .
which countries have fared well under this pillar and which poorly ?
donor governments are not doing enough to promote better accountability towards people affected by disasters and crises .
there are lots of requirements on humanitarian organizations to report on how they have spent the money they get , and what kind of results , but very few donor governments have in place requirements to monitor and ensure that aid money is being used to meet the needs and priorities of the actual people affected by the crisis .
most professional humanitarian organizations already do this to some extent , but donor governments are not monitoring and following up adequately , and supporting these efforts . another concern is that donor governments are not being transparent or accountable on the aid that they promise . for example , many governments have still not disbursed all the funds that they promised after the earthquake in haiti .
and while the promises are made in the media or in international conferences , most of the time , the people affected do n't receive any information about this , and do n't have any way to participate directly on how that aid will be prioritized or spent .
this is why we call on governments to improve their transparency and accountability . germany tends to do better than other donors in this area , and could perhaps take the lead in building more commitment amongst donor governments .
what 's been donor governments ' response to this ranking system – surely some are n't happy with the whole exercise ?
some governments have told us that they think a ranking system is counterproductive , and does n't encourage or motivate donor governments to do better .
but in fact , some of the lowest ranked donors have told us they appreciate having a tool like the humanitarian response index to benchmark their performance and to know where they stand compared to their peers . the ranking is only a minor part of the exercise , though .
we collect a lot of valuable information about how donors are performing , and we have always offered this information to governments , donor agencies and other stakeholders to use it to understand where a government may need to improve , and where they are doing well .
by visiting 14 crises areas – the biggest evaluation exercise of its kind in the humanitarian sector – we are able to identify trends that affect the quality and impact of aid .
so we have lots of valuable analysis to share with the international community , such as our increasing concerns about politicization of aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food for those who need it most you must have confronted questions relating to legitimacy , though – what gives dara the authority to rank donor performance ?
first of all , dara has a great multi-disciplinary team with extensive experience in the field of evaluating humanitarian action . we were part of the huge tsunami joint evaluation exercise on how the entire humanitarian system responded .
dara looked specifically at the area of donor funding , which gave us insights on how they took decisions , and why good practice was so difficult for them to apply .
that was the basis for us creating the humanitarian response index – to systematically measure donor practice and provide solid , empirical evidence on where donor governments need to improve further . since then , we have carried out hri evaluations in over 35 crises , along with our extensive evaluation experience in other areas .
we also felt it was absolutely critical for an independent , objective evaluation of donor governments .
until the hri was created , there was no way to monitor if donor governments were complying with their commitments .
most of the tools and processes used by donors to assess their own performance are not transparent enough , and do n't look at issues around the quality of their aid , or the relationship with the humanitarian organizations they fund .
we think the hri can be used to stimulate changes and improvements .
has the hri , since its inception in 2007 , had a measurable impact on donors ?
if so , could you give some examples ?
yes .
the index has helped to raise many issues and concerns facing the humanitarian sector in general , and several donor governments have now taken this up as an issue for discussion at the international level .
for example , our findings in the 2008 report called for improvements in the way that humanitarian needs are identified so that aid could be distributed more effectively and fairly .
now , many governments are working with humanitarian organizations to address this gap .
some governments have used our findings as part of their overall evaluation of their aid programs and policies .
and dara has also begun working with some donor governments to provide a more detailed assessment on how they are doing , with recommendations on where to change and improve . next year we hope to carry out an evaluation of the impact of the hri after its first five years , where we can show how and where it has had an influence .
in the meantime , we will continue to offer our support and analysis to governments and other stakeholders who are interested in making sure that aid efforts help people affected by crisis .

deutsche welle spoke with tom kirchmaier of the london school of economics about the decision . eurozone finance ministers met on monday evening to discuss increasing the emergency fund but ultimately decided it was big enough .
is it ?
at the moment it is enough .
but the problem is a different one .
you arrange a fund like this to send a signal to the market that there is no point in speculating against the currency .
so by not increasing the fund , the eurozone finance ministers send a signal that there might actually be a point in speculating against larger countries like spain .
so in that way , they made the markets less stable , not more .
you do n't think markets are convinced yet that the debt crisis is contained ?
the funds are enough to support countries like greece and portugal , they are not enough to support countries like spain , or belgium , or italy .
it 's an arithmetic game , and you come up with a number that 's around one-and-a-half trillion , or two trillion euros and you come up with a guarantee where you can say , this is rock solid .
the number is just so big that it becomes clear to everybody that a speculator ca n't win .
another idea that had been floated prior to monday evening 's meeting , but was then not discussed , was that of bonds issued jointly by the eurozone countries .
is that a good idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the efsf is not big enough for markets to take it seriously " it 's a good idea in principle , but it 's very far-fetched politically .
one of the problems with the eurozone - and it 's a problem from birth - is that monetary policy is done by the european central bank , but fiscal policy is done by each of the member states .
and that creates almost perverse incentives for the individual member states to over-consume , which is what they have done .
one of the ways to solve this problem is to centralize fiscal policy , i.e. to make more fiscal decisions in brussels .
if you launch a euro bond , you essentially do exactly that because you then unify all the risks which you have in the eurozone .
for it to work , you have to have a centralized fiscal policy .
interestingly , china and sovereign wealth funds are very keen for europe to issue these bonds because they would be highly liquid and a good alternative to a us treasury bond .
both the bigger emergency fund and the euro bonds are supposed to convince markets of the " irreversibility " of the euro , as luxemberg 's prime minister jean claude juncker put it .
is the euro in fact " irreversible " or can you imagine a scenario in which this common currency would fold ?
nothing is irreversible .
it would unravel the minute that germany in particular were to make the tiniest suggestion about leaving .
it would be possible to reverse the euro , but it would have catastrophic consequences .
on one hand , you would see a bank run with weaker countries - everybody would try to get their money and put it in a german bank account and that would lead to an immediate collapse of the banking system in that country .
it would be catastrophic for the european idea , for these weak economies , and if germany were to decide to leave , it would not be good for germany either because the currency would appreciate dramatically .
next week at a eu summit , leaders are expected to agree on permanent eurozone rescue mechanisms , since the current emergency fund expires in 2013 .
what could or what should these permanent mechanisms look like ?
the issue of " permanent " only makes sense if the fund is large and credible enough .
at the moment i do n't see that we are getting any closer to making a credible long-term commitment to stability .
the only really credible commitment would be to integrate fiscal policy further .

and no one seems to know exactly what role the european union will play . the fifth edition of the european development days , a two-day eu-sponsored conference in brussels that brings together representatives of governments , humanitarian ngos and others , was the first to take place after the creation of the european external action service , the eu equivalent of a foreign ministry .
not surprisingly , much of the focus of the discussions was what impact increasing eu coordination and involvement would have on the aid handed out by some of the world 's wealthiest countries to some of its poorest .
no one seemed particularly optimistic .
deputy chairman of the africa commission erastus mwencha , for example , said the body had too little power , asking for instance why the eu failed to have single coordinated positions at groups like the world trade organization .
representatives of aid groups , meanwhile , said they feared that more power in brussels would simply bring increased bureaucracy .
bildunterschrift : investing in education pays big long-term dividends " again there are also problems with red tape , " said philomena johnson , the director of the charity group caritas in ghana .
" what we call long processes and procedures that make it impossible for developing countries to make optimal benefits from the resources that come to them to reduce poverty . "
and the individual countries in the eu are also wary about handing over control of what have previously been national aid initiatives .
" as a member state with quite a lot of money and thereby quite a lot of responsibility , i have to see who is accountable , " said swedish development minister gunilla carlsson .
" that 's why it has been hard to devote all the money to brussels .
it has been rather anonymous , it 's really bureaucratic , and also as a donor , it 's very hard to have influence . "
carlsson was speaking from a position of moral high ground .
sweden is one of only five countries that have achieved aid targets formulated 40 years ago .
0.7 percent - not enough or too much ?
bildunterschrift : this ambulance is part of the millennium project , but larger aims are n't being met in 1970 , the un general assembly decided that the world 's wealthy countries should be devoting 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product to aid .
that goal was confirmed by the un millennium project , and the target date was set at 2015 .
the eu and its member states provide some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.6 billion -rrb- in aid annually , but in terms of percentage that figure does not come even close to the target .
oxfam says germany , for instance , spent only 0.35 percent of its 2009 gross domestic product on developmental assistance , slightly less than the year before , and is n't scheduled to meet the un goal until 2027 .
eu development commissioner andris piebalgs used the brussels event to remind eu members of their obligations .
" the real challenge is how europeans will use the 0.7 percent so that it really has the impact our taxpayers expect , " piebalgs said .
" our taxpayers expect that there is a visible change in the conditions of life in developing countries . "
but mentioning expectations and measureable effects also raises the sensitive issue of whether developmental aid truly works .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the money never gets to the poor aid , according to a famous quip attributed to british economist peter bauer , is " an excellent method for transferring money from poor people in rich countries to rich people in poor countries . "
and earlier this year , the free-market washington think-tank center for global development published a report claiming that the 0.7 percent figure was arbitrary , and that less money , if well spent , would do more to benefit poor people in , for instance , africa .
" the assumptions that in africa all aid becomes investment and all investment becomes growth have no empirical support , " the report 's authors concluded .
" the evidence is very strong that africa 's growth performance has been weak not from a lack of capital per se , but from low productivity of that capital . "
in other words , the problem is less about giving more money than about ensuring that money is used to generate lasting improvements .
for this reason , germany has been placing more and more emphasis on linking aid to good governance in recipient countries .
quid pro quo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel is among those who say that money is only as good as the results it yields although idealistic notions of human solidarity are one factor that motivates developmental aid , another is simple self-interest .
countries rich in natural resources such as libya , algeria and the central asia republics are increasingly becoming a focus of both german and european aid initiatives .
on a slightest less morally ambiguous note , most european countries see aid as a means of encouraging stability in poorer countries and thus a vastly cheaper alternative to military interventions .
germany 's development minister dirk niebel recently made this point with reference to afghanistan .
" we assume that , if we want to bring our soldiers home , our efforts have to put a clear emphasis on civilian support , " niebel told reporters .
" the citizens of afghanistan need a true peace dividend .
they have to see that our effort clearly betters their personal living conditions .
that will have on an effect on regions that are n't so secure and others where we would hope to see some quick improvements . "
this " butter versus guns " ideal is , of course , anything but new , but it does underscore a point that increasing numbers of european and world leaders are making .
where aid is concerned , delivery counts every bit as much as amount .

in a video interview with the french newspaper presse ocean , cantona suggested that everyone should withdraw their money from the banks in an attempt to punish the " corrupt , criminal " banking system .
" the three million people in the street , they go to the bank , withdraw their money , and the banks collapse ...
that 's a real threat , there 's a real revolution , " he said in the video .
the video interview was picked up by two " civic activists " who named december 7 as the day people should withdraw their cash and set up a website to help circulate cantona 's video .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cantona 's comments caused an international campaign for a run on banks tens of thousands of people have watched the video online and signed a support group on the social networking website facebook .
' stop interfering ' cantona 's philosophizing on the future of the banking sector has been met with scathing criticism from the french finance minister .
christine lagarde said cantona should stop " intervening in finance and economics , especially when he does n't fully understand the mechanics of it . "
her comments were backed by the head of france 's largest bank bnp paribas , who said the footballer 's comments were " typically misplaced . "
" the recommendation to withdraw deposits will sow insecurity , " said baudoin prot .
as cantona 's " revolution " gained support across europe , the head of the eurogroup of finance ministers jean-claude juncker added his criticisms calling the scheme " irresponsible . "
european union economic affairs commissioner olli rehn added : " i think mr cantona is a better footballer than he is an economist . "

critics argue that this is not art . berlin-based artist susan philipsz has won britain 's turner prize for her sound installation featuring a 16th-century scottish lament song .
this makes her the first sound artist in history to receive the award , which has been dominated by conceptual visual art . the glasgow-born artist 's work , entitled " lowlands , " is a sound installation based on " lowlands away " - a song about a man drowned at sea who returns to tell his lover of his death . " it has been overwhelming , the wonderful responses i 've been getting for the work and i just did n't expect that , " philipsz said while receiving the award - endowed with 25,000 pounds -lrb- $ 39,000 -rrb- - at the tate britain museum in london . not to everyone 's taste an untrained singer , philipsz performed three versions of the song unaccompanied and then mixed together the recordings echoing off the underside of bridges in glasgow , creating a unique sound . despite the work 's success , it has been criticized as not being real art .
the stuckists , an art group opposed to the turner prize , said the award should not go to a " singer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emin 's " my bed " caused a stir over a decade ago " it 's just someone singing in an empty room , " they wrote in advance of the winner announcement .
" it 's not art .
it 's music . " the turner prize has a reputation for honoring unusual works and has been the subject of many controversies .
previous winning exhibits include martin creed 's installation " the lights going on and off , " which featured lamps in an otherwise empty room , and a bronze sculpture by the chapman brothers called " death , " which resembled two blow-up sex dolls . in 1999 , a lot of criticism was directed at tracey emin 's shortlisted exhibit " my bed , " which was a double bed in an abject state , with stained sheets and surrounded by soiled underwear , condoms , slippers and bottles . the turner prize is awarded annually to artists born in britain who may be working abroad or any artists based in the united kingdom .
it is organized by the tate gallery and staged at tate britain .
since coming into existence in 1984 , it has become the uk 's most publicized art award . author : eva wutke -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was 2006 and she had escaped north korea two years earlier .
ji , now 28 , and his younger brother and sister had also fled .
they were hiding out in northeast china .
that ’ s when he suddenly got a phone call .
his mother called him from south korea .
she ’ d decided that china , which often forcibly repatriates north koreans , was too dangerous a place for the family to stay in .
that ’ s why she had gone to the south .
ji ’ s mother had arranged for a broker to escort him and his brother to laos and then on to south korea .
but ji says they couldn ’ t find their sister in time to take her with them .
it was only last september that ji and his family finally located her .
" my sister had no idea whether we were back in north korea or in the south , " ji said .
" she found out through a friend in china that we were in seoul .
we contacted her and we paid a human rights organization to help bring her here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , a group of north korean refugees managed to flee to a german school in beijing the ' underground railroad ' the seoul government recently announced that 20,000 defectors from the north have resettled in south korea , about half of those arriving in just the past few years .
most make it to the south with the help of christian missionaries who take north koreans along what ’ s called the underground railroad that runs through china to southeast asia , where it is easier to seek asylum .
many resettled north koreans , like ji ’ s family , are cooperating with missionaries and have their own network of brokers taking refugees out of china , said tim peters , an american missionary whose seoul-based organization assists defectors in reaching south korea .
" virtually every refugee who makes it safely and resettles in south korea has probably made a sworn oath to two to three to four other family members or very close associates in north korea that the resettled one is going to do everything possible to get those other people out . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rally in seoul against the chinese government 's policy on north korean defectors peters added that some defectors even go back to china themselves to bring loved ones to the south .
and refugees are doing whatever they can to raise funds to help their families , said kim seok hyang , a former official at seoul ’ s ministry of unification , the agency that oversees north korean resettlement .
paying human traffickers kim said defectors are using the few thousand dollars they initially receive as a government stipend to pay off human traffickers to bring their loved ones to the south .
but if that money isn ’ t enough , some turn to the sex trade , kim said .
" they want to sacrifice themselves to get that amount of money . from their point of view they need to save their family members and they have no other choice than -lsb- selling -rsb- their body . "
defector ji sang hyun said he doesn ’ t know how much money his mother paid to have him and his brother and sister brought to south korea .
he is glad that his sister finally made it here so the family can live together once again .
but it ’ s not an entirely happy ending .
ji said , " my father at first didn ’ t want to defect , but when he learned that we were all going to south korea he tried to escape north korea too .
but he was caught by border guards and tortured in a prison camp . "
ji learned that his father died just a few days after he was released .

russia now appears to be on its way to membership , despite the longest running negotiations in history . on tuesday , european union commission president jose manuel barroso announced a breakthrough to clear the way for russia 's entry to the world trade organization .
" our difficult bilateral issues are resolved .
we signed a memorandum of understanding to this end today , " barroso said at the brussels summit .
as part of the agreement , russia has pledged to lower export duties on timber and asian freight that travels to europe via russian railways .
the road to wto membership is usually long and paved with obstacles - but russia 's ongoing 17-year journey is a world record .
the nation with a 90 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- economy is the largest outside the wto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower export duties on russian timber will benefit eu paper makers the blame game frustrated russian politicians blame politically-motivated delay tactics employed by the us and the eu , while trade diplomats in geneva fault russia for failing to understand the rules of the organization .
the key to speeding up the process now lies in moscow , according to wto spokesman keith rockwell .
" the pace of accession is in almost every instance driven by the capital of the country that is acceding , " rockwell said .
in many instances the reforms that are required to join the wto are politically difficult - which is certainly the case in russia , he added .
" there are sectors of the russian economy that find the process of joining the wto very difficult . "
making nice with the neighbors moscow must now get approval from the other members of the wto , a process that includes entering talks with any of the 153 wto members that wish to negotiate .
on monday , russian president dmitri medvedev made the first state visit by a kremlin leader to poland in nine years , and secured poland 's support for russia 's wto accession .
but not all bilateral talks have been constructive .
georgia , russia 's neighbor to the south , has been a wto member for ten years , and has blocked the russian accession process since the armed conflict in the summer of 2008 .
ukraine , too , still has not given a green light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland supports russia 's accession to the wto a veto , however , is unlikely , says alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations .
" in my opinion , in doing so , georgia would harm itself , given the fact that the eu and the us both want russia in the wto and not out of it .
such a move by the georgians would jeopardize the agenda which the west has set up with russia , " rahr told deutche welle .
a powerful partner the european union , with 500 million people , is russia 's largest trading partner .
if russia joins the world trade organization , the nation will be unable to impose arbitrary import bans , drastic tariff increases , and import restrictions without risking sanctions .
exporting nations such as germany would benefit from easier market access , says wto spokesman rockwell , adding that membership for russia would provide german exporters , as well as their japanese and american counterparts , with " a certain sense of predictability " when they enter into business transactions in that country .
" that makes the country a more attractive place for doing business , " said rockwell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keith rockwell speaks for the wto which represents more than 97 percent of global trade a rocky start in the past , russia has been less than committed to the process of joining the wto .
in june 2009 , prime minister vladimir putin declared out of the blue that russia was withdrawing its application for accession to the wto .
instead , his country would join the world trade organization as a customs union , together with kazakhstan and belarus .
in 2007 , in his capacity as president , putin lost patience with geneva 's trade diplomacy , labeling the wto as " archaic , undemocratic and inflexible . "
but the wto wo n't hold a grudge , said keith rockwell .
" we are very thick-skinned in the wto , " the spokesman said , adding mr. putin would be welcome for a visit any time . " we would be very happy to see him here . "

the next generation of chinese artists is , however , and many of them have discovered berlin as an increasingly attractive hot spot for art students . one of those is duan yafeng , who has lived in germany 's capital for a year .
after studying chinese art in beijing , she relocated to germany where she enrolled in the liberal arts program at legendary design school bauhaus . " i think every artist has to come here at some time or another , " she said , " we have so many more opportunities here than anywhere else , so many galleries and so many people who are making some really fantastic works . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xu beihong 's " slave and lion " sold for a record-setting $ 6.9 million in a 2006 auction duan is extremely animated when talking about the creative possibilities afforded her from bauhaus ; an all-encompassing alternative arts course , it 's a world away from the education she received in beijing . " i studied chinese art , but something was missing , " she said , " at bauhaus we learn about how museums work , what kind of exhibitions you can present , how you can use performance in your work - so many different aspects of art . " new look at traditions while duan is just one of many young artists currently studying in berlin , she 's by no means the first . during the 1920s and 30s , berlin boasted a vibrant chinese art scene populated by figures who had re-located paris , which had become increasingly expensive .
even xu beihong spent time in berlin in the 20s . the rise of the nazi regime in the early 30s put and end to this lively chinese art scene - the largest outside of china at that time - as many fled germany . " western art plays an important role in china and i think that 's the attraction of these works , " said berlin gallery owner zhu ling , " all of my artists studied traditional chinese painting before they came to germany and here they studied western oil painting and in their works i see an effort to combine these two traditions .
it 's an interesting phenomenon that chinese people , only after they have left china , begin to reflect on their own traditions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duan says she 's found her direction in berlin more than 70 years after berlin 's first wave of chinese artists left the city , zhu is one of the next generation of artists to take up residence .
her gallery on motz strasse is dedicated to the promotion of chinese art . " it 's only in the last 10 or 20 years that chinese people have been allowed to go abroad , " she explained , " so these artists are generally very young and they are at the start of their careers .
i think these people need a platform to present their works . " accidental freedom current census records show that there are around 6,000 chinese people living in berlin and , while not all of them are artists , the figures make for a vibrant chinese community .
while recent media reports suggest that berlin 's cheap rents are the main reason for this influx of chinese artists , zhu thinks this is a trivial excuse and that the real reason is a sense of freedom not available to them under the communist rule in the people 's republic of china . communist control runs deep in china 's educational system , adding that independent thinking was never promoted in schools and universities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallery owner zhu ling says chinese artists enjoy the freedom they discover in berlin " from my experience , i think -lsb- berlin 's chinese artists -rsb- did not consciously reflect on the political restrictions in china before they came to germany , but once they arrive here they can feel the difference , " commented zhu .
" they have more freedom to develop their own individuality than in china but before they came here they did n't even know what it was like , so you ca n't say they made the conscious decision to seek more freedom . " duan yafeng mentions neither politics nor cheap rent when asked why she decided to make berlin her new artistic residence .
her answer is simple : " here i have the right people to work with and the right audience who understands my work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 07.12.2010 climate talks inch closer to forest protection agreement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainforest is illegally burnt to turn it into arable land a global climate treaty looks far off , but cancun may reach a key agreement on how to fight deforestation , a top cause of carbon emissions .
the redd scheme aims to reward developing nations for preserving their forests . a pact on reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries - known to negotiators as redd or " reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation " - appears to be close to an international agreement at the un framework convention on climate change in cancun .
" there 's a really strong chance that we will get a solid agreement , " said rane cortez , the senior forest carbon advisor for the nature conservancy environmental group .
" there is a lot of consensus coming on the text , but we need a few tweaks to get everyone onboard , " she added .
the programme was launched in september 2008 and consists largely of offering financial incentives to developing countries such as brazil , indonesia or the democratic republic of congo to save their tropical forests .
deforestation accounts for almost one-fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions , which is more than the entire global transport sector causes .
co2 released into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels like oil and coal can be absorbed and stored by forests until the forest dies .
yet even though that 's a well established fact , deforestation is continuing at a rapid pace .
each year , an estimated 13 million hectares of forest - mainly rain forest - is destroyed .
that 's equivalent to the area of a country like greece .
bildunterschrift : sources of greenhouse gasses - deforestation accounts for 17 percent of global emissions a simple concept the principle behind redd is simple .
the idea is to reward developing nations that preserve their forests , boost the carbon stock , and have sustainable forestry management .
currently , forests in developing countries are often cleared to make way for plantations , agricultural land or livestock .
in order to give people there the chance to make a different living , developed countries would under the redd scheme have to pay for the environmental services which these forests perform if they are left intact .
a fair deal , one might think - not least in view of the fact that developed nations are historically responsible for the ever-increasing co2 in the atmosphere - and thus for global climate change .
since a hectare of a palm oil plantation or arable land brings in more money than a hectare of rainforest , compensation should be agreed on an international level , according to the reasoning behind the redd concept .
bildunterschrift : cumulative co2 emissions -lrb- 1850-2000 -rrb- show usa and europe have been the biggest poluters money money money but even if it sounds like a logical solution , the simplicity ends when money comes into play .
what form this compensation should take and who should finance it are in dispute .
some negotiators say that only public money should go to redd .
but others say it is more realistic to set up a market approach that would allow nations to swap assistance for credits in emission reduction goals .
sha zukang , the un undersecretary for economic and social affairs , said funding so far has been insufficient even though the forest issue was critical for the " protection of the environment , social development and the fight against poverty . "
developed nations have pledged some 4.5 billion dollars for redd .
the leading financial contributor is norway , which among other projects has committed to provide one billion dollars for indonesia which plans a two-year moratorium on new clearing of natural forests and peat lands from 2011 .
what is a forest ?
but even before negotiators get to the sticky issue of money , " the debate about the redd agreement begins with the definition of the term ' forest ' , " said christoph thies of greenpeace .
to date no agreement has been reached in the negotiations : some also want plantations to count as forests , while others think the term should only refer to primary forests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace does n't want plantations to be counted as " forests " " for us at greenpeace it ' quite clear : a forest is a natural ecosystem that is dominated by trees - but not a plantation .
a tree plantation follows the principles of agriculture and is more of a tree farm for us , " thies said .
a tree farm or a plantation hardly stores any co2 .
even worse : to make room for the plantation , rain forest has to be cleared - and in this way co2 and methane is released into the atmosphere .
if this were rewarded in a redd agreement , thies thinks it would lose all credibility .
who does the forest belong to ?
worldwide , over a billion people live off the forest - many of them belong to indigenous people that have not only lived in the forest , but also from the forest .
the norwegian rainforest foundation wants to support and strengthen precisely this population , said lars loevold .
he said that involving indigenous peoples in the debate was not just an ethical question but a strategic decision .
" we are 100 percent convinced that forest protection will only work if we recognize the traditional communal rights of these people , " loevold said .
" for centuries they have maintained and protected the forests .
what looks to us in the west like untouched rain forest , is in fact the result of a very complex ecosystem within which humans have also played a role for centuries .
in this life cycle , a richer biodiversity has been created than if no people had lived there , " loevold added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies show that indigenous people can look after forest better than national parks local administration is more successful than national parks new research supports loevold 's argument that forests which are managed by indigenous peoples and local communities are better protected and have a greater biodiversity than , for example , national parks .
to enable people who actually live from and with the forests to have their voice heard at international climate negotiations , the norwegian rainforest foundation have paid the travel costs of indigenous representatives from all around the world .
the demands of indigenous peoples have become an essential part of climate negotiations .
the point for the director of the norwegian rainforest foundation at redd negotiations in cancun is that the forests should not just degenerate into a short-term investment .
" until now it has been profitable to destroy the rain forest .
some earned money with deforestation , but they did n't have to pay for the costs of the destruction .
the redd agreement is about finding mechanisms which reward people who protect forests , and punish those who destroy the forest , " said lars loevold .
this issue is being addressed by the 194 member countries at the un climate summit in cancun , mexico .
an agreement seems within reach .

the specification supports both smart cards and future versions of smartphones .
mobile devices equipped with near-field communications -lrb- nfc -rrb- chips would enable customers to pay for their journey at a ticket turnstile with a wave of a cell phone .
known as " cipurse , " the standard was developed by a group of leading technology firms , which announced a new partnership , known as the open standard for public transport -lrb- ospt -rrb- alliance .
" for mobile device manufacturers , the open security standard will be the next ‘ must-have ' checklist item they include in all next-generation nfc implementations , " the group said in a statement .
the ospt alliance described its open system as offering an alternative to proprietary technologies , which the group said " limit choices , are potentially less secure and cost more to acquire , deploy and maintain . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chip maker infineon is a member of the ospt alliance collaborators welcome the developers of the open security standard say their alliance is also open to bringing new partners into the fold .
on tuesday , watchdata technologies ltd. and the open ticketing institute of the netherlands joined the group , which already included inside secure , oberthur technologies and giesecke & devrient , as well as german chip maker infineon technologies .
the cipurse system was welcomed by transit industry representatives - among them the fare system director for singapore 's land transport authority .
" cipurse is an important step towards establishing standardized , secure and interoperable fare collection for all public transport schemes , and we plan to adopt it for future releases of -lrb- singapore 's contactless e-purse application -rrb- cepas , " said silvester prakasam , singapore 's fare system director , in the same statement .
the vice president of engineering with cubic transportation systems , inc . , pradip mistry , also described his company as " thrilled " with the group 's new open security standard .
an eye toward security the alliance is now looking to finalize its new specification – which can be used for smart cards and contactless tickets , as well as mobile phones and other media . though smart card technology has been around for years , the companies behind the open standard wanted to take another look at security .
the mifare classic chip , the technology and security standard widely used in today 's smart cards , saw its encryption cracked in recent years . tilo pannenbaecker , infineon technologies ' vice president and general manager of business line personal and object id , told deutsche welle that the new security standard uses the advanced encryption standard -lrb- aes -rrb- 128 , which he called " a more advanced , more modern cryptography . " but the alliance also found fault with the proprietary nature of the mifare technology .
pannenbaecker said the group 's new specification would allow a range of vendors to offer nfc-capable sim cards and phones . " our security standard that we are proposing now is the ideal security concept for nfc because it is offering advanced security , so chances of fraud and counterfeiting are limited , " he said .
" and it is a technology available at fair and reasonable terms . " the future of financial transactions ? google plans to put an nfc-enabled smartphone on the market this month .
at a web 2.0 summit in san francisco this past november , google 's chief executive eric schmidt said the next-generation devices " will be able to do commerce . " the head of research in motion , the company behind the blackberry smartphone , also expressed interest during the summit in incorporating nfc chips into the firm 's product range - and soon . 2011 could be off to a strong start : charles walton , chief operating officer for inside secure , cited estimates of between 40 and 50 million payment-equipped phones hitting the market next year . " now that the industry is moving to nfc phones and guys like google and apple and others are getting on board with nfc , they are looking for some global standards , " he told news agency afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong and japan already have smart card transit payment systems in place winning over consumers still , some analysts suggest taking a step back - and looking beyond the buzz surrounding the " tap and pay " phenomenon when it comes to mobile phones . " it 's a move in the right direction , " said christophe uzureau , research director of banking and investment services at gartner research , " but we tend to forget the big picture . " uzureau told deutsche welle that mobile providers are keen to seize upon the potential of nfc-enabled phones - but the industry is creating " a lot of hype . " consumers in hong kong , with its " octopus card , " and japan , which has " suica , " are accustomed to using prepaid , contactless means for transit .
but replacing cards with phones is easier said than done . " this only works if all consumers have nfc-enabled phones , and if they are confident in using them , " uzureau said .
" and right now , most consumers are not . " that means mobile operators must convince their customers to increase their usage of nfc-enabled phones - and to do so , they must show them that the chips allow for better financial access and control . but companies might have trouble persuading customers to change their habits .
despite what uzureau called a " perfect supply-side arrangement , " in japan , cash-centric consumers there have been slow to latch on . " on the demand side , most customers do n't see the point of nfc-enabled mobile phones , " he said , adding that having a bit more speed at the point of sale still does n't outweigh the benefits of secure cash transactions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 07.12.2010 qatar 's economic vision translates into reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qatar 's sun is on its way up when qatar stepped into the ring on monday offering to buy shares in the german construction company hochtief , it was not only acting as a white knight , but was pushing ahead with its own dream . there is no doubt that the qatari offer to purchase a 9.1 percent stake in hochtief is good news for the german company seeking to thwart a hostile takeover bid from spanish rival actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- .
hochtief , which currently has five subsidiaries in qatar and employs more than five thousand people in the country , is to sell its shares at 57.114 euros a piece , which is less than the current stock price , but around the same as acs is offering .
the news of the deal between qatar and hochtief sent shares soaring , which as analysts were quick to point out , would make acs 's all-share offer considerably more expensive .
the group , headed by real madrid soccer club president florentino perez , has yet to comment on the latest twist in the takeover drama in which qatar shines as the white knight .
but there is nothing selfless about the oil-rich country 's intervention .
quite the reverse in fact .
" this is qatar 's moment and it has been working towards it for the past ten years , " kristian coates-ulrichsen , kuwait research fellow at the london school of economics told deutsche welle .
" it has been trying to diversify its name and create a brand ' qatar ' through the acquisition of high profile companies . "
sparkling portfolio among the country 's corporate portfolio are stakes in the german sports car manufacturer porsche , europe 's largest carmaker volkswagen , and arguably the most prestigious department store in the world , harrods .
and that is to name but a few .
bildunterschrift : harrods is one of qatar 's high-brand icons " they have been getting powerful external economies to buy into the image so as to reposition themselves , " coates-ulrichsen said .
" they plan to diversify away from being a gas and oil-based economy . "
and winning the bid for the 2022 soccer world cup has helped them on their way .
it means instant recognition and international acceptance of qatar as a global force , and it also puts the country ahead of its regional competitors .
" dubai and abu dhabi have been trying to do the same thing as qatar , but the world cup puts qatar to the front of the queue and overshadows everything else , " the economist added .
new infrastructure in the offing the gulf country 's stock exchange responded well to the news of the successful soccer bid , and taha abdel ghani , general manager of nama economic consulting told the afp news agency that it had " raised investors ' confidence in the qatari market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the qatar university stadium for the the 2022 world cup " there are huge sums of money that qatar has pledged to spend within a set period of time , " he said .
doubtless a lot of that money will go on infrastructure to make the first world cup to be held in the middle east a resounding success .
there is already talk of a joint venture between hochtief and qatar to build an entirely new city , designed to house 200,000 people and play a hosting role in the soccer championships .
hochtief ceo herbert luetkestratkoetter is optimistic that a construction boom is on the way .
" you need to be able to accommodate guests who come to the country , " he told reporters .
" it suits me just fine .
i 'm happy about it . "
strategic planning in that context , the decision to invest in the german construction company could be seen as highly strategic .
it would certainly sit with the country 's pattern of doing things .
a couple of years ago qatar invested in a shipyard in poland which was building tankers to transport its gas .
bildunterschrift : there 's much more to qatar than the sand on which it is built " it 's all part of a broader plan to diversify and meet the needs of the qatari economic strategy by investing in companies they can use , " coates-ulrichsen said .
" they match talent with economic niches . "
and as far as he is concerned they do it exceptionally well .
rather than bothering with speculative investment like some other gulf states , qatar has a clear vision of how it wants to diversify , namely into iconic western companies , construction and real estate .
this , the economist insists , will stand the country in great stead , opening not only economic , but political doors for what might once have been regarded as a small country in the middle of the desert .

although the two sides have agreed to meet again , the sticking point is the demand for iran to suspend uranium enrichment . the negotiations between un security council heavyweights the united states , russia , china , france and britain along with germany - the so called 5 + 1 group - with an iranian delegation were the first in 13 months .
the negotiation teams , headed by eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton for the 5 + 1 and iran 's secretary of the national security council saaed jalili , agreed that a further round of talks would take place at the end of january in turkey . however , iran has already made it clear that it will not discuss its uranium enrichment program , which it insists is for peaceful purposes while western powers fear the fuel would be used for nuclear warheads .
at the last meeting in october 2009 , the 5 + 1 agreed to a proposal that would have allowed iran to ship a major portion of the uranium they had enriched to 3.5 percent to an external destination to undergo further enrichment and to be converted into fuel rods for the small tehran research reactor .
that would remove the potential threat of weapons-grade material being siphoned off within iran for military purposes .
iran originally agreed to this proposal but later reneged on it , having scored a major point by having the 5 + 1 tacitly agree to iran engaging in enrichment , a practice forbidden by security council resolutions .
then in may this year , brazil and turkey tried to re-broker the deal but this attempt was scuppered by the united states which claimed higher levels of uranium had been enriched in iran since the original offer in 2009 and that the new export deal would leave too much material behind in iran .
iran 's stance on enrichment levels proving obstructive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's saeed jalili will present a similar stance to that of 2009 " if iran agrees to suspend further enrichment , up to the 17.5 percent which it has already stated it was pressing ahead with , then there are a whole series of economic incentives which are on the table , " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , told deutsche welle .
" if , on the other hand , as ahmadinejad has said , iran does not want to address the issue of enrichment or make any concessions or compromises on that account , there will be no alternative at this stage but the consideration of further punitive sanctions . "
chances of reaching any agreements or compromises seem very bleak at this time , khonsari added , but there are clear signs that because economic and other pressures are making life very difficult for the iranian regime , ahmadinejad may be looking for a way out without losing face .
" for ahmadinejad and his supporters there are two main reasons for an engagement with washington , " professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" first , they know that an understanding with the us would be popular , particularly among the educated youth and the business community .
the second reason is that ahmadinejad and the political leadership feel that the regime is under serious threat by the united states , and only by the united states . "
perthes said iran 's threat perception , and its deep suspicion of us intentions , are often underestimated in washington despite these issues being driving factors in iranian politics .
while the regime elite still appears to be divided over the prospect of a full-scale rapprochement with the united states , it is believed many share this fear of the us and there is a real desire to avoid further isolation .
with this in mind , the 5 + 1 may consider lessened sanctions - along with other incentives - as a way to achieve progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has so far dismissed the western incentives incentives on offer but tehran remains steadfast " the western powers along with russia and china are offering iran lessened sanctions , the chance to fix world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership in return for explanations of what has gone on in regard to tehran 's nuclear program and realistic assurances that it has no military nuclear intentions , " simon henderson , director of the gulf and energy policy program at the washington institute for near east policy , told deutsche welle .
" the best hope for agreement lies on the possibility of reaching an acceptable compromise regarding the shipment of already enriched uranium from iran to an outside destination , " khonsari said .
" if agreement could be reached on the quantity , and there is a minute chance given past turkish and brazilian mediation that this is possible , there may still be a way out though it will be very difficult . "
there were concerns that the geneva negotiations would be made even more problematic by the latest wikileaks revelations which exposed the level of international concern and distrust of iran , especially among its persian gulf neighbors , and the consideration of many that military action is the best option when it comes to stopping tehran 's nuclear program .
however , experts believe there is little new information in the wikileaks revelations and that all the parties involved in the talks with iran are already aware of the delicate nature of relations .
wikileaks revelations unlikely to add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks revelations on iran are unlikely to affect talks " there is nothing in the wikileaks revelations that the islamic authorities have been unaware of , " khonsari said .
" the iranian regime understands that matters will be ratcheted up if they are unable to reach an agreement and they are aware that , irrespective of all factors , the likelihood of military confrontation is a very real possibility . "
khonsari believes the consensus among iran 's opponents , that confronting an ambitious iran with all its downsides might be a cheaper option than living with a nuclear iran - as highlighted in the wikileaks cables - might possibly alter tehran 's previous calculations .
those gambled on the belief that the americans would never dare to embark on another military adventure in the aftermath of the iraq and afghanistan conflicts .
options running out if current talks fail " the 5 + 1 diplomats think that sanctions will eventually work , " said simon henderson .
" however , it 's hard to say what iran will do next in response . iran might calculate that if it tests a bomb , there would be some condemnation but then the world would have to get used to a new status quo , much in the same way as it did after the indian and pakistani tests in 1998 . "
mehrdad khonsari said the general consensus is that ahmadinejad wants to escalate matters and essentially go to the very brink of war in a bid to shore up his own leadership , which has been under pressure since the opposition protests in 2009 .
" it is believed that ahmadinejad feels a military conflict might help him consolidate his position inside the country , " he concluded .
" in such a case , his major aim is to buy time as it is unlikely that anything positive can be achieved as a result of these negotiations . "

by the time french banks closed on tuesday , very few appeared to have followed his call . tens of thousands of people heard the call by former french footballer eric cantona to bring down the banking system that sparked the global economic crisis - but few acted on it on tuesday , the day cantona suggested his anti-capitalist revolution should begin . the protests were few , isolated and largely symbolic .
one group of activists in paris emptied their bank accounts from a branch of societe generale and opened accounts at the nearby branch of a cooperative bank .
but in general , it was business as usual in france 's banking institutions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests were few and far between cantona , now a successful actor and an icon to many , had appealed to people to withdraw their money from the banks in an attempt to punish the " corrupt , criminal " banking system .
" the three million people in the street , they go to the bank , withdraw their money , and the banks collapse ...
that 's a real threat , there 's a real revolution , " the ex-football star said in an online video watched by tens of thousands of people in france and beyond .
naive and misguided french and european politicians and bankers condemned cantona 's philosophizing on the future of the banking sector as irresponsible .
his calls for mass bank withdrawals met with sharp criticism from the french finance minister .
christine lagarde said cantona should stop " intervening in finance and economics , especially when he does n't fully understand the mechanics of it . "
the head of the eurogroup of finance ministers , jean-claude juncker , called the scheme " irresponsible " and eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn said : " i think mr cantona is a better footballer than he is an economist . "

but academic peformance of a select group in select subjects may not yield the complete picture . the organization for economic cooperation and development conducted the survey among the oecd 's 34 member nations as well as in 41 partner economies in 2009 .
the results show asians did exceptionally well .
the 15-year-old students were evaluated in reading , mathematics and science .
improved school curricula and teachers ' training are being cited as the reasons for the top peformer 's success .
china 's boomtown shanghai 's success in topping the list is the result of recent changes in the school curriculum , the oecd claims .
students are given more choice in what they study .
in shanghai , teachers from the high-achieving schools are regularyly sent to schools with lower scores to improve the latter 's performance .
apparently , the city has even reformed college entrance examinations to put more emphasis on the handling of information rather than on learning things by rote .
factors still to be examined the true picture may be less rosy .
shanghai is a single city , whereas other countries are judged as a whole .
the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- claims that the study proves that low national income " is not incompatible " with good educational performance .
whether within the country or in comparison with other countries , it is the relative income that usually makes the difference .
and as the oecd itself has announced , the more specific social , economic and cultural factors behind asia 's success are still to be examined .
goals , ways and means tao hongkai , an education expert from wuhan , china , told the afp news agency in beijing that grades still remained the sole criteria for judging the performance of a child or student in china - obedience and high grades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seoul students compete during a korean olympiad in informatics south korea spends more than any other oecd country on private education , but spends relatively little on public education , which widens the gap between high and low achievers .
and korean students participate in the pisa test in the spirit of the olympics : they must get the gold for their country .
it might well be that academic performance should and can not be the most important criterion if the ultimate goal of education is to shape a complete human being and a responsible citizen .

" i 'm confident that ireland , with its smart , competent , and stubborn people - and its prospects of recovering -lsb- from -rsb- this situation - will overcome the current challenges . "
tough budget while the final stamp of approval for the bailout loan was being given in brussels , the irish government in dublin announced deep cuts in its 2011 budget .
tax hikes and spending cuts are expected to save the country around 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lenihan unveiled a tough budget on tuesday " as outlined in the plan , six billion euros of the overall adjustment is made in today 's budget .
the scale of this adjustment is demanding but it demonstrates the seriousness of our intent , " said finance minister brian lenihan in an address to ireland 's lower house of parliament .
the budget cuts were necessary to secure the bailout from the eu and the international monetary fund .
tapping the reserves ireland 's bailout comes from the 750 billion euro crisis fund established earlier this year after greece required similar aid .
now , the question is still being asked : will ireland be the only country to access the fund , or will portugal , spain or even italy need support soon ?
and if so , will 750 billion euros be enough ?
for spanish finance minister elena salgado , the problem simply does not exist .
“ the volume of the crisis mechanism seems reasonable to us , ” she said .
but from her , these words seem logical ; spain is trying to soothe the markets .
belgian finance minister didier reynders , who chaired the talks , is more cautious , saying debates on the size of the bailout mechanism will likely continue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 07.12.2010 us-china truce signals a spirit of compromise in cancun climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global agreement on emissions targets may be in sight china has offered for the first time to submit its voluntary carbon emissions target to a binding un resolution , buoying climate talks as environment ministers from around the globe arrive in cancun . environment ministers from around the world arrived in cancun on tuesday , replacing their lower-level negotiators and hoping to wrap up a deal by friday night .
a major sticking point to any potential deal has been the fact that the us and china are not signed up to the accord .
" there is a challenge that not everyone is part of the kyoto protocol " , eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard told a press conference in cancun .
but as the talks enter the final stages , china and the us have confirmed their commitment to emissions reductions – a move that could save the talks .
developing countries have said they wo n't move towards any new treaty until members of the kyoto protocol agree to extend the treaty beyond 2012 .
but japan , russia and canada have refused to extend kyoto without the participation of the world 's two top polluters - china , which has no requirements as a developing country , and the united states , which rejected the treaty in 2001 .
together , china and the us emit about 40 percent of the world 's greenhouse gases .
japan , russia and canada want a separate agreement regulating all nations .
" there are huge concerns about the position of japan .
we 're seeing some signals of possible flexibility from the japanese , but the japanese have to not stand in the way of a decision that reaffirms a second commitment period , " alden meyer from the union of concerned scientists told a press conference in cancun .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer is concerned about japan 's position game-changer in an apparent about turn , which could potentially save the climate talks , china announced on monday that it would be prepared to make emissions reductions binding .
" we can create a resolution and that resolution can be binding on china , " said huang huikang , the chinese foreign ministry 's envoy for climate change talks , in an interview with reuters .
china 's offer to make its existing , domestic pledge to reduce its " carbon intensity " - the amount of the main greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , emitted for each dollar of economic growth - binding under a un resolution is a compromise it hopes will encourage developed countries to continue the existing kyoto protocol .
" china wants to avoid a collapse of the talks , " ruth davis from greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" they 're trying to create a landing space for japan to come back on board without losing face " .
china 's target would still be voluntary , stressed china 's chief negotiator xie zhenhua , in contrast to developed nation targets under kyoto .
targets for developed countries are imposed by the international community , but beijing 's targets would be offered to the community by china .
analysts were generally positive about china 's proposal .
" this is a game-changer , " said jennifer morgan from the washington-based world resources institute .
but the details of china ‘ s pledge remain unclear .
" china may ask for different conditions to developed countries whose emissions reductions are subject to international scrutiny and monitoring , " ruth davis told deutsche welle .
china in the past has refused to be part of a binding agreement involving outside verification that it is making good on its pledges to curb emissions .
low key us appearance us involvement is also seen as a linchpin for an international agreement .
" there can be no doubt that in the european union , we have time and again told our american friends why we thought it was very important that they engage in this agenda , " said eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chu reaffirmed obama 's commitment to fighting climate change on a brief visit to cancun , us energy secretary steven chu confirmed that president barack obama was committed to meeting us pledges made in copenhagen to curb carbon emissions from 2005 levels by 17 percent by 2020 .
" he absolutely feels that moving toward a clean energy economy is really about our energy security and about our financial security , " chu said .
" it 's about our economy ; it 's about the future of the planet . "
this is despite the republican party 's election victory last month , which says forced emission cuts would hurt a fragile economy .
some republicans also doubt the science behind climate change .
this all but ended the prospect of the united states approving legislation to restrict carbon emissions .
chu highlighted efforts by the obama administration to encourage low-carbon technology , including 90 billion dollars towards clean energy in its economic stimulus package .
the administration has set up research laboratories for green research and offered tax incentives to pursue eco-friendly energy .
air of optimism amid diplomatic leaks environmentalists seem to agree that there is a more hopeful tone at this year 's talks in cancun .
" over the past week , we have seen a vastly improved atmosphere in these talks than we 've seen over the past year , " said wendel trio , greenpeace international 's director of climate policy .
mexico has so far received plaudits for running an open process that has kept the mood at the cancun talks more positive than in copenhagen where major global powers negotiated behind closed doors , a move that irked many developing countries .
but disclosures by wikileaks this week threatened to sour the mood .
the leaked memos showed that the united states and european union worked together aggressively to sell the copenhagen deal last year .
bildunterschrift : delegates have until the end of the week to forge an agreement on how to tackle climate change in one cable , reported by the british newspaper the guardian , hedegaard is quoted as telling a us official that small island nations " could be our best allies " as they need financial assistance from wealthy states .
the goal would be to step up pressure on developing countries such as india and brazil to sign up .
such emerging powers have taken growing action on climate change but stated adamantly that the measures are voluntary and that rich nations bear historic responsibility for the problem .
a leaked cable also said the european union and united states looked at ways to " neutralize , co-opt or marginalize " countries seen as " unhelpful " - particularly venezuela and bolivia , which have raised persistent objections during climate negotiations on issues both of substance and process .
asked about the leaks , hedegaard said that the cables offered a " one-sided and selected " us account of conversations .
she denied any untoward pressure toward the most vulnerable nations such as maldives , saying : " for many reasons we want to work very much with them . "
hedegaard said she did not believe the disclosures would hurt the cancun talks , saying everyone knows " that you discuss a lot of things " in negotiations .
but bolivian negotiator pablo solon said he was " greatly concerned " by the disclosures .
the cables " confirm what we 've always been saying and the united states has been denying : the interference , pressure and blackmail regrettably conducted by the us administration , " he said .

assange , wanted on allegations including rape , says foreign powers are leaning upon the swedes . a lawyer for wikileaks founder julian assange said on monday that his client was arranging to meet with british police , who have received a request from sweden for his extradition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us attorney general eric holder promised ' significant action against wikileaks " we are in the process of making arrangements to meet with the police by consent in order to facilitate the taking of that question and answer that is needed , " said mark stephens .
the lawyer added that the interview was expected to happen in the " foreseeable future " but could not give an exact timescale .
the 39-year-old is wanted on allegations of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion .
london 's metropolitan police received an arrest warrant earlier on monday , a police source told the news agency reuters .
australian assange , whose wikileaks website has caused an international sensation over the release of secret us diplomatic cables , denies the allegations .
the extradition request came after swedish prosecutors reopened an investigation into the allegations , being made by two swedish women .
assange 's swedish lawyer said his client believed sweden was being influenced by foreign powers after the november release of the cables , some of which are politically sensitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the latest cable revelations are politically sensitive authorities in sweden said they had provided their british colleagues with all the information they had requested , following apparent legal hitches .

in france , industry minister eric besson demanded that wikileaks be banned from french web servers being used by the site .
however , a french judge declined to force web provider ovh to go ahead with the closure .
in october , wikileaks angered the pentagon over its release of nearly 400,000 classified documents on the iraq war , which assange said showed 15,000 more civilian deaths than previously thought . in july , the site posted some 77,000 secret us files on the conflict in afghanistan .

the original plan of the caravan organizers was to take a land route from india to pakistan , and from there over iran , turkey , syria and lebanon to gaza .
however , the indian delegates were only permitted to travel via the wagah border to lahore .
the idea of indian and pakistani peace activists undertaking a symbolic journey through pakistan could not be realized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between india and pakistan have been tense since the mumbai attacks in 2008 the indian and pakistani delegations are now going to join together in the iranian city of zahidan , from where , along with peace activists from other asian countries , they will continue their journey towards gaza .
the caravan is scheduled to reach the palestinian territories on december 27 .
mire of indo-pakistani politics indian peace activist rakhi sehgal condemned the behavior of the indian and pakistani governments towards the convoy .
she told deutsche welle that initially 51 peace activists from india had applied for a pakistani visa , out of whom only 34 finally received the visa after days of protesting outside the pakistan high commission in delhi .
" we had planned to travel over land from delhi to wagah , and then from wagah to lahore , karachi , quetta and zahidan , in iran .
however , we were not allowed to go beyond lahore .
on december 4 , we reached the wagah border and were informed that the indian government had not given us permission to cross the border .
after unsuccessfully trying to contact the ministry of external affairs , we held a demonstration at wagah .
it was on december 5 that we got word from the indian officials that we were being allowed to cross the border . "
despite the fact that the convoy has nothing to do with indo-pakistani security and peace issues , its main purpose is to help the people of gaza , it has been dragged into the mire of indo-pakistani politics .
pakistan labour party 's farooq tariq , who is one of the main organizers of the caravan in pakistan , believes that us pressure on pakistan and india has probably led to this crisis .
" both the indian and pakistani governments have close ties with the us , and they would obviously not want to displease the us , which has cordial ties with israel . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli commandos on 31 may 2010 stormed a flotilla bound for the gaza strip symbolic significance however , the symbolic union of pakistanis and indians for the palestinian cause might be enough to enrage the authorities on both sides of the border , who have almost stopped people-to-people contacts since the mumbai attacks of 2008 .
the combined journey of indian and pakistani activists to gaza could have eased the tense relationship between india and pakistan .
sehgal was ecstatic about the manner in which the indian activists were received in pakistan .
" we were received with a lot of warmth in pakistan .
there was a huge reception for us in lahore .
people from all walks of life came to meet us , including students , trade union activists , lawyers , and journalists .
everybody was as excited as we were . "
farooq tariq is also of the view that even the short trip of the indian activists to pakistan carried immense symbolic significance .
" the indians got a real message of friendship in pakistan .
the pakistani media also gave a lot of coverage to them .
apart from that , the indian delegation handed over the palestinian flag to their pakistani counterparts , and now we are going to join them in iran . "
from there , the peace activists of several asian countries will embark upon the journey to gaza and are hoping that they wo n't at least be shot at , as in the case of the gaza aid flotilla in may .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 07.12.2010 is the eu emergency fund big enough ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb is in charge of monetary but not fiscal policy eu finance ministers said monday that they would not be taking new measures to tackle the current debt crisis in the bloc .
deutsche welle spoke with tom kirchmaier of the london school of economics about the decision . eurozone finance ministers met on monday evening to discuss increasing the emergency fund but ultimately decided it was big enough .
is it ?
at the moment it is enough .
but the problem is a different one .
you arrange a fund like this to send a signal to the market that there is no point in speculating against the currency .
so by not increasing the fund , the eurozone finance ministers send a signal that there might actually be a point in speculating against larger countries like spain .
so in that way , they made the markets less stable , not more .
you do n't think markets are convinced yet that the debt crisis is contained ?
the funds are enough to support countries like greece and portugal , they are not enough to support countries like spain , or belgium , or italy .
it 's an arithmetic game , and you come up with a number that 's around one-and-a-half trillion , or two trillion euros and you come up with a guarantee where you can say , this is rock solid .
the number is just so big that it becomes clear to everybody that a speculator ca n't win .
another idea that had been floated prior to monday evening 's meeting , but was then not discussed , was that of bonds issued jointly by the eurozone countries .
is that a good idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the efsf is not big enough for markets to take it seriously " it 's a good idea in principle , but it 's very far-fetched politically .
one of the problems with the eurozone - and it 's a problem from birth - is that monetary policy is done by the european central bank , but fiscal policy is done by each of the member states .
and that creates almost perverse incentives for the individual member states to over-consume , which is what they have done .
one of the ways to solve this problem is to centralize fiscal policy , i.e. to make more fiscal decisions in brussels .
if you launch a euro bond , you essentially do exactly that because you then unify all the risks which you have in the eurozone .
for it to work , you have to have a centralized fiscal policy .
interestingly , china and sovereign wealth funds are very keen for europe to issue these bonds because they would be highly liquid and a good alternative to a us treasury bond .
both the bigger emergency fund and the euro bonds are supposed to convince markets of the " irreversibility " of the euro , as luxemberg 's prime minister jean claude juncker put it .
is the euro in fact " irreversible " or can you imagine a scenario in which this common currency would fold ?
nothing is irreversible .
it would unravel the minute that germany in particular were to make the tiniest suggestion about leaving .
it would be possible to reverse the euro , but it would have catastrophic consequences .
on one hand , you would see a bank run with weaker countries - everybody would try to get their money and put it in a german bank account and that would lead to an immediate collapse of the banking system in that country .
it would be catastrophic for the european idea , for these weak economies , and if germany were to decide to leave , it would not be good for germany either because the currency would appreciate dramatically .
next week at a eu summit , leaders are expected to agree on permanent eurozone rescue mechanisms , since the current emergency fund expires in 2013 .
what could or what should these permanent mechanisms look like ?
the issue of " permanent " only makes sense if the fund is large and credible enough .
at the moment i do n't see that we are getting any closer to making a credible long-term commitment to stability .
the only really credible commitment would be to integrate fiscal policy further .

russia now appears to be on its way to membership , despite the longest running negotiations in history . on tuesday , european union commission president jose manuel barroso announced a breakthrough to clear the way for russia 's entry to the world trade organization .
" our difficult bilateral issues are resolved .
we signed a memorandum of understanding to this end today , " barroso said at the brussels summit .
as part of the agreement , russia has pledged to lower export duties on timber and asian freight that travels to europe via russian railways .
the road to wto membership is usually long and paved with obstacles - but russia 's ongoing 17-year journey is a world record .
the nation with a 90 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- economy is the largest outside the wto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower export duties on russian timber will benefit eu paper makers the blame game frustrated russian politicians blame politically-motivated delay tactics employed by the us and the eu , while trade diplomats in geneva fault russia for failing to understand the rules of the organization .
the key to speeding up the process now lies in moscow , according to wto spokesman keith rockwell .
" the pace of accession is in almost every instance driven by the capital of the country that is acceding , " rockwell said .
in many instances the reforms that are required to join the wto are politically difficult - which is certainly the case in russia , he added .
" there are sectors of the russian economy that find the process of joining the wto very difficult . "
making nice with the neighbors moscow must now get approval from the other members of the wto , a process that includes entering talks with any of the 153 wto members that wish to negotiate .
on monday , russian president dmitri medvedev made the first state visit by a kremlin leader to poland in nine years , and secured poland 's support for russia 's wto accession .
but not all bilateral talks have been constructive .
georgia , russia 's neighbor to the south , has been a wto member for ten years , and has blocked the russian accession process since the armed conflict in the summer of 2008 .
ukraine , too , still has not given a green light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland supports russia 's accession to the wto a veto , however , is unlikely , says alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations .
" in my opinion , in doing so , georgia would harm itself , given the fact that the eu and the us both want russia in the wto and not out of it .
such a move by the georgians would jeopardize the agenda which the west has set up with russia , " rahr told deutche welle .
a powerful partner the european union , with 500 million people , is russia 's largest trading partner .
if russia joins the world trade organization , the nation will be unable to impose arbitrary import bans , drastic tariff increases , and import restrictions without risking sanctions .
exporting nations such as germany would benefit from easier market access , says wto spokesman rockwell , adding that membership for russia would provide german exporters , as well as their japanese and american counterparts , with " a certain sense of predictability " when they enter into business transactions in that country .
" that makes the country a more attractive place for doing business , " said rockwell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keith rockwell speaks for the wto which represents more than 97 percent of global trade a rocky start in the past , russia has been less than committed to the process of joining the wto .
in june 2009 , prime minister vladimir putin declared out of the blue that russia was withdrawing its application for accession to the wto .
instead , his country would join the world trade organization as a customs union , together with kazakhstan and belarus .
in 2007 , in his capacity as president , putin lost patience with geneva 's trade diplomacy , labeling the wto as " archaic , undemocratic and inflexible . "
but the wto wo n't hold a grudge , said keith rockwell .
" we are very thick-skinned in the wto , " the spokesman said , adding mr. putin would be welcome for a visit any time . " we would be very happy to see him here . "

but know-how , often protected by patents , is trickling way too slowly from industrialized nations to poorer regions . every few years , world leaders get together at high-profile conferences to discuss ways to reduce global warming and save the planet . the 2010 united nations climate change conference is currently being held in cancun , mexico .
but the talks are taking place amid low expectations , after the disappointment of the copenhagen summit last year – which memorably failed to produce any binding agreements .
this came as a particular blow to the g77 countries , which have in fact expanded to 131 mostly developing nations .
their demands include a relaxation , if not a general lifting , of patent protection laws governing renewable energies .
their argument is that it is first and foremost the industrialized nations that are responsible for climate change , while the poorer nations pay the price for the wealthier countries ' mistakes .
therefore industrialized nations should at least give them the benefit of their green energy know-how .
sharing their patents would go some way to paying off their climate debts , the g77 countries say .
the patent imbalance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patents get in the way of technology transfer between developed and developing nations according to a new study compiled by the un environment program , 80 percent of all patented innovations in the area of clean energy technologies are registered by companies in japan , germany , us , south korea , britain and france .
the report , which examines the role of patents in combating climate change , was jointly conducted with the european patent office and the international centre for trade and sustainable development .
" the fact that northern countries keep their expertise on regenerative energies to themselves , puts the south at an additional disadvantage , " says aileen kwa from south center , an intergovernmental policy think tank of developing countries .
as a climate-friendly , affordable alternative to fossil fuels , clean energy is key to the future of the developing world , and allows people to access energy supplies without having to rely on major providers .
moreover , it decentralizes the energy supply .
in countries where the majority of the population is rural , solar panels and geothermal heat pumps installed in individual homes are energy efficient solutions for people who would otherwise go without .
one problem , however , is the frequent lack of local expertise necessary not only to install the technology , but also to maintain it .
not only does the equipment therefore need to be imported – the know-how does to .
if patents are a factor , the whole process soon becomes very costly .
but it 's not only developing nations that have some catching-up to do on the clean energy front .
green technology is still very much in its infancy in croatia , for example , although grassroots projects are slowly beginning to gather momentum .
even in industrialized countries , it seems , introduction of climate protection measures comes with a high price tag . popular misconceptions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in cancun , debate is centering around mobilizing funds and technology transfer to cope with climate change one obstacle to globalized climate control is the general ignorance in the developed world of what exactly the developing world needs .
" indigenous knowledge on protecting natural resources and alternative energy supplies often exists , " points out kwa , stressing that all that 's then needed is a transfer of technology that can be implemented locally .
rainer osterwalder from the european patent office agrees , but says there 's plenty of room for improvement .
" the technology transfer from north to south is still unsatisfactory , " he says .
" one thing that should n't be forgotten is that emerging economies , and china in particular , are increasingly active when it comes to domestic innovation in the area of regenerative energy . "
" patents neither create problems nor solve them , " he says .
in his opinion , more urgent problems include inadequate infrastructure in the developing world ; the lack of an existing market for clean technologies and the lack of opportunity to build one .
adding to the problem is the popular misconception that patents are internationally valid .
in fact , if a patent is n't registered with the patent office of a specific country , then it does n't exist .
" a french company does n't necessarily register the patent for its photovoltaic technology in angola , say , if it believes that there 's no market for such a system in that country , " explains osterwalder .
in developing countries , however , few people are aware that many technologies are not actually patented in their country .
a spanner in the works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , local expertise is underestimated critics believe that ultimately , patent protection is a major stumbling block in fighting climate change .
in recent years , the european patent office has complained about the ‘ global patent warming , ' stressing that the increasing number of patent applications is slowing down the issue of patents .
the multitude of patent applications does not mean that the world is coming up with more innovations - rather , what is happening is that inventors and companies that already hold patents in one country are lining up at many other national patent offices to get patents for other markets .
ultimately , the purpose of securing a patent is to throw a spanner in the works of rival development .
the patents issue is one that results in the developing world feeling as though it has been left to deal with climate change by itself , by the very countries that are mainly responsible for it .
but industrialized nations retaliate by citing the free market and the necessary protection of intellectual property – and , needless to say , their own economic superiority . whether or not it is justifiable to privatize expertise in the field of regenerative energy is a question that will no doubt be raised at the current summit in cancun .

the patent imbalance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patents get in the way of technology transfer between developed and developing nations according to a new study compiled by the un environment program , 80 percent of all patented innovations in the area of clean energy technologies are registered by companies in japan , germany , us , south korea , britain and france .
the report , which examines the role of patents in combating climate change , was jointly conducted with the european patent office and the international centre for trade and sustainable development .
" the fact that northern countries keep their expertise on regenerative energies to themselves , puts the south at an additional disadvantage , " says aileen kwa from south center , an intergovernmental policy think tank of developing countries .
as a climate-friendly , affordable alternative to fossil fuels , clean energy is key to the future of the developing world , and allows people to access energy supplies without having to rely on major providers .
moreover , it decentralizes the energy supply .
in countries where the majority of the population is rural , solar panels and geothermal heat pumps installed in individual homes are energy efficient solutions for people who would otherwise go without .
one problem , however , is the frequent lack of local expertise necessary not only to install the technology , but also to maintain it .
not only does the equipment therefore need to be imported – the know-how does to .
if patents are a factor , the whole process soon becomes very costly .
but it 's not only developing nations that have some catching-up to do on the clean energy front .
green technology is still very much in its infancy in croatia , for example , although grassroots projects are slowly beginning to gather momentum .
even in industrialized countries , it seems , introduction of climate protection measures comes with a high price tag . popular misconceptions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in cancun , debate is centering around mobilizing funds and technology transfer to cope with climate change one obstacle to globalized climate control is the general ignorance in the developed world of what exactly the developing world needs .
" indigenous knowledge on protecting natural resources and alternative energy supplies often exists , " points out kwa , stressing that all that 's then needed is a transfer of technology that can be implemented locally .
rainer osterwalder from the european patent office agrees , but says there 's plenty of room for improvement .
" the technology transfer from north to south is still unsatisfactory , " he says .
" one thing that should n't be forgotten is that emerging economies , and china in particular , are increasingly active when it comes to domestic innovation in the area of regenerative energy . "
" patents neither create problems nor solve them , " he says .
in his opinion , more urgent problems include inadequate infrastructure in the developing world ; the lack of an existing market for clean technologies and the lack of opportunity to build one .
adding to the problem is the popular misconception that patents are internationally valid .
in fact , if a patent is n't registered with the patent office of a specific country , then it does n't exist .
" a french company does n't necessarily register the patent for its photovoltaic technology in angola , say , if it believes that there 's no market for such a system in that country , " explains osterwalder .
in developing countries , however , few people are aware that many technologies are not actually patented in their country .
a spanner in the works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , local expertise is underestimated critics believe that ultimately , patent protection is a major stumbling block in fighting climate change .
in recent years , the european patent office has complained about the ‘ global patent warming , ' stressing that the increasing number of patent applications is slowing down the issue of patents .
the multitude of patent applications does not mean that the world is coming up with more innovations - rather , what is happening is that inventors and companies that already hold patents in one country are lining up at many other national patent offices to get patents for other markets .
ultimately , the purpose of securing a patent is to throw a spanner in the works of rival development .
the patents issue is one that results in the developing world feeling as though it has been left to deal with climate change by itself , by the very countries that are mainly responsible for it .
but industrialized nations retaliate by citing the free market and the necessary protection of intellectual property – and , needless to say , their own economic superiority . whether or not it is justifiable to privatize expertise in the field of regenerative energy is a question that will no doubt be raised at the current summit in cancun .

deutsche welle spoke with tom kirchmaier of the london school of economics about the decision . eurozone finance ministers met on monday evening to discuss increasing the emergency fund but ultimately decided it was big enough .
is it ?
at the moment it is enough .
but the problem is a different one .
you arrange a fund like this to send a signal to the market that there is no point in speculating against the currency .
so by not increasing the fund , the eurozone finance ministers send a signal that there might actually be a point in speculating against larger countries like spain .
so in that way , they made the markets less stable , not more .
you do n't think markets are convinced yet that the debt crisis is contained ?
the funds are enough to support countries like greece and portugal , they are not enough to support countries like spain , or belgium , or italy .
it 's an arithmetic game , and you come up with a number that 's around one-and-a-half trillion , or two trillion euros and you come up with a guarantee where you can say , this is rock solid .
the number is just so big that it becomes clear to everybody that a speculator ca n't win .
another idea that had been floated prior to monday evening 's meeting , but was then not discussed , was that of bonds issued jointly by the eurozone countries .
is that a good idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the efsf is not big enough for markets to take it seriously " it 's a good idea in principle , but it 's very far-fetched politically .
one of the problems with the eurozone - and it 's a problem from birth - is that monetary policy is done by the european central bank , but fiscal policy is done by each of the member states .
and that creates almost perverse incentives for the individual member states to over-consume , which is what they have done .
one of the ways to solve this problem is to centralize fiscal policy , i.e. to make more fiscal decisions in brussels .
if you launch a euro bond , you essentially do exactly that because you then unify all the risks which you have in the eurozone .
for it to work , you have to have a centralized fiscal policy .
interestingly , china and sovereign wealth funds are very keen for europe to issue these bonds because they would be highly liquid and a good alternative to a us treasury bond .
both the bigger emergency fund and the euro bonds are supposed to convince markets of the " irreversibility " of the euro , as luxemberg 's prime minister jean claude juncker put it .
is the euro in fact " irreversible " or can you imagine a scenario in which this common currency would fold ?
nothing is irreversible .
it would unravel the minute that germany in particular were to make the tiniest suggestion about leaving .
it would be possible to reverse the euro , but it would have catastrophic consequences .
on one hand , you would see a bank run with weaker countries - everybody would try to get their money and put it in a german bank account and that would lead to an immediate collapse of the banking system in that country .
it would be catastrophic for the european idea , for these weak economies , and if germany were to decide to leave , it would not be good for germany either because the currency would appreciate dramatically .
next week at a eu summit , leaders are expected to agree on permanent eurozone rescue mechanisms , since the current emergency fund expires in 2013 .
what could or what should these permanent mechanisms look like ?
the issue of " permanent " only makes sense if the fund is large and credible enough .
at the moment i do n't see that we are getting any closer to making a credible long-term commitment to stability .
the only really credible commitment would be to integrate fiscal policy further .

russia now appears to be on its way to membership , despite the longest running negotiations in history . on tuesday , european union commission president jose manuel barroso announced a breakthrough to clear the way for russia 's entry to the world trade organization .
" our difficult bilateral issues are resolved .
we signed a memorandum of understanding to this end today , " barroso said at the brussels summit .
as part of the agreement , russia has pledged to lower export duties on timber and asian freight that travels to europe via russian railways .
the road to wto membership is usually long and paved with obstacles - but russia 's ongoing 17-year journey is a world record .
the nation with a 90 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- economy is the largest outside the wto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower export duties on russian timber will benefit eu paper makers the blame game frustrated russian politicians blame politically-motivated delay tactics employed by the us and the eu , while trade diplomats in geneva fault russia for failing to understand the rules of the organization .
the key to speeding up the process now lies in moscow , according to wto spokesman keith rockwell .
" the pace of accession is in almost every instance driven by the capital of the country that is acceding , " rockwell said .
in many instances the reforms that are required to join the wto are politically difficult - which is certainly the case in russia , he added .
" there are sectors of the russian economy that find the process of joining the wto very difficult . "
making nice with the neighbors moscow must now get approval from the other members of the wto , a process that includes entering talks with any of the 153 wto members that wish to negotiate .
on monday , russian president dmitri medvedev made the first state visit by a kremlin leader to poland in nine years , and secured poland 's support for russia 's wto accession .
but not all bilateral talks have been constructive .
georgia , russia 's neighbor to the south , has been a wto member for ten years , and has blocked the russian accession process since the armed conflict in the summer of 2008 .
ukraine , too , still has not given a green light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland supports russia 's accession to the wto a veto , however , is unlikely , says alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations .
" in my opinion , in doing so , georgia would harm itself , given the fact that the eu and the us both want russia in the wto and not out of it .
such a move by the georgians would jeopardize the agenda which the west has set up with russia , " rahr told deutche welle .
a powerful partner the european union , with 500 million people , is russia 's largest trading partner .
if russia joins the world trade organization , the nation will be unable to impose arbitrary import bans , drastic tariff increases , and import restrictions without risking sanctions .
exporting nations such as germany would benefit from easier market access , says wto spokesman rockwell , adding that membership for russia would provide german exporters , as well as their japanese and american counterparts , with " a certain sense of predictability " when they enter into business transactions in that country .
" that makes the country a more attractive place for doing business , " said rockwell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keith rockwell speaks for the wto which represents more than 97 percent of global trade a rocky start in the past , russia has been less than committed to the process of joining the wto .
in june 2009 , prime minister vladimir putin declared out of the blue that russia was withdrawing its application for accession to the wto .
instead , his country would join the world trade organization as a customs union , together with kazakhstan and belarus .
in 2007 , in his capacity as president , putin lost patience with geneva 's trade diplomacy , labeling the wto as " archaic , undemocratic and inflexible . "
but the wto wo n't hold a grudge , said keith rockwell .
" we are very thick-skinned in the wto , " the spokesman said , adding mr. putin would be welcome for a visit any time . " we would be very happy to see him here . "

the specification supports both smart cards and future versions of smartphones .
mobile devices equipped with near-field communications -lrb- nfc -rrb- chips would enable customers to pay for their journey at a ticket turnstile with a wave of a cell phone .
known as " cipurse , " the standard was developed by a group of leading technology firms , which announced a new partnership , known as the open standard for public transport -lrb- ospt -rrb- alliance .
" for mobile device manufacturers , the open security standard will be the next ‘ must-have ' checklist item they include in all next-generation nfc implementations , " the group said in a statement .
the ospt alliance described its open system as offering an alternative to proprietary technologies , which the group said " limit choices , are potentially less secure and cost more to acquire , deploy and maintain . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chip maker infineon is a member of the ospt alliance collaborators welcome the developers of the open security standard say their alliance is also open to bringing new partners into the fold .
on tuesday , watchdata technologies ltd. and the open ticketing institute of the netherlands joined the group , which already included inside secure , oberthur technologies and giesecke & devrient , as well as german chip maker infineon technologies .
the cipurse system was welcomed by transit industry representatives - among them the fare system director for singapore 's land transport authority .
" cipurse is an important step towards establishing standardized , secure and interoperable fare collection for all public transport schemes , and we plan to adopt it for future releases of -lrb- singapore 's contactless e-purse application -rrb- cepas , " said silvester prakasam , singapore 's fare system director , in the same statement .
the vice president of engineering with cubic transportation systems , inc . , pradip mistry , also described his company as " thrilled " with the group 's new open security standard .
an eye toward security the alliance is now looking to finalize its new specification – which can be used for smart cards and contactless tickets , as well as mobile phones and other media . though smart card technology has been around for years , the companies behind the open standard wanted to take another look at security .
the mifare classic chip , the technology and security standard widely used in today 's smart cards , saw its encryption cracked in recent years . tilo pannenbaecker , infineon technologies ' vice president and general manager of business line personal and object id , told deutsche welle that the new security standard uses the advanced encryption standard -lrb- aes -rrb- 128 , which he called " a more advanced , more modern cryptography . " but the alliance also found fault with the proprietary nature of the mifare technology .
pannenbaecker said the group 's new specification would allow a range of vendors to offer nfc-capable sim cards and phones . " our security standard that we are proposing now is the ideal security concept for nfc because it is offering advanced security , so chances of fraud and counterfeiting are limited , " he said .
" and it is a technology available at fair and reasonable terms . " the future of financial transactions ? google plans to put an nfc-enabled smartphone on the market this month .
at a web 2.0 summit in san francisco this past november , google 's chief executive eric schmidt said the next-generation devices " will be able to do commerce . " the head of research in motion , the company behind the blackberry smartphone , also expressed interest during the summit in incorporating nfc chips into the firm 's product range - and soon . 2011 could be off to a strong start : charles walton , chief operating officer for inside secure , cited estimates of between 40 and 50 million payment-equipped phones hitting the market next year . " now that the industry is moving to nfc phones and guys like google and apple and others are getting on board with nfc , they are looking for some global standards , " he told news agency afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong and japan already have smart card transit payment systems in place winning over consumers still , some analysts suggest taking a step back - and looking beyond the buzz surrounding the " tap and pay " phenomenon when it comes to mobile phones . " it 's a move in the right direction , " said christophe uzureau , research director of banking and investment services at gartner research , " but we tend to forget the big picture . " uzureau told deutsche welle that mobile providers are keen to seize upon the potential of nfc-enabled phones - but the industry is creating " a lot of hype . " consumers in hong kong , with its " octopus card , " and japan , which has " suica , " are accustomed to using prepaid , contactless means for transit .
but replacing cards with phones is easier said than done . " this only works if all consumers have nfc-enabled phones , and if they are confident in using them , " uzureau said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 07.12.2010 cash-strapped ireland awaits brutal 2011 austerity budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one down , 5,999,999,999 to go irish finance minister brian lenihan is to present his proposed 2011 budget to parliament later on tuesday , and it 's unlikely to make pleasant reading .
the debt-ridden country needs to fill a six billion euro hole . ireland 's already unpopular ruling party , fianna fail , will on tuesday present the toughest budget in the country 's history .
finance minister brian lenihan has already announced that dublin will be looking to raise an extra six billion euros -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- in 2011 , through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts .
due to the domestic budget presentation , lenihan has been forced to skip the high profile eurogroup meeting in brussels this week addressing the eurozone 's debt woes , sending ministry officials in his place .
the irish government effectively issued an outline of its plans for the coming year two weeks ago , when ironing out a broad four-year national recovery plan in order to qualify for an 85 billion euro rescue deal from the european union and international monetary fund .
the first tranche of these emergency loans will not be released until the budget is passed .
to placate the eu and imf , ireland needs to generate an extra 15 billion euros by 2014 , as it battles to bring its annual budget deficit back within the prescribed eurozone limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
this year 's deficit , which has ballooned due to the government bailout of the country 's biggest moneylender , anglo irish bank , is likely to be 32 percent of gdp .
" the budget is usually the most eagerly anticipated event in the fiscal calendar , " economist dermot o 'leary at goodbody stockbrokers in dublin told the afp news agency .
" this year though , the thunder has been stolen by the release of last week 's four-year plan .
we already know the broad parameters of what will be contained in the budget for 2011 . "
cuts in public sector , taxes to rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands protested when the initial recovery plan was announced roughly two-thirds of the savings are set to come from the public sector .
ireland 's relatively generous welfare spending is likely to take a big hit , with child benefit and social welfare spending facing a reduction of at least 5 percent .
only state pensions are expected to remain unchanged .
thousands of public sector jobs will also be cut , and those civil servants who keep their jobs will face pay cuts or freezes .
changes in tax brackets will generate the rest of the revenue .
by lowering income tax brands and revising the country 's tax credit system , the government will be able to target thousands of irish adults on lower incomes who currently do not have to pay income tax .
a reduction in the country 's minimum wage , which is currently the second highest in the eu at 8.65 euros per hour , is also on the cards .
government promises election once budget passes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even if ireland recovers , prime minister cowen is unlikely to irish prime minister brian cowen 's government might be forced into snap elections if the budget does not pass .
cowen , whose approval ratings are at an all-time low , has also pledged to call elections soon after parliament ratifies the austerity measures .
cowen 's coalition government no longer controls the lower house of parliament , the dail , and will need to find either independent or opposition support .
" the consequences of not passing a budget would be disastrous for ireland and its people , " independent mp michael lowry said in a statement on monday evening , pledging his reluctant support to the government 's proposal .
" despite some adverse reaction in my constituency to this decision i feel duty bound to put the country 's interests first . "
the dail 's other independent lawmaker , jackie healy-rae , has not yet revealed his position .
it 's unclear whether the main opposition group , the center-right fine gael and center-left labour parties , will attempt to thwart the budget in parliament or not .
barring a dramatic change in the public mood , these two parties look certain to rule in coalition once irish voters next go to the polls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 07.12.2010 no real breakthrough as 5 + 1 talks on iran end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 5 + 1 and iran returned to negotiations after 13 months nuclear talks between the 5 + 1 group and iran have ended in geneva with little sign of progress .
although the two sides have agreed to meet again , the sticking point is the demand for iran to suspend uranium enrichment . the negotiations between un security council heavyweights the united states , russia , china , france and britain along with germany - the so called 5 + 1 group - with an iranian delegation were the first in 13 months .
the negotiation teams , headed by eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton for the 5 + 1 and iran 's secretary of the national security council saaed jalili , agreed that a further round of talks would take place at the end of january in turkey . however , iran has already made it clear that it will not discuss its uranium enrichment program , which it insists is for peaceful purposes while western powers fear the fuel would be used for nuclear warheads .
at the last meeting in october 2009 , the 5 + 1 agreed to a proposal that would have allowed iran to ship a major portion of the uranium they had enriched to 3.5 percent to an external destination to undergo further enrichment and to be converted into fuel rods for the small tehran research reactor .
that would remove the potential threat of weapons-grade material being siphoned off within iran for military purposes .
iran originally agreed to this proposal but later reneged on it , having scored a major point by having the 5 + 1 tacitly agree to iran engaging in enrichment , a practice forbidden by security council resolutions .
then in may this year , brazil and turkey tried to re-broker the deal but this attempt was scuppered by the united states which claimed higher levels of uranium had been enriched in iran since the original offer in 2009 and that the new export deal would leave too much material behind in iran .
iran 's stance on enrichment levels proving obstructive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's saeed jalili will present a similar stance to that of 2009 " if iran agrees to suspend further enrichment , up to the 17.5 percent which it has already stated it was pressing ahead with , then there are a whole series of economic incentives which are on the table , " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , told deutsche welle .
" if , on the other hand , as ahmadinejad has said , iran does not want to address the issue of enrichment or make any concessions or compromises on that account , there will be no alternative at this stage but the consideration of further punitive sanctions . "
chances of reaching any agreements or compromises seem very bleak at this time , khonsari added , but there are clear signs that because economic and other pressures are making life very difficult for the iranian regime , ahmadinejad may be looking for a way out without losing face .
" for ahmadinejad and his supporters there are two main reasons for an engagement with washington , " professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" first , they know that an understanding with the us would be popular , particularly among the educated youth and the business community .
the second reason is that ahmadinejad and the political leadership feel that the regime is under serious threat by the united states , and only by the united states . "
perthes said iran 's threat perception , and its deep suspicion of us intentions , are often underestimated in washington despite these issues being driving factors in iranian politics .
while the regime elite still appears to be divided over the prospect of a full-scale rapprochement with the united states , it is believed many share this fear of the us and there is a real desire to avoid further isolation .
with this in mind , the 5 + 1 may consider lessened sanctions - along with other incentives - as a way to achieve progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has so far dismissed the western incentives incentives on offer but tehran remains steadfast " the western powers along with russia and china are offering iran lessened sanctions , the chance to fix world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership in return for explanations of what has gone on in regard to tehran 's nuclear program and realistic assurances that it has no military nuclear intentions , " simon henderson , director of the gulf and energy policy program at the washington institute for near east policy , told deutsche welle .
" the best hope for agreement lies on the possibility of reaching an acceptable compromise regarding the shipment of already enriched uranium from iran to an outside destination , " khonsari said .
" if agreement could be reached on the quantity , and there is a minute chance given past turkish and brazilian mediation that this is possible , there may still be a way out though it will be very difficult . "
there were concerns that the geneva negotiations would be made even more problematic by the latest wikileaks revelations which exposed the level of international concern and distrust of iran , especially among its persian gulf neighbors , and the consideration of many that military action is the best option when it comes to stopping tehran 's nuclear program .
however , experts believe there is little new information in the wikileaks revelations and that all the parties involved in the talks with iran are already aware of the delicate nature of relations .
wikileaks revelations unlikely to add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks revelations on iran are unlikely to affect talks " there is nothing in the wikileaks revelations that the islamic authorities have been unaware of , " khonsari said .
" the iranian regime understands that matters will be ratcheted up if they are unable to reach an agreement and they are aware that , irrespective of all factors , the likelihood of military confrontation is a very real possibility . "
khonsari believes the consensus among iran 's opponents , that confronting an ambitious iran with all its downsides might be a cheaper option than living with a nuclear iran - as highlighted in the wikileaks cables - might possibly alter tehran 's previous calculations .

" however , it 's hard to say what iran will do next in response . iran might calculate that if it tests a bomb , there would be some condemnation but then the world would have to get used to a new status quo , much in the same way as it did after the indian and pakistani tests in 1998 . "
mehrdad khonsari said the general consensus is that ahmadinejad wants to escalate matters and essentially go to the very brink of war in a bid to shore up his own leadership , which has been under pressure since the opposition protests in 2009 .
" it is believed that ahmadinejad feels a military conflict might help him consolidate his position inside the country , " he concluded .
" in such a case , his major aim is to buy time as it is unlikely that anything positive can be achieved as a result of these negotiations . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 07.12.2010 no real breakthrough as 5 + 1 talks on iran end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 5 + 1 and iran returned to negotiations after 13 months nuclear talks between the 5 + 1 group and iran have ended in geneva with little sign of progress .
although the two sides have agreed to meet again , the sticking point is the demand for iran to suspend uranium enrichment . the negotiations between un security council heavyweights the united states , russia , china , france and britain along with germany - the so called 5 + 1 group - with an iranian delegation were the first in 13 months .
the negotiation teams , headed by eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton for the 5 + 1 and iran 's secretary of the national security council saaed jalili , agreed that a further round of talks would take place at the end of january in turkey . however , iran has already made it clear that it will not discuss its uranium enrichment program , which it insists is for peaceful purposes while western powers fear the fuel would be used for nuclear warheads .
at the last meeting in october 2009 , the 5 + 1 agreed to a proposal that would have allowed iran to ship a major portion of the uranium they had enriched to 3.5 percent to an external destination to undergo further enrichment and to be converted into fuel rods for the small tehran research reactor .
that would remove the potential threat of weapons-grade material being siphoned off within iran for military purposes .
iran originally agreed to this proposal but later reneged on it , having scored a major point by having the 5 + 1 tacitly agree to iran engaging in enrichment , a practice forbidden by security council resolutions .
then in may this year , brazil and turkey tried to re-broker the deal but this attempt was scuppered by the united states which claimed higher levels of uranium had been enriched in iran since the original offer in 2009 and that the new export deal would leave too much material behind in iran .
iran 's stance on enrichment levels proving obstructive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's saeed jalili will present a similar stance to that of 2009 " if iran agrees to suspend further enrichment , up to the 17.5 percent which it has already stated it was pressing ahead with , then there are a whole series of economic incentives which are on the table , " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , told deutsche welle .
" if , on the other hand , as ahmadinejad has said , iran does not want to address the issue of enrichment or make any concessions or compromises on that account , there will be no alternative at this stage but the consideration of further punitive sanctions . "
chances of reaching any agreements or compromises seem very bleak at this time , khonsari added , but there are clear signs that because economic and other pressures are making life very difficult for the iranian regime , ahmadinejad may be looking for a way out without losing face .
" for ahmadinejad and his supporters there are two main reasons for an engagement with washington , " professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" first , they know that an understanding with the us would be popular , particularly among the educated youth and the business community .
the second reason is that ahmadinejad and the political leadership feel that the regime is under serious threat by the united states , and only by the united states . "
perthes said iran 's threat perception , and its deep suspicion of us intentions , are often underestimated in washington despite these issues being driving factors in iranian politics .
while the regime elite still appears to be divided over the prospect of a full-scale rapprochement with the united states , it is believed many share this fear of the us and there is a real desire to avoid further isolation .
with this in mind , the 5 + 1 may consider lessened sanctions - along with other incentives - as a way to achieve progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has so far dismissed the western incentives incentives on offer but tehran remains steadfast " the western powers along with russia and china are offering iran lessened sanctions , the chance to fix world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership in return for explanations of what has gone on in regard to tehran 's nuclear program and realistic assurances that it has no military nuclear intentions , " simon henderson , director of the gulf and energy policy program at the washington institute for near east policy , told deutsche welle .
" the best hope for agreement lies on the possibility of reaching an acceptable compromise regarding the shipment of already enriched uranium from iran to an outside destination , " khonsari said .
" if agreement could be reached on the quantity , and there is a minute chance given past turkish and brazilian mediation that this is possible , there may still be a way out though it will be very difficult . "
there were concerns that the geneva negotiations would be made even more problematic by the latest wikileaks revelations which exposed the level of international concern and distrust of iran , especially among its persian gulf neighbors , and the consideration of many that military action is the best option when it comes to stopping tehran 's nuclear program .

mehrdad khonsari said the general consensus is that ahmadinejad wants to escalate matters and essentially go to the very brink of war in a bid to shore up his own leadership , which has been under pressure since the opposition protests in 2009 .
" it is believed that ahmadinejad feels a military conflict might help him consolidate his position inside the country , " he concluded .
" in such a case , his major aim is to buy time as it is unlikely that anything positive can be achieved as a result of these negotiations . "

the eu ’ s foreign policy chief catherine ashton said the talks were detailed and substantive .
the meeting aimed to fix the framework for " several sessions " of future negotiations , with the next round of talks now planned for the end of january in istanbul .
the two-day meeting comes 14 months after the last attempt to temper iran 's uranium enrichment drive and clarify its nuclear capabilities .
the so-called 5 + 1 group of the united states , britain , france , russia , china and germany are worried iran could use its uranium enrichment plants to make fuel for warheads .
iran insists that it is seeking nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
before the talks started , iran made statements that their right to seek nuclear technology was " non-negotiable . "

he later held one-on-one meetings with the heads of the chinese , russian and british delegations as well as having a working dinner with ashton .
european sources said they were not expecting the geneva talks to produce instant results but hoping to re-engage iran over the longer term .
" we 've said all along that this was a starting point , and the aim was to have another meeting in which we can take things forward , " one eu diplomat told the news agency reuters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 07.12.2010 concern over politicization of top donor governments ’ aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philip tamminga an international organization , which evaluates the effectiveness of donor governments ’ aid for people suffering from conflicts , disasters and climate change , has released its 2010 humanitarian response index . the dara index -lrb- hri -rrb- assesses responses to crises by the world 's top donor governments – members of the disaster action committee of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
now in its fourth year , the hri examines performance under five “ pillars ” of donor practice : response to needs ; prevention , risk reduction and recovery ; working with partners ; protection and international humanitarian law ; and learning and accountability .
denmark tops the hri ranking list followed by ireland , new zealand , norway , and sweden , while the european commission comes in sixth .
the head of the hri team , philip tamminga , talked with deutsche welle about the latest index and how political priorities have impeded the delivery of humanitarian aid to millions .
deutsche welle : germany does n't appear to have done too well in your assessment .
why is that ?
philip tamminga : germany is ranked 14th -lsb- out of 20 -rsb- in the index this year , just after canada and australia , but before japan and france . germany spends a lot less on humanitarian assistance than other countries , and the percentage of its aid dedicated to humanitarian crises is about half of the average of other donors . so it lags somewhat behind other countries .
other factors that explain germany 's position in the ranking is that it has too many restrictive conditions on its aid funding .
this sometimes makes it difficult for the humanitarian organizations it funds to have enough flexibility to direct aid where it is needed or to adapt programmes if the situation changes on the ground - which happens quite often in a disaster or conflict .
germany could also do better at funding un and red cross appeals , and make better use of regular evaluations to improve the quality and effectiveness of the assistance it provides .
germany does have many strengths , though .
for instance , it tends to provide funding rapidly in cases of disasters , and it 's a strong supporter of ngos .
it is also one of the better donor governments in terms of its commitment towards accountability to people affected by crises - making sure aid is effective and responds to their needs . could you explain briefly how exactly the assessment is done – what are the key tools and methodology employed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid is much-needed in many corners of the globe we assess donors by looking at 35 different indicators of how well they support humanitarian action and apply good practices .
the indicators are based on the core concepts contained in the declaration of good humanitarian donorship , which was developed and signed by the world 's main donor governments - including germany - in 2003 .
what we want to see is if governments are respecting the commitments they made , so we send teams to different humanitarian crises and we talk to the different humanitarian organizations about how well the governments that fund their work are applying good practice .
we combine this with publicly available information from published sources on government aid funding , respect of international humanitarian law , and other elements of good donor practice .
this year , our teams visited 14 humanitarian crises areas like haiti , afghanistan , somalia , sudan and pakistan , and we spoke to over 500 senior officials working in these crises from the united nations , the red cross and the red crescent , ngos , donor governments and others .
we also collected nearly 2,000 survey responses .
this gives us a good basis to measure and compare donor governments each year on whether their policies and practices facilitate or impede an effective response to crises .
the report says that there 's ample evidence of politicization of aid .
exactly what evidence do you have to show that political interests have overtaken the commitment to good humanitarian donorship ?
in 10 of the 14 crises we visited , we saw and heard of evidence that donor governments were placing political interests above humanitarian objectives . in some cases , like afghanistan , the use of western military forces to provide humanitarian assistance is compromising the neutrality , impartiality and independence of humanitarian organizations , and putting humanitarian workers and civilians at risk .
we also saw in some places like somalia , the occupied palestinian territories or yemen , some donor governments are putting restrictions on humanitarian organizations that prevents them from working in areas controlled by certain groups like hamas , as part of the " war on terror . "
this means the people in need are not getting the aid they deserve .
in other crises , there are debates about how foreign aid can help win " hearts and minds " or achieve other foreign policy objectives .
one of the most basic humanitarian principles – which donor governments committed themselves to when they signed the good donorship declaration – is that humanitarian assistance should be given without discrimination , and based on needs alone – and not because it may or may not help a government achieve other objectives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastation left behind by the 2005 tsunami the hri report claims that there are gaps in the protection of civilians and that the lack of safe humanitarian access has put vulnerable groups at risk of harm .
basically , this refers to the promotion of international humanitarian law and goes beyond programming issues – is the report referring to diplomacy efforts in this direction ? yes , the report is clear that as a result of politicization , safe access by humanitarian organizations to people affected by crisis is being compromised . because of that , humanitarian workers are at risk , and civilian populations are not getting the protection and assistance they need .
a recent example of this lack of protection was seen in the mass rapes that took place in the democratic republic of the congo .
and the safety of humanitarian workers is also at stake : last year over 260 humanitarians were killed , kidnapped or injured while trying to carry out their work .
you have also accused donors of failing to improve transparency and accountability towards affected people .
which countries have fared well under this pillar and which poorly ?
donor governments are not doing enough to promote better accountability towards people affected by disasters and crises .
there are lots of requirements on humanitarian organizations to report on how they have spent the money they get , and what kind of results , but very few donor governments have in place requirements to monitor and ensure that aid money is being used to meet the needs and priorities of the actual people affected by the crisis .
most professional humanitarian organizations already do this to some extent , but donor governments are not monitoring and following up adequately , and supporting these efforts . another concern is that donor governments are not being transparent or accountable on the aid that they promise . for example , many governments have still not disbursed all the funds that they promised after the earthquake in haiti .
and while the promises are made in the media or in international conferences , most of the time , the people affected do n't receive any information about this , and do n't have any way to participate directly on how that aid will be prioritized or spent .
this is why we call on governments to improve their transparency and accountability . germany tends to do better than other donors in this area , and could perhaps take the lead in building more commitment amongst donor governments .
what 's been donor governments ' response to this ranking system – surely some are n't happy with the whole exercise ?
some governments have told us that they think a ranking system is counterproductive , and does n't encourage or motivate donor governments to do better .
but in fact , some of the lowest ranked donors have told us they appreciate having a tool like the humanitarian response index to benchmark their performance and to know where they stand compared to their peers . the ranking is only a minor part of the exercise , though .
we collect a lot of valuable information about how donors are performing , and we have always offered this information to governments , donor agencies and other stakeholders to use it to understand where a government may need to improve , and where they are doing well .
by visiting 14 crises areas – the biggest evaluation exercise of its kind in the humanitarian sector – we are able to identify trends that affect the quality and impact of aid .
so we have lots of valuable analysis to share with the international community , such as our increasing concerns about politicization of aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food for those who need it most you must have confronted questions relating to legitimacy , though – what gives dara the authority to rank donor performance ?
first of all , dara has a great multi-disciplinary team with extensive experience in the field of evaluating humanitarian action . we were part of the huge tsunami joint evaluation exercise on how the entire humanitarian system responded .
dara looked specifically at the area of donor funding , which gave us insights on how they took decisions , and why good practice was so difficult for them to apply .
that was the basis for us creating the humanitarian response index – to systematically measure donor practice and provide solid , empirical evidence on where donor governments need to improve further . since then , we have carried out hri evaluations in over 35 crises , along with our extensive evaluation experience in other areas .
we also felt it was absolutely critical for an independent , objective evaluation of donor governments .
until the hri was created , there was no way to monitor if donor governments were complying with their commitments .
most of the tools and processes used by donors to assess their own performance are not transparent enough , and do n't look at issues around the quality of their aid , or the relationship with the humanitarian organizations they fund .
we think the hri can be used to stimulate changes and improvements .
has the hri , since its inception in 2007 , had a measurable impact on donors ?
if so , could you give some examples ?
yes .
the index has helped to raise many issues and concerns facing the humanitarian sector in general , and several donor governments have now taken this up as an issue for discussion at the international level .
for example , our findings in the 2008 report called for improvements in the way that humanitarian needs are identified so that aid could be distributed more effectively and fairly .
now , many governments are working with humanitarian organizations to address this gap .
some governments have used our findings as part of their overall evaluation of their aid programs and policies .
and dara has also begun working with some donor governments to provide a more detailed assessment on how they are doing , with recommendations on where to change and improve . next year we hope to carry out an evaluation of the impact of the hri after its first five years , where we can show how and where it has had an influence .
in the meantime , we will continue to offer our support and analysis to governments and other stakeholders who are interested in making sure that aid efforts help people affected by crisis .

it was 2006 and she had escaped north korea two years earlier .
ji , now 28 , and his younger brother and sister had also fled .
they were hiding out in northeast china .
that ’ s when he suddenly got a phone call .
his mother called him from south korea .
she ’ d decided that china , which often forcibly repatriates north koreans , was too dangerous a place for the family to stay in .
that ’ s why she had gone to the south .
ji ’ s mother had arranged for a broker to escort him and his brother to laos and then on to south korea .
but ji says they couldn ’ t find their sister in time to take her with them .
it was only last september that ji and his family finally located her .
" my sister had no idea whether we were back in north korea or in the south , " ji said .
" she found out through a friend in china that we were in seoul .
we contacted her and we paid a human rights organization to help bring her here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , a group of north korean refugees managed to flee to a german school in beijing the ' underground railroad ' the seoul government recently announced that 20,000 defectors from the north have resettled in south korea , about half of those arriving in just the past few years .
most make it to the south with the help of christian missionaries who take north koreans along what ’ s called the underground railroad that runs through china to southeast asia , where it is easier to seek asylum .
many resettled north koreans , like ji ’ s family , are cooperating with missionaries and have their own network of brokers taking refugees out of china , said tim peters , an american missionary whose seoul-based organization assists defectors in reaching south korea .
" virtually every refugee who makes it safely and resettles in south korea has probably made a sworn oath to two to three to four other family members or very close associates in north korea that the resettled one is going to do everything possible to get those other people out . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rally in seoul against the chinese government 's policy on north korean defectors peters added that some defectors even go back to china themselves to bring loved ones to the south .
and refugees are doing whatever they can to raise funds to help their families , said kim seok hyang , a former official at seoul ’ s ministry of unification , the agency that oversees north korean resettlement .
paying human traffickers kim said defectors are using the few thousand dollars they initially receive as a government stipend to pay off human traffickers to bring their loved ones to the south .
but if that money isn ’ t enough , some turn to the sex trade , kim said .
" they want to sacrifice themselves to get that amount of money . from their point of view they need to save their family members and they have no other choice than -lsb- selling -rsb- their body . "
defector ji sang hyun said he doesn ’ t know how much money his mother paid to have him and his brother and sister brought to south korea .
he is glad that his sister finally made it here so the family can live together once again .
but it ’ s not an entirely happy ending .
ji said , " my father at first didn ’ t want to defect , but when he learned that we were all going to south korea he tried to escape north korea too .
but he was caught by border guards and tortured in a prison camp . "
ji learned that his father died just a few days after he was released .

russia now appears to be on its way to membership , despite the longest running negotiations in history . on tuesday , european union commission president jose manuel barroso announced a breakthrough to clear the way for russia 's entry to the world trade organization .
" our difficult bilateral issues are resolved .
we signed a memorandum of understanding to this end today , " barroso said at the brussels summit .
as part of the agreement , russia has pledged to lower export duties on timber and asian freight that travels to europe via russian railways .
the road to wto membership is usually long and paved with obstacles - but russia 's ongoing 17-year journey is a world record .
the nation with a 90 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- economy is the largest outside the wto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower export duties on russian timber will benefit eu paper makers the blame game frustrated russian politicians blame politically-motivated delay tactics employed by the us and the eu , while trade diplomats in geneva fault russia for failing to understand the rules of the organization .
the key to speeding up the process now lies in moscow , according to wto spokesman keith rockwell .
" the pace of accession is in almost every instance driven by the capital of the country that is acceding , " rockwell said .
in many instances the reforms that are required to join the wto are politically difficult - which is certainly the case in russia , he added .
" there are sectors of the russian economy that find the process of joining the wto very difficult . "
making nice with the neighbors moscow must now get approval from the other members of the wto , a process that includes entering talks with any of the 153 wto members that wish to negotiate .
on monday , russian president dmitri medvedev made the first state visit by a kremlin leader to poland in nine years , and secured poland 's support for russia 's wto accession .
but not all bilateral talks have been constructive .
georgia , russia 's neighbor to the south , has been a wto member for ten years , and has blocked the russian accession process since the armed conflict in the summer of 2008 .
ukraine , too , still has not given a green light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland supports russia 's accession to the wto a veto , however , is unlikely , says alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations .
" in my opinion , in doing so , georgia would harm itself , given the fact that the eu and the us both want russia in the wto and not out of it .
such a move by the georgians would jeopardize the agenda which the west has set up with russia , " rahr told deutche welle .
a powerful partner the european union , with 500 million people , is russia 's largest trading partner .
if russia joins the world trade organization , the nation will be unable to impose arbitrary import bans , drastic tariff increases , and import restrictions without risking sanctions .
exporting nations such as germany would benefit from easier market access , says wto spokesman rockwell , adding that membership for russia would provide german exporters , as well as their japanese and american counterparts , with " a certain sense of predictability " when they enter into business transactions in that country .
" that makes the country a more attractive place for doing business , " said rockwell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keith rockwell speaks for the wto which represents more than 97 percent of global trade a rocky start in the past , russia has been less than committed to the process of joining the wto .
in june 2009 , prime minister vladimir putin declared out of the blue that russia was withdrawing its application for accession to the wto .
instead , his country would join the world trade organization as a customs union , together with kazakhstan and belarus .
in 2007 , in his capacity as president , putin lost patience with geneva 's trade diplomacy , labeling the wto as " archaic , undemocratic and inflexible . "
but the wto wo n't hold a grudge , said keith rockwell .
" we are very thick-skinned in the wto , " the spokesman said , adding mr. putin would be welcome for a visit any time . " we would be very happy to see him here . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 07.12.2010 us-china truce signals a spirit of compromise in cancun climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global agreement on emissions targets may be in sight china has offered for the first time to submit its voluntary carbon emissions target to a binding un resolution , buoying climate talks as environment ministers from around the globe arrive in cancun . environment ministers from around the world arrived in cancun on tuesday , replacing their lower-level negotiators and hoping to wrap up a deal by friday night .
a major sticking point to any potential deal has been the fact that the us and china are not signed up to the accord .
" there is a challenge that not everyone is part of the kyoto protocol " , eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard told a press conference in cancun .
but as the talks enter the final stages , china and the us have confirmed their commitment to emissions reductions – a move that could save the talks .
developing countries have said they wo n't move towards any new treaty until members of the kyoto protocol agree to extend the treaty beyond 2012 .
but japan , russia and canada have refused to extend kyoto without the participation of the world 's two top polluters - china , which has no requirements as a developing country , and the united states , which rejected the treaty in 2001 .
together , china and the us emit about 40 percent of the world 's greenhouse gases .
japan , russia and canada want a separate agreement regulating all nations .
" there are huge concerns about the position of japan .
we 're seeing some signals of possible flexibility from the japanese , but the japanese have to not stand in the way of a decision that reaffirms a second commitment period , " alden meyer from the union of concerned scientists told a press conference in cancun .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer is concerned about japan 's position game-changer in an apparent about turn , which could potentially save the climate talks , china announced on monday that it would be prepared to make emissions reductions binding .
" we can create a resolution and that resolution can be binding on china , " said huang huikang , the chinese foreign ministry 's envoy for climate change talks , in an interview with reuters .
china 's offer to make its existing , domestic pledge to reduce its " carbon intensity " - the amount of the main greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , emitted for each dollar of economic growth - binding under a un resolution is a compromise it hopes will encourage developed countries to continue the existing kyoto protocol .
" china wants to avoid a collapse of the talks , " ruth davis from greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" they 're trying to create a landing space for japan to come back on board without losing face " .
china 's target would still be voluntary , stressed china 's chief negotiator xie zhenhua , in contrast to developed nation targets under kyoto .
targets for developed countries are imposed by the international community , but beijing 's targets would be offered to the community by china .
analysts were generally positive about china 's proposal .
" this is a game-changer , " said jennifer morgan from the washington-based world resources institute .
but the details of china ‘ s pledge remain unclear .
" china may ask for different conditions to developed countries whose emissions reductions are subject to international scrutiny and monitoring , " ruth davis told deutsche welle .
china in the past has refused to be part of a binding agreement involving outside verification that it is making good on its pledges to curb emissions .
low key us appearance us involvement is also seen as a linchpin for an international agreement .
" there can be no doubt that in the european union , we have time and again told our american friends why we thought it was very important that they engage in this agenda , " said eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chu reaffirmed obama 's commitment to fighting climate change on a brief visit to cancun , us energy secretary steven chu confirmed that president barack obama was committed to meeting us pledges made in copenhagen to curb carbon emissions from 2005 levels by 17 percent by 2020 .
" he absolutely feels that moving toward a clean energy economy is really about our energy security and about our financial security , " chu said .
" it 's about our economy ; it 's about the future of the planet . "
this is despite the republican party 's election victory last month , which says forced emission cuts would hurt a fragile economy .
some republicans also doubt the science behind climate change .
this all but ended the prospect of the united states approving legislation to restrict carbon emissions .
chu highlighted efforts by the obama administration to encourage low-carbon technology , including 90 billion dollars towards clean energy in its economic stimulus package .
the administration has set up research laboratories for green research and offered tax incentives to pursue eco-friendly energy .
air of optimism amid diplomatic leaks environmentalists seem to agree that there is a more hopeful tone at this year 's talks in cancun .
" over the past week , we have seen a vastly improved atmosphere in these talks than we 've seen over the past year , " said wendel trio , greenpeace international 's director of climate policy .
mexico has so far received plaudits for running an open process that has kept the mood at the cancun talks more positive than in copenhagen where major global powers negotiated behind closed doors , a move that irked many developing countries .
but disclosures by wikileaks this week threatened to sour the mood .
the leaked memos showed that the united states and european union worked together aggressively to sell the copenhagen deal last year .
bildunterschrift : delegates have until the end of the week to forge an agreement on how to tackle climate change in one cable , reported by the british newspaper the guardian , hedegaard is quoted as telling a us official that small island nations " could be our best allies " as they need financial assistance from wealthy states .
the goal would be to step up pressure on developing countries such as india and brazil to sign up .
such emerging powers have taken growing action on climate change but stated adamantly that the measures are voluntary and that rich nations bear historic responsibility for the problem .
a leaked cable also said the european union and united states looked at ways to " neutralize , co-opt or marginalize " countries seen as " unhelpful " - particularly venezuela and bolivia , which have raised persistent objections during climate negotiations on issues both of substance and process .
asked about the leaks , hedegaard said that the cables offered a " one-sided and selected " us account of conversations .
she denied any untoward pressure toward the most vulnerable nations such as maldives , saying : " for many reasons we want to work very much with them . "
hedegaard said she did not believe the disclosures would hurt the cancun talks , saying everyone knows " that you discuss a lot of things " in negotiations .
but bolivian negotiator pablo solon said he was " greatly concerned " by the disclosures .
the cables " confirm what we 've always been saying and the united states has been denying : the interference , pressure and blackmail regrettably conducted by the us administration , " he said .

in brussels on tuesday , eu monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn expressed confidence that this money would not be lost .
" i 'm confident that ireland , with its smart , competent , and stubborn people - and its prospects of recovering -lsb- from -rsb- this situation - will overcome the current challenges . "
tough budget while the final stamp of approval for the bailout loan was being given in brussels , the irish government in dublin announced deep cuts in its 2011 budget .
tax hikes and spending cuts are expected to save the country around 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lenihan unveiled a tough budget on tuesday " as outlined in the plan , six billion euros of the overall adjustment is made in today 's budget .
the scale of this adjustment is demanding but it demonstrates the seriousness of our intent , " said finance minister brian lenihan in an address to ireland 's lower house of parliament .
the budget cuts were necessary to secure the bailout from the eu and the international monetary fund .
tapping the reserves ireland 's bailout comes from the 750 billion euro crisis fund established earlier this year after greece required similar aid .
now , the question is still being asked : will ireland be the only country to access the fund , or will portugal , spain or even italy need support soon ?
and if so , will 750 billion euros be enough ?
for spanish finance minister elena salgado , the problem simply does not exist .
“ the volume of the crisis mechanism seems reasonable to us , ” she said .
but from her , these words seem logical ; spain is trying to soothe the markets .
belgian finance minister didier reynders , who chaired the talks , is more cautious , saying debates on the size of the bailout mechanism will likely continue .

russia now appears to be on its way to membership , despite the longest running negotiations in history . on tuesday , european union commission president jose manuel barroso announced a breakthrough to clear the way for russia 's entry to the world trade organization .
" our difficult bilateral issues are resolved .
we signed a memorandum of understanding to this end today , " barroso said at the brussels summit .
as part of the agreement , russia has pledged to lower export duties on timber and asian freight that travels to europe via russian railways .
the road to wto membership is usually long and paved with obstacles - but russia 's ongoing 17-year journey is a world record .
the nation with a 90 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- economy is the largest outside the wto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower export duties on russian timber will benefit eu paper makers the blame game frustrated russian politicians blame politically-motivated delay tactics employed by the us and the eu , while trade diplomats in geneva fault russia for failing to understand the rules of the organization .
the key to speeding up the process now lies in moscow , according to wto spokesman keith rockwell .
" the pace of accession is in almost every instance driven by the capital of the country that is acceding , " rockwell said .
in many instances the reforms that are required to join the wto are politically difficult - which is certainly the case in russia , he added .
" there are sectors of the russian economy that find the process of joining the wto very difficult . "
making nice with the neighbors moscow must now get approval from the other members of the wto , a process that includes entering talks with any of the 153 wto members that wish to negotiate .
on monday , russian president dmitri medvedev made the first state visit by a kremlin leader to poland in nine years , and secured poland 's support for russia 's wto accession .
but not all bilateral talks have been constructive .
georgia , russia 's neighbor to the south , has been a wto member for ten years , and has blocked the russian accession process since the armed conflict in the summer of 2008 .
ukraine , too , still has not given a green light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland supports russia 's accession to the wto a veto , however , is unlikely , says alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations .
" in my opinion , in doing so , georgia would harm itself , given the fact that the eu and the us both want russia in the wto and not out of it .
such a move by the georgians would jeopardize the agenda which the west has set up with russia , " rahr told deutche welle .
a powerful partner the european union , with 500 million people , is russia 's largest trading partner .
if russia joins the world trade organization , the nation will be unable to impose arbitrary import bans , drastic tariff increases , and import restrictions without risking sanctions .
exporting nations such as germany would benefit from easier market access , says wto spokesman rockwell , adding that membership for russia would provide german exporters , as well as their japanese and american counterparts , with " a certain sense of predictability " when they enter into business transactions in that country .
" that makes the country a more attractive place for doing business , " said rockwell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keith rockwell speaks for the wto which represents more than 97 percent of global trade a rocky start in the past , russia has been less than committed to the process of joining the wto .
in june 2009 , prime minister vladimir putin declared out of the blue that russia was withdrawing its application for accession to the wto .
instead , his country would join the world trade organization as a customs union , together with kazakhstan and belarus .
in 2007 , in his capacity as president , putin lost patience with geneva 's trade diplomacy , labeling the wto as " archaic , undemocratic and inflexible . "
but the wto wo n't hold a grudge , said keith rockwell .
" we are very thick-skinned in the wto , " the spokesman said , adding mr. putin would be welcome for a visit any time . " we would be very happy to see him here . "

but know-how , often protected by patents , is trickling way too slowly from industrialized nations to poorer regions . every few years , world leaders get together at high-profile conferences to discuss ways to reduce global warming and save the planet . the 2010 united nations climate change conference is currently being held in cancun , mexico .
but the talks are taking place amid low expectations , after the disappointment of the copenhagen summit last year – which memorably failed to produce any binding agreements .
this came as a particular blow to the g77 countries , which have in fact expanded to 131 mostly developing nations .
their demands include a relaxation , if not a general lifting , of patent protection laws governing renewable energies .
their argument is that it is first and foremost the industrialized nations that are responsible for climate change , while the poorer nations pay the price for the wealthier countries ' mistakes .
therefore industrialized nations should at least give them the benefit of their green energy know-how .
sharing their patents would go some way to paying off their climate debts , the g77 countries say .
the patent imbalance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patents get in the way of technology transfer between developed and developing nations according to a new study compiled by the un environment program , 80 percent of all patented innovations in the area of clean energy technologies are registered by companies in japan , germany , us , south korea , britain and france .
the report , which examines the role of patents in combating climate change , was jointly conducted with the european patent office and the international centre for trade and sustainable development .
" the fact that northern countries keep their expertise on regenerative energies to themselves , puts the south at an additional disadvantage , " says aileen kwa from south center , an intergovernmental policy think tank of developing countries .
as a climate-friendly , affordable alternative to fossil fuels , clean energy is key to the future of the developing world , and allows people to access energy supplies without having to rely on major providers .
moreover , it decentralizes the energy supply .
in countries where the majority of the population is rural , solar panels and geothermal heat pumps installed in individual homes are energy efficient solutions for people who would otherwise go without .
one problem , however , is the frequent lack of local expertise necessary not only to install the technology , but also to maintain it .
not only does the equipment therefore need to be imported – the know-how does to .
if patents are a factor , the whole process soon becomes very costly .
but it 's not only developing nations that have some catching-up to do on the clean energy front .
green technology is still very much in its infancy in croatia , for example , although grassroots projects are slowly beginning to gather momentum .
even in industrialized countries , it seems , introduction of climate protection measures comes with a high price tag . popular misconceptions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in cancun , debate is centering around mobilizing funds and technology transfer to cope with climate change one obstacle to globalized climate control is the general ignorance in the developed world of what exactly the developing world needs .
" indigenous knowledge on protecting natural resources and alternative energy supplies often exists , " points out kwa , stressing that all that 's then needed is a transfer of technology that can be implemented locally .
rainer osterwalder from the european patent office agrees , but says there 's plenty of room for improvement .
" the technology transfer from north to south is still unsatisfactory , " he says .
" one thing that should n't be forgotten is that emerging economies , and china in particular , are increasingly active when it comes to domestic innovation in the area of regenerative energy . "
" patents neither create problems nor solve them , " he says .
in his opinion , more urgent problems include inadequate infrastructure in the developing world ; the lack of an existing market for clean technologies and the lack of opportunity to build one .
adding to the problem is the popular misconception that patents are internationally valid .
in fact , if a patent is n't registered with the patent office of a specific country , then it does n't exist .
" a french company does n't necessarily register the patent for its photovoltaic technology in angola , say , if it believes that there 's no market for such a system in that country , " explains osterwalder .
in developing countries , however , few people are aware that many technologies are not actually patented in their country .
a spanner in the works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , local expertise is underestimated critics believe that ultimately , patent protection is a major stumbling block in fighting climate change .
in recent years , the european patent office has complained about the ‘ global patent warming , ' stressing that the increasing number of patent applications is slowing down the issue of patents .
the multitude of patent applications does not mean that the world is coming up with more innovations - rather , what is happening is that inventors and companies that already hold patents in one country are lining up at many other national patent offices to get patents for other markets .
ultimately , the purpose of securing a patent is to throw a spanner in the works of rival development .
the patents issue is one that results in the developing world feeling as though it has been left to deal with climate change by itself , by the very countries that are mainly responsible for it .
but industrialized nations retaliate by citing the free market and the necessary protection of intellectual property – and , needless to say , their own economic superiority . whether or not it is justifiable to privatize expertise in the field of regenerative energy is a question that will no doubt be raised at the current summit in cancun .

but know-how , often protected by patents , is trickling way too slowly from industrialized nations to poorer regions . every few years , world leaders get together at high-profile conferences to discuss ways to reduce global warming and save the planet . the 2010 united nations climate change conference is currently being held in cancun , mexico .
but the talks are taking place amid low expectations , after the disappointment of the copenhagen summit last year – which memorably failed to produce any binding agreements .
this came as a particular blow to the g77 countries , which have in fact expanded to 131 mostly developing nations .
their demands include a relaxation , if not a general lifting , of patent protection laws governing renewable energies .
their argument is that it is first and foremost the industrialized nations that are responsible for climate change , while the poorer nations pay the price for the wealthier countries ' mistakes .
therefore industrialized nations should at least give them the benefit of their green energy know-how .
sharing their patents would go some way to paying off their climate debts , the g77 countries say .
the patent imbalance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patents get in the way of technology transfer between developed and developing nations according to a new study compiled by the un environment program , 80 percent of all patented innovations in the area of clean energy technologies are registered by companies in japan , germany , us , south korea , britain and france .
the report , which examines the role of patents in combating climate change , was jointly conducted with the european patent office and the international centre for trade and sustainable development .
" the fact that northern countries keep their expertise on regenerative energies to themselves , puts the south at an additional disadvantage , " says aileen kwa from south center , an intergovernmental policy think tank of developing countries .
as a climate-friendly , affordable alternative to fossil fuels , clean energy is key to the future of the developing world , and allows people to access energy supplies without having to rely on major providers .
moreover , it decentralizes the energy supply .
in countries where the majority of the population is rural , solar panels and geothermal heat pumps installed in individual homes are energy efficient solutions for people who would otherwise go without .
one problem , however , is the frequent lack of local expertise necessary not only to install the technology , but also to maintain it .
not only does the equipment therefore need to be imported – the know-how does to .
if patents are a factor , the whole process soon becomes very costly .
but it 's not only developing nations that have some catching-up to do on the clean energy front .
green technology is still very much in its infancy in croatia , for example , although grassroots projects are slowly beginning to gather momentum .
even in industrialized countries , it seems , introduction of climate protection measures comes with a high price tag . popular misconceptions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in cancun , debate is centering around mobilizing funds and technology transfer to cope with climate change one obstacle to globalized climate control is the general ignorance in the developed world of what exactly the developing world needs .
" indigenous knowledge on protecting natural resources and alternative energy supplies often exists , " points out kwa , stressing that all that 's then needed is a transfer of technology that can be implemented locally .
rainer osterwalder from the european patent office agrees , but says there 's plenty of room for improvement .
" the technology transfer from north to south is still unsatisfactory , " he says .
" one thing that should n't be forgotten is that emerging economies , and china in particular , are increasingly active when it comes to domestic innovation in the area of regenerative energy . "
" patents neither create problems nor solve them , " he says .
in his opinion , more urgent problems include inadequate infrastructure in the developing world ; the lack of an existing market for clean technologies and the lack of opportunity to build one .
adding to the problem is the popular misconception that patents are internationally valid .
in fact , if a patent is n't registered with the patent office of a specific country , then it does n't exist .
" a french company does n't necessarily register the patent for its photovoltaic technology in angola , say , if it believes that there 's no market for such a system in that country , " explains osterwalder .
in developing countries , however , few people are aware that many technologies are not actually patented in their country .
a spanner in the works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , local expertise is underestimated critics believe that ultimately , patent protection is a major stumbling block in fighting climate change .
in recent years , the european patent office has complained about the ‘ global patent warming , ' stressing that the increasing number of patent applications is slowing down the issue of patents .
the multitude of patent applications does not mean that the world is coming up with more innovations - rather , what is happening is that inventors and companies that already hold patents in one country are lining up at many other national patent offices to get patents for other markets .
ultimately , the purpose of securing a patent is to throw a spanner in the works of rival development .
the patents issue is one that results in the developing world feeling as though it has been left to deal with climate change by itself , by the very countries that are mainly responsible for it .
but industrialized nations retaliate by citing the free market and the necessary protection of intellectual property – and , needless to say , their own economic superiority . whether or not it is justifiable to privatize expertise in the field of regenerative energy is a question that will no doubt be raised at the current summit in cancun .

it was 2006 and she had escaped north korea two years earlier .
ji , now 28 , and his younger brother and sister had also fled .
they were hiding out in northeast china .
that ’ s when he suddenly got a phone call .
his mother called him from south korea .
she ’ d decided that china , which often forcibly repatriates north koreans , was too dangerous a place for the family to stay in .
that ’ s why she had gone to the south .
ji ’ s mother had arranged for a broker to escort him and his brother to laos and then on to south korea .
but ji says they couldn ’ t find their sister in time to take her with them .
it was only last september that ji and his family finally located her .
" my sister had no idea whether we were back in north korea or in the south , " ji said .
" she found out through a friend in china that we were in seoul .
we contacted her and we paid a human rights organization to help bring her here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , a group of north korean refugees managed to flee to a german school in beijing the ' underground railroad ' the seoul government recently announced that 20,000 defectors from the north have resettled in south korea , about half of those arriving in just the past few years .
most make it to the south with the help of christian missionaries who take north koreans along what ’ s called the underground railroad that runs through china to southeast asia , where it is easier to seek asylum .
many resettled north koreans , like ji ’ s family , are cooperating with missionaries and have their own network of brokers taking refugees out of china , said tim peters , an american missionary whose seoul-based organization assists defectors in reaching south korea .
" virtually every refugee who makes it safely and resettles in south korea has probably made a sworn oath to two to three to four other family members or very close associates in north korea that the resettled one is going to do everything possible to get those other people out . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rally in seoul against the chinese government 's policy on north korean defectors peters added that some defectors even go back to china themselves to bring loved ones to the south .
and refugees are doing whatever they can to raise funds to help their families , said kim seok hyang , a former official at seoul ’ s ministry of unification , the agency that oversees north korean resettlement .
paying human traffickers kim said defectors are using the few thousand dollars they initially receive as a government stipend to pay off human traffickers to bring their loved ones to the south .
but if that money isn ’ t enough , some turn to the sex trade , kim said .
" they want to sacrifice themselves to get that amount of money . from their point of view they need to save their family members and they have no other choice than -lsb- selling -rsb- their body . "
defector ji sang hyun said he doesn ’ t know how much money his mother paid to have him and his brother and sister brought to south korea .
he is glad that his sister finally made it here so the family can live together once again .
but it ’ s not an entirely happy ending .
ji said , " my father at first didn ’ t want to defect , but when he learned that we were all going to south korea he tried to escape north korea too .
but he was caught by border guards and tortured in a prison camp . "
ji learned that his father died just a few days after he was released .

the specification supports both smart cards and future versions of smartphones .
mobile devices equipped with near-field communications -lrb- nfc -rrb- chips would enable customers to pay for their journey at a ticket turnstile with a wave of a cell phone .
known as " cipurse , " the standard was developed by a group of leading technology firms , which announced a new partnership , known as the open standard for public transport -lrb- ospt -rrb- alliance .
" for mobile device manufacturers , the open security standard will be the next ‘ must-have ' checklist item they include in all next-generation nfc implementations , " the group said in a statement .
the ospt alliance described its open system as offering an alternative to proprietary technologies , which the group said " limit choices , are potentially less secure and cost more to acquire , deploy and maintain . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chip maker infineon is a member of the ospt alliance collaborators welcome the developers of the open security standard say their alliance is also open to bringing new partners into the fold .
on tuesday , watchdata technologies ltd. and the open ticketing institute of the netherlands joined the group , which already included inside secure , oberthur technologies and giesecke & devrient , as well as german chip maker infineon technologies .
the cipurse system was welcomed by transit industry representatives - among them the fare system director for singapore 's land transport authority .
" cipurse is an important step towards establishing standardized , secure and interoperable fare collection for all public transport schemes , and we plan to adopt it for future releases of -lrb- singapore 's contactless e-purse application -rrb- cepas , " said silvester prakasam , singapore 's fare system director , in the same statement .
the vice president of engineering with cubic transportation systems , inc . , pradip mistry , also described his company as " thrilled " with the group 's new open security standard .
an eye toward security the alliance is now looking to finalize its new specification – which can be used for smart cards and contactless tickets , as well as mobile phones and other media . though smart card technology has been around for years , the companies behind the open standard wanted to take another look at security .
the mifare classic chip , the technology and security standard widely used in today 's smart cards , saw its encryption cracked in recent years . tilo pannenbaecker , infineon technologies ' vice president and general manager of business line personal and object id , told deutsche welle that the new security standard uses the advanced encryption standard -lrb- aes -rrb- 128 , which he called " a more advanced , more modern cryptography . " but the alliance also found fault with the proprietary nature of the mifare technology .
pannenbaecker said the group 's new specification would allow a range of vendors to offer nfc-capable sim cards and phones . " our security standard that we are proposing now is the ideal security concept for nfc because it is offering advanced security , so chances of fraud and counterfeiting are limited , " he said .
" and it is a technology available at fair and reasonable terms . " the future of financial transactions ? google plans to put an nfc-enabled smartphone on the market this month .
at a web 2.0 summit in san francisco this past november , google 's chief executive eric schmidt said the next-generation devices " will be able to do commerce . " the head of research in motion , the company behind the blackberry smartphone , also expressed interest during the summit in incorporating nfc chips into the firm 's product range - and soon . 2011 could be off to a strong start : charles walton , chief operating officer for inside secure , cited estimates of between 40 and 50 million payment-equipped phones hitting the market next year . " now that the industry is moving to nfc phones and guys like google and apple and others are getting on board with nfc , they are looking for some global standards , " he told news agency afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong and japan already have smart card transit payment systems in place winning over consumers still , some analysts suggest taking a step back - and looking beyond the buzz surrounding the " tap and pay " phenomenon when it comes to mobile phones . " it 's a move in the right direction , " said christophe uzureau , research director of banking and investment services at gartner research , " but we tend to forget the big picture . " uzureau told deutsche welle that mobile providers are keen to seize upon the potential of nfc-enabled phones - but the industry is creating " a lot of hype . " consumers in hong kong , with its " octopus card , " and japan , which has " suica , " are accustomed to using prepaid , contactless means for transit .
but replacing cards with phones is easier said than done . " this only works if all consumers have nfc-enabled phones , and if they are confident in using them , " uzureau said .
" and right now , most consumers are not . " that means mobile operators must convince their customers to increase their usage of nfc-enabled phones - and to do so , they must show them that the chips allow for better financial access and control . but companies might have trouble persuading customers to change their habits .
despite what uzureau called a " perfect supply-side arrangement , " in japan , cash-centric consumers there have been slow to latch on . " on the demand side , most customers do n't see the point of nfc-enabled mobile phones , " he said , adding that having a bit more speed at the point of sale still does n't outweigh the benefits of secure cash transactions . " it 's not going to replace the wallet , " uzureau said . author : amanda price -lrb- afp -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the redd scheme aims to reward developing nations for preserving their forests . a pact on reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries - known to negotiators as redd or " reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation " - appears to be close to an international agreement at the un framework convention on climate change in cancun .
" there 's a really strong chance that we will get a solid agreement , " said rane cortez , the senior forest carbon advisor for the nature conservancy environmental group .
" there is a lot of consensus coming on the text , but we need a few tweaks to get everyone onboard , " she added .
the programme was launched in september 2008 and consists largely of offering financial incentives to developing countries such as brazil , indonesia or the democratic republic of congo to save their tropical forests .
deforestation accounts for almost one-fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions , which is more than the entire global transport sector causes .
co2 released into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels like oil and coal can be absorbed and stored by forests until the forest dies .
yet even though that 's a well established fact , deforestation is continuing at a rapid pace .
each year , an estimated 13 million hectares of forest - mainly rain forest - is destroyed .
that 's equivalent to the area of a country like greece .
bildunterschrift : sources of greenhouse gasses - deforestation accounts for 17 percent of global emissions a simple concept the principle behind redd is simple .
the idea is to reward developing nations that preserve their forests , boost the carbon stock , and have sustainable forestry management .
currently , forests in developing countries are often cleared to make way for plantations , agricultural land or livestock .
in order to give people there the chance to make a different living , developed countries would under the redd scheme have to pay for the environmental services which these forests perform if they are left intact .
a fair deal , one might think - not least in view of the fact that developed nations are historically responsible for the ever-increasing co2 in the atmosphere - and thus for global climate change .
since a hectare of a palm oil plantation or arable land brings in more money than a hectare of rainforest , compensation should be agreed on an international level , according to the reasoning behind the redd concept .
bildunterschrift : cumulative co2 emissions -lrb- 1850-2000 -rrb- show usa and europe have been the biggest poluters money money money but even if it sounds like a logical solution , the simplicity ends when money comes into play .
what form this compensation should take and who should finance it are in dispute .
some negotiators say that only public money should go to redd .
but others say it is more realistic to set up a market approach that would allow nations to swap assistance for credits in emission reduction goals .
sha zukang , the un undersecretary for economic and social affairs , said funding so far has been insufficient even though the forest issue was critical for the " protection of the environment , social development and the fight against poverty . "
developed nations have pledged some 4.5 billion dollars for redd .
the leading financial contributor is norway , which among other projects has committed to provide one billion dollars for indonesia which plans a two-year moratorium on new clearing of natural forests and peat lands from 2011 .
what is a forest ?
but even before negotiators get to the sticky issue of money , " the debate about the redd agreement begins with the definition of the term ' forest ' , " said christoph thies of greenpeace .
to date no agreement has been reached in the negotiations : some also want plantations to count as forests , while others think the term should only refer to primary forests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace does n't want plantations to be counted as " forests " " for us at greenpeace it ' quite clear : a forest is a natural ecosystem that is dominated by trees - but not a plantation .
a tree plantation follows the principles of agriculture and is more of a tree farm for us , " thies said .
a tree farm or a plantation hardly stores any co2 .
even worse : to make room for the plantation , rain forest has to be cleared - and in this way co2 and methane is released into the atmosphere .
if this were rewarded in a redd agreement , thies thinks it would lose all credibility .
who does the forest belong to ?
worldwide , over a billion people live off the forest - many of them belong to indigenous people that have not only lived in the forest , but also from the forest .
the norwegian rainforest foundation wants to support and strengthen precisely this population , said lars loevold .
he said that involving indigenous peoples in the debate was not just an ethical question but a strategic decision .
" we are 100 percent convinced that forest protection will only work if we recognize the traditional communal rights of these people , " loevold said .
" for centuries they have maintained and protected the forests .
what looks to us in the west like untouched rain forest , is in fact the result of a very complex ecosystem within which humans have also played a role for centuries .
in this life cycle , a richer biodiversity has been created than if no people had lived there , " loevold added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies show that indigenous people can look after forest better than national parks local administration is more successful than national parks new research supports loevold 's argument that forests which are managed by indigenous peoples and local communities are better protected and have a greater biodiversity than , for example , national parks .
to enable people who actually live from and with the forests to have their voice heard at international climate negotiations , the norwegian rainforest foundation have paid the travel costs of indigenous representatives from all around the world .
the demands of indigenous peoples have become an essential part of climate negotiations .
the point for the director of the norwegian rainforest foundation at redd negotiations in cancun is that the forests should not just degenerate into a short-term investment .
" until now it has been profitable to destroy the rain forest .
some earned money with deforestation , but they did n't have to pay for the costs of the destruction .
the redd agreement is about finding mechanisms which reward people who protect forests , and punish those who destroy the forest , " said lars loevold .
this issue is being addressed by the 194 member countries at the un climate summit in cancun , mexico .
an agreement seems within reach .

now , a jewish museum is being built near the site . the construction of warsaw 's jewish museum is currently the most extensive cultural project in poland , though few in neighboring germany even know about it . the museum is being built in what was the warsaw ghetto during the period of nazi occupation .
nearby is the memorial to the victims of the warsaw ghetto uprising , in front of which former german chancellor willy brandt spontaneously knelt 40 years ago , on december 7 , 1970 .
it was an unprecedented act of humility that would become a milestone in polish-german ties . moral obligation to support museum plans for the jewish museum began in 1994 when then german president roman herzog got behind the project and oversaw the launch of a development foundation to fund it .
though the idea for the museum initially came from poland , the country lacked the necessary resources at that time . " roman herzog suddenly endorsed he idea , " said josef thesing , chairman of the development foundation .
" our foundation was started in order to make the idea a reality .
if we had n't managed to secure funding from the beginning , it never would have happened . " so far , the foundation has managed to acquire some 6 million euros -lrb- about $ 8 million -rrb- for the museum project ; by its completion in 2013 , costs are expected to total 90 million euros . thesing added that germany had a moral responsibility to invest in the warsaw museum . " i think that we can demonstrate that there is a different germany now , " he said .
" and , together with poles - who are now our friends in the european community - we can work through our past instead of denying it and look , with our unique perspective , toward a common future . " bildunterschrift : chancellor willy brandt 's humble gesture at the memorial to the victims of the warsaw uprising in 1970 was unplanned , but went down in history rich jewish tradition in poland the path to the future leads first through the past .
few poles are aware that the first known reference to their country was made in hebrew .
poland 's jewish roots go back a thousand years , according to auschwitz survivor marian turski . " we have no jews in poland - almost no jews .
the jews are present in history , they 're present in literature but there 's a vacuum in society , hence , the interest in those topics , " said turski .
" this is why we estimate that this will be one of the most-visited museums in poland . " it was marian turski who conceived the idea for the museum in the early 1990s .
he chairs poland 's jewish historical institute and is now chairman of the jewish museum as well . for turski , there was only one possible location for the museum : the site of the warsaw ghetto and willy brandt 's 1970 gesture of reconciliation . " for a long time , as the chairman of the jewish historical institute , i was the owner of this land , " said turski .
" it was obvious to everybody that there was no better and no more appropriate place than this to build the museum . " bildunterschrift : jewish life is slowly returning to warsaw turning point in understanding history it was n't until a year and a half ago that construction finally began , under the auspices of museum director jerzy halbersztadt .
he said its completion , planned for 2013 , would be a new landmark in the often difficult relationship between germany and poland . " the construction of this museum is a very important turning point , " he said .
" it can not transform the whole country , but it will be a sign of the changes that took place in the last 20 years of democratic development . " the museum wo n't focus solely on the holocaust , but will span from the very beginning of poland 's jewish roots to the present day . that includes the kielce pogrom of 1946 , when townspeople and officials in the polish town turned against the jewish community , killing around 40 people .
the anti-semitic sentiment that sprung up in the late 1960s is also to be addressed , as is the gradual return of judaism in post-communist poland . " our mission is to reach those who do n't understand what it means in the contemporary world to have an open dialogue , revisit history , tell the truth about history whether it 's nice or not , " said halbersztadt .
" those who are not convinced today will be convinced tomorrow , i believe that . " the museum director is expecting some half a million visitors per year to come and contribute to a new understanding of history in the country . author : wolfram stahl -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

assange , wanted on allegations including rape , says foreign powers are leaning upon the swedes . a lawyer for wikileaks founder julian assange said on monday that his client was arranging to meet with british police , who have received a request from sweden for his extradition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us attorney general eric holder promised ' significant action against wikileaks " we are in the process of making arrangements to meet with the police by consent in order to facilitate the taking of that question and answer that is needed , " said mark stephens .
the lawyer added that the interview was expected to happen in the " foreseeable future " but could not give an exact timescale .
the 39-year-old is wanted on allegations of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion .
london 's metropolitan police received an arrest warrant earlier on monday , a police source told the news agency reuters .
australian assange , whose wikileaks website has caused an international sensation over the release of secret us diplomatic cables , denies the allegations .
the extradition request came after swedish prosecutors reopened an investigation into the allegations , being made by two swedish women .
assange 's swedish lawyer said his client believed sweden was being influenced by foreign powers after the november release of the cables , some of which are politically sensitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the latest cable revelations are politically sensitive authorities in sweden said they had provided their british colleagues with all the information they had requested , following apparent legal hitches .
significant prosecution authorized us attorney general eric holder said that " significant " action was being authorized by the government in washington for putting the country 's national security at risk .
swiss authorities on monday shut down a bank account held by assange with the swiss post office 's banking group , claiming he had provided false information .
in france , industry minister eric besson demanded that wikileaks be banned from french web servers being used by the site .
however , a french judge declined to force web provider ovh to go ahead with the closure .
in october , wikileaks angered the pentagon over its release of nearly 400,000 classified documents on the iraq war , which assange said showed 15,000 more civilian deaths than previously thought . in july , the site posted some 77,000 secret us files on the conflict in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 07.12.2010 less bureaucracy , more efficiency as europe ponders aid future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid agencies worry about whether the money will continue to flow diverse and often contradictory interests between donor nations and aid organizations were on ample display at the european development days .
and no one seems to know exactly what role the european union will play . the fifth edition of the european development days , a two-day eu-sponsored conference in brussels that brings together representatives of governments , humanitarian ngos and others , was the first to take place after the creation of the european external action service , the eu equivalent of a foreign ministry .
not surprisingly , much of the focus of the discussions was what impact increasing eu coordination and involvement would have on the aid handed out by some of the world 's wealthiest countries to some of its poorest .
no one seemed particularly optimistic .
deputy chairman of the africa commission erastus mwencha , for example , said the body had too little power , asking for instance why the eu failed to have single coordinated positions at groups like the world trade organization .
representatives of aid groups , meanwhile , said they feared that more power in brussels would simply bring increased bureaucracy .
bildunterschrift : investing in education pays big long-term dividends " again there are also problems with red tape , " said philomena johnson , the director of the charity group caritas in ghana .
" what we call long processes and procedures that make it impossible for developing countries to make optimal benefits from the resources that come to them to reduce poverty . "
and the individual countries in the eu are also wary about handing over control of what have previously been national aid initiatives .
" as a member state with quite a lot of money and thereby quite a lot of responsibility , i have to see who is accountable , " said swedish development minister gunilla carlsson .
" that 's why it has been hard to devote all the money to brussels .
it has been rather anonymous , it 's really bureaucratic , and also as a donor , it 's very hard to have influence . "
carlsson was speaking from a position of moral high ground .
sweden is one of only five countries that have achieved aid targets formulated 40 years ago .
0.7 percent - not enough or too much ?
bildunterschrift : this ambulance is part of the millennium project , but larger aims are n't being met in 1970 , the un general assembly decided that the world 's wealthy countries should be devoting 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product to aid .
that goal was confirmed by the un millennium project , and the target date was set at 2015 .
the eu and its member states provide some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.6 billion -rrb- in aid annually , but in terms of percentage that figure does not come even close to the target .
oxfam says germany , for instance , spent only 0.35 percent of its 2009 gross domestic product on developmental assistance , slightly less than the year before , and is n't scheduled to meet the un goal until 2027 .
eu development commissioner andris piebalgs used the brussels event to remind eu members of their obligations .
" the real challenge is how europeans will use the 0.7 percent so that it really has the impact our taxpayers expect , " piebalgs said .
" our taxpayers expect that there is a visible change in the conditions of life in developing countries . "
but mentioning expectations and measureable effects also raises the sensitive issue of whether developmental aid truly works .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the money never gets to the poor aid , according to a famous quip attributed to british economist peter bauer , is " an excellent method for transferring money from poor people in rich countries to rich people in poor countries . "
and earlier this year , the free-market washington think-tank center for global development published a report claiming that the 0.7 percent figure was arbitrary , and that less money , if well spent , would do more to benefit poor people in , for instance , africa .
" the assumptions that in africa all aid becomes investment and all investment becomes growth have no empirical support , " the report 's authors concluded .
" the evidence is very strong that africa 's growth performance has been weak not from a lack of capital per se , but from low productivity of that capital . "
in other words , the problem is less about giving more money than about ensuring that money is used to generate lasting improvements .
for this reason , germany has been placing more and more emphasis on linking aid to good governance in recipient countries .
quid pro quo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel is among those who say that money is only as good as the results it yields although idealistic notions of human solidarity are one factor that motivates developmental aid , another is simple self-interest .
countries rich in natural resources such as libya , algeria and the central asia republics are increasingly becoming a focus of both german and european aid initiatives .
on a slightest less morally ambiguous note , most european countries see aid as a means of encouraging stability in poorer countries and thus a vastly cheaper alternative to military interventions .
germany 's development minister dirk niebel recently made this point with reference to afghanistan .
" we assume that , if we want to bring our soldiers home , our efforts have to put a clear emphasis on civilian support , " niebel told reporters .
" the citizens of afghanistan need a true peace dividend .
they have to see that our effort clearly betters their personal living conditions .
that will have on an effect on regions that are n't so secure and others where we would hope to see some quick improvements . "
this " butter versus guns " ideal is , of course , anything but new , but it does underscore a point that increasing numbers of european and world leaders are making .
where aid is concerned , delivery counts every bit as much as amount .

deutsche welle spoke with tom kirchmaier of the london school of economics about the decision . eurozone finance ministers met on monday evening to discuss increasing the emergency fund but ultimately decided it was big enough .
is it ?
at the moment it is enough .
but the problem is a different one .
you arrange a fund like this to send a signal to the market that there is no point in speculating against the currency .
so by not increasing the fund , the eurozone finance ministers send a signal that there might actually be a point in speculating against larger countries like spain .
so in that way , they made the markets less stable , not more .
you do n't think markets are convinced yet that the debt crisis is contained ?
the funds are enough to support countries like greece and portugal , they are not enough to support countries like spain , or belgium , or italy .
it 's an arithmetic game , and you come up with a number that 's around one-and-a-half trillion , or two trillion euros and you come up with a guarantee where you can say , this is rock solid .
the number is just so big that it becomes clear to everybody that a speculator ca n't win .
another idea that had been floated prior to monday evening 's meeting , but was then not discussed , was that of bonds issued jointly by the eurozone countries .
is that a good idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the efsf is not big enough for markets to take it seriously " it 's a good idea in principle , but it 's very far-fetched politically .
one of the problems with the eurozone - and it 's a problem from birth - is that monetary policy is done by the european central bank , but fiscal policy is done by each of the member states .
and that creates almost perverse incentives for the individual member states to over-consume , which is what they have done .
one of the ways to solve this problem is to centralize fiscal policy , i.e. to make more fiscal decisions in brussels .
if you launch a euro bond , you essentially do exactly that because you then unify all the risks which you have in the eurozone .
for it to work , you have to have a centralized fiscal policy .
interestingly , china and sovereign wealth funds are very keen for europe to issue these bonds because they would be highly liquid and a good alternative to a us treasury bond .
both the bigger emergency fund and the euro bonds are supposed to convince markets of the " irreversibility " of the euro , as luxemberg 's prime minister jean claude juncker put it .
is the euro in fact " irreversible " or can you imagine a scenario in which this common currency would fold ?
nothing is irreversible .
it would unravel the minute that germany in particular were to make the tiniest suggestion about leaving .
it would be possible to reverse the euro , but it would have catastrophic consequences .
on one hand , you would see a bank run with weaker countries - everybody would try to get their money and put it in a german bank account and that would lead to an immediate collapse of the banking system in that country .
it would be catastrophic for the european idea , for these weak economies , and if germany were to decide to leave , it would not be good for germany either because the currency would appreciate dramatically .
next week at a eu summit , leaders are expected to agree on permanent eurozone rescue mechanisms , since the current emergency fund expires in 2013 .
what could or what should these permanent mechanisms look like ?
the issue of " permanent " only makes sense if the fund is large and credible enough .
at the moment i do n't see that we are getting any closer to making a credible long-term commitment to stability .
the only really credible commitment would be to integrate fiscal policy further .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 07.12.2010 no real breakthrough as 5 + 1 talks on iran end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 5 + 1 and iran returned to negotiations after 13 months nuclear talks between the 5 + 1 group and iran have ended in geneva with little sign of progress .
although the two sides have agreed to meet again , the sticking point is the demand for iran to suspend uranium enrichment . the negotiations between un security council heavyweights the united states , russia , china , france and britain along with germany - the so called 5 + 1 group - with an iranian delegation were the first in 13 months .
the negotiation teams , headed by eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton for the 5 + 1 and iran 's secretary of the national security council saaed jalili , agreed that a further round of talks would take place at the end of january in turkey . however , iran has already made it clear that it will not discuss its uranium enrichment program , which it insists is for peaceful purposes while western powers fear the fuel would be used for nuclear warheads .
at the last meeting in october 2009 , the 5 + 1 agreed to a proposal that would have allowed iran to ship a major portion of the uranium they had enriched to 3.5 percent to an external destination to undergo further enrichment and to be converted into fuel rods for the small tehran research reactor .
that would remove the potential threat of weapons-grade material being siphoned off within iran for military purposes .
iran originally agreed to this proposal but later reneged on it , having scored a major point by having the 5 + 1 tacitly agree to iran engaging in enrichment , a practice forbidden by security council resolutions .
then in may this year , brazil and turkey tried to re-broker the deal but this attempt was scuppered by the united states which claimed higher levels of uranium had been enriched in iran since the original offer in 2009 and that the new export deal would leave too much material behind in iran .
iran 's stance on enrichment levels proving obstructive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's saeed jalili will present a similar stance to that of 2009 " if iran agrees to suspend further enrichment , up to the 17.5 percent which it has already stated it was pressing ahead with , then there are a whole series of economic incentives which are on the table , " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , told deutsche welle .
" if , on the other hand , as ahmadinejad has said , iran does not want to address the issue of enrichment or make any concessions or compromises on that account , there will be no alternative at this stage but the consideration of further punitive sanctions . "
chances of reaching any agreements or compromises seem very bleak at this time , khonsari added , but there are clear signs that because economic and other pressures are making life very difficult for the iranian regime , ahmadinejad may be looking for a way out without losing face .
" for ahmadinejad and his supporters there are two main reasons for an engagement with washington , " professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" first , they know that an understanding with the us would be popular , particularly among the educated youth and the business community .
the second reason is that ahmadinejad and the political leadership feel that the regime is under serious threat by the united states , and only by the united states . "
perthes said iran 's threat perception , and its deep suspicion of us intentions , are often underestimated in washington despite these issues being driving factors in iranian politics .
while the regime elite still appears to be divided over the prospect of a full-scale rapprochement with the united states , it is believed many share this fear of the us and there is a real desire to avoid further isolation .
with this in mind , the 5 + 1 may consider lessened sanctions - along with other incentives - as a way to achieve progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has so far dismissed the western incentives incentives on offer but tehran remains steadfast " the western powers along with russia and china are offering iran lessened sanctions , the chance to fix world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership in return for explanations of what has gone on in regard to tehran 's nuclear program and realistic assurances that it has no military nuclear intentions , " simon henderson , director of the gulf and energy policy program at the washington institute for near east policy , told deutsche welle .
" the best hope for agreement lies on the possibility of reaching an acceptable compromise regarding the shipment of already enriched uranium from iran to an outside destination , " khonsari said .
" if agreement could be reached on the quantity , and there is a minute chance given past turkish and brazilian mediation that this is possible , there may still be a way out though it will be very difficult . "
there were concerns that the geneva negotiations would be made even more problematic by the latest wikileaks revelations which exposed the level of international concern and distrust of iran , especially among its persian gulf neighbors , and the consideration of many that military action is the best option when it comes to stopping tehran 's nuclear program .
however , experts believe there is little new information in the wikileaks revelations and that all the parties involved in the talks with iran are already aware of the delicate nature of relations .
wikileaks revelations unlikely to add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks revelations on iran are unlikely to affect talks " there is nothing in the wikileaks revelations that the islamic authorities have been unaware of , " khonsari said .
" the iranian regime understands that matters will be ratcheted up if they are unable to reach an agreement and they are aware that , irrespective of all factors , the likelihood of military confrontation is a very real possibility . "
khonsari believes the consensus among iran 's opponents , that confronting an ambitious iran with all its downsides might be a cheaper option than living with a nuclear iran - as highlighted in the wikileaks cables - might possibly alter tehran 's previous calculations .
those gambled on the belief that the americans would never dare to embark on another military adventure in the aftermath of the iraq and afghanistan conflicts .
options running out if current talks fail " the 5 + 1 diplomats think that sanctions will eventually work , " said simon henderson .
" however , it 's hard to say what iran will do next in response . iran might calculate that if it tests a bomb , there would be some condemnation but then the world would have to get used to a new status quo , much in the same way as it did after the indian and pakistani tests in 1998 . "
mehrdad khonsari said the general consensus is that ahmadinejad wants to escalate matters and essentially go to the very brink of war in a bid to shore up his own leadership , which has been under pressure since the opposition protests in 2009 .
" it is believed that ahmadinejad feels a military conflict might help him consolidate his position inside the country , " he concluded .
" in such a case , his major aim is to buy time as it is unlikely that anything positive can be achieved as a result of these negotiations . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 07.12.2010 is the eu emergency fund big enough ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb is in charge of monetary but not fiscal policy eu finance ministers said monday that they would not be taking new measures to tackle the current debt crisis in the bloc .
deutsche welle spoke with tom kirchmaier of the london school of economics about the decision . eurozone finance ministers met on monday evening to discuss increasing the emergency fund but ultimately decided it was big enough .
is it ?
at the moment it is enough .
but the problem is a different one .
you arrange a fund like this to send a signal to the market that there is no point in speculating against the currency .
so by not increasing the fund , the eurozone finance ministers send a signal that there might actually be a point in speculating against larger countries like spain .
so in that way , they made the markets less stable , not more .
you do n't think markets are convinced yet that the debt crisis is contained ?
the funds are enough to support countries like greece and portugal , they are not enough to support countries like spain , or belgium , or italy .
it 's an arithmetic game , and you come up with a number that 's around one-and-a-half trillion , or two trillion euros and you come up with a guarantee where you can say , this is rock solid .
the number is just so big that it becomes clear to everybody that a speculator ca n't win .
another idea that had been floated prior to monday evening 's meeting , but was then not discussed , was that of bonds issued jointly by the eurozone countries .
is that a good idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the efsf is not big enough for markets to take it seriously " it 's a good idea in principle , but it 's very far-fetched politically .
one of the problems with the eurozone - and it 's a problem from birth - is that monetary policy is done by the european central bank , but fiscal policy is done by each of the member states .
and that creates almost perverse incentives for the individual member states to over-consume , which is what they have done .
one of the ways to solve this problem is to centralize fiscal policy , i.e. to make more fiscal decisions in brussels .
if you launch a euro bond , you essentially do exactly that because you then unify all the risks which you have in the eurozone .
for it to work , you have to have a centralized fiscal policy .
interestingly , china and sovereign wealth funds are very keen for europe to issue these bonds because they would be highly liquid and a good alternative to a us treasury bond .
both the bigger emergency fund and the euro bonds are supposed to convince markets of the " irreversibility " of the euro , as luxemberg 's prime minister jean claude juncker put it .
is the euro in fact " irreversible " or can you imagine a scenario in which this common currency would fold ?
nothing is irreversible .
it would unravel the minute that germany in particular were to make the tiniest suggestion about leaving .
it would be possible to reverse the euro , but it would have catastrophic consequences .
on one hand , you would see a bank run with weaker countries - everybody would try to get their money and put it in a german bank account and that would lead to an immediate collapse of the banking system in that country .
it would be catastrophic for the european idea , for these weak economies , and if germany were to decide to leave , it would not be good for germany either because the currency would appreciate dramatically .
next week at a eu summit , leaders are expected to agree on permanent eurozone rescue mechanisms , since the current emergency fund expires in 2013 .
what could or what should these permanent mechanisms look like ?
the issue of " permanent " only makes sense if the fund is large and credible enough .
at the moment i do n't see that we are getting any closer to making a credible long-term commitment to stability .
the only really credible commitment would be to integrate fiscal policy further .

the eu ’ s foreign policy chief catherine ashton said the talks were detailed and substantive .
the meeting aimed to fix the framework for " several sessions " of future negotiations , with the next round of talks now planned for the end of january in istanbul .
the two-day meeting comes 14 months after the last attempt to temper iran 's uranium enrichment drive and clarify its nuclear capabilities .
the so-called 5 + 1 group of the united states , britain , france , russia , china and germany are worried iran could use its uranium enrichment plants to make fuel for warheads .
iran insists that it is seeking nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
before the talks started , iran made statements that their right to seek nuclear technology was " non-negotiable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says enrichment facilities like this , are just used for peaceful purposes however after repeated breakdowns in international inspections and the build up of uranium enrichment , western countries suspect iran is engaging in a covert program to build nuclear weapons .

in brussels on tuesday , eu monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn expressed confidence that this money would not be lost .
" i 'm confident that ireland , with its smart , competent , and stubborn people - and its prospects of recovering -lsb- from -rsb- this situation - will overcome the current challenges . "
tough budget while the final stamp of approval for the bailout loan was being given in brussels , the irish government in dublin announced deep cuts in its 2011 budget .
tax hikes and spending cuts are expected to save the country around 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- .

the scale of this adjustment is demanding but it demonstrates the seriousness of our intent , " said finance minister brian lenihan in an address to ireland 's lower house of parliament .
the budget cuts were necessary to secure the bailout from the eu and the international monetary fund .
tapping the reserves ireland 's bailout comes from the 750 billion euro crisis fund established earlier this year after greece required similar aid .
now , the question is still being asked : will ireland be the only country to access the fund , or will portugal , spain or even italy need support soon ?
and if so , will 750 billion euros be enough ?
for spanish finance minister elena salgado , the problem simply does not exist .
“ the volume of the crisis mechanism seems reasonable to us , ” she said .
but from her , these words seem logical ; spain is trying to soothe the markets .
belgian finance minister didier reynders , who chaired the talks , is more cautious , saying debates on the size of the bailout mechanism will likely continue .

now , a jewish museum is being built near the site . the construction of warsaw 's jewish museum is currently the most extensive cultural project in poland , though few in neighboring germany even know about it . the museum is being built in what was the warsaw ghetto during the period of nazi occupation .
nearby is the memorial to the victims of the warsaw ghetto uprising , in front of which former german chancellor willy brandt spontaneously knelt 40 years ago , on december 7 , 1970 .
it was an unprecedented act of humility that would become a milestone in polish-german ties . moral obligation to support museum plans for the jewish museum began in 1994 when then german president roman herzog got behind the project and oversaw the launch of a development foundation to fund it .
though the idea for the museum initially came from poland , the country lacked the necessary resources at that time . " roman herzog suddenly endorsed he idea , " said josef thesing , chairman of the development foundation .
" our foundation was started in order to make the idea a reality .
if we had n't managed to secure funding from the beginning , it never would have happened . " so far , the foundation has managed to acquire some 6 million euros -lrb- about $ 8 million -rrb- for the museum project ; by its completion in 2013 , costs are expected to total 90 million euros . thesing added that germany had a moral responsibility to invest in the warsaw museum . " i think that we can demonstrate that there is a different germany now , " he said .
" and , together with poles - who are now our friends in the european community - we can work through our past instead of denying it and look , with our unique perspective , toward a common future . " bildunterschrift : chancellor willy brandt 's humble gesture at the memorial to the victims of the warsaw uprising in 1970 was unplanned , but went down in history rich jewish tradition in poland the path to the future leads first through the past .
few poles are aware that the first known reference to their country was made in hebrew .
poland 's jewish roots go back a thousand years , according to auschwitz survivor marian turski . " we have no jews in poland - almost no jews .
the jews are present in history , they 're present in literature but there 's a vacuum in society , hence , the interest in those topics , " said turski .
" this is why we estimate that this will be one of the most-visited museums in poland . " it was marian turski who conceived the idea for the museum in the early 1990s .
he chairs poland 's jewish historical institute and is now chairman of the jewish museum as well . for turski , there was only one possible location for the museum : the site of the warsaw ghetto and willy brandt 's 1970 gesture of reconciliation . " for a long time , as the chairman of the jewish historical institute , i was the owner of this land , " said turski .
" it was obvious to everybody that there was no better and no more appropriate place than this to build the museum . " bildunterschrift : jewish life is slowly returning to warsaw turning point in understanding history it was n't until a year and a half ago that construction finally began , under the auspices of museum director jerzy halbersztadt .
he said its completion , planned for 2013 , would be a new landmark in the often difficult relationship between germany and poland . " the construction of this museum is a very important turning point , " he said .
" it can not transform the whole country , but it will be a sign of the changes that took place in the last 20 years of democratic development . " the museum wo n't focus solely on the holocaust , but will span from the very beginning of poland 's jewish roots to the present day . that includes the kielce pogrom of 1946 , when townspeople and officials in the polish town turned against the jewish community , killing around 40 people .
the anti-semitic sentiment that sprung up in the late 1960s is also to be addressed , as is the gradual return of judaism in post-communist poland . " our mission is to reach those who do n't understand what it means in the contemporary world to have an open dialogue , revisit history , tell the truth about history whether it 's nice or not , " said halbersztadt .
" those who are not convinced today will be convinced tomorrow , i believe that . " the museum director is expecting some half a million visitors per year to come and contribute to a new understanding of history in the country . author : wolfram stahl -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but know-how , often protected by patents , is trickling way too slowly from industrialized nations to poorer regions . every few years , world leaders get together at high-profile conferences to discuss ways to reduce global warming and save the planet . the 2010 united nations climate change conference is currently being held in cancun , mexico .
but the talks are taking place amid low expectations , after the disappointment of the copenhagen summit last year – which memorably failed to produce any binding agreements .
this came as a particular blow to the g77 countries , which have in fact expanded to 131 mostly developing nations .
their demands include a relaxation , if not a general lifting , of patent protection laws governing renewable energies .
their argument is that it is first and foremost the industrialized nations that are responsible for climate change , while the poorer nations pay the price for the wealthier countries ' mistakes .
therefore industrialized nations should at least give them the benefit of their green energy know-how .
sharing their patents would go some way to paying off their climate debts , the g77 countries say .
the patent imbalance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patents get in the way of technology transfer between developed and developing nations according to a new study compiled by the un environment program , 80 percent of all patented innovations in the area of clean energy technologies are registered by companies in japan , germany , us , south korea , britain and france .
the report , which examines the role of patents in combating climate change , was jointly conducted with the european patent office and the international centre for trade and sustainable development .
" the fact that northern countries keep their expertise on regenerative energies to themselves , puts the south at an additional disadvantage , " says aileen kwa from south center , an intergovernmental policy think tank of developing countries .
as a climate-friendly , affordable alternative to fossil fuels , clean energy is key to the future of the developing world , and allows people to access energy supplies without having to rely on major providers .
moreover , it decentralizes the energy supply .
in countries where the majority of the population is rural , solar panels and geothermal heat pumps installed in individual homes are energy efficient solutions for people who would otherwise go without .
one problem , however , is the frequent lack of local expertise necessary not only to install the technology , but also to maintain it .
not only does the equipment therefore need to be imported – the know-how does to .
if patents are a factor , the whole process soon becomes very costly .
but it 's not only developing nations that have some catching-up to do on the clean energy front .
green technology is still very much in its infancy in croatia , for example , although grassroots projects are slowly beginning to gather momentum .
even in industrialized countries , it seems , introduction of climate protection measures comes with a high price tag . popular misconceptions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in cancun , debate is centering around mobilizing funds and technology transfer to cope with climate change one obstacle to globalized climate control is the general ignorance in the developed world of what exactly the developing world needs .
" indigenous knowledge on protecting natural resources and alternative energy supplies often exists , " points out kwa , stressing that all that 's then needed is a transfer of technology that can be implemented locally .
rainer osterwalder from the european patent office agrees , but says there 's plenty of room for improvement .
" the technology transfer from north to south is still unsatisfactory , " he says .
" one thing that should n't be forgotten is that emerging economies , and china in particular , are increasingly active when it comes to domestic innovation in the area of regenerative energy . "
" patents neither create problems nor solve them , " he says .
in his opinion , more urgent problems include inadequate infrastructure in the developing world ; the lack of an existing market for clean technologies and the lack of opportunity to build one .
adding to the problem is the popular misconception that patents are internationally valid .
in fact , if a patent is n't registered with the patent office of a specific country , then it does n't exist .
" a french company does n't necessarily register the patent for its photovoltaic technology in angola , say , if it believes that there 's no market for such a system in that country , " explains osterwalder .
in developing countries , however , few people are aware that many technologies are not actually patented in their country .
a spanner in the works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , local expertise is underestimated critics believe that ultimately , patent protection is a major stumbling block in fighting climate change .
in recent years , the european patent office has complained about the ‘ global patent warming , ' stressing that the increasing number of patent applications is slowing down the issue of patents .
the multitude of patent applications does not mean that the world is coming up with more innovations - rather , what is happening is that inventors and companies that already hold patents in one country are lining up at many other national patent offices to get patents for other markets .
ultimately , the purpose of securing a patent is to throw a spanner in the works of rival development .
the patents issue is one that results in the developing world feeling as though it has been left to deal with climate change by itself , by the very countries that are mainly responsible for it .
but industrialized nations retaliate by citing the free market and the necessary protection of intellectual property – and , needless to say , their own economic superiority . whether or not it is justifiable to privatize expertise in the field of regenerative energy is a question that will no doubt be raised at the current summit in cancun .

but know-how , often protected by patents , is trickling way too slowly from industrialized nations to poorer regions . every few years , world leaders get together at high-profile conferences to discuss ways to reduce global warming and save the planet . the 2010 united nations climate change conference is currently being held in cancun , mexico .
but the talks are taking place amid low expectations , after the disappointment of the copenhagen summit last year – which memorably failed to produce any binding agreements .
this came as a particular blow to the g77 countries , which have in fact expanded to 131 mostly developing nations .
their demands include a relaxation , if not a general lifting , of patent protection laws governing renewable energies .
their argument is that it is first and foremost the industrialized nations that are responsible for climate change , while the poorer nations pay the price for the wealthier countries ' mistakes .
therefore industrialized nations should at least give them the benefit of their green energy know-how .
sharing their patents would go some way to paying off their climate debts , the g77 countries say .
the patent imbalance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patents get in the way of technology transfer between developed and developing nations according to a new study compiled by the un environment program , 80 percent of all patented innovations in the area of clean energy technologies are registered by companies in japan , germany , us , south korea , britain and france .
the report , which examines the role of patents in combating climate change , was jointly conducted with the european patent office and the international centre for trade and sustainable development .
" the fact that northern countries keep their expertise on regenerative energies to themselves , puts the south at an additional disadvantage , " says aileen kwa from south center , an intergovernmental policy think tank of developing countries .
as a climate-friendly , affordable alternative to fossil fuels , clean energy is key to the future of the developing world , and allows people to access energy supplies without having to rely on major providers .
moreover , it decentralizes the energy supply .
in countries where the majority of the population is rural , solar panels and geothermal heat pumps installed in individual homes are energy efficient solutions for people who would otherwise go without .
one problem , however , is the frequent lack of local expertise necessary not only to install the technology , but also to maintain it .
not only does the equipment therefore need to be imported – the know-how does to .
if patents are a factor , the whole process soon becomes very costly .
but it 's not only developing nations that have some catching-up to do on the clean energy front .
green technology is still very much in its infancy in croatia , for example , although grassroots projects are slowly beginning to gather momentum .
even in industrialized countries , it seems , introduction of climate protection measures comes with a high price tag . popular misconceptions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in cancun , debate is centering around mobilizing funds and technology transfer to cope with climate change one obstacle to globalized climate control is the general ignorance in the developed world of what exactly the developing world needs .
" indigenous knowledge on protecting natural resources and alternative energy supplies often exists , " points out kwa , stressing that all that 's then needed is a transfer of technology that can be implemented locally .
rainer osterwalder from the european patent office agrees , but says there 's plenty of room for improvement .
" the technology transfer from north to south is still unsatisfactory , " he says .
" one thing that should n't be forgotten is that emerging economies , and china in particular , are increasingly active when it comes to domestic innovation in the area of regenerative energy . "
" patents neither create problems nor solve them , " he says .
in his opinion , more urgent problems include inadequate infrastructure in the developing world ; the lack of an existing market for clean technologies and the lack of opportunity to build one .
adding to the problem is the popular misconception that patents are internationally valid .
in fact , if a patent is n't registered with the patent office of a specific country , then it does n't exist .
" a french company does n't necessarily register the patent for its photovoltaic technology in angola , say , if it believes that there 's no market for such a system in that country , " explains osterwalder .
in developing countries , however , few people are aware that many technologies are not actually patented in their country .
a spanner in the works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , local expertise is underestimated critics believe that ultimately , patent protection is a major stumbling block in fighting climate change .
in recent years , the european patent office has complained about the ‘ global patent warming , ' stressing that the increasing number of patent applications is slowing down the issue of patents .
the multitude of patent applications does not mean that the world is coming up with more innovations - rather , what is happening is that inventors and companies that already hold patents in one country are lining up at many other national patent offices to get patents for other markets .
ultimately , the purpose of securing a patent is to throw a spanner in the works of rival development .
the patents issue is one that results in the developing world feeling as though it has been left to deal with climate change by itself , by the very countries that are mainly responsible for it .
but industrialized nations retaliate by citing the free market and the necessary protection of intellectual property – and , needless to say , their own economic superiority . whether or not it is justifiable to privatize expertise in the field of regenerative energy is a question that will no doubt be raised at the current summit in cancun .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 07.12.2010 chinese artists find new creative freedom in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist duan yafeng specialises in brightly-colored collages berlin has long been a magnet for international artists but in recent years a growing number of artists from china are making it their new home , combining western european influences with traditional chinese imagery . the 2006 sale of xu beihong 's work " slave and lion " set a new world record ; sold for $ 6.9 million -lrb- 5 million euros -rrb- , it was the most expensive piece of chinese art and started a wave of popularity surrounding art of chinese origin . as xu died in 1953 , he is not profiting from his fame .
the next generation of chinese artists is , however , and many of them have discovered berlin as an increasingly attractive hot spot for art students . one of those is duan yafeng , who has lived in germany 's capital for a year .
after studying chinese art in beijing , she relocated to germany where she enrolled in the liberal arts program at legendary design school bauhaus . " i think every artist has to come here at some time or another , " she said , " we have so many more opportunities here than anywhere else , so many galleries and so many people who are making some really fantastic works . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xu beihong 's " slave and lion " sold for a record-setting $ 6.9 million in a 2006 auction duan is extremely animated when talking about the creative possibilities afforded her from bauhaus ; an all-encompassing alternative arts course , it 's a world away from the education she received in beijing . " i studied chinese art , but something was missing , " she said , " at bauhaus we learn about how museums work , what kind of exhibitions you can present , how you can use performance in your work - so many different aspects of art . " new look at traditions while duan is just one of many young artists currently studying in berlin , she 's by no means the first . during the 1920s and 30s , berlin boasted a vibrant chinese art scene populated by figures who had re-located paris , which had become increasingly expensive .
even xu beihong spent time in berlin in the 20s . the rise of the nazi regime in the early 30s put and end to this lively chinese art scene - the largest outside of china at that time - as many fled germany . " western art plays an important role in china and i think that 's the attraction of these works , " said berlin gallery owner zhu ling , " all of my artists studied traditional chinese painting before they came to germany and here they studied western oil painting and in their works i see an effort to combine these two traditions .
it 's an interesting phenomenon that chinese people , only after they have left china , begin to reflect on their own traditions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duan says she 's found her direction in berlin more than 70 years after berlin 's first wave of chinese artists left the city , zhu is one of the next generation of artists to take up residence .
her gallery on motz strasse is dedicated to the promotion of chinese art . " it 's only in the last 10 or 20 years that chinese people have been allowed to go abroad , " she explained , " so these artists are generally very young and they are at the start of their careers .
i think these people need a platform to present their works . " accidental freedom current census records show that there are around 6,000 chinese people living in berlin and , while not all of them are artists , the figures make for a vibrant chinese community .
while recent media reports suggest that berlin 's cheap rents are the main reason for this influx of chinese artists , zhu thinks this is a trivial excuse and that the real reason is a sense of freedom not available to them under the communist rule in the people 's republic of china . communist control runs deep in china 's educational system , adding that independent thinking was never promoted in schools and universities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallery owner zhu ling says chinese artists enjoy the freedom they discover in berlin " from my experience , i think -lsb- berlin 's chinese artists -rsb- did not consciously reflect on the political restrictions in china before they came to germany , but once they arrive here they can feel the difference , " commented zhu .
" they have more freedom to develop their own individuality than in china but before they came here they did n't even know what it was like , so you ca n't say they made the conscious decision to seek more freedom . " duan yafeng mentions neither politics nor cheap rent when asked why she decided to make berlin her new artistic residence .
her answer is simple : " here i have the right people to work with and the right audience who understands my work .
now i know who i am and what i am doing .
i know which direction i am going in . " author : gavin blackburn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was 2006 and she had escaped north korea two years earlier .
ji , now 28 , and his younger brother and sister had also fled .
they were hiding out in northeast china .
that ’ s when he suddenly got a phone call .
his mother called him from south korea .
she ’ d decided that china , which often forcibly repatriates north koreans , was too dangerous a place for the family to stay in .
that ’ s why she had gone to the south .
ji ’ s mother had arranged for a broker to escort him and his brother to laos and then on to south korea .
but ji says they couldn ’ t find their sister in time to take her with them .
it was only last september that ji and his family finally located her .
" my sister had no idea whether we were back in north korea or in the south , " ji said .
" she found out through a friend in china that we were in seoul .
we contacted her and we paid a human rights organization to help bring her here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , a group of north korean refugees managed to flee to a german school in beijing the ' underground railroad ' the seoul government recently announced that 20,000 defectors from the north have resettled in south korea , about half of those arriving in just the past few years .
most make it to the south with the help of christian missionaries who take north koreans along what ’ s called the underground railroad that runs through china to southeast asia , where it is easier to seek asylum .
many resettled north koreans , like ji ’ s family , are cooperating with missionaries and have their own network of brokers taking refugees out of china , said tim peters , an american missionary whose seoul-based organization assists defectors in reaching south korea .
" virtually every refugee who makes it safely and resettles in south korea has probably made a sworn oath to two to three to four other family members or very close associates in north korea that the resettled one is going to do everything possible to get those other people out . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rally in seoul against the chinese government 's policy on north korean defectors peters added that some defectors even go back to china themselves to bring loved ones to the south .
and refugees are doing whatever they can to raise funds to help their families , said kim seok hyang , a former official at seoul ’ s ministry of unification , the agency that oversees north korean resettlement .
paying human traffickers kim said defectors are using the few thousand dollars they initially receive as a government stipend to pay off human traffickers to bring their loved ones to the south .
but if that money isn ’ t enough , some turn to the sex trade , kim said .
" they want to sacrifice themselves to get that amount of money . from their point of view they need to save their family members and they have no other choice than -lsb- selling -rsb- their body . "
defector ji sang hyun said he doesn ’ t know how much money his mother paid to have him and his brother and sister brought to south korea .
he is glad that his sister finally made it here so the family can live together once again .
but it ’ s not an entirely happy ending .
ji said , " my father at first didn ’ t want to defect , but when he learned that we were all going to south korea he tried to escape north korea too .
but he was caught by border guards and tortured in a prison camp . "
ji learned that his father died just a few days after he was released .

it was 2006 and she had escaped north korea two years earlier .
ji , now 28 , and his younger brother and sister had also fled .
they were hiding out in northeast china .
that ’ s when he suddenly got a phone call .
his mother called him from south korea .
she ’ d decided that china , which often forcibly repatriates north koreans , was too dangerous a place for the family to stay in .
that ’ s why she had gone to the south .
ji ’ s mother had arranged for a broker to escort him and his brother to laos and then on to south korea .
but ji says they couldn ’ t find their sister in time to take her with them .
it was only last september that ji and his family finally located her .
" my sister had no idea whether we were back in north korea or in the south , " ji said .
" she found out through a friend in china that we were in seoul .
we contacted her and we paid a human rights organization to help bring her here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , a group of north korean refugees managed to flee to a german school in beijing the ' underground railroad ' the seoul government recently announced that 20,000 defectors from the north have resettled in south korea , about half of those arriving in just the past few years .
most make it to the south with the help of christian missionaries who take north koreans along what ’ s called the underground railroad that runs through china to southeast asia , where it is easier to seek asylum .
many resettled north koreans , like ji ’ s family , are cooperating with missionaries and have their own network of brokers taking refugees out of china , said tim peters , an american missionary whose seoul-based organization assists defectors in reaching south korea .
" virtually every refugee who makes it safely and resettles in south korea has probably made a sworn oath to two to three to four other family members or very close associates in north korea that the resettled one is going to do everything possible to get those other people out . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rally in seoul against the chinese government 's policy on north korean defectors peters added that some defectors even go back to china themselves to bring loved ones to the south .
and refugees are doing whatever they can to raise funds to help their families , said kim seok hyang , a former official at seoul ’ s ministry of unification , the agency that oversees north korean resettlement .
paying human traffickers kim said defectors are using the few thousand dollars they initially receive as a government stipend to pay off human traffickers to bring their loved ones to the south .
but if that money isn ’ t enough , some turn to the sex trade , kim said .
" they want to sacrifice themselves to get that amount of money . from their point of view they need to save their family members and they have no other choice than -lsb- selling -rsb- their body . "
defector ji sang hyun said he doesn ’ t know how much money his mother paid to have him and his brother and sister brought to south korea .
he is glad that his sister finally made it here so the family can live together once again .
but it ’ s not an entirely happy ending .
ji said , " my father at first didn ’ t want to defect , but when he learned that we were all going to south korea he tried to escape north korea too .
but he was caught by border guards and tortured in a prison camp . "
ji learned that his father died just a few days after he was released .

russia now appears to be on its way to membership , despite the longest running negotiations in history . on tuesday , european union commission president jose manuel barroso announced a breakthrough to clear the way for russia 's entry to the world trade organization .
" our difficult bilateral issues are resolved .
we signed a memorandum of understanding to this end today , " barroso said at the brussels summit .
as part of the agreement , russia has pledged to lower export duties on timber and asian freight that travels to europe via russian railways .
the road to wto membership is usually long and paved with obstacles - but russia 's ongoing 17-year journey is a world record .
the nation with a 90 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- economy is the largest outside the wto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower export duties on russian timber will benefit eu paper makers the blame game frustrated russian politicians blame politically-motivated delay tactics employed by the us and the eu , while trade diplomats in geneva fault russia for failing to understand the rules of the organization .
the key to speeding up the process now lies in moscow , according to wto spokesman keith rockwell .
" the pace of accession is in almost every instance driven by the capital of the country that is acceding , " rockwell said .
in many instances the reforms that are required to join the wto are politically difficult - which is certainly the case in russia , he added .
" there are sectors of the russian economy that find the process of joining the wto very difficult . "
making nice with the neighbors moscow must now get approval from the other members of the wto , a process that includes entering talks with any of the 153 wto members that wish to negotiate .
on monday , russian president dmitri medvedev made the first state visit by a kremlin leader to poland in nine years , and secured poland 's support for russia 's wto accession .
but not all bilateral talks have been constructive .
georgia , russia 's neighbor to the south , has been a wto member for ten years , and has blocked the russian accession process since the armed conflict in the summer of 2008 .
ukraine , too , still has not given a green light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland supports russia 's accession to the wto a veto , however , is unlikely , says alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations .
" in my opinion , in doing so , georgia would harm itself , given the fact that the eu and the us both want russia in the wto and not out of it .
such a move by the georgians would jeopardize the agenda which the west has set up with russia , " rahr told deutche welle .
a powerful partner the european union , with 500 million people , is russia 's largest trading partner .
if russia joins the world trade organization , the nation will be unable to impose arbitrary import bans , drastic tariff increases , and import restrictions without risking sanctions .
exporting nations such as germany would benefit from easier market access , says wto spokesman rockwell , adding that membership for russia would provide german exporters , as well as their japanese and american counterparts , with " a certain sense of predictability " when they enter into business transactions in that country .
" that makes the country a more attractive place for doing business , " said rockwell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keith rockwell speaks for the wto which represents more than 97 percent of global trade a rocky start in the past , russia has been less than committed to the process of joining the wto .
in june 2009 , prime minister vladimir putin declared out of the blue that russia was withdrawing its application for accession to the wto .
instead , his country would join the world trade organization as a customs union , together with kazakhstan and belarus .
in 2007 , in his capacity as president , putin lost patience with geneva 's trade diplomacy , labeling the wto as " archaic , undemocratic and inflexible . "
but the wto wo n't hold a grudge , said keith rockwell .
" we are very thick-skinned in the wto , " the spokesman said , adding mr. putin would be welcome for a visit any time . " we would be very happy to see him here . "

although the two sides have agreed to meet again , the sticking point is the demand for iran to suspend uranium enrichment . the negotiations between un security council heavyweights the united states , russia , china , france and britain along with germany - the so called 5 + 1 group - with an iranian delegation were the first in 13 months .
the negotiation teams , headed by eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton for the 5 + 1 and iran 's secretary of the national security council saaed jalili , agreed that a further round of talks would take place at the end of january in turkey . however , iran has already made it clear that it will not discuss its uranium enrichment program , which it insists is for peaceful purposes while western powers fear the fuel would be used for nuclear warheads .
at the last meeting in october 2009 , the 5 + 1 agreed to a proposal that would have allowed iran to ship a major portion of the uranium they had enriched to 3.5 percent to an external destination to undergo further enrichment and to be converted into fuel rods for the small tehran research reactor .
that would remove the potential threat of weapons-grade material being siphoned off within iran for military purposes .
iran originally agreed to this proposal but later reneged on it , having scored a major point by having the 5 + 1 tacitly agree to iran engaging in enrichment , a practice forbidden by security council resolutions .
then in may this year , brazil and turkey tried to re-broker the deal but this attempt was scuppered by the united states which claimed higher levels of uranium had been enriched in iran since the original offer in 2009 and that the new export deal would leave too much material behind in iran .
iran 's stance on enrichment levels proving obstructive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's saeed jalili will present a similar stance to that of 2009 " if iran agrees to suspend further enrichment , up to the 17.5 percent which it has already stated it was pressing ahead with , then there are a whole series of economic incentives which are on the table , " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , told deutsche welle .
" if , on the other hand , as ahmadinejad has said , iran does not want to address the issue of enrichment or make any concessions or compromises on that account , there will be no alternative at this stage but the consideration of further punitive sanctions . "
chances of reaching any agreements or compromises seem very bleak at this time , khonsari added , but there are clear signs that because economic and other pressures are making life very difficult for the iranian regime , ahmadinejad may be looking for a way out without losing face .
" for ahmadinejad and his supporters there are two main reasons for an engagement with washington , " professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" first , they know that an understanding with the us would be popular , particularly among the educated youth and the business community .
the second reason is that ahmadinejad and the political leadership feel that the regime is under serious threat by the united states , and only by the united states . "
perthes said iran 's threat perception , and its deep suspicion of us intentions , are often underestimated in washington despite these issues being driving factors in iranian politics .
while the regime elite still appears to be divided over the prospect of a full-scale rapprochement with the united states , it is believed many share this fear of the us and there is a real desire to avoid further isolation .
with this in mind , the 5 + 1 may consider lessened sanctions - along with other incentives - as a way to achieve progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has so far dismissed the western incentives incentives on offer but tehran remains steadfast " the western powers along with russia and china are offering iran lessened sanctions , the chance to fix world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership in return for explanations of what has gone on in regard to tehran 's nuclear program and realistic assurances that it has no military nuclear intentions , " simon henderson , director of the gulf and energy policy program at the washington institute for near east policy , told deutsche welle .
" the best hope for agreement lies on the possibility of reaching an acceptable compromise regarding the shipment of already enriched uranium from iran to an outside destination , " khonsari said .
" if agreement could be reached on the quantity , and there is a minute chance given past turkish and brazilian mediation that this is possible , there may still be a way out though it will be very difficult . "
there were concerns that the geneva negotiations would be made even more problematic by the latest wikileaks revelations which exposed the level of international concern and distrust of iran , especially among its persian gulf neighbors , and the consideration of many that military action is the best option when it comes to stopping tehran 's nuclear program .
however , experts believe there is little new information in the wikileaks revelations and that all the parties involved in the talks with iran are already aware of the delicate nature of relations .
wikileaks revelations unlikely to add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks revelations on iran are unlikely to affect talks " there is nothing in the wikileaks revelations that the islamic authorities have been unaware of , " khonsari said .
" the iranian regime understands that matters will be ratcheted up if they are unable to reach an agreement and they are aware that , irrespective of all factors , the likelihood of military confrontation is a very real possibility . "
khonsari believes the consensus among iran 's opponents , that confronting an ambitious iran with all its downsides might be a cheaper option than living with a nuclear iran - as highlighted in the wikileaks cables - might possibly alter tehran 's previous calculations .
those gambled on the belief that the americans would never dare to embark on another military adventure in the aftermath of the iraq and afghanistan conflicts .
options running out if current talks fail " the 5 + 1 diplomats think that sanctions will eventually work , " said simon henderson .
" however , it 's hard to say what iran will do next in response . iran might calculate that if it tests a bomb , there would be some condemnation but then the world would have to get used to a new status quo , much in the same way as it did after the indian and pakistani tests in 1998 . "
mehrdad khonsari said the general consensus is that ahmadinejad wants to escalate matters and essentially go to the very brink of war in a bid to shore up his own leadership , which has been under pressure since the opposition protests in 2009 .
" it is believed that ahmadinejad feels a military conflict might help him consolidate his position inside the country , " he concluded .
" in such a case , his major aim is to buy time as it is unlikely that anything positive can be achieved as a result of these negotiations . "

in brussels on tuesday , eu monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn expressed confidence that this money would not be lost .
" i 'm confident that ireland , with its smart , competent , and stubborn people - and its prospects of recovering -lsb- from -rsb- this situation - will overcome the current challenges . "
tough budget while the final stamp of approval for the bailout loan was being given in brussels , the irish government in dublin announced deep cuts in its 2011 budget .
tax hikes and spending cuts are expected to save the country around 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lenihan unveiled a tough budget on tuesday " as outlined in the plan , six billion euros of the overall adjustment is made in today 's budget .
the scale of this adjustment is demanding but it demonstrates the seriousness of our intent , " said finance minister brian lenihan in an address to ireland 's lower house of parliament .
the budget cuts were necessary to secure the bailout from the eu and the international monetary fund .
tapping the reserves ireland 's bailout comes from the 750 billion euro crisis fund established earlier this year after greece required similar aid .
now , the question is still being asked : will ireland be the only country to access the fund , or will portugal , spain or even italy need support soon ?
and if so , will 750 billion euros be enough ?
for spanish finance minister elena salgado , the problem simply does not exist .
“ the volume of the crisis mechanism seems reasonable to us , ” she said .
but from her , these words seem logical ; spain is trying to soothe the markets .
belgian finance minister didier reynders , who chaired the talks , is more cautious , saying debates on the size of the bailout mechanism will likely continue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 07.12.2010 us-china truce signals a spirit of compromise in cancun climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global agreement on emissions targets may be in sight china has offered for the first time to submit its voluntary carbon emissions target to a binding un resolution , buoying climate talks as environment ministers from around the globe arrive in cancun . environment ministers from around the world arrived in cancun on tuesday , replacing their lower-level negotiators and hoping to wrap up a deal by friday night .
a major sticking point to any potential deal has been the fact that the us and china are not signed up to the accord .
" there is a challenge that not everyone is part of the kyoto protocol " , eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard told a press conference in cancun .
but as the talks enter the final stages , china and the us have confirmed their commitment to emissions reductions – a move that could save the talks .
developing countries have said they wo n't move towards any new treaty until members of the kyoto protocol agree to extend the treaty beyond 2012 .
but japan , russia and canada have refused to extend kyoto without the participation of the world 's two top polluters - china , which has no requirements as a developing country , and the united states , which rejected the treaty in 2001 .
together , china and the us emit about 40 percent of the world 's greenhouse gases .
japan , russia and canada want a separate agreement regulating all nations .
" there are huge concerns about the position of japan .
we 're seeing some signals of possible flexibility from the japanese , but the japanese have to not stand in the way of a decision that reaffirms a second commitment period , " alden meyer from the union of concerned scientists told a press conference in cancun .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer is concerned about japan 's position game-changer in an apparent about turn , which could potentially save the climate talks , china announced on monday that it would be prepared to make emissions reductions binding .
" we can create a resolution and that resolution can be binding on china , " said huang huikang , the chinese foreign ministry 's envoy for climate change talks , in an interview with reuters .
china 's offer to make its existing , domestic pledge to reduce its " carbon intensity " - the amount of the main greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , emitted for each dollar of economic growth - binding under a un resolution is a compromise it hopes will encourage developed countries to continue the existing kyoto protocol .
" china wants to avoid a collapse of the talks , " ruth davis from greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" they 're trying to create a landing space for japan to come back on board without losing face " .
china 's target would still be voluntary , stressed china 's chief negotiator xie zhenhua , in contrast to developed nation targets under kyoto .
targets for developed countries are imposed by the international community , but beijing 's targets would be offered to the community by china .
analysts were generally positive about china 's proposal .
" this is a game-changer , " said jennifer morgan from the washington-based world resources institute .
but the details of china ‘ s pledge remain unclear .
" china may ask for different conditions to developed countries whose emissions reductions are subject to international scrutiny and monitoring , " ruth davis told deutsche welle .
china in the past has refused to be part of a binding agreement involving outside verification that it is making good on its pledges to curb emissions .
low key us appearance us involvement is also seen as a linchpin for an international agreement .
" there can be no doubt that in the european union , we have time and again told our american friends why we thought it was very important that they engage in this agenda , " said eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chu reaffirmed obama 's commitment to fighting climate change on a brief visit to cancun , us energy secretary steven chu confirmed that president barack obama was committed to meeting us pledges made in copenhagen to curb carbon emissions from 2005 levels by 17 percent by 2020 .
" he absolutely feels that moving toward a clean energy economy is really about our energy security and about our financial security , " chu said .
" it 's about our economy ; it 's about the future of the planet . "
this is despite the republican party 's election victory last month , which says forced emission cuts would hurt a fragile economy .
some republicans also doubt the science behind climate change .
this all but ended the prospect of the united states approving legislation to restrict carbon emissions .
chu highlighted efforts by the obama administration to encourage low-carbon technology , including 90 billion dollars towards clean energy in its economic stimulus package .
the administration has set up research laboratories for green research and offered tax incentives to pursue eco-friendly energy .
air of optimism amid diplomatic leaks environmentalists seem to agree that there is a more hopeful tone at this year 's talks in cancun .
" over the past week , we have seen a vastly improved atmosphere in these talks than we 've seen over the past year , " said wendel trio , greenpeace international 's director of climate policy .
mexico has so far received plaudits for running an open process that has kept the mood at the cancun talks more positive than in copenhagen where major global powers negotiated behind closed doors , a move that irked many developing countries .
but disclosures by wikileaks this week threatened to sour the mood .
the leaked memos showed that the united states and european union worked together aggressively to sell the copenhagen deal last year .
bildunterschrift : delegates have until the end of the week to forge an agreement on how to tackle climate change in one cable , reported by the british newspaper the guardian , hedegaard is quoted as telling a us official that small island nations " could be our best allies " as they need financial assistance from wealthy states .
the goal would be to step up pressure on developing countries such as india and brazil to sign up .
such emerging powers have taken growing action on climate change but stated adamantly that the measures are voluntary and that rich nations bear historic responsibility for the problem .
a leaked cable also said the european union and united states looked at ways to " neutralize , co-opt or marginalize " countries seen as " unhelpful " - particularly venezuela and bolivia , which have raised persistent objections during climate negotiations on issues both of substance and process .
asked about the leaks , hedegaard said that the cables offered a " one-sided and selected " us account of conversations .
she denied any untoward pressure toward the most vulnerable nations such as maldives , saying : " for many reasons we want to work very much with them . "
hedegaard said she did not believe the disclosures would hurt the cancun talks , saying everyone knows " that you discuss a lot of things " in negotiations .
but bolivian negotiator pablo solon said he was " greatly concerned " by the disclosures .
the cables " confirm what we 've always been saying and the united states has been denying : the interference , pressure and blackmail regrettably conducted by the us administration , " he said .

known as " cipurse , " the standard was developed by a group of leading technology firms , which announced a new partnership , known as the open standard for public transport -lrb- ospt -rrb- alliance .
" for mobile device manufacturers , the open security standard will be the next ‘ must-have ' checklist item they include in all next-generation nfc implementations , " the group said in a statement .
the ospt alliance described its open system as offering an alternative to proprietary technologies , which the group said " limit choices , are potentially less secure and cost more to acquire , deploy and maintain . "

" but the alliance also found fault with the proprietary nature of the mifare technology .
pannenbaecker said the group 's new specification would allow a range of vendors to offer nfc-capable sim cards and phones .

the original plan of the caravan organizers was to take a land route from india to pakistan , and from there over iran , turkey , syria and lebanon to gaza .
however , the indian delegates were only permitted to travel via the wagah border to lahore .
the idea of indian and pakistani peace activists undertaking a symbolic journey through pakistan could not be realized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between india and pakistan have been tense since the mumbai attacks in 2008 the indian and pakistani delegations are now going to join together in the iranian city of zahidan , from where , along with peace activists from other asian countries , they will continue their journey towards gaza .
the caravan is scheduled to reach the palestinian territories on december 27 .
mire of indo-pakistani politics indian peace activist rakhi sehgal condemned the behavior of the indian and pakistani governments towards the convoy .
she told deutsche welle that initially 51 peace activists from india had applied for a pakistani visa , out of whom only 34 finally received the visa after days of protesting outside the pakistan high commission in delhi .
" we had planned to travel over land from delhi to wagah , and then from wagah to lahore , karachi , quetta and zahidan , in iran .
however , we were not allowed to go beyond lahore .
on december 4 , we reached the wagah border and were informed that the indian government had not given us permission to cross the border .
after unsuccessfully trying to contact the ministry of external affairs , we held a demonstration at wagah .
it was on december 5 that we got word from the indian officials that we were being allowed to cross the border . "
despite the fact that the convoy has nothing to do with indo-pakistani security and peace issues , its main purpose is to help the people of gaza , it has been dragged into the mire of indo-pakistani politics .
pakistan labour party 's farooq tariq , who is one of the main organizers of the caravan in pakistan , believes that us pressure on pakistan and india has probably led to this crisis .
" both the indian and pakistani governments have close ties with the us , and they would obviously not want to displease the us , which has cordial ties with israel . "

the original plan of the caravan organizers was to take a land route from india to pakistan , and from there over iran , turkey , syria and lebanon to gaza .
however , the indian delegates were only permitted to travel via the wagah border to lahore .
the idea of indian and pakistani peace activists undertaking a symbolic journey through pakistan could not be realized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between india and pakistan have been tense since the mumbai attacks in 2008 the indian and pakistani delegations are now going to join together in the iranian city of zahidan , from where , along with peace activists from other asian countries , they will continue their journey towards gaza .
the caravan is scheduled to reach the palestinian territories on december 27 .
mire of indo-pakistani politics indian peace activist rakhi sehgal condemned the behavior of the indian and pakistani governments towards the convoy .
she told deutsche welle that initially 51 peace activists from india had applied for a pakistani visa , out of whom only 34 finally received the visa after days of protesting outside the pakistan high commission in delhi .
" we had planned to travel over land from delhi to wagah , and then from wagah to lahore , karachi , quetta and zahidan , in iran .
however , we were not allowed to go beyond lahore .
on december 4 , we reached the wagah border and were informed that the indian government had not given us permission to cross the border .
after unsuccessfully trying to contact the ministry of external affairs , we held a demonstration at wagah .
it was on december 5 that we got word from the indian officials that we were being allowed to cross the border . "
despite the fact that the convoy has nothing to do with indo-pakistani security and peace issues , its main purpose is to help the people of gaza , it has been dragged into the mire of indo-pakistani politics .
pakistan labour party 's farooq tariq , who is one of the main organizers of the caravan in pakistan , believes that us pressure on pakistan and india has probably led to this crisis .
" both the indian and pakistani governments have close ties with the us , and they would obviously not want to displease the us , which has cordial ties with israel . "

the redd scheme aims to reward developing nations for preserving their forests . a pact on reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries - known to negotiators as redd or " reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation " - appears to be close to an international agreement at the un framework convention on climate change in cancun .
" there 's a really strong chance that we will get a solid agreement , " said rane cortez , the senior forest carbon advisor for the nature conservancy environmental group .
" there is a lot of consensus coming on the text , but we need a few tweaks to get everyone onboard , " she added .
the programme was launched in september 2008 and consists largely of offering financial incentives to developing countries such as brazil , indonesia or the democratic republic of congo to save their tropical forests .
deforestation accounts for almost one-fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions , which is more than the entire global transport sector causes .
co2 released into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels like oil and coal can be absorbed and stored by forests until the forest dies .
yet even though that 's a well established fact , deforestation is continuing at a rapid pace .
each year , an estimated 13 million hectares of forest - mainly rain forest - is destroyed .
that 's equivalent to the area of a country like greece .
bildunterschrift : sources of greenhouse gasses - deforestation accounts for 17 percent of global emissions a simple concept the principle behind redd is simple .
the idea is to reward developing nations that preserve their forests , boost the carbon stock , and have sustainable forestry management .
currently , forests in developing countries are often cleared to make way for plantations , agricultural land or livestock .
in order to give people there the chance to make a different living , developed countries would under the redd scheme have to pay for the environmental services which these forests perform if they are left intact .
a fair deal , one might think - not least in view of the fact that developed nations are historically responsible for the ever-increasing co2 in the atmosphere - and thus for global climate change .
since a hectare of a palm oil plantation or arable land brings in more money than a hectare of rainforest , compensation should be agreed on an international level , according to the reasoning behind the redd concept .
bildunterschrift : cumulative co2 emissions -lrb- 1850-2000 -rrb- show usa and europe have been the biggest poluters money money money but even if it sounds like a logical solution , the simplicity ends when money comes into play .
what form this compensation should take and who should finance it are in dispute .
some negotiators say that only public money should go to redd .
but others say it is more realistic to set up a market approach that would allow nations to swap assistance for credits in emission reduction goals .
sha zukang , the un undersecretary for economic and social affairs , said funding so far has been insufficient even though the forest issue was critical for the " protection of the environment , social development and the fight against poverty . "
developed nations have pledged some 4.5 billion dollars for redd .
the leading financial contributor is norway , which among other projects has committed to provide one billion dollars for indonesia which plans a two-year moratorium on new clearing of natural forests and peat lands from 2011 .
what is a forest ?
but even before negotiators get to the sticky issue of money , " the debate about the redd agreement begins with the definition of the term ' forest ' , " said christoph thies of greenpeace .
to date no agreement has been reached in the negotiations : some also want plantations to count as forests , while others think the term should only refer to primary forests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace does n't want plantations to be counted as " forests " " for us at greenpeace it ' quite clear : a forest is a natural ecosystem that is dominated by trees - but not a plantation .
a tree plantation follows the principles of agriculture and is more of a tree farm for us , " thies said .
a tree farm or a plantation hardly stores any co2 .
even worse : to make room for the plantation , rain forest has to be cleared - and in this way co2 and methane is released into the atmosphere .
if this were rewarded in a redd agreement , thies thinks it would lose all credibility .
who does the forest belong to ?
worldwide , over a billion people live off the forest - many of them belong to indigenous people that have not only lived in the forest , but also from the forest .
the norwegian rainforest foundation wants to support and strengthen precisely this population , said lars loevold .
he said that involving indigenous peoples in the debate was not just an ethical question but a strategic decision .
" we are 100 percent convinced that forest protection will only work if we recognize the traditional communal rights of these people , " loevold said .
" for centuries they have maintained and protected the forests .
what looks to us in the west like untouched rain forest , is in fact the result of a very complex ecosystem within which humans have also played a role for centuries .
in this life cycle , a richer biodiversity has been created than if no people had lived there , " loevold added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies show that indigenous people can look after forest better than national parks local administration is more successful than national parks new research supports loevold 's argument that forests which are managed by indigenous peoples and local communities are better protected and have a greater biodiversity than , for example , national parks .
to enable people who actually live from and with the forests to have their voice heard at international climate negotiations , the norwegian rainforest foundation have paid the travel costs of indigenous representatives from all around the world .
the demands of indigenous peoples have become an essential part of climate negotiations .
the point for the director of the norwegian rainforest foundation at redd negotiations in cancun is that the forests should not just degenerate into a short-term investment .
" until now it has been profitable to destroy the rain forest .
some earned money with deforestation , but they did n't have to pay for the costs of the destruction .
the redd agreement is about finding mechanisms which reward people who protect forests , and punish those who destroy the forest , " said lars loevold .
this issue is being addressed by the 194 member countries at the un climate summit in cancun , mexico .
an agreement seems within reach .

now in its fourth year , the hri examines performance under five “ pillars ” of donor practice : response to needs ; prevention , risk reduction and recovery ; working with partners ; protection and international humanitarian law ; and learning and accountability .
denmark tops the hri ranking list followed by ireland , new zealand , norway , and sweden , while the european commission comes in sixth .
the head of the hri team , philip tamminga , talked with deutsche welle about the latest index and how political priorities have impeded the delivery of humanitarian aid to millions .
deutsche welle : germany does n't appear to have done too well in your assessment .
why is that ?
philip tamminga : germany is ranked 14th -lsb- out of 20 -rsb- in the index this year , just after canada and australia , but before japan and france . germany spends a lot less on humanitarian assistance than other countries , and the percentage of its aid dedicated to humanitarian crises is about half of the average of other donors . so it lags somewhat behind other countries .
other factors that explain germany 's position in the ranking is that it has too many restrictive conditions on its aid funding .
this sometimes makes it difficult for the humanitarian organizations it funds to have enough flexibility to direct aid where it is needed or to adapt programmes if the situation changes on the ground - which happens quite often in a disaster or conflict .
germany could also do better at funding un and red cross appeals , and make better use of regular evaluations to improve the quality and effectiveness of the assistance it provides .
germany does have many strengths , though .
for instance , it tends to provide funding rapidly in cases of disasters , and it 's a strong supporter of ngos .
it is also one of the better donor governments in terms of its commitment towards accountability to people affected by crises - making sure aid is effective and responds to their needs . could you explain briefly how exactly the assessment is done – what are the key tools and methodology employed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid is much-needed in many corners of the globe we assess donors by looking at 35 different indicators of how well they support humanitarian action and apply good practices .
the indicators are based on the core concepts contained in the declaration of good humanitarian donorship , which was developed and signed by the world 's main donor governments - including germany - in 2003 .
what we want to see is if governments are respecting the commitments they made , so we send teams to different humanitarian crises and we talk to the different humanitarian organizations about how well the governments that fund their work are applying good practice .
we combine this with publicly available information from published sources on government aid funding , respect of international humanitarian law , and other elements of good donor practice .
this year , our teams visited 14 humanitarian crises areas like haiti , afghanistan , somalia , sudan and pakistan , and we spoke to over 500 senior officials working in these crises from the united nations , the red cross and the red crescent , ngos , donor governments and others .
we also collected nearly 2,000 survey responses .
this gives us a good basis to measure and compare donor governments each year on whether their policies and practices facilitate or impede an effective response to crises .
the report says that there 's ample evidence of politicization of aid .
exactly what evidence do you have to show that political interests have overtaken the commitment to good humanitarian donorship ?
in 10 of the 14 crises we visited , we saw and heard of evidence that donor governments were placing political interests above humanitarian objectives . in some cases , like afghanistan , the use of western military forces to provide humanitarian assistance is compromising the neutrality , impartiality and independence of humanitarian organizations , and putting humanitarian workers and civilians at risk .
we also saw in some places like somalia , the occupied palestinian territories or yemen , some donor governments are putting restrictions on humanitarian organizations that prevents them from working in areas controlled by certain groups like hamas , as part of the " war on terror . "
this means the people in need are not getting the aid they deserve .
in other crises , there are debates about how foreign aid can help win " hearts and minds " or achieve other foreign policy objectives .
one of the most basic humanitarian principles – which donor governments committed themselves to when they signed the good donorship declaration – is that humanitarian assistance should be given without discrimination , and based on needs alone – and not because it may or may not help a government achieve other objectives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastation left behind by the 2005 tsunami the hri report claims that there are gaps in the protection of civilians and that the lack of safe humanitarian access has put vulnerable groups at risk of harm .
basically , this refers to the promotion of international humanitarian law and goes beyond programming issues – is the report referring to diplomacy efforts in this direction ? yes , the report is clear that as a result of politicization , safe access by humanitarian organizations to people affected by crisis is being compromised . because of that , humanitarian workers are at risk , and civilian populations are not getting the protection and assistance they need .
a recent example of this lack of protection was seen in the mass rapes that took place in the democratic republic of the congo .
and the safety of humanitarian workers is also at stake : last year over 260 humanitarians were killed , kidnapped or injured while trying to carry out their work .
you have also accused donors of failing to improve transparency and accountability towards affected people .
which countries have fared well under this pillar and which poorly ?
donor governments are not doing enough to promote better accountability towards people affected by disasters and crises .
there are lots of requirements on humanitarian organizations to report on how they have spent the money they get , and what kind of results , but very few donor governments have in place requirements to monitor and ensure that aid money is being used to meet the needs and priorities of the actual people affected by the crisis .
most professional humanitarian organizations already do this to some extent , but donor governments are not monitoring and following up adequately , and supporting these efforts . another concern is that donor governments are not being transparent or accountable on the aid that they promise . for example , many governments have still not disbursed all the funds that they promised after the earthquake in haiti .
and while the promises are made in the media or in international conferences , most of the time , the people affected do n't receive any information about this , and do n't have any way to participate directly on how that aid will be prioritized or spent .
this is why we call on governments to improve their transparency and accountability . germany tends to do better than other donors in this area , and could perhaps take the lead in building more commitment amongst donor governments .
what 's been donor governments ' response to this ranking system – surely some are n't happy with the whole exercise ?
some governments have told us that they think a ranking system is counterproductive , and does n't encourage or motivate donor governments to do better .
but in fact , some of the lowest ranked donors have told us they appreciate having a tool like the humanitarian response index to benchmark their performance and to know where they stand compared to their peers . the ranking is only a minor part of the exercise , though .
we collect a lot of valuable information about how donors are performing , and we have always offered this information to governments , donor agencies and other stakeholders to use it to understand where a government may need to improve , and where they are doing well .
by visiting 14 crises areas – the biggest evaluation exercise of its kind in the humanitarian sector – we are able to identify trends that affect the quality and impact of aid .
so we have lots of valuable analysis to share with the international community , such as our increasing concerns about politicization of aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food for those who need it most you must have confronted questions relating to legitimacy , though – what gives dara the authority to rank donor performance ?
first of all , dara has a great multi-disciplinary team with extensive experience in the field of evaluating humanitarian action . we were part of the huge tsunami joint evaluation exercise on how the entire humanitarian system responded .
dara looked specifically at the area of donor funding , which gave us insights on how they took decisions , and why good practice was so difficult for them to apply .
that was the basis for us creating the humanitarian response index – to systematically measure donor practice and provide solid , empirical evidence on where donor governments need to improve further . since then , we have carried out hri evaluations in over 35 crises , along with our extensive evaluation experience in other areas .
we also felt it was absolutely critical for an independent , objective evaluation of donor governments .
until the hri was created , there was no way to monitor if donor governments were complying with their commitments .
most of the tools and processes used by donors to assess their own performance are not transparent enough , and do n't look at issues around the quality of their aid , or the relationship with the humanitarian organizations they fund .
we think the hri can be used to stimulate changes and improvements .
has the hri , since its inception in 2007 , had a measurable impact on donors ?
if so , could you give some examples ?
yes .
the index has helped to raise many issues and concerns facing the humanitarian sector in general , and several donor governments have now taken this up as an issue for discussion at the international level .
for example , our findings in the 2008 report called for improvements in the way that humanitarian needs are identified so that aid could be distributed more effectively and fairly .
now , many governments are working with humanitarian organizations to address this gap .
some governments have used our findings as part of their overall evaluation of their aid programs and policies .
and dara has also begun working with some donor governments to provide a more detailed assessment on how they are doing , with recommendations on where to change and improve . next year we hope to carry out an evaluation of the impact of the hri after its first five years , where we can show how and where it has had an influence .
in the meantime , we will continue to offer our support and analysis to governments and other stakeholders who are interested in making sure that aid efforts help people affected by crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 07.12.2010 is the eu emergency fund big enough ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb is in charge of monetary but not fiscal policy eu finance ministers said monday that they would not be taking new measures to tackle the current debt crisis in the bloc .
deutsche welle spoke with tom kirchmaier of the london school of economics about the decision . eurozone finance ministers met on monday evening to discuss increasing the emergency fund but ultimately decided it was big enough .
is it ?
at the moment it is enough .
but the problem is a different one .
you arrange a fund like this to send a signal to the market that there is no point in speculating against the currency .
so by not increasing the fund , the eurozone finance ministers send a signal that there might actually be a point in speculating against larger countries like spain .
so in that way , they made the markets less stable , not more .
you do n't think markets are convinced yet that the debt crisis is contained ?
the funds are enough to support countries like greece and portugal , they are not enough to support countries like spain , or belgium , or italy .
it 's an arithmetic game , and you come up with a number that 's around one-and-a-half trillion , or two trillion euros and you come up with a guarantee where you can say , this is rock solid .
the number is just so big that it becomes clear to everybody that a speculator ca n't win .
another idea that had been floated prior to monday evening 's meeting , but was then not discussed , was that of bonds issued jointly by the eurozone countries .
is that a good idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the efsf is not big enough for markets to take it seriously " it 's a good idea in principle , but it 's very far-fetched politically .
one of the problems with the eurozone - and it 's a problem from birth - is that monetary policy is done by the european central bank , but fiscal policy is done by each of the member states .
and that creates almost perverse incentives for the individual member states to over-consume , which is what they have done .
one of the ways to solve this problem is to centralize fiscal policy , i.e. to make more fiscal decisions in brussels .
if you launch a euro bond , you essentially do exactly that because you then unify all the risks which you have in the eurozone .
for it to work , you have to have a centralized fiscal policy .
interestingly , china and sovereign wealth funds are very keen for europe to issue these bonds because they would be highly liquid and a good alternative to a us treasury bond .
both the bigger emergency fund and the euro bonds are supposed to convince markets of the " irreversibility " of the euro , as luxemberg 's prime minister jean claude juncker put it .
is the euro in fact " irreversible " or can you imagine a scenario in which this common currency would fold ?
nothing is irreversible .
it would unravel the minute that germany in particular were to make the tiniest suggestion about leaving .
it would be possible to reverse the euro , but it would have catastrophic consequences .
on one hand , you would see a bank run with weaker countries - everybody would try to get their money and put it in a german bank account and that would lead to an immediate collapse of the banking system in that country .
it would be catastrophic for the european idea , for these weak economies , and if germany were to decide to leave , it would not be good for germany either because the currency would appreciate dramatically .
next week at a eu summit , leaders are expected to agree on permanent eurozone rescue mechanisms , since the current emergency fund expires in 2013 .
what could or what should these permanent mechanisms look like ?
the issue of " permanent " only makes sense if the fund is large and credible enough .
at the moment i do n't see that we are getting any closer to making a credible long-term commitment to stability .
the only really credible commitment would be to integrate fiscal policy further .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 07.12.2010 concern over politicization of top donor governments ’ aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philip tamminga an international organization , which evaluates the effectiveness of donor governments ’ aid for people suffering from conflicts , disasters and climate change , has released its 2010 humanitarian response index . the dara index -lrb- hri -rrb- assesses responses to crises by the world 's top donor governments – members of the disaster action committee of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
now in its fourth year , the hri examines performance under five “ pillars ” of donor practice : response to needs ; prevention , risk reduction and recovery ; working with partners ; protection and international humanitarian law ; and learning and accountability .
denmark tops the hri ranking list followed by ireland , new zealand , norway , and sweden , while the european commission comes in sixth .
the head of the hri team , philip tamminga , talked with deutsche welle about the latest index and how political priorities have impeded the delivery of humanitarian aid to millions .
deutsche welle : germany does n't appear to have done too well in your assessment .
why is that ?
philip tamminga : germany is ranked 14th -lsb- out of 20 -rsb- in the index this year , just after canada and australia , but before japan and france . germany spends a lot less on humanitarian assistance than other countries , and the percentage of its aid dedicated to humanitarian crises is about half of the average of other donors . so it lags somewhat behind other countries .
other factors that explain germany 's position in the ranking is that it has too many restrictive conditions on its aid funding .
this sometimes makes it difficult for the humanitarian organizations it funds to have enough flexibility to direct aid where it is needed or to adapt programmes if the situation changes on the ground - which happens quite often in a disaster or conflict .
germany could also do better at funding un and red cross appeals , and make better use of regular evaluations to improve the quality and effectiveness of the assistance it provides .
germany does have many strengths , though .
for instance , it tends to provide funding rapidly in cases of disasters , and it 's a strong supporter of ngos .
it is also one of the better donor governments in terms of its commitment towards accountability to people affected by crises - making sure aid is effective and responds to their needs . could you explain briefly how exactly the assessment is done – what are the key tools and methodology employed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid is much-needed in many corners of the globe we assess donors by looking at 35 different indicators of how well they support humanitarian action and apply good practices .
the indicators are based on the core concepts contained in the declaration of good humanitarian donorship , which was developed and signed by the world 's main donor governments - including germany - in 2003 .
what we want to see is if governments are respecting the commitments they made , so we send teams to different humanitarian crises and we talk to the different humanitarian organizations about how well the governments that fund their work are applying good practice .
we combine this with publicly available information from published sources on government aid funding , respect of international humanitarian law , and other elements of good donor practice .
this year , our teams visited 14 humanitarian crises areas like haiti , afghanistan , somalia , sudan and pakistan , and we spoke to over 500 senior officials working in these crises from the united nations , the red cross and the red crescent , ngos , donor governments and others .
we also collected nearly 2,000 survey responses .
this gives us a good basis to measure and compare donor governments each year on whether their policies and practices facilitate or impede an effective response to crises .
the report says that there 's ample evidence of politicization of aid .
exactly what evidence do you have to show that political interests have overtaken the commitment to good humanitarian donorship ?
in 10 of the 14 crises we visited , we saw and heard of evidence that donor governments were placing political interests above humanitarian objectives . in some cases , like afghanistan , the use of western military forces to provide humanitarian assistance is compromising the neutrality , impartiality and independence of humanitarian organizations , and putting humanitarian workers and civilians at risk .
we also saw in some places like somalia , the occupied palestinian territories or yemen , some donor governments are putting restrictions on humanitarian organizations that prevents them from working in areas controlled by certain groups like hamas , as part of the " war on terror . "
this means the people in need are not getting the aid they deserve .
in other crises , there are debates about how foreign aid can help win " hearts and minds " or achieve other foreign policy objectives .
one of the most basic humanitarian principles – which donor governments committed themselves to when they signed the good donorship declaration – is that humanitarian assistance should be given without discrimination , and based on needs alone – and not because it may or may not help a government achieve other objectives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastation left behind by the 2005 tsunami the hri report claims that there are gaps in the protection of civilians and that the lack of safe humanitarian access has put vulnerable groups at risk of harm .

library archivists finally unearthed the text fragment in the nantes public library late last week after being alerted to its possible presence by a reporter writing for a nantes newspaper , presse ocean .
local authorities say the fragment had sat undisturbed in the library 's archives , which was part of a collection of documents donated to the city in 1872 by a wealthy collector .
the text is written mirrored right to left script , which was da vinci 's style , as a way to keep his documents somewhat secret .
" he was most probably writing in 15th-century italian , and possibly in other languages , so it 's now got to be deciphered , " said agnes marcetteau , head of the nantes library where the manuscript was found , in an interview monday with the news agency reuters .
text mentions birds , flight on its website , presse ocean reported tuesday that it had confirmed the authenticity of the fragment with carlo pedretti , a da vinci expert based in los angeles .
" it has to do with the air and the wind , relating to a study of the flight of birds .
the fragment dates from around 1504 , " pedretti told the french newspaper .
if that estimation proves to be accurate , that would put the text fragment around the same time that da vinci painted the mona lisa , which is now held in the louvre museum in paris .
this is the second rare item uncovered in the 1872 collection , after the discovery in 2008 of a never-before-seen score by composer wolfgang amadeus mozart .

and no one seems to know exactly what role the european union will play . the fifth edition of the european development days , a two-day eu-sponsored conference in brussels that brings together representatives of governments , humanitarian ngos and others , was the first to take place after the creation of the european external action service , the eu equivalent of a foreign ministry .
not surprisingly , much of the focus of the discussions was what impact increasing eu coordination and involvement would have on the aid handed out by some of the world 's wealthiest countries to some of its poorest .
no one seemed particularly optimistic .
deputy chairman of the africa commission erastus mwencha , for example , said the body had too little power , asking for instance why the eu failed to have single coordinated positions at groups like the world trade organization .
representatives of aid groups , meanwhile , said they feared that more power in brussels would simply bring increased bureaucracy .
bildunterschrift : investing in education pays big long-term dividends " again there are also problems with red tape , " said philomena johnson , the director of the charity group caritas in ghana .
" what we call long processes and procedures that make it impossible for developing countries to make optimal benefits from the resources that come to them to reduce poverty . "
and the individual countries in the eu are also wary about handing over control of what have previously been national aid initiatives .
" as a member state with quite a lot of money and thereby quite a lot of responsibility , i have to see who is accountable , " said swedish development minister gunilla carlsson .
" that 's why it has been hard to devote all the money to brussels .
it has been rather anonymous , it 's really bureaucratic , and also as a donor , it 's very hard to have influence . "
carlsson was speaking from a position of moral high ground .
sweden is one of only five countries that have achieved aid targets formulated 40 years ago .
0.7 percent - not enough or too much ?
bildunterschrift : this ambulance is part of the millennium project , but larger aims are n't being met in 1970 , the un general assembly decided that the world 's wealthy countries should be devoting 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product to aid .
that goal was confirmed by the un millennium project , and the target date was set at 2015 .
the eu and its member states provide some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.6 billion -rrb- in aid annually , but in terms of percentage that figure does not come even close to the target .
oxfam says germany , for instance , spent only 0.35 percent of its 2009 gross domestic product on developmental assistance , slightly less than the year before , and is n't scheduled to meet the un goal until 2027 .
eu development commissioner andris piebalgs used the brussels event to remind eu members of their obligations .
" the real challenge is how europeans will use the 0.7 percent so that it really has the impact our taxpayers expect , " piebalgs said .
" our taxpayers expect that there is a visible change in the conditions of life in developing countries . "
but mentioning expectations and measureable effects also raises the sensitive issue of whether developmental aid truly works .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the money never gets to the poor aid , according to a famous quip attributed to british economist peter bauer , is " an excellent method for transferring money from poor people in rich countries to rich people in poor countries . "
and earlier this year , the free-market washington think-tank center for global development published a report claiming that the 0.7 percent figure was arbitrary , and that less money , if well spent , would do more to benefit poor people in , for instance , africa .
" the assumptions that in africa all aid becomes investment and all investment becomes growth have no empirical support , " the report 's authors concluded .
" the evidence is very strong that africa 's growth performance has been weak not from a lack of capital per se , but from low productivity of that capital . "
in other words , the problem is less about giving more money than about ensuring that money is used to generate lasting improvements .
for this reason , germany has been placing more and more emphasis on linking aid to good governance in recipient countries .
quid pro quo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel is among those who say that money is only as good as the results it yields although idealistic notions of human solidarity are one factor that motivates developmental aid , another is simple self-interest .
countries rich in natural resources such as libya , algeria and the central asia republics are increasingly becoming a focus of both german and european aid initiatives .
on a slightest less morally ambiguous note , most european countries see aid as a means of encouraging stability in poorer countries and thus a vastly cheaper alternative to military interventions .
germany 's development minister dirk niebel recently made this point with reference to afghanistan .
" we assume that , if we want to bring our soldiers home , our efforts have to put a clear emphasis on civilian support , " niebel told reporters .
" the citizens of afghanistan need a true peace dividend .
they have to see that our effort clearly betters their personal living conditions .
that will have on an effect on regions that are n't so secure and others where we would hope to see some quick improvements . "
this " butter versus guns " ideal is , of course , anything but new , but it does underscore a point that increasing numbers of european and world leaders are making .
where aid is concerned , delivery counts every bit as much as amount .

but know-how , often protected by patents , is trickling way too slowly from industrialized nations to poorer regions . every few years , world leaders get together at high-profile conferences to discuss ways to reduce global warming and save the planet . the 2010 united nations climate change conference is currently being held in cancun , mexico .
but the talks are taking place amid low expectations , after the disappointment of the copenhagen summit last year – which memorably failed to produce any binding agreements .
this came as a particular blow to the g77 countries , which have in fact expanded to 131 mostly developing nations .
their demands include a relaxation , if not a general lifting , of patent protection laws governing renewable energies .
their argument is that it is first and foremost the industrialized nations that are responsible for climate change , while the poorer nations pay the price for the wealthier countries ' mistakes .
therefore industrialized nations should at least give them the benefit of their green energy know-how .
sharing their patents would go some way to paying off their climate debts , the g77 countries say .
the patent imbalance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patents get in the way of technology transfer between developed and developing nations according to a new study compiled by the un environment program , 80 percent of all patented innovations in the area of clean energy technologies are registered by companies in japan , germany , us , south korea , britain and france .
the report , which examines the role of patents in combating climate change , was jointly conducted with the european patent office and the international centre for trade and sustainable development .
" the fact that northern countries keep their expertise on regenerative energies to themselves , puts the south at an additional disadvantage , " says aileen kwa from south center , an intergovernmental policy think tank of developing countries .
as a climate-friendly , affordable alternative to fossil fuels , clean energy is key to the future of the developing world , and allows people to access energy supplies without having to rely on major providers .
moreover , it decentralizes the energy supply .
in countries where the majority of the population is rural , solar panels and geothermal heat pumps installed in individual homes are energy efficient solutions for people who would otherwise go without .
one problem , however , is the frequent lack of local expertise necessary not only to install the technology , but also to maintain it .
not only does the equipment therefore need to be imported – the know-how does to .
if patents are a factor , the whole process soon becomes very costly .
but it 's not only developing nations that have some catching-up to do on the clean energy front .
green technology is still very much in its infancy in croatia , for example , although grassroots projects are slowly beginning to gather momentum .
even in industrialized countries , it seems , introduction of climate protection measures comes with a high price tag . popular misconceptions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in cancun , debate is centering around mobilizing funds and technology transfer to cope with climate change one obstacle to globalized climate control is the general ignorance in the developed world of what exactly the developing world needs .
" indigenous knowledge on protecting natural resources and alternative energy supplies often exists , " points out kwa , stressing that all that 's then needed is a transfer of technology that can be implemented locally .
rainer osterwalder from the european patent office agrees , but says there 's plenty of room for improvement .
" the technology transfer from north to south is still unsatisfactory , " he says .
" one thing that should n't be forgotten is that emerging economies , and china in particular , are increasingly active when it comes to domestic innovation in the area of regenerative energy . "
" patents neither create problems nor solve them , " he says .
in his opinion , more urgent problems include inadequate infrastructure in the developing world ; the lack of an existing market for clean technologies and the lack of opportunity to build one .
adding to the problem is the popular misconception that patents are internationally valid .
in fact , if a patent is n't registered with the patent office of a specific country , then it does n't exist .
" a french company does n't necessarily register the patent for its photovoltaic technology in angola , say , if it believes that there 's no market for such a system in that country , " explains osterwalder .
in developing countries , however , few people are aware that many technologies are not actually patented in their country .
a spanner in the works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , local expertise is underestimated critics believe that ultimately , patent protection is a major stumbling block in fighting climate change .
in recent years , the european patent office has complained about the ‘ global patent warming , ' stressing that the increasing number of patent applications is slowing down the issue of patents .
the multitude of patent applications does not mean that the world is coming up with more innovations - rather , what is happening is that inventors and companies that already hold patents in one country are lining up at many other national patent offices to get patents for other markets .
ultimately , the purpose of securing a patent is to throw a spanner in the works of rival development .
the patents issue is one that results in the developing world feeling as though it has been left to deal with climate change by itself , by the very countries that are mainly responsible for it .
but industrialized nations retaliate by citing the free market and the necessary protection of intellectual property – and , needless to say , their own economic superiority . whether or not it is justifiable to privatize expertise in the field of regenerative energy is a question that will no doubt be raised at the current summit in cancun .

hochtief , which currently has five subsidiaries in qatar and employs more than five thousand people in the country , is to sell its shares at 57.114 euros a piece , which is less than the current stock price , but around the same as acs is offering .
the news of the deal between qatar and hochtief sent shares soaring , which as analysts were quick to point out , would make acs 's all-share offer considerably more expensive .
the group , headed by real madrid soccer club president florentino perez , has yet to comment on the latest twist in the takeover drama in which qatar shines as the white knight .
but there is nothing selfless about the oil-rich country 's intervention .
quite the reverse in fact .
" this is qatar 's moment and it has been working towards it for the past ten years , " kristian coates-ulrichsen , kuwait research fellow at the london school of economics told deutsche welle .
" it has been trying to diversify its name and create a brand ' qatar ' through the acquisition of high profile companies . "
sparkling portfolio among the country 's corporate portfolio are stakes in the german sports car manufacturer porsche , europe 's largest carmaker volkswagen , and arguably the most prestigious department store in the world , harrods .
and that is to name but a few .
bildunterschrift : harrods is one of qatar 's high-brand icons " they have been getting powerful external economies to buy into the image so as to reposition themselves , " coates-ulrichsen said .
" they plan to diversify away from being a gas and oil-based economy . "
and winning the bid for the 2022 soccer world cup has helped them on their way .
it means instant recognition and international acceptance of qatar as a global force , and it also puts the country ahead of its regional competitors .
" dubai and abu dhabi have been trying to do the same thing as qatar , but the world cup puts qatar to the front of the queue and overshadows everything else , " the economist added .
new infrastructure in the offing the gulf country 's stock exchange responded well to the news of the successful soccer bid , and taha abdel ghani , general manager of nama economic consulting told the afp news agency that it had " raised investors ' confidence in the qatari market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the qatar university stadium for the the 2022 world cup " there are huge sums of money that qatar has pledged to spend within a set period of time , " he said .
doubtless a lot of that money will go on infrastructure to make the first world cup to be held in the middle east a resounding success .
there is already talk of a joint venture between hochtief and qatar to build an entirely new city , designed to house 200,000 people and play a hosting role in the soccer championships .
hochtief ceo herbert luetkestratkoetter is optimistic that a construction boom is on the way .
" you need to be able to accommodate guests who come to the country , " he told reporters .
" it suits me just fine .
i 'm happy about it . "
strategic planning in that context , the decision to invest in the german construction company could be seen as highly strategic .
it would certainly sit with the country 's pattern of doing things .
a couple of years ago qatar invested in a shipyard in poland which was building tankers to transport its gas .
bildunterschrift : there 's much more to qatar than the sand on which it is built " it 's all part of a broader plan to diversify and meet the needs of the qatari economic strategy by investing in companies they can use , " coates-ulrichsen said .
" they match talent with economic niches . "
and as far as he is concerned they do it exceptionally well .
rather than bothering with speculative investment like some other gulf states , qatar has a clear vision of how it wants to diversify , namely into iconic western companies , construction and real estate .
this , the economist insists , will stand the country in great stead , opening not only economic , but political doors for what might once have been regarded as a small country in the middle of the desert .

now , a jewish museum is being built near the site . the construction of warsaw 's jewish museum is currently the most extensive cultural project in poland , though few in neighboring germany even know about it . the museum is being built in what was the warsaw ghetto during the period of nazi occupation .
nearby is the memorial to the victims of the warsaw uprising , in front of which former german chancellor willy brandt spontaneously knelt 40 years ago , on december 7 , 1970 .
it was an unprecedented act of humility that would become a milestone in polish-german ties . moral obligation to support museum plans for the jewish museum began in 1994 when then german president roman herzog got behind the project and oversaw the launch of a development foundation to fund it .
though the idea for the museum initially came from poland , the country lacked the necessary resources at that time . " roman herzog suddenly endorsed he idea , " said josef thesing , chairman of the development foundation .
" our foundation was started in order to make the idea a reality .
if we had n't managed to secure funding from the beginning , it never would have happened . " so far , the foundation has managed to acquire some 6 million euros -lrb- about $ 8 million -rrb- for the museum project ; by its completion in 2013 , costs are expected to total 90 million euros . thesing added that germany had a moral responsibility to invest in the warsaw museum . " i think that we can demonstrate that there is a different germany now , " he said .
" and , together with poles - who are now our friends in the european community - we can work through our past instead of denying it and look , with our unique perspective , toward a common future . " bildunterschrift : chancellor willy brandt 's humble gesture at the memorial to the victims of the warsaw uprising in 1970 was unplanned , but went down in history rich jewish tradition in poland the path to the future leads first through the past .
few poles are aware that the first known reference to their country was made in hebrew .
poland 's jewish roots go back a thousand years , according to auschwitz survivor marian turski . " we have no jews in poland - almost no jews .
the jews are present in history , they 're present in literature but there 's a vacuum in society , hence , the interest in those topics , " said turski .

now , a jewish museum is being built near the site . the construction of warsaw 's jewish museum is currently the most extensive cultural project in poland , though few in neighboring germany even know about it . the museum is being built in what was the warsaw ghetto during the period of nazi occupation .
nearby is the memorial to the victims of the warsaw ghetto uprising , in front of which former german chancellor willy brandt spontaneously knelt 40 years ago , on december 7 , 1970 .
it was an unprecedented act of humility that would become a milestone in polish-german ties . moral obligation to support museum plans for the jewish museum began in 1994 when then german president roman herzog got behind the project and oversaw the launch of a development foundation to fund it .
though the idea for the museum initially came from poland , the country lacked the necessary resources at that time . " roman herzog suddenly endorsed he idea , " said josef thesing , chairman of the development foundation .
" our foundation was started in order to make the idea a reality .
if we had n't managed to secure funding from the beginning , it never would have happened . " so far , the foundation has managed to acquire some 6 million euros -lrb- about $ 8 million -rrb- for the museum project ; by its completion in 2013 , costs are expected to total 90 million euros . thesing added that germany had a moral responsibility to invest in the warsaw museum . " i think that we can demonstrate that there is a different germany now , " he said .
" and , together with poles - who are now our friends in the european community - we can work through our past instead of denying it and look , with our unique perspective , toward a common future . " bildunterschrift : chancellor willy brandt 's humble gesture at the memorial to the victims of the warsaw uprising in 1970 was unplanned , but went down in history rich jewish tradition in poland the path to the future leads first through the past .
few poles are aware that the first known reference to their country was made in hebrew .
poland 's jewish roots go back a thousand years , according to auschwitz survivor marian turski . " we have no jews in poland - almost no jews .
the jews are present in history , they 're present in literature but there 's a vacuum in society , hence , the interest in those topics , " said turski .
" this is why we estimate that this will be one of the most-visited museums in poland . " it was marian turski who conceived the idea for the museum in the early 1990s .

not surprisingly , much of the focus of the discussions was what impact increasing eu coordination and involvement would have on the aid handed out by some of the world 's wealthiest countries to some of its poorest .
no one seemed particularly optimistic .
deputy chairman of the africa commission erastus mwencha , for example , said the body had too little power , asking for instance why the eu failed to have single coordinated positions at groups like the world trade organization .
representatives of aid groups , meanwhile , said they feared that more power in brussels would simply bring increased bureaucracy .

" what we call long processes and procedures that make it impossible for developing countries to make optimal benefits from the resources that come to them to reduce poverty . "
and the individual countries in the eu are also wary about handing over control of what have previously been national aid initiatives .
" as a member state with quite a lot of money and thereby quite a lot of responsibility , i have to see who is accountable , " said swedish development minister gunilla carlsson .
" that 's why it has been hard to devote all the money to brussels .
it has been rather anonymous , it 's really bureaucratic , and also as a donor , it 's very hard to have influence . "
carlsson was speaking from a position of moral high ground .
sweden is one of only five countries that have achieved aid targets formulated 40 years ago .
0.7 percent - not enough or too much ?
bildunterschrift : this ambulance is part of the millennium project , but larger aims are n't being met in 1970 , the un general assembly decided that the world 's wealthy countries should be devoting 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product to aid .
that goal was confirmed by the un millennium project , and the target date was set at 2015 .
the eu and its member states provide some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.6 billion -rrb- in aid annually , but in terms of percentage that figure does not come even close to the target .
oxfam says germany , for instance , spent only 0.35 percent of its 2009 gross domestic product on developmental assistance , slightly less than the year before , and is n't scheduled to meet the un goal until 2027 .
eu development commissioner andris piebalgs used the brussels event to remind eu members of their obligations .
" the real challenge is how europeans will use the 0.7 percent so that it really has the impact our taxpayers expect , " piebalgs said .
" our taxpayers expect that there is a visible change in the conditions of life in developing countries . "
but mentioning expectations and measureable effects also raises the sensitive issue of whether developmental aid truly works .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the money never gets to the poor aid , according to a famous quip attributed to british economist peter bauer , is " an excellent method for transferring money from poor people in rich countries to rich people in poor countries . "
and earlier this year , the free-market washington think-tank center for global development published a report claiming that the 0.7 percent figure was arbitrary , and that less money , if well spent , would do more to benefit poor people in , for instance , africa .
" the assumptions that in africa all aid becomes investment and all investment becomes growth have no empirical support , " the report 's authors concluded .
" the evidence is very strong that africa 's growth performance has been weak not from a lack of capital per se , but from low productivity of that capital . "
in other words , the problem is less about giving more money than about ensuring that money is used to generate lasting improvements .
for this reason , germany has been placing more and more emphasis on linking aid to good governance in recipient countries .
quid pro quo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel is among those who say that money is only as good as the results it yields although idealistic notions of human solidarity are one factor that motivates developmental aid , another is simple self-interest .
countries rich in natural resources such as libya , algeria and the central asia republics are increasingly becoming a focus of both german and european aid initiatives .
on a slightest less morally ambiguous note , most european countries see aid as a means of encouraging stability in poorer countries and thus a vastly cheaper alternative to military interventions .
germany 's development minister dirk niebel recently made this point with reference to afghanistan .
" we assume that , if we want to bring our soldiers home , our efforts have to put a clear emphasis on civilian support , " niebel told reporters .
" the citizens of afghanistan need a true peace dividend .
they have to see that our effort clearly betters their personal living conditions .
that will have on an effect on regions that are n't so secure and others where we would hope to see some quick improvements . "
this " butter versus guns " ideal is , of course , anything but new , but it does underscore a point that increasing numbers of european and world leaders are making .
where aid is concerned , delivery counts every bit as much as amount .

" the assumptions that in africa all aid becomes investment and all investment becomes growth have no empirical support , " the report 's authors concluded .
" the evidence is very strong that africa 's growth performance has been weak not from a lack of capital per se , but from low productivity of that capital . "
in other words , the problem is less about giving more money than about ensuring that money is used to generate lasting improvements .
for this reason , germany has been placing more and more emphasis on linking aid to good governance in recipient countries .
quid pro quo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel is among those who say that money is only as good as the results it yields although idealistic notions of human solidarity are one factor that motivates developmental aid , another is simple self-interest .
countries rich in natural resources such as libya , algeria and the central asia republics are increasingly becoming a focus of both german and european aid initiatives .
on a slightest less morally ambiguous note , most european countries see aid as a means of encouraging stability in poorer countries and thus a vastly cheaper alternative to military interventions .
germany 's development minister dirk niebel recently made this point with reference to afghanistan .
" we assume that , if we want to bring our soldiers home , our efforts have to put a clear emphasis on civilian support , " niebel told reporters .
" the citizens of afghanistan need a true peace dividend .
they have to see that our effort clearly betters their personal living conditions .
that will have on an effect on regions that are n't so secure and others where we would hope to see some quick improvements . "
this " butter versus guns " ideal is , of course , anything but new , but it does underscore a point that increasing numbers of european and world leaders are making .
where aid is concerned , delivery counts every bit as much as amount .

but academic peformance of a select group in select subjects may not yield the complete picture . the organization for economic cooperation and development conducted the survey among the oecd 's 34 member nations as well as in 41 partner economies in 2009 .
the results show asians did exceptionally well .
the 15-year-old students were evaluated in reading , mathematics and science .
improved school curricula and teachers ' training are being cited as the reasons for the top peformer 's success .
china 's boomtown shanghai 's success in topping the list is the result of recent changes in the school curriculum , the oecd claims .
students are given more choice in what they study .
in shanghai , teachers from the high-achieving schools are regularyly sent to schools with lower scores to improve the latter 's performance .
apparently , the city has even reformed college entrance examinations to put more emphasis on the handling of information rather than on learning things by rote .
factors still to be examined the true picture may be less rosy .
shanghai is a single city , whereas other countries are judged as a whole .
the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- claims that the study proves that low national income " is not incompatible " with good educational performance .
whether within the country or in comparison with other countries , it is the relative income that usually makes the difference .
and as the oecd itself has announced , the more specific social , economic and cultural factors behind asia 's success are still to be examined .
goals , ways and means tao hongkai , an education expert from wuhan , china , told the afp news agency in beijing that grades still remained the sole criteria for judging the performance of a child or student in china - obedience and high grades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seoul students compete during a korean olympiad in informatics south korea spends more than any other oecd country on private education , but spends relatively little on public education , which widens the gap between high and low achievers .
and korean students participate in the pisa test in the spirit of the olympics : they must get the gold for their country .
it might well be that academic performance should and can not be the most important criterion if the ultimate goal of education is to shape a complete human being and a responsible citizen .

but know-how , often protected by patents , is trickling way too slowly from industrialized nations to poorer regions . every few years , world leaders get together at high-profile conferences to discuss ways to reduce global warming and save the planet . the 2010 united nations climate change conference is currently being held in cancun , mexico .
but the talks are taking place amid low expectations , after the disappointment of the copenhagen summit last year – which memorably failed to produce any binding agreements .
this came as a particular blow to the g77 countries , which have in fact expanded to 131 mostly developing nations .
their demands include a relaxation , if not a general lifting , of patent protection laws governing renewable energies .
their argument is that it is first and foremost the industrialized nations that are responsible for climate change , while the poorer nations pay the price for the wealthier countries ' mistakes .
therefore industrialized nations should at least give them the benefit of their green energy know-how .
sharing their patents would go some way to paying off their climate debts , the g77 countries say .
the patent imbalance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patents get in the way of technology transfer between developed and developing nations according to a new study compiled by the un environment program , 80 percent of all patented innovations in the area of clean energy technologies are registered by companies in japan , germany , us , south korea , britain and france .
the report , which examines the role of patents in combating climate change , was jointly conducted with the european patent office and the international centre for trade and sustainable development .
" the fact that northern countries keep their expertise on regenerative energies to themselves , puts the south at an additional disadvantage , " says aileen kwa from south center , an intergovernmental policy think tank of developing countries .
as a climate-friendly , affordable alternative to fossil fuels , clean energy is key to the future of the developing world , and allows people to access energy supplies without having to rely on major providers .
moreover , it decentralizes the energy supply .
in countries where the majority of the population is rural , solar panels and geothermal heat pumps installed in individual homes are energy efficient solutions for people who would otherwise go without .
one problem , however , is the frequent lack of local expertise necessary not only to install the technology , but also to maintain it .
not only does the equipment therefore need to be imported – the know-how does to .
if patents are a factor , the whole process soon becomes very costly .
but it 's not only developing nations that have some catching-up to do on the clean energy front .
green technology is still very much in its infancy in croatia , for example , although grassroots projects are slowly beginning to gather momentum .
even in industrialized countries , it seems , introduction of climate protection measures comes with a high price tag . popular misconceptions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in cancun , debate is centering around mobilizing funds and technology transfer to cope with climate change one obstacle to globalized climate control is the general ignorance in the developed world of what exactly the developing world needs .
" indigenous knowledge on protecting natural resources and alternative energy supplies often exists , " points out kwa , stressing that all that 's then needed is a transfer of technology that can be implemented locally .
rainer osterwalder from the european patent office agrees , but says there 's plenty of room for improvement .
" the technology transfer from north to south is still unsatisfactory , " he says .
" one thing that should n't be forgotten is that emerging economies , and china in particular , are increasingly active when it comes to domestic innovation in the area of regenerative energy . "
" patents neither create problems nor solve them , " he says .
in his opinion , more urgent problems include inadequate infrastructure in the developing world ; the lack of an existing market for clean technologies and the lack of opportunity to build one .
adding to the problem is the popular misconception that patents are internationally valid .
in fact , if a patent is n't registered with the patent office of a specific country , then it does n't exist .
" a french company does n't necessarily register the patent for its photovoltaic technology in angola , say , if it believes that there 's no market for such a system in that country , " explains osterwalder .
in developing countries , however , few people are aware that many technologies are not actually patented in their country .
a spanner in the works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , local expertise is underestimated critics believe that ultimately , patent protection is a major stumbling block in fighting climate change .
in recent years , the european patent office has complained about the ‘ global patent warming , ' stressing that the increasing number of patent applications is slowing down the issue of patents .
the multitude of patent applications does not mean that the world is coming up with more innovations - rather , what is happening is that inventors and companies that already hold patents in one country are lining up at many other national patent offices to get patents for other markets .
ultimately , the purpose of securing a patent is to throw a spanner in the works of rival development .
the patents issue is one that results in the developing world feeling as though it has been left to deal with climate change by itself , by the very countries that are mainly responsible for it .
but industrialized nations retaliate by citing the free market and the necessary protection of intellectual property – and , needless to say , their own economic superiority . whether or not it is justifiable to privatize expertise in the field of regenerative energy is a question that will no doubt be raised at the current summit in cancun .

a major sticking point to any potential deal has been the fact that the us and china are not signed up to the accord .
" there is a challenge that not everyone is part of the kyoto protocol " , eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard told a press conference in cancun .
but as the talks enter the final stages , china and the us have confirmed their commitment to emissions reductions – a move that could save the talks .
developing countries have said they wo n't move towards any new treaty until members of the kyoto protocol agree to extend the treaty beyond 2012 .
but japan , russia and canada have refused to extend kyoto without the participation of the world 's two top polluters - china , which has no requirements as a developing country , and the united states , which rejected the treaty in 2001 .
together , china and the us emit about 40 percent of the world 's greenhouse gases .
japan , russia and canada want a separate agreement regulating all nations .
" there are huge concerns about the position of japan .
we 're seeing some signals of possible flexibility from the japanese , but the japanese have to not stand in the way of a decision that reaffirms a second commitment period , " alden meyer from the union of concerned scientists told a press conference in cancun .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer is concerned about japan 's position game-changer in an apparent about turn , which could potentially save the climate talks , china announced on monday that it would be prepared to make emissions reductions binding .
" we can create a resolution and that resolution can be binding on china , " said huang huikang , the chinese foreign ministry 's envoy for climate change talks , in an interview with reuters .
china 's offer to make its existing , domestic pledge to reduce its " carbon intensity " - the amount of the main greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , emitted for each dollar of economic growth - binding under a un resolution is a compromise it hopes will encourage developed countries to continue the existing kyoto protocol .
" china wants to avoid a collapse of the talks , " ruth davis from greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" they 're trying to create a landing space for japan to come back on board without losing face " .
china 's target would still be voluntary , stressed china 's chief negotiator xie zhenhua , in contrast to developed nation targets under kyoto .
targets for developed countries are imposed by the international community , but beijing 's targets would be offered to the community by china .
analysts were generally positive about china 's proposal .
" this is a game-changer , " said jennifer morgan from the washington-based world resources institute .
but the details of china ‘ s pledge remain unclear .
" china may ask for different conditions to developed countries whose emissions reductions are subject to international scrutiny and monitoring , " ruth davis told deutsche welle .
china in the past has refused to be part of a binding agreement involving outside verification that it is making good on its pledges to curb emissions .
low key us appearance us involvement is also seen as a linchpin for an international agreement .
" there can be no doubt that in the european union , we have time and again told our american friends why we thought it was very important that they engage in this agenda , " said eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chu reaffirmed obama 's commitment to fighting climate change on a brief visit to cancun , us energy secretary steven chu confirmed that president barack obama was committed to meeting us pledges made in copenhagen to curb carbon emissions from 2005 levels by 17 percent by 2020 .
" he absolutely feels that moving toward a clean energy economy is really about our energy security and about our financial security , " chu said .
" it 's about our economy ; it 's about the future of the planet . "
this is despite the republican party 's election victory last month , which says forced emission cuts would hurt a fragile economy .
some republicans also doubt the science behind climate change .
this all but ended the prospect of the united states approving legislation to restrict carbon emissions .
chu highlighted efforts by the obama administration to encourage low-carbon technology , including 90 billion dollars towards clean energy in its economic stimulus package .
the administration has set up research laboratories for green research and offered tax incentives to pursue eco-friendly energy .
air of optimism amid diplomatic leaks environmentalists seem to agree that there is a more hopeful tone at this year 's talks in cancun .
" over the past week , we have seen a vastly improved atmosphere in these talks than we 've seen over the past year , " said wendel trio , greenpeace international 's director of climate policy .
mexico has so far received plaudits for running an open process that has kept the mood at the cancun talks more positive than in copenhagen where major global powers negotiated behind closed doors , a move that irked many developing countries .
but disclosures by wikileaks this week threatened to sour the mood .
the leaked memos showed that the united states and european union worked together aggressively to sell the copenhagen deal last year .
bildunterschrift : delegates have until the end of the week to forge an agreement on how to tackle climate change in one cable , reported by the british newspaper the guardian , hedegaard is quoted as telling a us official that small island nations " could be our best allies " as they need financial assistance from wealthy states .
the goal would be to step up pressure on developing countries such as india and brazil to sign up .
such emerging powers have taken growing action on climate change but stated adamantly that the measures are voluntary and that rich nations bear historic responsibility for the problem .
a leaked cable also said the european union and united states looked at ways to " neutralize , co-opt or marginalize " countries seen as " unhelpful " - particularly venezuela and bolivia , which have raised persistent objections during climate negotiations on issues both of substance and process .
asked about the leaks , hedegaard said that the cables offered a " one-sided and selected " us account of conversations .
she denied any untoward pressure toward the most vulnerable nations such as maldives , saying : " for many reasons we want to work very much with them . "
hedegaard said she did not believe the disclosures would hurt the cancun talks , saying everyone knows " that you discuss a lot of things " in negotiations .
but bolivian negotiator pablo solon said he was " greatly concerned " by the disclosures .
the cables " confirm what we 've always been saying and the united states has been denying : the interference , pressure and blackmail regrettably conducted by the us administration , " he said .

but academic peformance of a select group in select subjects may not yield the complete picture . the organization for economic cooperation and development conducted the survey among the oecd 's 34 member nations as well as in 41 partner economies in 2009 .
the results show asians did exceptionally well .
the 15-year-old students were evaluated in reading , mathematics and science .
improved school curricula and teachers ' training are being cited as the reasons for the top peformer 's success .
china 's boomtown shanghai 's success in topping the list is the result of recent changes in the school curriculum , the oecd claims .
students are given more choice in what they study .
in shanghai , teachers from the high-achieving schools are regularyly sent to schools with lower scores to improve the latter 's performance .
apparently , the city has even reformed college entrance examinations to put more emphasis on the handling of information rather than on learning things by rote .
factors still to be examined the true picture may be less rosy .
shanghai is a single city , whereas other countries are judged as a whole .
the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- claims that the study proves that low national income " is not incompatible " with good educational performance .
whether within the country or in comparison with other countries , it is the relative income that usually makes the difference .
and as the oecd itself has announced , the more specific social , economic and cultural factors behind asia 's success are still to be examined .
goals , ways and means tao hongkai , an education expert from wuhan , china , told the afp news agency in beijing that grades still remained the sole criteria for judging the performance of a child or student in china - obedience and high grades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seoul students compete during a korean olympiad in informatics south korea spends more than any other oecd country on private education , but spends relatively little on public education , which widens the gap between high and low achievers .
and korean students participate in the pisa test in the spirit of the olympics : they must get the gold for their country .
it might well be that academic performance should and can not be the most important criterion if the ultimate goal of education is to shape a complete human being and a responsible citizen .

assange faces rape charges in sweden . wikileaks founder julian assange has been denied bail and will remain in custody until a december 14 extradition hearing .
assange was arrested in london on tuesday on suspicion of rape , after a european arrest warrant was issued by swedish authorities .
assange had turned himself in to london police earlier in the day .
he had been staying at an undisclosed location somewhere in britain .
in the westminster magistrates court , senior district judge howard riddle said assange posed a significant flight risk if he was granted bail , adding that " these are extremely serious allegations . "
during the hearing , assange indicated his intent to fight the extradition .
he has the right to appeal the extradition in higher courts .

the website and assange have both come under fire in the united states as threats to national security , and on monday , us attorney general eric holder said he would be looking into the possibility of any crimes that could be associated with the leaking of the documents .
lawyers for assange have expressed concern that if he were to be extradited to sweden , he may then be sent to the united states .

foreign minister kevin rudd said australia would support assange as it would any australian arrested abroad , adding that he was entitled to a presumption of innocence just like any australian citizen .
rudd said the australian consul general in london spoke to assange on tuesday following his arrest , to ensure he had legal representation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 07.12.2010 concern over politicization of top donor governments ’ aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philip tamminga an international organization , which evaluates the effectiveness of donor governments ’ aid for people suffering from conflicts , disasters and climate change , has released its 2010 humanitarian response index . the dara index -lrb- hri -rrb- assesses responses to crises by the world 's top donor governments – members of the disaster action committee of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
now in its fourth year , the hri examines performance under five “ pillars ” of donor practice : response to needs ; prevention , risk reduction and recovery ; working with partners ; protection and international humanitarian law ; and learning and accountability .
denmark tops the hri ranking list followed by ireland , new zealand , norway , and sweden , while the european commission comes in sixth .
the head of the hri team , philip tamminga , talked with deutsche welle about the latest index and how political priorities have impeded the delivery of humanitarian aid to millions .
deutsche welle : germany does n't appear to have done too well in your assessment .
why is that ?
philip tamminga : germany is ranked 14th -lsb- out of 20 -rsb- in the index this year , just after canada and australia , but before japan and france . germany spends a lot less on humanitarian assistance than other countries , and the percentage of its aid dedicated to humanitarian crises is about half of the average of other donors . so it lags somewhat behind other countries .
other factors that explain germany 's position in the ranking is that it has too many restrictive conditions on its aid funding .
this sometimes makes it difficult for the humanitarian organizations it funds to have enough flexibility to direct aid where it is needed or to adapt programmes if the situation changes on the ground - which happens quite often in a disaster or conflict .
germany could also do better at funding un and red cross appeals , and make better use of regular evaluations to improve the quality and effectiveness of the assistance it provides .
germany does have many strengths , though .
for instance , it tends to provide funding rapidly in cases of disasters , and it 's a strong supporter of ngos .
it is also one of the better donor governments in terms of its commitment towards accountability to people affected by crises - making sure aid is effective and responds to their needs . could you explain briefly how exactly the assessment is done – what are the key tools and methodology employed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid is much-needed in many corners of the globe we assess donors by looking at 35 different indicators of how well they support humanitarian action and apply good practices .
the indicators are based on the core concepts contained in the declaration of good humanitarian donorship , which was developed and signed by the world 's main donor governments - including germany - in 2003 .
what we want to see is if governments are respecting the commitments they made , so we send teams to different humanitarian crises and we talk to the different humanitarian organizations about how well the governments that fund their work are applying good practice .
we combine this with publicly available information from published sources on government aid funding , respect of international humanitarian law , and other elements of good donor practice .
this year , our teams visited 14 humanitarian crises areas like haiti , afghanistan , somalia , sudan and pakistan , and we spoke to over 500 senior officials working in these crises from the united nations , the red cross and the red crescent , ngos , donor governments and others .
we also collected nearly 2,000 survey responses .
this gives us a good basis to measure and compare donor governments each year on whether their policies and practices facilitate or impede an effective response to crises .
the report says that there 's ample evidence of politicization of aid .
exactly what evidence do you have to show that political interests have overtaken the commitment to good humanitarian donorship ?
in 10 of the 14 crises we visited , we saw and heard of evidence that donor governments were placing political interests above humanitarian objectives . in some cases , like afghanistan , the use of western military forces to provide humanitarian assistance is compromising the neutrality , impartiality and independence of humanitarian organizations , and putting humanitarian workers and civilians at risk .
we also saw in some places like somalia , the occupied palestinian territories or yemen , some donor governments are putting restrictions on humanitarian organizations that prevents them from working in areas controlled by certain groups like hamas , as part of the " war on terror . "
this means the people in need are not getting the aid they deserve .
in other crises , there are debates about how foreign aid can help win " hearts and minds " or achieve other foreign policy objectives .
one of the most basic humanitarian principles – which donor governments committed themselves to when they signed the good donorship declaration – is that humanitarian assistance should be given without discrimination , and based on needs alone – and not because it may or may not help a government achieve other objectives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastation left behind by the 2005 tsunami the hri report claims that there are gaps in the protection of civilians and that the lack of safe humanitarian access has put vulnerable groups at risk of harm .
basically , this refers to the promotion of international humanitarian law and goes beyond programming issues – is the report referring to diplomacy efforts in this direction ? yes , the report is clear that as a result of politicization , safe access by humanitarian organizations to people affected by crisis is being compromised . because of that , humanitarian workers are at risk , and civilian populations are not getting the protection and assistance they need .
a recent example of this lack of protection was seen in the mass rapes that took place in the democratic republic of the congo .
and the safety of humanitarian workers is also at stake : last year over 260 humanitarians were killed , kidnapped or injured while trying to carry out their work .
you have also accused donors of failing to improve transparency and accountability towards affected people .
which countries have fared well under this pillar and which poorly ?
donor governments are not doing enough to promote better accountability towards people affected by disasters and crises .
there are lots of requirements on humanitarian organizations to report on how they have spent the money they get , and what kind of results , but very few donor governments have in place requirements to monitor and ensure that aid money is being used to meet the needs and priorities of the actual people affected by the crisis .
most professional humanitarian organizations already do this to some extent , but donor governments are not monitoring and following up adequately , and supporting these efforts . another concern is that donor governments are not being transparent or accountable on the aid that they promise . for example , many governments have still not disbursed all the funds that they promised after the earthquake in haiti .
and while the promises are made in the media or in international conferences , most of the time , the people affected do n't receive any information about this , and do n't have any way to participate directly on how that aid will be prioritized or spent .
this is why we call on governments to improve their transparency and accountability . germany tends to do better than other donors in this area , and could perhaps take the lead in building more commitment amongst donor governments .
what 's been donor governments ' response to this ranking system – surely some are n't happy with the whole exercise ?
some governments have told us that they think a ranking system is counterproductive , and does n't encourage or motivate donor governments to do better .
but in fact , some of the lowest ranked donors have told us they appreciate having a tool like the humanitarian response index to benchmark their performance and to know where they stand compared to their peers . the ranking is only a minor part of the exercise , though .
we collect a lot of valuable information about how donors are performing , and we have always offered this information to governments , donor agencies and other stakeholders to use it to understand where a government may need to improve , and where they are doing well .
by visiting 14 crises areas – the biggest evaluation exercise of its kind in the humanitarian sector – we are able to identify trends that affect the quality and impact of aid .
so we have lots of valuable analysis to share with the international community , such as our increasing concerns about politicization of aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food for those who need it most you must have confronted questions relating to legitimacy , though – what gives dara the authority to rank donor performance ?
first of all , dara has a great multi-disciplinary team with extensive experience in the field of evaluating humanitarian action . we were part of the huge tsunami joint evaluation exercise on how the entire humanitarian system responded .
dara looked specifically at the area of donor funding , which gave us insights on how they took decisions , and why good practice was so difficult for them to apply .
that was the basis for us creating the humanitarian response index – to systematically measure donor practice and provide solid , empirical evidence on where donor governments need to improve further . since then , we have carried out hri evaluations in over 35 crises , along with our extensive evaluation experience in other areas .
we also felt it was absolutely critical for an independent , objective evaluation of donor governments .
until the hri was created , there was no way to monitor if donor governments were complying with their commitments .
most of the tools and processes used by donors to assess their own performance are not transparent enough , and do n't look at issues around the quality of their aid , or the relationship with the humanitarian organizations they fund .
we think the hri can be used to stimulate changes and improvements .
has the hri , since its inception in 2007 , had a measurable impact on donors ?
if so , could you give some examples ?
yes .
the index has helped to raise many issues and concerns facing the humanitarian sector in general , and several donor governments have now taken this up as an issue for discussion at the international level .
for example , our findings in the 2008 report called for improvements in the way that humanitarian needs are identified so that aid could be distributed more effectively and fairly .
now , many governments are working with humanitarian organizations to address this gap .
some governments have used our findings as part of their overall evaluation of their aid programs and policies .
and dara has also begun working with some donor governments to provide a more detailed assessment on how they are doing , with recommendations on where to change and improve . next year we hope to carry out an evaluation of the impact of the hri after its first five years , where we can show how and where it has had an influence .
in the meantime , we will continue to offer our support and analysis to governments and other stakeholders who are interested in making sure that aid efforts help people affected by crisis .

by the time french banks closed on tuesday , very few appeared to have followed his call . tens of thousands of people heard the call by former french footballer eric cantona to bring down the banking system that sparked the global economic crisis - but few acted on it on tuesday , the day cantona suggested his anti-capitalist revolution should begin . the protests were few , isolated and largely symbolic .
one group of activists in paris emptied their bank accounts from a branch of societe generale and opened accounts at the nearby branch of a cooperative bank .
but in general , it was business as usual in france 's banking institutions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests were few and far between cantona , now a successful actor and an icon to many , had appealed to people to withdraw their money from the banks in an attempt to punish the " corrupt , criminal " banking system .
" the three million people in the street , they go to the bank , withdraw their money , and the banks collapse ...
that 's a real threat , there 's a real revolution , " the ex-football star said in an online video watched by tens of thousands of people in france and beyond .
naive and misguided french and european politicians and bankers condemned cantona 's philosophizing on the future of the banking sector as irresponsible .
his calls for mass bank withdrawals met with sharp criticism from the french finance minister .
christine lagarde said cantona should stop " intervening in finance and economics , especially when he does n't fully understand the mechanics of it . "
the head of the eurogroup of finance ministers , jean-claude juncker , called the scheme " irresponsible " and eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn said : " i think mr cantona is a better footballer than he is an economist . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 07.12.2010 germany 's schools improve their grades modestly in global league tables großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading and writing skills still represent germany 's achilles ' heel germany is back into the ' first division ' when it comes to education around the world , but still needs to raise its game to secure qualification for the champions ' league .
so say the organizers of the pisa studies . an international study into the abilities of 15 year-old schoolchildren has shown that german children have been making steady progress in recent years .
however , germany 's results in the fourth program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- study , released on tuesday , were hardly stellar either .
like the inaugural study in 2000 , in which germany scored disastrously for a developed country , this 2009 investigation focused on literacy skills among students .
the german grade improved by 13 points to 497 , representing an average score for industrialized countries .
nevertheless , german 15 year-olds are roughly one school year behind their counterparts in table-topping countries like finland -lrb- 536 points -rrb- or south korea -lrb- 539 -rrb- .
" germany has been promoted from the second division to the top flight , " the berlin head of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , heino von meyer , said at a press conference on tuesday .
" but germany 's still a long way away from qualifying for the champions ' league . "
the oecd conducts the pisa study in 65 countries , testing almost half a million teenagers in the process .
roughly 5,000 randomly-selected german children from 230 schools took part in the study .
germany also made progress in the smaller mathematics and science sections of the study , and can now boast above-average performance against comparable countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students are as good as their teachers , the study concludes " germany has improved its status from ' horrendous ' to ' average , ' we are at least satisfied with that upward trend , " the chairwoman of the german government 's education committee , ulla burchardt said .
" but i do n't think this is cause for celebration , rather continued reflection .
we 're still struggling when it comes to literacy skills ; and these are the most important qualifications for young school leavers seeking a job and a place in society . "
shortly before the publication of the pisa results , education minister annette schavan pledged to implement a new program encouraging youngsters to read in their free time .
top teachers = top marks the pisa study highlighted the importance of placing quality teachers in the classroom .
" it 's crucial that schools try to secure the brightest available brains , " the coordinator of the pisa study , andreas schleicher , said in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" countries like finland are doing a great job of this . "
schleicher also criticized the syllabus-driven schooling system prevalent in the western world , likening the modern day teacher to an assembly line worker .
" somebody publishes a lesson plan , and then the teacher is expected to sit down in the classroom and follow it . "
in the first pisa study in 2000 , 22.6 percent of german 15 year-olds were at least two years behind the average level for literacy and numeracy , and that figure has only dropped to 18.5 percent in the interim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the word pisa has become a headache for students , teachers , and politicians alike " it is imperative that we reduce the size of this group of 15 year-olds whose reading , writing and arithmetic skills are still at an elementary school level , " education researcher at the university of muenster , professor ewald terhart said .
" this is only possible by changing the teaching methods in the relevant subjects , and to do that , we need to give additional training to our teachers .
it will cost time and money , but it 's the only way to meaningfully change the quality of teaching . "
social status still decisive factor the vast majority of the lowest scoring german students hail either from less wealthy families or from families with immigrant backgrounds , or both .
the gap in performance between children from these groups and the average german student remains greater than in most pisa participants .
however , the study also noted that the discrepancy had shrunk considerably in the past decade .
traditionally , german high schools have been split up into three tiers , and oecd officials praised initiatives in some german states to merge the bottom two tiers , saying this would help prevent children from falling adrift in the future .
pisa officials also recommended that germany consider restructuring class sizes in its school system .
currently , average class sizes tend to get progressively smaller as children get older .
however , the study notes that young children benefit more from small classes , while teenagers cope with larger groups more effectively .
the 2003 pisa study focused on mathematics , and in 2006 , science was the principal subject assessed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 07.12.2010 is the eu emergency fund big enough ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb is in charge of monetary but not fiscal policy eu finance ministers said monday that they would not be taking new measures to tackle the current debt crisis in the bloc .
deutsche welle spoke with tom kirchmaier of the london school of economics about the decision . eurozone finance ministers met on monday evening to discuss increasing the emergency fund but ultimately decided it was big enough .
is it ?
at the moment it is enough .
but the problem is a different one .
you arrange a fund like this to send a signal to the market that there is no point in speculating against the currency .
so by not increasing the fund , the eurozone finance ministers send a signal that there might actually be a point in speculating against larger countries like spain .
so in that way , they made the markets less stable , not more .
you do n't think markets are convinced yet that the debt crisis is contained ?
the funds are enough to support countries like greece and portugal , they are not enough to support countries like spain , or belgium , or italy .
it 's an arithmetic game , and you come up with a number that 's around one-and-a-half trillion , or two trillion euros and you come up with a guarantee where you can say , this is rock solid .
the number is just so big that it becomes clear to everybody that a speculator ca n't win .
another idea that had been floated prior to monday evening 's meeting , but was then not discussed , was that of bonds issued jointly by the eurozone countries .
is that a good idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the efsf is not big enough for markets to take it seriously " it 's a good idea in principle , but it 's very far-fetched politically .
one of the problems with the eurozone - and it 's a problem from birth - is that monetary policy is done by the european central bank , but fiscal policy is done by each of the member states .
and that creates almost perverse incentives for the individual member states to over-consume , which is what they have done .
one of the ways to solve this problem is to centralize fiscal policy , i.e. to make more fiscal decisions in brussels .
if you launch a euro bond , you essentially do exactly that because you then unify all the risks which you have in the eurozone .
for it to work , you have to have a centralized fiscal policy .
interestingly , china and sovereign wealth funds are very keen for europe to issue these bonds because they would be highly liquid and a good alternative to a us treasury bond .
both the bigger emergency fund and the euro bonds are supposed to convince markets of the " irreversibility " of the euro , as luxemberg 's prime minister jean claude juncker put it .
is the euro in fact " irreversible " or can you imagine a scenario in which this common currency would fold ?
nothing is irreversible .
it would unravel the minute that germany in particular were to make the tiniest suggestion about leaving .
it would be possible to reverse the euro , but it would have catastrophic consequences .
on one hand , you would see a bank run with weaker countries - everybody would try to get their money and put it in a german bank account and that would lead to an immediate collapse of the banking system in that country .
it would be catastrophic for the european idea , for these weak economies , and if germany were to decide to leave , it would not be good for germany either because the currency would appreciate dramatically .
next week at a eu summit , leaders are expected to agree on permanent eurozone rescue mechanisms , since the current emergency fund expires in 2013 .
what could or what should these permanent mechanisms look like ?
the issue of " permanent " only makes sense if the fund is large and credible enough .
at the moment i do n't see that we are getting any closer to making a credible long-term commitment to stability .
the only really credible commitment would be to integrate fiscal policy further .

russia now appears to be on its way to membership , despite the longest running negotiations in history . on tuesday , european union commission president jose manuel barroso announced a breakthrough to clear the way for russia 's entry to the world trade organization .
" our difficult bilateral issues are resolved .
we signed a memorandum of understanding to this end today , " barroso said at the brussels summit .
as part of the agreement , russia has pledged to lower export duties on timber and asian freight that travels to europe via russian railways .
the road to wto membership is usually long and paved with obstacles - but russia 's ongoing 17-year journey is a world record .
the nation with a 90 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- economy is the largest outside the wto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower export duties on russian timber will benefit eu paper makers the blame game frustrated russian politicians blame politically-motivated delay tactics employed by the us and the eu , while trade diplomats in geneva fault russia for failing to understand the rules of the organization .
the key to speeding up the process now lies in moscow , according to wto spokesman keith rockwell .
" the pace of accession is in almost every instance driven by the capital of the country that is acceding , " rockwell said .
in many instances the reforms that are required to join the wto are politically difficult - which is certainly the case in russia , he added .
" there are sectors of the russian economy that find the process of joining the wto very difficult . "
making nice with the neighbors moscow must now get approval from the other members of the wto , a process that includes entering talks with any of the 153 wto members that wish to negotiate .
on monday , russian president dmitri medvedev made the first state visit by a kremlin leader to poland in nine years , and secured poland 's support for russia 's wto accession .
but not all bilateral talks have been constructive .
georgia , russia 's neighbor to the south , has been a wto member for ten years , and has blocked the russian accession process since the armed conflict in the summer of 2008 .
ukraine , too , still has not given a green light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland supports russia 's accession to the wto a veto , however , is unlikely , says alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations .
" in my opinion , in doing so , georgia would harm itself , given the fact that the eu and the us both want russia in the wto and not out of it .
such a move by the georgians would jeopardize the agenda which the west has set up with russia , " rahr told deutche welle .
a powerful partner the european union , with 500 million people , is russia 's largest trading partner .
if russia joins the world trade organization , the nation will be unable to impose arbitrary import bans , drastic tariff increases , and import restrictions without risking sanctions .
exporting nations such as germany would benefit from easier market access , says wto spokesman rockwell , adding that membership for russia would provide german exporters , as well as their japanese and american counterparts , with " a certain sense of predictability " when they enter into business transactions in that country .
" that makes the country a more attractive place for doing business , " said rockwell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keith rockwell speaks for the wto which represents more than 97 percent of global trade a rocky start in the past , russia has been less than committed to the process of joining the wto .
in june 2009 , prime minister vladimir putin declared out of the blue that russia was withdrawing its application for accession to the wto .
instead , his country would join the world trade organization as a customs union , together with kazakhstan and belarus .
in 2007 , in his capacity as president , putin lost patience with geneva 's trade diplomacy , labeling the wto as " archaic , undemocratic and inflexible . "
but the wto wo n't hold a grudge , said keith rockwell .
" we are very thick-skinned in the wto , " the spokesman said , adding mr. putin would be welcome for a visit any time . " we would be very happy to see him here . "

by the time french banks closed on tuesday , very few appeared to have followed his call . tens of thousands of people heard the call by former french footballer eric cantona to bring down the banking system that sparked the global economic crisis - but few acted on it on tuesday , the day cantona suggested his anti-capitalist revolution should begin . the protests were few , isolated and largely symbolic .
one group of activists in paris emptied their bank accounts from a branch of societe generale and opened accounts at the nearby branch of a cooperative bank .
but in general , it was business as usual in france 's banking institutions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests were few and far between cantona , now a successful actor and an icon to many , had appealed to people to withdraw their money from the banks in an attempt to punish the " corrupt , criminal " banking system .
" the three million people in the street , they go to the bank , withdraw their money , and the banks collapse ...
that 's a real threat , there 's a real revolution , " the ex-football star said in an online video watched by tens of thousands of people in france and beyond .
naive and misguided french and european politicians and bankers condemned cantona 's philosophizing on the future of the banking sector as irresponsible .
his calls for mass bank withdrawals met with sharp criticism from the french finance minister .
christine lagarde said cantona should stop " intervening in finance and economics , especially when he does n't fully understand the mechanics of it . "
the head of the eurogroup of finance ministers , jean-claude juncker , called the scheme " irresponsible " and eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn said : " i think mr cantona is a better footballer than he is an economist . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 07.12.2010 cash-strapped ireland awaits brutal 2011 austerity budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one down , 5,999,999,999 to go irish finance minister brian lenihan is to present his proposed 2011 budget to parliament later on tuesday , and it 's unlikely to make pleasant reading .
the debt-ridden country needs to fill a six billion euro hole . ireland 's already unpopular ruling party , fianna fail , will on tuesday present the toughest budget in the country 's history .
finance minister brian lenihan has already announced that dublin will be looking to raise an extra six billion euros -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- in 2011 , through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts .
due to the domestic budget presentation , lenihan has been forced to skip the high profile eurogroup meeting in brussels this week addressing the eurozone 's debt woes , sending ministry officials in his place .
the irish government effectively issued an outline of its plans for the coming year two weeks ago , when ironing out a broad four-year national recovery plan in order to qualify for an 85 billion euro rescue deal from the european union and international monetary fund .
the first tranche of these emergency loans will not be released until the budget is passed .
to placate the eu and imf , ireland needs to generate an extra 15 billion euros by 2014 , as it battles to bring its annual budget deficit back within the prescribed eurozone limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
this year 's deficit , which has ballooned due to the government bailout of the country 's biggest moneylender , anglo irish bank , is likely to be 32 percent of gdp .
" the budget is usually the most eagerly anticipated event in the fiscal calendar , " economist dermot o 'leary at goodbody stockbrokers in dublin told the afp news agency .
" this year though , the thunder has been stolen by the release of last week 's four-year plan .
we already know the broad parameters of what will be contained in the budget for 2011 . "
cuts in public sector , taxes to rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands protested when the initial recovery plan was announced roughly two-thirds of the savings are set to come from the public sector .
ireland 's relatively generous welfare spending is likely to take a big hit , with child benefit and social welfare spending facing a reduction of at least 5 percent .
only state pensions are expected to remain unchanged .
thousands of public sector jobs will also be cut , and those civil servants who keep their jobs will face pay cuts or freezes .
changes in tax brackets will generate the rest of the revenue .
by lowering income tax brands and revising the country 's tax credit system , the government will be able to target thousands of irish adults on lower incomes who currently do not have to pay income tax .
a reduction in the country 's minimum wage , which is currently the second highest in the eu at 8.65 euros per hour , is also on the cards .
government promises election once budget passes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even if ireland recovers , prime minister cowen is unlikely to irish prime minister brian cowen 's government might be forced into snap elections if the budget does not pass .
cowen , whose approval ratings are at an all-time low , has also pledged to call elections soon after parliament ratifies the austerity measures .
cowen 's coalition government no longer controls the lower house of parliament , the dail , and will need to find either independent or opposition support .
" the consequences of not passing a budget would be disastrous for ireland and its people , " independent mp michael lowry said in a statement on monday evening , pledging his reluctant support to the government 's proposal .
" despite some adverse reaction in my constituency to this decision i feel duty bound to put the country 's interests first . "
the dail 's other independent lawmaker , jackie healy-rae , has not yet revealed his position .
it 's unclear whether the main opposition group , the center-right fine gael and center-left labour parties , will attempt to thwart the budget in parliament or not .
barring a dramatic change in the public mood , these two parties look certain to rule in coalition once irish voters next go to the polls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 07.12.2010 cash-strapped ireland awaits brutal 2011 austerity budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one down , 5,999,999,999 to go irish finance minister brian lenihan is to present his proposed 2011 budget to parliament later on tuesday , and it 's unlikely to make pleasant reading .
the debt-ridden country needs to fill a six billion euro hole . ireland 's already unpopular ruling party , fianna fail , will on tuesday present the toughest budget in the country 's history .
finance minister brian lenihan has already announced that dublin will be looking to raise an extra six billion euros -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- in 2011 , through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts .
due to the domestic budget presentation , lenihan has been forced to skip the high profile eurogroup meeting in brussels this week addressing the eurozone 's debt woes , sending ministry officials in his place .
the irish government effectively issued an outline of its plans for the coming year two weeks ago , when ironing out a broad four-year national recovery plan in order to qualify for an 85 billion euro rescue deal from the european union and international monetary fund .
the first tranche of these emergency loans will not be released until the budget is passed .
to placate the eu and imf , ireland needs to generate an extra 15 billion euros by 2014 , as it battles to bring its annual budget deficit back within the prescribed eurozone limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
this year 's deficit , which has ballooned due to the government bailout of the country 's biggest moneylender , anglo irish bank , is likely to be 32 percent of gdp .
" the budget is usually the most eagerly anticipated event in the fiscal calendar , " economist dermot o 'leary at goodbody stockbrokers in dublin told the afp news agency .
" this year though , the thunder has been stolen by the release of last week 's four-year plan .
we already know the broad parameters of what will be contained in the budget for 2011 . "
cuts in public sector , taxes to rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands protested when the initial recovery plan was announced roughly two-thirds of the savings are set to come from the public sector .
ireland 's relatively generous welfare spending is likely to take a big hit , with child benefit and social welfare spending facing a reduction of at least 5 percent .
only state pensions are expected to remain unchanged .
thousands of public sector jobs will also be cut , and those civil servants who keep their jobs will face pay cuts or freezes .
changes in tax brackets will generate the rest of the revenue .
by lowering income tax brands and revising the country 's tax credit system , the government will be able to target thousands of irish adults on lower incomes who currently do not have to pay income tax .
a reduction in the country 's minimum wage , which is currently the second highest in the eu at 8.65 euros per hour , is also on the cards .
government promises election once budget passes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even if ireland recovers , prime minister cowen is unlikely to irish prime minister brian cowen 's government might be forced into snap elections if the budget does not pass .
cowen , whose approval ratings are at an all-time low , has also pledged to call elections soon after parliament ratifies the austerity measures .
cowen 's coalition government no longer controls the lower house of parliament , the dail , and will need to find either independent or opposition support .
" the consequences of not passing a budget would be disastrous for ireland and its people , " independent mp michael lowry said in a statement on monday evening , pledging his reluctant support to the government 's proposal .
" despite some adverse reaction in my constituency to this decision i feel duty bound to put the country 's interests first . "
the dail 's other independent lawmaker , jackie healy-rae , has not yet revealed his position .
it 's unclear whether the main opposition group , the center-right fine gael and center-left labour parties , will attempt to thwart the budget in parliament or not .
barring a dramatic change in the public mood , these two parties look certain to rule in coalition once irish voters next go to the polls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 07.12.2010 no real breakthrough as 5 + 1 talks on iran end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 5 + 1 and iran returned to negotiations after 13 months nuclear talks between the 5 + 1 group and iran have ended in geneva with little sign of progress .
although the two sides have agreed to meet again , the sticking point is the demand for iran to suspend uranium enrichment . the negotiations between un security council heavyweights the united states , russia , china , france and britain along with germany - the so called 5 + 1 group - with an iranian delegation were the first in 13 months .
the negotiation teams , headed by eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton for the 5 + 1 and iran 's secretary of the national security council saaed jalili , agreed that a further round of talks would take place at the end of january in turkey . however , iran has already made it clear that it will not discuss its uranium enrichment program , which it insists is for peaceful purposes while western powers fear the fuel would be used for nuclear warheads .
at the last meeting in october 2009 , the 5 + 1 agreed to a proposal that would have allowed iran to ship a major portion of the uranium they had enriched to 3.5 percent to an external destination to undergo further enrichment and to be converted into fuel rods for the small tehran research reactor .
that would remove the potential threat of weapons-grade material being siphoned off within iran for military purposes .
iran originally agreed to this proposal but later reneged on it , having scored a major point by having the 5 + 1 tacitly agree to iran engaging in enrichment , a practice forbidden by security council resolutions .
then in may this year , brazil and turkey tried to re-broker the deal but this attempt was scuppered by the united states which claimed higher levels of uranium had been enriched in iran since the original offer in 2009 and that the new export deal would leave too much material behind in iran .
iran 's stance on enrichment levels proving obstructive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's saeed jalili will present a similar stance to that of 2009 " if iran agrees to suspend further enrichment , up to the 17.5 percent which it has already stated it was pressing ahead with , then there are a whole series of economic incentives which are on the table , " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , told deutsche welle .
" if , on the other hand , as ahmadinejad has said , iran does not want to address the issue of enrichment or make any concessions or compromises on that account , there will be no alternative at this stage but the consideration of further punitive sanctions . "
chances of reaching any agreements or compromises seem very bleak at this time , khonsari added , but there are clear signs that because economic and other pressures are making life very difficult for the iranian regime , ahmadinejad may be looking for a way out without losing face .
" for ahmadinejad and his supporters there are two main reasons for an engagement with washington , " professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" first , they know that an understanding with the us would be popular , particularly among the educated youth and the business community .
the second reason is that ahmadinejad and the political leadership feel that the regime is under serious threat by the united states , and only by the united states . "
perthes said iran 's threat perception , and its deep suspicion of us intentions , are often underestimated in washington despite these issues being driving factors in iranian politics .
while the regime elite still appears to be divided over the prospect of a full-scale rapprochement with the united states , it is believed many share this fear of the us and there is a real desire to avoid further isolation .
with this in mind , the 5 + 1 may consider lessened sanctions - along with other incentives - as a way to achieve progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has so far dismissed the western incentives incentives on offer but tehran remains steadfast " the western powers along with russia and china are offering iran lessened sanctions , the chance to fix world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership in return for explanations of what has gone on in regard to tehran 's nuclear program and realistic assurances that it has no military nuclear intentions , " simon henderson , director of the gulf and energy policy program at the washington institute for near east policy , told deutsche welle .
" the best hope for agreement lies on the possibility of reaching an acceptable compromise regarding the shipment of already enriched uranium from iran to an outside destination , " khonsari said .
" if agreement could be reached on the quantity , and there is a minute chance given past turkish and brazilian mediation that this is possible , there may still be a way out though it will be very difficult . "
there were concerns that the geneva negotiations would be made even more problematic by the latest wikileaks revelations which exposed the level of international concern and distrust of iran , especially among its persian gulf neighbors , and the consideration of many that military action is the best option when it comes to stopping tehran 's nuclear program .
however , experts believe there is little new information in the wikileaks revelations and that all the parties involved in the talks with iran are already aware of the delicate nature of relations .
wikileaks revelations unlikely to add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks revelations on iran are unlikely to affect talks " there is nothing in the wikileaks revelations that the islamic authorities have been unaware of , " khonsari said .
" the iranian regime understands that matters will be ratcheted up if they are unable to reach an agreement and they are aware that , irrespective of all factors , the likelihood of military confrontation is a very real possibility . "
khonsari believes the consensus among iran 's opponents , that confronting an ambitious iran with all its downsides might be a cheaper option than living with a nuclear iran - as highlighted in the wikileaks cables - might possibly alter tehran 's previous calculations .
those gambled on the belief that the americans would never dare to embark on another military adventure in the aftermath of the iraq and afghanistan conflicts .
options running out if current talks fail " the 5 + 1 diplomats think that sanctions will eventually work , " said simon henderson .
" however , it 's hard to say what iran will do next in response . iran might calculate that if it tests a bomb , there would be some condemnation but then the world would have to get used to a new status quo , much in the same way as it did after the indian and pakistani tests in 1998 . "
mehrdad khonsari said the general consensus is that ahmadinejad wants to escalate matters and essentially go to the very brink of war in a bid to shore up his own leadership , which has been under pressure since the opposition protests in 2009 .
" it is believed that ahmadinejad feels a military conflict might help him consolidate his position inside the country , " he concluded .
" in such a case , his major aim is to buy time as it is unlikely that anything positive can be achieved as a result of these negotiations . "

the specification supports both smart cards and future versions of smartphones .
mobile devices equipped with near-field communications -lrb- nfc -rrb- chips would enable customers to pay for their journey at a ticket turnstile with a wave of a cell phone .
known as " cipurse , " the standard was developed by a group of leading technology firms , which announced a new partnership , known as the open standard for public transport -lrb- ospt -rrb- alliance .
" for mobile device manufacturers , the open security standard will be the next ‘ must-have ' checklist item they include in all next-generation nfc implementations , " the group said in a statement .
the ospt alliance described its open system as offering an alternative to proprietary technologies , which the group said " limit choices , are potentially less secure and cost more to acquire , deploy and maintain . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chip maker infineon is a member of the ospt alliance collaborators welcome the developers of the open security standard say their alliance is also open to bringing new partners into the fold .
on tuesday , watchdata technologies ltd. and the open ticketing institute of the netherlands joined the group , which already included inside secure , oberthur technologies and giesecke & devrient , as well as german chip maker infineon technologies .
the cipurse system was welcomed by transit industry representatives - among them the fare system director for singapore 's land transport authority .
" cipurse is an important step towards establishing standardized , secure and interoperable fare collection for all public transport schemes , and we plan to adopt it for future releases of -lrb- singapore 's contactless e-purse application -rrb- cepas , " said silvester prakasam , singapore 's fare system director , in the same statement .
the vice president of engineering with cubic transportation systems , inc . , pradip mistry , also described his company as " thrilled " with the group 's new open security standard .
an eye toward security the alliance is now looking to finalize its new specification – which can be used for smart cards and contactless tickets , as well as mobile phones and other media . though smart card technology has been around for years , the companies behind the open standard wanted to take another look at security .
the mifare classic chip , the technology and security standard widely used in today 's smart cards , saw its encryption cracked in recent years . tilo pannenbaecker , infineon technologies ' vice president and general manager of business line personal and object id , told deutsche welle that the new security standard uses the advanced encryption standard -lrb- aes -rrb- 128 , which he called " a more advanced , more modern cryptography . " but the alliance also found fault with the proprietary nature of the mifare technology .
pannenbaecker said the group 's new specification would allow a range of vendors to offer nfc-capable sim cards and phones . " our security standard that we are proposing now is the ideal security concept for nfc because it is offering advanced security , so chances of fraud and counterfeiting are limited , " he said .
" and it is a technology available at fair and reasonable terms . " the future of financial transactions ? google plans to put an nfc-enabled smartphone on the market this month .
at a web 2.0 summit in san francisco this past november , google 's chief executive eric schmidt said the next-generation devices " will be able to do commerce . " the head of research in motion , the company behind the blackberry smartphone , also expressed interest during the summit in incorporating nfc chips into the firm 's product range - and soon . 2011 could be off to a strong start : charles walton , chief operating officer for inside secure , cited estimates of between 40 and 50 million payment-equipped phones hitting the market next year . " now that the industry is moving to nfc phones and guys like google and apple and others are getting on board with nfc , they are looking for some global standards , " he told news agency afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong and japan already have smart card transit payment systems in place winning over consumers still , some analysts suggest taking a step back - and looking beyond the buzz surrounding the " tap and pay " phenomenon when it comes to mobile phones . " it 's a move in the right direction , " said christophe uzureau , research director of banking and investment services at gartner research , " but we tend to forget the big picture . " uzureau told deutsche welle that mobile providers are keen to seize upon the potential of nfc-enabled phones - but the industry is creating " a lot of hype . " consumers in hong kong , with its " octopus card , " and japan , which has " suica , " are accustomed to using prepaid , contactless means for transit .
but replacing cards with phones is easier said than done . " this only works if all consumers have nfc-enabled phones , and if they are confident in using them , " uzureau said .
" and right now , most consumers are not . " that means mobile operators must convince their customers to increase their usage of nfc-enabled phones - and to do so , they must show them that the chips allow for better financial access and control . but companies might have trouble persuading customers to change their habits .
despite what uzureau called a " perfect supply-side arrangement , " in japan , cash-centric consumers there have been slow to latch on . " on the demand side , most customers do n't see the point of nfc-enabled mobile phones , " he said , adding that having a bit more speed at the point of sale still does n't outweigh the benefits of secure cash transactions . " it 's not going to replace the wallet , " uzureau said . author : amanda price -lrb- afp -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in brussels on tuesday , eu monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn expressed confidence that this money would not be lost .
" i 'm confident that ireland , with its smart , competent , and stubborn people - and its prospects of recovering -lsb- from -rsb- this situation - will overcome the current challenges . "
tough budget while the final stamp of approval for the bailout loan was being given in brussels , the irish government in dublin announced deep cuts in its 2011 budget .
tax hikes and spending cuts are expected to save the country around 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lenihan unveiled a tough budget on tuesday " as outlined in the plan , six billion euros of the overall adjustment is made in today 's budget .
the scale of this adjustment is demanding but it demonstrates the seriousness of our intent , " said finance minister brian lenihan in an address to ireland 's lower house of parliament .
the budget cuts were necessary to secure the bailout from the eu and the international monetary fund .
tapping the reserves ireland 's bailout comes from the 750 billion euro crisis fund established earlier this year after greece required similar aid .
now , the question is still being asked : will ireland be the only country to access the fund , or will portugal , spain or even italy need support soon ?
and if so , will 750 billion euros be enough ?
for spanish finance minister elena salgado , the problem simply does not exist .
“ the volume of the crisis mechanism seems reasonable to us , ” she said .
but from her , these words seem logical ; spain is trying to soothe the markets .
belgian finance minister didier reynders , who chaired the talks , is more cautious , saying debates on the size of the bailout mechanism will likely continue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 07.12.2010 no real breakthrough as 5 + 1 talks on iran end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 5 + 1 and iran returned to negotiations after 13 months nuclear talks between the 5 + 1 group and iran have ended in geneva with little sign of progress .
although the two sides have agreed to meet again , the sticking point is the demand for iran to suspend uranium enrichment . the negotiations between un security council heavyweights the united states , russia , china , france and britain along with germany - the so called 5 + 1 group - with an iranian delegation were the first in 13 months .
the negotiation teams , headed by eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton for the 5 + 1 and iran 's secretary of the national security council saaed jalili , agreed that a further round of talks would take place at the end of january in turkey . however , iran has already made it clear that it will not discuss its uranium enrichment program , which it insists is for peaceful purposes while western powers fear the fuel would be used for nuclear warheads .
at the last meeting in october 2009 , the 5 + 1 agreed to a proposal that would have allowed iran to ship a major portion of the uranium they had enriched to 3.5 percent to an external destination to undergo further enrichment and to be converted into fuel rods for the small tehran research reactor .
that would remove the potential threat of weapons-grade material being siphoned off within iran for military purposes .
iran originally agreed to this proposal but later reneged on it , having scored a major point by having the 5 + 1 tacitly agree to iran engaging in enrichment , a practice forbidden by security council resolutions .
then in may this year , brazil and turkey tried to re-broker the deal but this attempt was scuppered by the united states which claimed higher levels of uranium had been enriched in iran since the original offer in 2009 and that the new export deal would leave too much material behind in iran .
iran 's stance on enrichment levels proving obstructive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's saeed jalili will present a similar stance to that of 2009 " if iran agrees to suspend further enrichment , up to the 17.5 percent which it has already stated it was pressing ahead with , then there are a whole series of economic incentives which are on the table , " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , told deutsche welle .
" if , on the other hand , as ahmadinejad has said , iran does not want to address the issue of enrichment or make any concessions or compromises on that account , there will be no alternative at this stage but the consideration of further punitive sanctions . "
chances of reaching any agreements or compromises seem very bleak at this time , khonsari added , but there are clear signs that because economic and other pressures are making life very difficult for the iranian regime , ahmadinejad may be looking for a way out without losing face .
" for ahmadinejad and his supporters there are two main reasons for an engagement with washington , " professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" first , they know that an understanding with the us would be popular , particularly among the educated youth and the business community .
the second reason is that ahmadinejad and the political leadership feel that the regime is under serious threat by the united states , and only by the united states . "
perthes said iran 's threat perception , and its deep suspicion of us intentions , are often underestimated in washington despite these issues being driving factors in iranian politics .
while the regime elite still appears to be divided over the prospect of a full-scale rapprochement with the united states , it is believed many share this fear of the us and there is a real desire to avoid further isolation .
with this in mind , the 5 + 1 may consider lessened sanctions - along with other incentives - as a way to achieve progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has so far dismissed the western incentives incentives on offer but tehran remains steadfast " the western powers along with russia and china are offering iran lessened sanctions , the chance to fix world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership in return for explanations of what has gone on in regard to tehran 's nuclear program and realistic assurances that it has no military nuclear intentions , " simon henderson , director of the gulf and energy policy program at the washington institute for near east policy , told deutsche welle .
" the best hope for agreement lies on the possibility of reaching an acceptable compromise regarding the shipment of already enriched uranium from iran to an outside destination , " khonsari said .
" if agreement could be reached on the quantity , and there is a minute chance given past turkish and brazilian mediation that this is possible , there may still be a way out though it will be very difficult . "
there were concerns that the geneva negotiations would be made even more problematic by the latest wikileaks revelations which exposed the level of international concern and distrust of iran , especially among its persian gulf neighbors , and the consideration of many that military action is the best option when it comes to stopping tehran 's nuclear program .
however , experts believe there is little new information in the wikileaks revelations and that all the parties involved in the talks with iran are already aware of the delicate nature of relations .
wikileaks revelations unlikely to add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks revelations on iran are unlikely to affect talks " there is nothing in the wikileaks revelations that the islamic authorities have been unaware of , " khonsari said .
" the iranian regime understands that matters will be ratcheted up if they are unable to reach an agreement and they are aware that , irrespective of all factors , the likelihood of military confrontation is a very real possibility . "
khonsari believes the consensus among iran 's opponents , that confronting an ambitious iran with all its downsides might be a cheaper option than living with a nuclear iran - as highlighted in the wikileaks cables - might possibly alter tehran 's previous calculations .
those gambled on the belief that the americans would never dare to embark on another military adventure in the aftermath of the iraq and afghanistan conflicts .
options running out if current talks fail " the 5 + 1 diplomats think that sanctions will eventually work , " said simon henderson .
" however , it 's hard to say what iran will do next in response . iran might calculate that if it tests a bomb , there would be some condemnation but then the world would have to get used to a new status quo , much in the same way as it did after the indian and pakistani tests in 1998 . "
mehrdad khonsari said the general consensus is that ahmadinejad wants to escalate matters and essentially go to the very brink of war in a bid to shore up his own leadership , which has been under pressure since the opposition protests in 2009 .
" it is believed that ahmadinejad feels a military conflict might help him consolidate his position inside the country , " he concluded .
" in such a case , his major aim is to buy time as it is unlikely that anything positive can be achieved as a result of these negotiations . "

in a video interview with the french newspaper presse ocean , cantona suggested that everyone should withdraw their money from the banks in an attempt to punish the " corrupt , criminal " banking system .
" the three million people in the street , they go to the bank , withdraw their money , and the banks collapse ...
that 's a real threat , there 's a real revolution , " he said in the video .
the video interview was picked up by two " civic activists " who named december 7 as the day people should withdraw their cash and set up a website to help circulate cantona 's video .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cantona 's comments caused an international campaign for a run on banks tens of thousands of people have watched the video online and signed a support group on the social networking website facebook .
' stop interfering ' cantona 's philosophizing on the future of the banking sector has been met with scathing criticism from the french finance minister .
christine lagarde said cantona should stop " intervening in finance and economics , especially when he does n't fully understand the mechanics of it . "
her comments were backed by the head of france 's largest bank bnp paribas , who said the footballer 's comments were " typically misplaced . "
" the recommendation to withdraw deposits will sow insecurity , " said baudoin prot .
as cantona 's " revolution " gained support across europe , the head of the eurogroup of finance ministers jean-claude juncker added his criticisms calling the scheme " irresponsible . "
european union economic affairs commissioner olli rehn added : " i think mr cantona is a better footballer than he is an economist . "

deutsche welle spoke with tom kirchmaier of the london school of economics about the decision . eurozone finance ministers met on monday evening to discuss increasing the emergency fund but ultimately decided it was big enough .
is it ?
at the moment it is enough .
but the problem is a different one .
you arrange a fund like this to send a signal to the market that there is no point in speculating against the currency .
so by not increasing the fund , the eurozone finance ministers send a signal that there might actually be a point in speculating against larger countries like spain .
so in that way , they made the markets less stable , not more .
you do n't think markets are convinced yet that the debt crisis is contained ?
the funds are enough to support countries like greece and portugal , they are not enough to support countries like spain , or belgium , or italy .
it 's an arithmetic game , and you come up with a number that 's around one-and-a-half trillion , or two trillion euros and you come up with a guarantee where you can say , this is rock solid .
the number is just so big that it becomes clear to everybody that a speculator ca n't win .
another idea that had been floated prior to monday evening 's meeting , but was then not discussed , was that of bonds issued jointly by the eurozone countries .
is that a good idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the efsf is not big enough for markets to take it seriously " it 's a good idea in principle , but it 's very far-fetched politically .
one of the problems with the eurozone - and it 's a problem from birth - is that monetary policy is done by the european central bank , but fiscal policy is done by each of the member states .
and that creates almost perverse incentives for the individual member states to over-consume , which is what they have done .
one of the ways to solve this problem is to centralize fiscal policy , i.e. to make more fiscal decisions in brussels .
if you launch a euro bond , you essentially do exactly that because you then unify all the risks which you have in the eurozone .
for it to work , you have to have a centralized fiscal policy .
interestingly , china and sovereign wealth funds are very keen for europe to issue these bonds because they would be highly liquid and a good alternative to a us treasury bond .
both the bigger emergency fund and the euro bonds are supposed to convince markets of the " irreversibility " of the euro , as luxemberg 's prime minister jean claude juncker put it .
is the euro in fact " irreversible " or can you imagine a scenario in which this common currency would fold ?
nothing is irreversible .
it would unravel the minute that germany in particular were to make the tiniest suggestion about leaving .
it would be possible to reverse the euro , but it would have catastrophic consequences .
on one hand , you would see a bank run with weaker countries - everybody would try to get their money and put it in a german bank account and that would lead to an immediate collapse of the banking system in that country .
it would be catastrophic for the european idea , for these weak economies , and if germany were to decide to leave , it would not be good for germany either because the currency would appreciate dramatically .
next week at a eu summit , leaders are expected to agree on permanent eurozone rescue mechanisms , since the current emergency fund expires in 2013 .
what could or what should these permanent mechanisms look like ?
the issue of " permanent " only makes sense if the fund is large and credible enough .
at the moment i do n't see that we are getting any closer to making a credible long-term commitment to stability .
the only really credible commitment would be to integrate fiscal policy further .

the next generation of chinese artists is , however , and many of them have discovered berlin as an increasingly attractive hot spot for art students . one of those is duan yafeng , who has lived in germany 's capital for a year .

" western art plays an important role in china and i think that 's the attraction of these works , " said berlin gallery owner zhu ling , " all of my artists studied traditional chinese painting before they came to germany and here they studied western oil painting and in their works i see an effort to combine these two traditions .

in brussels on tuesday , eu monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn expressed confidence that this money would not be lost .
" i 'm confident that ireland , with its smart , competent , and stubborn people - and its prospects of recovering -lsb- from -rsb- this situation - will overcome the current challenges . "
tough budget while the final stamp of approval for the bailout loan was being given in brussels , the irish government in dublin announced deep cuts in its 2011 budget .
tax hikes and spending cuts are expected to save the country around 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lenihan unveiled a tough budget on tuesday " as outlined in the plan , six billion euros of the overall adjustment is made in today 's budget .
the scale of this adjustment is demanding but it demonstrates the seriousness of our intent , " said finance minister brian lenihan in an address to ireland 's lower house of parliament .
the budget cuts were necessary to secure the bailout from the eu and the international monetary fund .
tapping the reserves ireland 's bailout comes from the 750 billion euro crisis fund established earlier this year after greece required similar aid .
now , the question is still being asked : will ireland be the only country to access the fund , or will portugal , spain or even italy need support soon ?
and if so , will 750 billion euros be enough ?
for spanish finance minister elena salgado , the problem simply does not exist .
“ the volume of the crisis mechanism seems reasonable to us , ” she said .
but from her , these words seem logical ; spain is trying to soothe the markets .
belgian finance minister didier reynders , who chaired the talks , is more cautious , saying debates on the size of the bailout mechanism will likely continue .

the specification supports both smart cards and future versions of smartphones .
mobile devices equipped with near-field communications -lrb- nfc -rrb- chips would enable customers to pay for their journey at a ticket turnstile with a wave of a cell phone .
known as " cipurse , " the standard was developed by a group of leading technology firms , which announced a new partnership , known as the open standard for public transport -lrb- ospt -rrb- alliance .
" for mobile device manufacturers , the open security standard will be the next ‘ must-have ' checklist item they include in all next-generation nfc implementations , " the group said in a statement .
the ospt alliance described its open system as offering an alternative to proprietary technologies , which the group said " limit choices , are potentially less secure and cost more to acquire , deploy and maintain . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chip maker infineon is a member of the ospt alliance collaborators welcome the developers of the open security standard say their alliance is also open to bringing new partners into the fold .
on tuesday , watchdata technologies ltd. and the open ticketing institute of the netherlands joined the group , which already included inside secure , oberthur technologies and giesecke & devrient , as well as german chip maker infineon technologies .
the cipurse system was welcomed by transit industry representatives - among them the fare system director for singapore 's land transport authority .
" cipurse is an important step towards establishing standardized , secure and interoperable fare collection for all public transport schemes , and we plan to adopt it for future releases of -lrb- singapore 's contactless e-purse application -rrb- cepas , " said silvester prakasam , singapore 's fare system director , in the same statement .
the vice president of engineering with cubic transportation systems , inc . , pradip mistry , also described his company as " thrilled " with the group 's new open security standard .
an eye toward security the alliance is now looking to finalize its new specification – which can be used for smart cards and contactless tickets , as well as mobile phones and other media . though smart card technology has been around for years , the companies behind the open standard wanted to take another look at security .
the mifare classic chip , the technology and security standard widely used in today 's smart cards , saw its encryption cracked in recent years . tilo pannenbaecker , infineon technologies ' vice president and general manager of business line personal and object id , told deutsche welle that the new security standard uses the advanced encryption standard -lrb- aes -rrb- 128 , which he called " a more advanced , more modern cryptography . " but the alliance also found fault with the proprietary nature of the mifare technology .
pannenbaecker said the group 's new specification would allow a range of vendors to offer nfc-capable sim cards and phones . " our security standard that we are proposing now is the ideal security concept for nfc because it is offering advanced security , so chances of fraud and counterfeiting are limited , " he said .
" and it is a technology available at fair and reasonable terms . " the future of financial transactions ? google plans to put an nfc-enabled smartphone on the market this month .
at a web 2.0 summit in san francisco this past november , google 's chief executive eric schmidt said the next-generation devices " will be able to do commerce . " the head of research in motion , the company behind the blackberry smartphone , also expressed interest during the summit in incorporating nfc chips into the firm 's product range - and soon . 2011 could be off to a strong start : charles walton , chief operating officer for inside secure , cited estimates of between 40 and 50 million payment-equipped phones hitting the market next year . " now that the industry is moving to nfc phones and guys like google and apple and others are getting on board with nfc , they are looking for some global standards , " he told news agency afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong and japan already have smart card transit payment systems in place winning over consumers still , some analysts suggest taking a step back - and looking beyond the buzz surrounding the " tap and pay " phenomenon when it comes to mobile phones . " it 's a move in the right direction , " said christophe uzureau , research director of banking and investment services at gartner research , " but we tend to forget the big picture . " uzureau told deutsche welle that mobile providers are keen to seize upon the potential of nfc-enabled phones - but the industry is creating " a lot of hype . " consumers in hong kong , with its " octopus card , " and japan , which has " suica , " are accustomed to using prepaid , contactless means for transit .
but replacing cards with phones is easier said than done . " this only works if all consumers have nfc-enabled phones , and if they are confident in using them , " uzureau said .
" and right now , most consumers are not . " that means mobile operators must convince their customers to increase their usage of nfc-enabled phones - and to do so , they must show them that the chips allow for better financial access and control . but companies might have trouble persuading customers to change their habits .
despite what uzureau called a " perfect supply-side arrangement , " in japan , cash-centric consumers there have been slow to latch on . " on the demand side , most customers do n't see the point of nfc-enabled mobile phones , " he said , adding that having a bit more speed at the point of sale still does n't outweigh the benefits of secure cash transactions . " it 's not going to replace the wallet , " uzureau said . author : amanda price -lrb- afp -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the original plan of the caravan organizers was to take a land route from india to pakistan , and from there over iran , turkey , syria and lebanon to gaza .
however , the indian delegates were only permitted to travel via the wagah border to lahore .
the idea of indian and pakistani peace activists undertaking a symbolic journey through pakistan could not be realized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between india and pakistan have been tense since the mumbai attacks in 2008 the indian and pakistani delegations are now going to join together in the iranian city of zahidan , from where , along with peace activists from other asian countries , they will continue their journey towards gaza .
the caravan is scheduled to reach the palestinian territories on december 27 .
mire of indo-pakistani politics indian peace activist rakhi sehgal condemned the behavior of the indian and pakistani governments towards the convoy .
she told deutsche welle that initially 51 peace activists from india had applied for a pakistani visa , out of whom only 34 finally received the visa after days of protesting outside the pakistan high commission in delhi .
" we had planned to travel over land from delhi to wagah , and then from wagah to lahore , karachi , quetta and zahidan , in iran .
however , we were not allowed to go beyond lahore .
on december 4 , we reached the wagah border and were informed that the indian government had not given us permission to cross the border .
after unsuccessfully trying to contact the ministry of external affairs , we held a demonstration at wagah .
it was on december 5 that we got word from the indian officials that we were being allowed to cross the border . "
despite the fact that the convoy has nothing to do with indo-pakistani security and peace issues , its main purpose is to help the people of gaza , it has been dragged into the mire of indo-pakistani politics .
pakistan labour party 's farooq tariq , who is one of the main organizers of the caravan in pakistan , believes that us pressure on pakistan and india has probably led to this crisis .
" both the indian and pakistani governments have close ties with the us , and they would obviously not want to displease the us , which has cordial ties with israel . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli commandos on 31 may 2010 stormed a flotilla bound for the gaza strip symbolic significance however , the symbolic union of pakistanis and indians for the palestinian cause might be enough to enrage the authorities on both sides of the border , who have almost stopped people-to-people contacts since the mumbai attacks of 2008 .
the combined journey of indian and pakistani activists to gaza could have eased the tense relationship between india and pakistan .
sehgal was ecstatic about the manner in which the indian activists were received in pakistan .
" we were received with a lot of warmth in pakistan .
there was a huge reception for us in lahore .
people from all walks of life came to meet us , including students , trade union activists , lawyers , and journalists .
everybody was as excited as we were . "
farooq tariq is also of the view that even the short trip of the indian activists to pakistan carried immense symbolic significance .
" the indians got a real message of friendship in pakistan .
the pakistani media also gave a lot of coverage to them .
apart from that , the indian delegation handed over the palestinian flag to their pakistani counterparts , and now we are going to join them in iran . "
from there , the peace activists of several asian countries will embark upon the journey to gaza and are hoping that they wo n't at least be shot at , as in the case of the gaza aid flotilla in may .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 07.12.2010 us-china truce signals a spirit of compromise in cancun climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global agreement on emissions targets may be in sight china has offered for the first time to submit its voluntary carbon emissions target to a binding un resolution , buoying climate talks as environment ministers from around the globe arrive in cancun . environment ministers from around the world arrived in cancun on tuesday , replacing their lower-level negotiators and hoping to wrap up a deal by friday night .
a major sticking point to any potential deal has been the fact that the us and china are not signed up to the accord .
" there is a challenge that not everyone is part of the kyoto protocol " , eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard told a press conference in cancun .
but as the talks enter the final stages , china and the us have confirmed their commitment to emissions reductions – a move that could save the talks .
developing countries have said they wo n't move towards any new treaty until members of the kyoto protocol agree to extend the treaty beyond 2012 .
but japan , russia and canada have refused to extend kyoto without the participation of the world 's two top polluters - china , which has no requirements as a developing country , and the united states , which rejected the treaty in 2001 .
together , china and the us emit about 40 percent of the world 's greenhouse gases .
japan , russia and canada want a separate agreement regulating all nations .
" there are huge concerns about the position of japan .
we 're seeing some signals of possible flexibility from the japanese , but the japanese have to not stand in the way of a decision that reaffirms a second commitment period , " alden meyer from the union of concerned scientists told a press conference in cancun .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer is concerned about japan 's position game-changer in an apparent about turn , which could potentially save the climate talks , china announced on monday that it would be prepared to make emissions reductions binding .
" we can create a resolution and that resolution can be binding on china , " said huang huikang , the chinese foreign ministry 's envoy for climate change talks , in an interview with reuters .
china 's offer to make its existing , domestic pledge to reduce its " carbon intensity " - the amount of the main greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , emitted for each dollar of economic growth - binding under a un resolution is a compromise it hopes will encourage developed countries to continue the existing kyoto protocol .
" china wants to avoid a collapse of the talks , " ruth davis from greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" they 're trying to create a landing space for japan to come back on board without losing face " .
china 's target would still be voluntary , stressed china 's chief negotiator xie zhenhua , in contrast to developed nation targets under kyoto .
targets for developed countries are imposed by the international community , but beijing 's targets would be offered to the community by china .
analysts were generally positive about china 's proposal .
" this is a game-changer , " said jennifer morgan from the washington-based world resources institute .
but the details of china ‘ s pledge remain unclear .
" china may ask for different conditions to developed countries whose emissions reductions are subject to international scrutiny and monitoring , " ruth davis told deutsche welle .
china in the past has refused to be part of a binding agreement involving outside verification that it is making good on its pledges to curb emissions .
low key us appearance us involvement is also seen as a linchpin for an international agreement .
" there can be no doubt that in the european union , we have time and again told our american friends why we thought it was very important that they engage in this agenda , " said eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chu reaffirmed obama 's commitment to fighting climate change on a brief visit to cancun , us energy secretary steven chu confirmed that president barack obama was committed to meeting us pledges made in copenhagen to curb carbon emissions from 2005 levels by 17 percent by 2020 .
" he absolutely feels that moving toward a clean energy economy is really about our energy security and about our financial security , " chu said .
" it 's about our economy ; it 's about the future of the planet . "
this is despite the republican party 's election victory last month , which says forced emission cuts would hurt a fragile economy .
some republicans also doubt the science behind climate change .
this all but ended the prospect of the united states approving legislation to restrict carbon emissions .
chu highlighted efforts by the obama administration to encourage low-carbon technology , including 90 billion dollars towards clean energy in its economic stimulus package .
the administration has set up research laboratories for green research and offered tax incentives to pursue eco-friendly energy .
air of optimism amid diplomatic leaks environmentalists seem to agree that there is a more hopeful tone at this year 's talks in cancun .
" over the past week , we have seen a vastly improved atmosphere in these talks than we 've seen over the past year , " said wendel trio , greenpeace international 's director of climate policy .
mexico has so far received plaudits for running an open process that has kept the mood at the cancun talks more positive than in copenhagen where major global powers negotiated behind closed doors , a move that irked many developing countries .
but disclosures by wikileaks this week threatened to sour the mood .
the leaked memos showed that the united states and european union worked together aggressively to sell the copenhagen deal last year .
bildunterschrift : delegates have until the end of the week to forge an agreement on how to tackle climate change in one cable , reported by the british newspaper the guardian , hedegaard is quoted as telling a us official that small island nations " could be our best allies " as they need financial assistance from wealthy states .
the goal would be to step up pressure on developing countries such as india and brazil to sign up .
such emerging powers have taken growing action on climate change but stated adamantly that the measures are voluntary and that rich nations bear historic responsibility for the problem .
a leaked cable also said the european union and united states looked at ways to " neutralize , co-opt or marginalize " countries seen as " unhelpful " - particularly venezuela and bolivia , which have raised persistent objections during climate negotiations on issues both of substance and process .
asked about the leaks , hedegaard said that the cables offered a " one-sided and selected " us account of conversations .
she denied any untoward pressure toward the most vulnerable nations such as maldives , saying : " for many reasons we want to work very much with them . "
hedegaard said she did not believe the disclosures would hurt the cancun talks , saying everyone knows " that you discuss a lot of things " in negotiations .
but bolivian negotiator pablo solon said he was " greatly concerned " by the disclosures .
the cables " confirm what we 've always been saying and the united states has been denying : the interference , pressure and blackmail regrettably conducted by the us administration , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 07.12.2010 climate talks inch closer to forest protection agreement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainforest is illegally burnt to turn it into arable land a global climate treaty looks far off , but cancun may reach a key agreement on how to fight deforestation , a top cause of carbon emissions .
the redd scheme aims to reward developing nations for preserving their forests . a pact on reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries - known to negotiators as redd or " reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation " - appears to be close to an international agreement at the un framework convention on climate change in cancun .
" there 's a really strong chance that we will get a solid agreement , " said rane cortez , the senior forest carbon advisor for the nature conservancy environmental group .
" there is a lot of consensus coming on the text , but we need a few tweaks to get everyone onboard , " she added .
the programme was launched in september 2008 and consists largely of offering financial incentives to developing countries such as brazil , indonesia or the democratic republic of congo to save their tropical forests .
deforestation accounts for almost one-fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions , which is more than the entire global transport sector causes .
co2 released into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels like oil and coal can be absorbed and stored by forests until the forest dies .
yet even though that 's a well established fact , deforestation is continuing at a rapid pace .
each year , an estimated 13 million hectares of forest - mainly rain forest - is destroyed .
that 's equivalent to the area of a country like greece .
bildunterschrift : sources of greenhouse gasses - deforestation accounts for 17 percent of global emissions a simple concept the principle behind redd is simple .
the idea is to reward developing nations that preserve their forests , boost the carbon stock , and have sustainable forestry management .
currently , forests in developing countries are often cleared to make way for plantations , agricultural land or livestock .
in order to give people there the chance to make a different living , developed countries would under the redd scheme have to pay for the environmental services which these forests perform if they are left intact .
a fair deal , one might think - not least in view of the fact that developed nations are historically responsible for the ever-increasing co2 in the atmosphere - and thus for global climate change .
since a hectare of a palm oil plantation or arable land brings in more money than a hectare of rainforest , compensation should be agreed on an international level , according to the reasoning behind the redd concept .
bildunterschrift : cumulative co2 emissions -lrb- 1850-2000 -rrb- show usa and europe have been the biggest poluters money money money but even if it sounds like a logical solution , the simplicity ends when money comes into play .
what form this compensation should take and who should finance it are in dispute .
some negotiators say that only public money should go to redd .
but others say it is more realistic to set up a market approach that would allow nations to swap assistance for credits in emission reduction goals .
sha zukang , the un undersecretary for economic and social affairs , said funding so far has been insufficient even though the forest issue was critical for the " protection of the environment , social development and the fight against poverty . "
developed nations have pledged some 4.5 billion dollars for redd .
the leading financial contributor is norway , which among other projects has committed to provide one billion dollars for indonesia which plans a two-year moratorium on new clearing of natural forests and peat lands from 2011 .
what is a forest ?
but even before negotiators get to the sticky issue of money , " the debate about the redd agreement begins with the definition of the term ' forest ' , " said christoph thies of greenpeace .
to date no agreement has been reached in the negotiations : some also want plantations to count as forests , while others think the term should only refer to primary forests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace does n't want plantations to be counted as " forests " " for us at greenpeace it ' quite clear : a forest is a natural ecosystem that is dominated by trees - but not a plantation .
a tree plantation follows the principles of agriculture and is more of a tree farm for us , " thies said .
a tree farm or a plantation hardly stores any co2 .
even worse : to make room for the plantation , rain forest has to be cleared - and in this way co2 and methane is released into the atmosphere .
if this were rewarded in a redd agreement , thies thinks it would lose all credibility .
who does the forest belong to ?
worldwide , over a billion people live off the forest - many of them belong to indigenous people that have not only lived in the forest , but also from the forest .
the norwegian rainforest foundation wants to support and strengthen precisely this population , said lars loevold .
he said that involving indigenous peoples in the debate was not just an ethical question but a strategic decision .
" we are 100 percent convinced that forest protection will only work if we recognize the traditional communal rights of these people , " loevold said .
" for centuries they have maintained and protected the forests .
what looks to us in the west like untouched rain forest , is in fact the result of a very complex ecosystem within which humans have also played a role for centuries .
in this life cycle , a richer biodiversity has been created than if no people had lived there , " loevold added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies show that indigenous people can look after forest better than national parks local administration is more successful than national parks new research supports loevold 's argument that forests which are managed by indigenous peoples and local communities are better protected and have a greater biodiversity than , for example , national parks .
to enable people who actually live from and with the forests to have their voice heard at international climate negotiations , the norwegian rainforest foundation have paid the travel costs of indigenous representatives from all around the world .
the demands of indigenous peoples have become an essential part of climate negotiations .
the point for the director of the norwegian rainforest foundation at redd negotiations in cancun is that the forests should not just degenerate into a short-term investment .
" until now it has been profitable to destroy the rain forest .
some earned money with deforestation , but they did n't have to pay for the costs of the destruction .
the redd agreement is about finding mechanisms which reward people who protect forests , and punish those who destroy the forest , " said lars loevold .
this issue is being addressed by the 194 member countries at the un climate summit in cancun , mexico .
an agreement seems within reach .

the original plan of the caravan organizers was to take a land route from india to pakistan , and from there over iran , turkey , syria and lebanon to gaza .
however , the indian delegates were only permitted to travel via the wagah border to lahore .
the idea of indian and pakistani peace activists undertaking a symbolic journey through pakistan could not be realized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between india and pakistan have been tense since the mumbai attacks in 2008 the indian and pakistani delegations are now going to join together in the iranian city of zahidan , from where , along with peace activists from other asian countries , they will continue their journey towards gaza .
the caravan is scheduled to reach the palestinian territories on december 27 .
mire of indo-pakistani politics indian peace activist rakhi sehgal condemned the behavior of the indian and pakistani governments towards the convoy .
she told deutsche welle that initially 51 peace activists from india had applied for a pakistani visa , out of whom only 34 finally received the visa after days of protesting outside the pakistan high commission in delhi .
" we had planned to travel over land from delhi to wagah , and then from wagah to lahore , karachi , quetta and zahidan , in iran .
however , we were not allowed to go beyond lahore .
on december 4 , we reached the wagah border and were informed that the indian government had not given us permission to cross the border .
after unsuccessfully trying to contact the ministry of external affairs , we held a demonstration at wagah .
it was on december 5 that we got word from the indian officials that we were being allowed to cross the border . "
despite the fact that the convoy has nothing to do with indo-pakistani security and peace issues , its main purpose is to help the people of gaza , it has been dragged into the mire of indo-pakistani politics .
pakistan labour party 's farooq tariq , who is one of the main organizers of the caravan in pakistan , believes that us pressure on pakistan and india has probably led to this crisis .
" both the indian and pakistani governments have close ties with the us , and they would obviously not want to displease the us , which has cordial ties with israel . "

now in its fourth year , the hri examines performance under five “ pillars ” of donor practice : response to needs ; prevention , risk reduction and recovery ; working with partners ; protection and international humanitarian law ; and learning and accountability .
denmark tops the hri ranking list followed by ireland , new zealand , norway , and sweden , while the european commission comes in sixth .
the head of the hri team , philip tamminga , talked with deutsche welle about the latest index and how political priorities have impeded the delivery of humanitarian aid to millions .
deutsche welle : germany does n't appear to have done too well in your assessment .
why is that ?
philip tamminga : germany is ranked 14th -lsb- out of 20 -rsb- in the index this year , just after canada and australia , but before japan and france . germany spends a lot less on humanitarian assistance than other countries , and the percentage of its aid dedicated to humanitarian crises is about half of the average of other donors . so it lags somewhat behind other countries .
other factors that explain germany 's position in the ranking is that it has too many restrictive conditions on its aid funding .
this sometimes makes it difficult for the humanitarian organizations it funds to have enough flexibility to direct aid where it is needed or to adapt programmes if the situation changes on the ground - which happens quite often in a disaster or conflict .
germany could also do better at funding un and red cross appeals , and make better use of regular evaluations to improve the quality and effectiveness of the assistance it provides .
germany does have many strengths , though .
for instance , it tends to provide funding rapidly in cases of disasters , and it 's a strong supporter of ngos .
it is also one of the better donor governments in terms of its commitment towards accountability to people affected by crises - making sure aid is effective and responds to their needs . could you explain briefly how exactly the assessment is done – what are the key tools and methodology employed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid is much-needed in many corners of the globe we assess donors by looking at 35 different indicators of how well they support humanitarian action and apply good practices .
the indicators are based on the core concepts contained in the declaration of good humanitarian donorship , which was developed and signed by the world 's main donor governments - including germany - in 2003 .
what we want to see is if governments are respecting the commitments they made , so we send teams to different humanitarian crises and we talk to the different humanitarian organizations about how well the governments that fund their work are applying good practice .
we combine this with publicly available information from published sources on government aid funding , respect of international humanitarian law , and other elements of good donor practice .
this year , our teams visited 14 humanitarian crises areas like haiti , afghanistan , somalia , sudan and pakistan , and we spoke to over 500 senior officials working in these crises from the united nations , the red cross and the red crescent , ngos , donor governments and others .
we also collected nearly 2,000 survey responses .
this gives us a good basis to measure and compare donor governments each year on whether their policies and practices facilitate or impede an effective response to crises .
the report says that there 's ample evidence of politicization of aid .
exactly what evidence do you have to show that political interests have overtaken the commitment to good humanitarian donorship ?
in 10 of the 14 crises we visited , we saw and heard of evidence that donor governments were placing political interests above humanitarian objectives . in some cases , like afghanistan , the use of western military forces to provide humanitarian assistance is compromising the neutrality , impartiality and independence of humanitarian organizations , and putting humanitarian workers and civilians at risk .
we also saw in some places like somalia , the occupied palestinian territories or yemen , some donor governments are putting restrictions on humanitarian organizations that prevents them from working in areas controlled by certain groups like hamas , as part of the " war on terror . "
this means the people in need are not getting the aid they deserve .
in other crises , there are debates about how foreign aid can help win " hearts and minds " or achieve other foreign policy objectives .
one of the most basic humanitarian principles – which donor governments committed themselves to when they signed the good donorship declaration – is that humanitarian assistance should be given without discrimination , and based on needs alone – and not because it may or may not help a government achieve other objectives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastation left behind by the 2005 tsunami the hri report claims that there are gaps in the protection of civilians and that the lack of safe humanitarian access has put vulnerable groups at risk of harm .
basically , this refers to the promotion of international humanitarian law and goes beyond programming issues – is the report referring to diplomacy efforts in this direction ? yes , the report is clear that as a result of politicization , safe access by humanitarian organizations to people affected by crisis is being compromised . because of that , humanitarian workers are at risk , and civilian populations are not getting the protection and assistance they need .
a recent example of this lack of protection was seen in the mass rapes that took place in the democratic republic of the congo .
and the safety of humanitarian workers is also at stake : last year over 260 humanitarians were killed , kidnapped or injured while trying to carry out their work .
you have also accused donors of failing to improve transparency and accountability towards affected people .
which countries have fared well under this pillar and which poorly ?
donor governments are not doing enough to promote better accountability towards people affected by disasters and crises .
there are lots of requirements on humanitarian organizations to report on how they have spent the money they get , and what kind of results , but very few donor governments have in place requirements to monitor and ensure that aid money is being used to meet the needs and priorities of the actual people affected by the crisis .
most professional humanitarian organizations already do this to some extent , but donor governments are not monitoring and following up adequately , and supporting these efforts . another concern is that donor governments are not being transparent or accountable on the aid that they promise . for example , many governments have still not disbursed all the funds that they promised after the earthquake in haiti .
and while the promises are made in the media or in international conferences , most of the time , the people affected do n't receive any information about this , and do n't have any way to participate directly on how that aid will be prioritized or spent .
this is why we call on governments to improve their transparency and accountability . germany tends to do better than other donors in this area , and could perhaps take the lead in building more commitment amongst donor governments .
what 's been donor governments ' response to this ranking system – surely some are n't happy with the whole exercise ?
some governments have told us that they think a ranking system is counterproductive , and does n't encourage or motivate donor governments to do better .
but in fact , some of the lowest ranked donors have told us they appreciate having a tool like the humanitarian response index to benchmark their performance and to know where they stand compared to their peers . the ranking is only a minor part of the exercise , though .
we collect a lot of valuable information about how donors are performing , and we have always offered this information to governments , donor agencies and other stakeholders to use it to understand where a government may need to improve , and where they are doing well .
by visiting 14 crises areas – the biggest evaluation exercise of its kind in the humanitarian sector – we are able to identify trends that affect the quality and impact of aid .
so we have lots of valuable analysis to share with the international community , such as our increasing concerns about politicization of aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food for those who need it most you must have confronted questions relating to legitimacy , though – what gives dara the authority to rank donor performance ?
first of all , dara has a great multi-disciplinary team with extensive experience in the field of evaluating humanitarian action . we were part of the huge tsunami joint evaluation exercise on how the entire humanitarian system responded .
dara looked specifically at the area of donor funding , which gave us insights on how they took decisions , and why good practice was so difficult for them to apply .
that was the basis for us creating the humanitarian response index – to systematically measure donor practice and provide solid , empirical evidence on where donor governments need to improve further . since then , we have carried out hri evaluations in over 35 crises , along with our extensive evaluation experience in other areas .
we also felt it was absolutely critical for an independent , objective evaluation of donor governments .
until the hri was created , there was no way to monitor if donor governments were complying with their commitments .
most of the tools and processes used by donors to assess their own performance are not transparent enough , and do n't look at issues around the quality of their aid , or the relationship with the humanitarian organizations they fund .
we think the hri can be used to stimulate changes and improvements .
has the hri , since its inception in 2007 , had a measurable impact on donors ?
if so , could you give some examples ?
yes .
the index has helped to raise many issues and concerns facing the humanitarian sector in general , and several donor governments have now taken this up as an issue for discussion at the international level .
for example , our findings in the 2008 report called for improvements in the way that humanitarian needs are identified so that aid could be distributed more effectively and fairly .
now , many governments are working with humanitarian organizations to address this gap .
some governments have used our findings as part of their overall evaluation of their aid programs and policies .
and dara has also begun working with some donor governments to provide a more detailed assessment on how they are doing , with recommendations on where to change and improve . next year we hope to carry out an evaluation of the impact of the hri after its first five years , where we can show how and where it has had an influence .
in the meantime , we will continue to offer our support and analysis to governments and other stakeholders who are interested in making sure that aid efforts help people affected by crisis .

the redd scheme aims to reward developing nations for preserving their forests . a pact on reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries - known to negotiators as redd or " reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation " - appears to be close to an international agreement at the un framework convention on climate change in cancun .
" there 's a really strong chance that we will get a solid agreement , " said rane cortez , the senior forest carbon advisor for the nature conservancy environmental group .
" there is a lot of consensus coming on the text , but we need a few tweaks to get everyone onboard , " she added .
the programme was launched in september 2008 and consists largely of offering financial incentives to developing countries such as brazil , indonesia or the democratic republic of congo to save their tropical forests .
deforestation accounts for almost one-fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions , which is more than the entire global transport sector causes .
co2 released into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels like oil and coal can be absorbed and stored by forests until the forest dies .
yet even though that 's a well established fact , deforestation is continuing at a rapid pace .
each year , an estimated 13 million hectares of forest - mainly rain forest - is destroyed .
that 's equivalent to the area of a country like greece .
bildunterschrift : sources of greenhouse gasses - deforestation accounts for 17 percent of global emissions a simple concept the principle behind redd is simple .
the idea is to reward developing nations that preserve their forests , boost the carbon stock , and have sustainable forestry management .
currently , forests in developing countries are often cleared to make way for plantations , agricultural land or livestock .
in order to give people there the chance to make a different living , developed countries would under the redd scheme have to pay for the environmental services which these forests perform if they are left intact .
a fair deal , one might think - not least in view of the fact that developed nations are historically responsible for the ever-increasing co2 in the atmosphere - and thus for global climate change .
since a hectare of a palm oil plantation or arable land brings in more money than a hectare of rainforest , compensation should be agreed on an international level , according to the reasoning behind the redd concept .
bildunterschrift : cumulative co2 emissions -lrb- 1850-2000 -rrb- show usa and europe have been the biggest poluters money money money but even if it sounds like a logical solution , the simplicity ends when money comes into play .
what form this compensation should take and who should finance it are in dispute .
some negotiators say that only public money should go to redd .
but others say it is more realistic to set up a market approach that would allow nations to swap assistance for credits in emission reduction goals .
sha zukang , the un undersecretary for economic and social affairs , said funding so far has been insufficient even though the forest issue was critical for the " protection of the environment , social development and the fight against poverty . "
developed nations have pledged some 4.5 billion dollars for redd .
the leading financial contributor is norway , which among other projects has committed to provide one billion dollars for indonesia which plans a two-year moratorium on new clearing of natural forests and peat lands from 2011 .
what is a forest ?
but even before negotiators get to the sticky issue of money , " the debate about the redd agreement begins with the definition of the term ' forest ' , " said christoph thies of greenpeace .
to date no agreement has been reached in the negotiations : some also want plantations to count as forests , while others think the term should only refer to primary forests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace does n't want plantations to be counted as " forests " " for us at greenpeace it ' quite clear : a forest is a natural ecosystem that is dominated by trees - but not a plantation .
a tree plantation follows the principles of agriculture and is more of a tree farm for us , " thies said .
a tree farm or a plantation hardly stores any co2 .
even worse : to make room for the plantation , rain forest has to be cleared - and in this way co2 and methane is released into the atmosphere .
if this were rewarded in a redd agreement , thies thinks it would lose all credibility .
who does the forest belong to ?
worldwide , over a billion people live off the forest - many of them belong to indigenous people that have not only lived in the forest , but also from the forest .
the norwegian rainforest foundation wants to support and strengthen precisely this population , said lars loevold .
he said that involving indigenous peoples in the debate was not just an ethical question but a strategic decision .
" we are 100 percent convinced that forest protection will only work if we recognize the traditional communal rights of these people , " loevold said .
" for centuries they have maintained and protected the forests .
what looks to us in the west like untouched rain forest , is in fact the result of a very complex ecosystem within which humans have also played a role for centuries .
in this life cycle , a richer biodiversity has been created than if no people had lived there , " loevold added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies show that indigenous people can look after forest better than national parks local administration is more successful than national parks new research supports loevold 's argument that forests which are managed by indigenous peoples and local communities are better protected and have a greater biodiversity than , for example , national parks .
to enable people who actually live from and with the forests to have their voice heard at international climate negotiations , the norwegian rainforest foundation have paid the travel costs of indigenous representatives from all around the world .
the demands of indigenous peoples have become an essential part of climate negotiations .
the point for the director of the norwegian rainforest foundation at redd negotiations in cancun is that the forests should not just degenerate into a short-term investment .
" until now it has been profitable to destroy the rain forest .
some earned money with deforestation , but they did n't have to pay for the costs of the destruction .
the redd agreement is about finding mechanisms which reward people who protect forests , and punish those who destroy the forest , " said lars loevold .
this issue is being addressed by the 194 member countries at the un climate summit in cancun , mexico .
an agreement seems within reach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 07.12.2010 germany 's schools improve their grades modestly in global league tables großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading and writing skills still represent germany 's achilles ' heel germany is back into the ' first division ' when it comes to education around the world , but still needs to raise its game to secure qualification for the champions ' league .
so say the organizers of the pisa studies . an international study into the abilities of 15 year-old schoolchildren has shown that german children have been making steady progress in recent years .
however , germany 's results in the fourth program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- study , released on tuesday , were hardly stellar either .
like the inaugural study in 2000 , in which germany scored disastrously for a developed country , this 2009 investigation focused on literacy skills among students .
the german grade improved by 13 points to 497 , representing an average score for industrialized countries .
nevertheless , german 15 year-olds are roughly one school year behind their counterparts in table-topping countries like finland -lrb- 536 points -rrb- or south korea -lrb- 539 -rrb- .
" germany has been promoted from the second division to the top flight , " the berlin head of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , heino von meyer , said at a press conference on tuesday .
" but germany 's still a long way away from qualifying for the champions ' league . "
the oecd conducts the pisa study in 65 countries , testing almost half a million teenagers in the process .
roughly 5,000 randomly-selected german children from 230 schools took part in the study .
germany also made progress in the smaller mathematics and science sections of the study , and can now boast above-average performance against comparable countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students are as good as their teachers , the study concludes " germany has improved its status from ' horrendous ' to ' average , ' we are at least satisfied with that upward trend , " the chairwoman of the german government 's education committee , ulla burchardt said .
" but i do n't think this is cause for celebration , rather continued reflection .
we 're still struggling when it comes to literacy skills ; and these are the most important qualifications for young school leavers seeking a job and a place in society . "
shortly before the publication of the pisa results , education minister annette schavan pledged to implement a new program encouraging youngsters to read in their free time .
top teachers = top marks the pisa study highlighted the importance of placing quality teachers in the classroom .
" it 's crucial that schools try to secure the brightest available brains , " the coordinator of the pisa study , andreas schleicher , said in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" countries like finland are doing a great job of this . "
schleicher also criticized the syllabus-driven schooling system prevalent in the western world , likening the modern day teacher to an assembly line worker .
" somebody publishes a lesson plan , and then the teacher is expected to sit down in the classroom and follow it . "
in the first pisa study in 2000 , 22.6 percent of german 15 year-olds were at least two years behind the average level for literacy and numeracy , and that figure has only dropped to 18.5 percent in the interim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the word pisa has become a headache for students , teachers , and politicians alike " it is imperative that we reduce the size of this group of 15 year-olds whose reading , writing and arithmetic skills are still at an elementary school level , " education researcher at the university of muenster , professor ewald terhart said .
" this is only possible by changing the teaching methods in the relevant subjects , and to do that , we need to give additional training to our teachers .
it will cost time and money , but it 's the only way to meaningfully change the quality of teaching . "
social status still decisive factor the vast majority of the lowest scoring german students hail either from less wealthy families or from families with immigrant backgrounds , or both .
the gap in performance between children from these groups and the average german student remains greater than in most pisa participants .
however , the study also noted that the discrepancy had shrunk considerably in the past decade .
traditionally , german high schools have been split up into three tiers , and oecd officials praised initiatives in some german states to merge the bottom two tiers , saying this would help prevent children from falling adrift in the future .
pisa officials also recommended that germany consider restructuring class sizes in its school system .
currently , average class sizes tend to get progressively smaller as children get older .
however , the study notes that young children benefit more from small classes , while teenagers cope with larger groups more effectively .
the 2003 pisa study focused on mathematics , and in 2006 , science was the principal subject assessed .

hochtief , which currently has five subsidiaries in qatar and employs more than five thousand people in the country , is to sell its shares at 57.114 euros a piece , which is less than the current stock price , but around the same as acs is offering .
the news of the deal between qatar and hochtief sent shares soaring , which as analysts were quick to point out , would make acs 's all-share offer considerably more expensive .
the group , headed by real madrid soccer club president florentino perez , has yet to comment on the latest twist in the takeover drama in which qatar shines as the white knight .
but there is nothing selfless about the oil-rich country 's intervention .
quite the reverse in fact .
" this is qatar 's moment and it has been working towards it for the past ten years , " kristian coates-ulrichsen , kuwait research fellow at the london school of economics told deutsche welle .
" it has been trying to diversify its name and create a brand ' qatar ' through the acquisition of high profile companies . "
sparkling portfolio among the country 's corporate portfolio are stakes in the german sports car manufacturer porsche , europe 's largest carmaker volkswagen , and arguably the most prestigious department store in the world , harrods .
and that is to name but a few .
bildunterschrift : harrods is one of qatar 's high-brand icons " they have been getting powerful external economies to buy into the image so as to reposition themselves , " coates-ulrichsen said .
" they plan to diversify away from being a gas and oil-based economy . "
and winning the bid for the 2022 soccer world cup has helped them on their way .
it means instant recognition and international acceptance of qatar as a global force , and it also puts the country ahead of its regional competitors .
" dubai and abu dhabi have been trying to do the same thing as qatar , but the world cup puts qatar to the front of the queue and overshadows everything else , " the economist added .
new infrastructure in the offing the gulf country 's stock exchange responded well to the news of the successful soccer bid , and taha abdel ghani , general manager of nama economic consulting told the afp news agency that it had " raised investors ' confidence in the qatari market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the qatar university stadium for the the 2022 world cup " there are huge sums of money that qatar has pledged to spend within a set period of time , " he said .
doubtless a lot of that money will go on infrastructure to make the first world cup to be held in the middle east a resounding success .
there is already talk of a joint venture between hochtief and qatar to build an entirely new city , designed to house 200,000 people and play a hosting role in the soccer championships .
hochtief ceo herbert luetkestratkoetter is optimistic that a construction boom is on the way .
" you need to be able to accommodate guests who come to the country , " he told reporters .
" it suits me just fine .
i 'm happy about it . "
strategic planning in that context , the decision to invest in the german construction company could be seen as highly strategic .
it would certainly sit with the country 's pattern of doing things .
a couple of years ago qatar invested in a shipyard in poland which was building tankers to transport its gas .
bildunterschrift : there 's much more to qatar than the sand on which it is built " it 's all part of a broader plan to diversify and meet the needs of the qatari economic strategy by investing in companies they can use , " coates-ulrichsen said .
" they match talent with economic niches . "
and as far as he is concerned they do it exceptionally well .
rather than bothering with speculative investment like some other gulf states , qatar has a clear vision of how it wants to diversify , namely into iconic western companies , construction and real estate .
this , the economist insists , will stand the country in great stead , opening not only economic , but political doors for what might once have been regarded as a small country in the middle of the desert .

in a video interview with the french newspaper presse ocean , cantona suggested that everyone should withdraw their money from the banks in an attempt to punish the " corrupt , criminal " banking system .
" the three million people in the street , they go to the bank , withdraw their money , and the banks collapse ...
that 's a real threat , there 's a real revolution , " he said in the video .
the video interview was picked up by two " civic activists " who named december 7 as the day people should withdraw their cash and set up a website to help circulate cantona 's video .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cantona 's comments caused an international campaign for a run on banks tens of thousands of people have watched the video online and signed a support group on the social networking website facebook .
' stop interfering ' cantona 's philosophizing on the future of the banking sector has been met with scathing criticism from the french finance minister .
christine lagarde said cantona should stop " intervening in finance and economics , especially when he does n't fully understand the mechanics of it . "
her comments were backed by the head of france 's largest bank bnp paribas , who said the footballer 's comments were " typically misplaced . "
" the recommendation to withdraw deposits will sow insecurity , " said baudoin prot .
as cantona 's " revolution " gained support across europe , the head of the eurogroup of finance ministers jean-claude juncker added his criticisms calling the scheme " irresponsible . "
european union economic affairs commissioner olli rehn added : " i think mr cantona is a better footballer than he is an economist . "

russia now appears to be on its way to membership , despite the longest running negotiations in history . on tuesday , european union commission president jose manuel barroso announced a breakthrough to clear the way for russia 's entry to the world trade organization .
" our difficult bilateral issues are resolved .
we signed a memorandum of understanding to this end today , " barroso said at the brussels summit .
as part of the agreement , russia has pledged to lower export duties on timber and asian freight that travels to europe via russian railways .
the road to wto membership is usually long and paved with obstacles - but russia 's ongoing 17-year journey is a world record .
the nation with a 90 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- economy is the largest outside the wto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower export duties on russian timber will benefit eu paper makers the blame game frustrated russian politicians blame politically-motivated delay tactics employed by the us and the eu , while trade diplomats in geneva fault russia for failing to understand the rules of the organization .
the key to speeding up the process now lies in moscow , according to wto spokesman keith rockwell .
" the pace of accession is in almost every instance driven by the capital of the country that is acceding , " rockwell said .
in many instances the reforms that are required to join the wto are politically difficult - which is certainly the case in russia , he added .
" there are sectors of the russian economy that find the process of joining the wto very difficult . "
making nice with the neighbors moscow must now get approval from the other members of the wto , a process that includes entering talks with any of the 153 wto members that wish to negotiate .
on monday , russian president dmitri medvedev made the first state visit by a kremlin leader to poland in nine years , and secured poland 's support for russia 's wto accession .
but not all bilateral talks have been constructive .
georgia , russia 's neighbor to the south , has been a wto member for ten years , and has blocked the russian accession process since the armed conflict in the summer of 2008 .
ukraine , too , still has not given a green light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland supports russia 's accession to the wto a veto , however , is unlikely , says alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations .
" in my opinion , in doing so , georgia would harm itself , given the fact that the eu and the us both want russia in the wto and not out of it .
such a move by the georgians would jeopardize the agenda which the west has set up with russia , " rahr told deutche welle .
a powerful partner the european union , with 500 million people , is russia 's largest trading partner .
if russia joins the world trade organization , the nation will be unable to impose arbitrary import bans , drastic tariff increases , and import restrictions without risking sanctions .
exporting nations such as germany would benefit from easier market access , says wto spokesman rockwell , adding that membership for russia would provide german exporters , as well as their japanese and american counterparts , with " a certain sense of predictability " when they enter into business transactions in that country .
" that makes the country a more attractive place for doing business , " said rockwell .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keith rockwell speaks for the wto which represents more than 97 percent of global trade a rocky start in the past , russia has been less than committed to the process of joining the wto .
in june 2009 , prime minister vladimir putin declared out of the blue that russia was withdrawing its application for accession to the wto .
instead , his country would join the world trade organization as a customs union , together with kazakhstan and belarus .
in 2007 , in his capacity as president , putin lost patience with geneva 's trade diplomacy , labeling the wto as " archaic , undemocratic and inflexible . "
but the wto wo n't hold a grudge , said keith rockwell .
" we are very thick-skinned in the wto , " the spokesman said , adding mr. putin would be welcome for a visit any time . " we would be very happy to see him here . "

although the two sides have agreed to meet again , the sticking point is the demand for iran to suspend uranium enrichment . the negotiations between un security council heavyweights the united states , russia , china , france and britain along with germany - the so called 5 + 1 group - with an iranian delegation were the first in 13 months .
the negotiation teams , headed by eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton for the 5 + 1 and iran 's secretary of the national security council saaed jalili , agreed that a further round of talks would take place at the end of january in turkey . however , iran has already made it clear that it will not discuss its uranium enrichment program , which it insists is for peaceful purposes while western powers fear the fuel would be used for nuclear warheads .
at the last meeting in october 2009 , the 5 + 1 agreed to a proposal that would have allowed iran to ship a major portion of the uranium they had enriched to 3.5 percent to an external destination to undergo further enrichment and to be converted into fuel rods for the small tehran research reactor .
that would remove the potential threat of weapons-grade material being siphoned off within iran for military purposes .
iran originally agreed to this proposal but later reneged on it , having scored a major point by having the 5 + 1 tacitly agree to iran engaging in enrichment , a practice forbidden by security council resolutions .
then in may this year , brazil and turkey tried to re-broker the deal but this attempt was scuppered by the united states which claimed higher levels of uranium had been enriched in iran since the original offer in 2009 and that the new export deal would leave too much material behind in iran .
iran 's stance on enrichment levels proving obstructive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's saeed jalili will present a similar stance to that of 2009 " if iran agrees to suspend further enrichment , up to the 17.5 percent which it has already stated it was pressing ahead with , then there are a whole series of economic incentives which are on the table , " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , told deutsche welle .
" if , on the other hand , as ahmadinejad has said , iran does not want to address the issue of enrichment or make any concessions or compromises on that account , there will be no alternative at this stage but the consideration of further punitive sanctions . "
chances of reaching any agreements or compromises seem very bleak at this time , khonsari added , but there are clear signs that because economic and other pressures are making life very difficult for the iranian regime , ahmadinejad may be looking for a way out without losing face .
" for ahmadinejad and his supporters there are two main reasons for an engagement with washington , " professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" first , they know that an understanding with the us would be popular , particularly among the educated youth and the business community .
the second reason is that ahmadinejad and the political leadership feel that the regime is under serious threat by the united states , and only by the united states . "
perthes said iran 's threat perception , and its deep suspicion of us intentions , are often underestimated in washington despite these issues being driving factors in iranian politics .
while the regime elite still appears to be divided over the prospect of a full-scale rapprochement with the united states , it is believed many share this fear of the us and there is a real desire to avoid further isolation .
with this in mind , the 5 + 1 may consider lessened sanctions - along with other incentives - as a way to achieve progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has so far dismissed the western incentives incentives on offer but tehran remains steadfast " the western powers along with russia and china are offering iran lessened sanctions , the chance to fix world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership in return for explanations of what has gone on in regard to tehran 's nuclear program and realistic assurances that it has no military nuclear intentions , " simon henderson , director of the gulf and energy policy program at the washington institute for near east policy , told deutsche welle .
" the best hope for agreement lies on the possibility of reaching an acceptable compromise regarding the shipment of already enriched uranium from iran to an outside destination , " khonsari said .
" if agreement could be reached on the quantity , and there is a minute chance given past turkish and brazilian mediation that this is possible , there may still be a way out though it will be very difficult . "
there were concerns that the geneva negotiations would be made even more problematic by the latest wikileaks revelations which exposed the level of international concern and distrust of iran , especially among its persian gulf neighbors , and the consideration of many that military action is the best option when it comes to stopping tehran 's nuclear program .
however , experts believe there is little new information in the wikileaks revelations and that all the parties involved in the talks with iran are already aware of the delicate nature of relations .
wikileaks revelations unlikely to add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks revelations on iran are unlikely to affect talks " there is nothing in the wikileaks revelations that the islamic authorities have been unaware of , " khonsari said .
" the iranian regime understands that matters will be ratcheted up if they are unable to reach an agreement and they are aware that , irrespective of all factors , the likelihood of military confrontation is a very real possibility . "
khonsari believes the consensus among iran 's opponents , that confronting an ambitious iran with all its downsides might be a cheaper option than living with a nuclear iran - as highlighted in the wikileaks cables - might possibly alter tehran 's previous calculations .
those gambled on the belief that the americans would never dare to embark on another military adventure in the aftermath of the iraq and afghanistan conflicts .
options running out if current talks fail " the 5 + 1 diplomats think that sanctions will eventually work , " said simon henderson .
" however , it 's hard to say what iran will do next in response . iran might calculate that if it tests a bomb , there would be some condemnation but then the world would have to get used to a new status quo , much in the same way as it did after the indian and pakistani tests in 1998 . "
mehrdad khonsari said the general consensus is that ahmadinejad wants to escalate matters and essentially go to the very brink of war in a bid to shore up his own leadership , which has been under pressure since the opposition protests in 2009 .
" it is believed that ahmadinejad feels a military conflict might help him consolidate his position inside the country , " he concluded .
" in such a case , his major aim is to buy time as it is unlikely that anything positive can be achieved as a result of these negotiations . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 07.12.2010 is the eu emergency fund big enough ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb is in charge of monetary but not fiscal policy eu finance ministers said monday that they would not be taking new measures to tackle the current debt crisis in the bloc .
deutsche welle spoke with tom kirchmaier of the london school of economics about the decision . eurozone finance ministers met on monday evening to discuss increasing the emergency fund but ultimately decided it was big enough .
is it ?
at the moment it is enough .
but the problem is a different one .
you arrange a fund like this to send a signal to the market that there is no point in speculating against the currency .
so by not increasing the fund , the eurozone finance ministers send a signal that there might actually be a point in speculating against larger countries like spain .
so in that way , they made the markets less stable , not more .
you do n't think markets are convinced yet that the debt crisis is contained ?
the funds are enough to support countries like greece and portugal , they are not enough to support countries like spain , or belgium , or italy .
it 's an arithmetic game , and you come up with a number that 's around one-and-a-half trillion , or two trillion euros and you come up with a guarantee where you can say , this is rock solid .
the number is just so big that it becomes clear to everybody that a speculator ca n't win .
another idea that had been floated prior to monday evening 's meeting , but was then not discussed , was that of bonds issued jointly by the eurozone countries .
is that a good idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the efsf is not big enough for markets to take it seriously " it 's a good idea in principle , but it 's very far-fetched politically .
one of the problems with the eurozone - and it 's a problem from birth - is that monetary policy is done by the european central bank , but fiscal policy is done by each of the member states .
and that creates almost perverse incentives for the individual member states to over-consume , which is what they have done .
one of the ways to solve this problem is to centralize fiscal policy , i.e. to make more fiscal decisions in brussels .
if you launch a euro bond , you essentially do exactly that because you then unify all the risks which you have in the eurozone .
for it to work , you have to have a centralized fiscal policy .
interestingly , china and sovereign wealth funds are very keen for europe to issue these bonds because they would be highly liquid and a good alternative to a us treasury bond .
both the bigger emergency fund and the euro bonds are supposed to convince markets of the " irreversibility " of the euro , as luxemberg 's prime minister jean claude juncker put it .
is the euro in fact " irreversible " or can you imagine a scenario in which this common currency would fold ?
nothing is irreversible .
it would unravel the minute that germany in particular were to make the tiniest suggestion about leaving .
it would be possible to reverse the euro , but it would have catastrophic consequences .
on one hand , you would see a bank run with weaker countries - everybody would try to get their money and put it in a german bank account and that would lead to an immediate collapse of the banking system in that country .
it would be catastrophic for the european idea , for these weak economies , and if germany were to decide to leave , it would not be good for germany either because the currency would appreciate dramatically .
next week at a eu summit , leaders are expected to agree on permanent eurozone rescue mechanisms , since the current emergency fund expires in 2013 .
what could or what should these permanent mechanisms look like ?
the issue of " permanent " only makes sense if the fund is large and credible enough .
at the moment i do n't see that we are getting any closer to making a credible long-term commitment to stability .
the only really credible commitment would be to integrate fiscal policy further .

in brussels on tuesday , eu monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn expressed confidence that this money would not be lost .
" i 'm confident that ireland , with its smart , competent , and stubborn people - and its prospects of recovering -lsb- from -rsb- this situation - will overcome the current challenges . "
tough budget while the final stamp of approval for the bailout loan was being given in brussels , the irish government in dublin announced deep cuts in its 2011 budget .
tax hikes and spending cuts are expected to save the country around 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lenihan unveiled a tough budget on tuesday " as outlined in the plan , six billion euros of the overall adjustment is made in today 's budget .
the scale of this adjustment is demanding but it demonstrates the seriousness of our intent , " said finance minister brian lenihan in an address to ireland 's lower house of parliament .
the budget cuts were necessary to secure the bailout from the eu and the international monetary fund .
tapping the reserves ireland 's bailout comes from the 750 billion euro crisis fund established earlier this year after greece required similar aid .
now , the question is still being asked : will ireland be the only country to access the fund , or will portugal , spain or even italy need support soon ?
and if so , will 750 billion euros be enough ?
for spanish finance minister elena salgado , the problem simply does not exist .
“ the volume of the crisis mechanism seems reasonable to us , ” she said .
but from her , these words seem logical ; spain is trying to soothe the markets .
belgian finance minister didier reynders , who chaired the talks , is more cautious , saying debates on the size of the bailout mechanism will likely continue .

but know-how , often protected by patents , is trickling way too slowly from industrialized nations to poorer regions . every few years , world leaders get together at high-profile conferences to discuss ways to reduce global warming and save the planet . the 2010 united nations climate change conference is currently being held in cancun , mexico .
but the talks are taking place amid low expectations , after the disappointment of the copenhagen summit last year – which memorably failed to produce any binding agreements .
this came as a particular blow to the g77 countries , which have in fact expanded to 131 mostly developing nations .
their demands include a relaxation , if not a general lifting , of patent protection laws governing renewable energies .
their argument is that it is first and foremost the industrialized nations that are responsible for climate change , while the poorer nations pay the price for the wealthier countries ' mistakes .
therefore industrialized nations should at least give them the benefit of their green energy know-how .
sharing their patents would go some way to paying off their climate debts , the g77 countries say .
the patent imbalance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patents get in the way of technology transfer between developed and developing nations according to a new study compiled by the un environment program , 80 percent of all patented innovations in the area of clean energy technologies are registered by companies in japan , germany , us , south korea , britain and france .
the report , which examines the role of patents in combating climate change , was jointly conducted with the european patent office and the international centre for trade and sustainable development .
" the fact that northern countries keep their expertise on regenerative energies to themselves , puts the south at an additional disadvantage , " says aileen kwa from south center , an intergovernmental policy think tank of developing countries .
as a climate-friendly , affordable alternative to fossil fuels , clean energy is key to the future of the developing world , and allows people to access energy supplies without having to rely on major providers .
moreover , it decentralizes the energy supply .
in countries where the majority of the population is rural , solar panels and geothermal heat pumps installed in individual homes are energy efficient solutions for people who would otherwise go without .
one problem , however , is the frequent lack of local expertise necessary not only to install the technology , but also to maintain it .
not only does the equipment therefore need to be imported – the know-how does to .
if patents are a factor , the whole process soon becomes very costly .
but it 's not only developing nations that have some catching-up to do on the clean energy front .
green technology is still very much in its infancy in croatia , for example , although grassroots projects are slowly beginning to gather momentum .
even in industrialized countries , it seems , introduction of climate protection measures comes with a high price tag . popular misconceptions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in cancun , debate is centering around mobilizing funds and technology transfer to cope with climate change one obstacle to globalized climate control is the general ignorance in the developed world of what exactly the developing world needs .
" indigenous knowledge on protecting natural resources and alternative energy supplies often exists , " points out kwa , stressing that all that 's then needed is a transfer of technology that can be implemented locally .
rainer osterwalder from the european patent office agrees , but says there 's plenty of room for improvement .
" the technology transfer from north to south is still unsatisfactory , " he says .
" one thing that should n't be forgotten is that emerging economies , and china in particular , are increasingly active when it comes to domestic innovation in the area of regenerative energy . "
" patents neither create problems nor solve them , " he says .
in his opinion , more urgent problems include inadequate infrastructure in the developing world ; the lack of an existing market for clean technologies and the lack of opportunity to build one .
adding to the problem is the popular misconception that patents are internationally valid .
in fact , if a patent is n't registered with the patent office of a specific country , then it does n't exist .
" a french company does n't necessarily register the patent for its photovoltaic technology in angola , say , if it believes that there 's no market for such a system in that country , " explains osterwalder .
in developing countries , however , few people are aware that many technologies are not actually patented in their country .
a spanner in the works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , local expertise is underestimated critics believe that ultimately , patent protection is a major stumbling block in fighting climate change .
in recent years , the european patent office has complained about the ‘ global patent warming , ' stressing that the increasing number of patent applications is slowing down the issue of patents .
the multitude of patent applications does not mean that the world is coming up with more innovations - rather , what is happening is that inventors and companies that already hold patents in one country are lining up at many other national patent offices to get patents for other markets .
ultimately , the purpose of securing a patent is to throw a spanner in the works of rival development .
the patents issue is one that results in the developing world feeling as though it has been left to deal with climate change by itself , by the very countries that are mainly responsible for it .
but industrialized nations retaliate by citing the free market and the necessary protection of intellectual property – and , needless to say , their own economic superiority . whether or not it is justifiable to privatize expertise in the field of regenerative energy is a question that will no doubt be raised at the current summit in cancun .

russia now appears to be on its way to membership , despite the longest running negotiations in history . on tuesday , european union commission president jose manuel barroso announced a breakthrough to clear the way for russia 's entry to the world trade organization .
" our difficult bilateral issues are resolved .
we signed a memorandum of understanding to this end today , " barroso said at the brussels summit .
as part of the agreement , russia has pledged to lower export duties on timber and asian freight that travels to europe via russian railways .
the road to wto membership is usually long and paved with obstacles - but russia 's ongoing 17-year journey is a world record .

the key to speeding up the process now lies in moscow , according to wto spokesman keith rockwell .
" the pace of accession is in almost every instance driven by the capital of the country that is acceding , " rockwell said .
in many instances the reforms that are required to join the wto are politically difficult - which is certainly the case in russia , he added .
" there are sectors of the russian economy that find the process of joining the wto very difficult . "
making nice with the neighbors moscow must now get approval from the other members of the wto , a process that includes entering talks with any of the 153 wto members that wish to negotiate .
on monday , russian president dmitri medvedev made the first state visit by a kremlin leader to poland in nine years , and secured poland 's support for russia 's wto accession .
but not all bilateral talks have been constructive .
georgia , russia 's neighbor to the south , has been a wto member for ten years , and has blocked the russian accession process since the armed conflict in the summer of 2008 .
ukraine , too , still has not given a green light .

the redd scheme aims to reward developing nations for preserving their forests . a pact on reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries - known to negotiators as redd or " reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation " - appears to be close to an international agreement at the un framework convention on climate change in cancun .
" there 's a really strong chance that we will get a solid agreement , " said rane cortez , the senior forest carbon advisor for the nature conservancy environmental group .
" there is a lot of consensus coming on the text , but we need a few tweaks to get everyone onboard , " she added .
the programme was launched in september 2008 and consists largely of offering financial incentives to developing countries such as brazil , indonesia or the democratic republic of congo to save their tropical forests .
deforestation accounts for almost one-fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions , which is more than the entire global transport sector causes .
co2 released into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels like oil and coal can be absorbed and stored by forests until the forest dies .
yet even though that 's a well established fact , deforestation is continuing at a rapid pace .
each year , an estimated 13 million hectares of forest - mainly rain forest - is destroyed .
that 's equivalent to the area of a country like greece .
bildunterschrift : sources of greenhouse gasses - deforestation accounts for 17 percent of global emissions a simple concept the principle behind redd is simple .
the idea is to reward developing nations that preserve their forests , boost the carbon stock , and have sustainable forestry management .
currently , forests in developing countries are often cleared to make way for plantations , agricultural land or livestock .
in order to give people there the chance to make a different living , developed countries would under the redd scheme have to pay for the environmental services which these forests perform if they are left intact .
a fair deal , one might think - not least in view of the fact that developed nations are historically responsible for the ever-increasing co2 in the atmosphere - and thus for global climate change .
since a hectare of a palm oil plantation or arable land brings in more money than a hectare of rainforest , compensation should be agreed on an international level , according to the reasoning behind the redd concept .
bildunterschrift : cumulative co2 emissions -lrb- 1850-2000 -rrb- show usa and europe have been the biggest poluters money money money but even if it sounds like a logical solution , the simplicity ends when money comes into play .
what form this compensation should take and who should finance it are in dispute .
some negotiators say that only public money should go to redd .
but others say it is more realistic to set up a market approach that would allow nations to swap assistance for credits in emission reduction goals .
sha zukang , the un undersecretary for economic and social affairs , said funding so far has been insufficient even though the forest issue was critical for the " protection of the environment , social development and the fight against poverty . "
developed nations have pledged some 4.5 billion dollars for redd .
the leading financial contributor is norway , which among other projects has committed to provide one billion dollars for indonesia which plans a two-year moratorium on new clearing of natural forests and peat lands from 2011 .
what is a forest ?
but even before negotiators get to the sticky issue of money , " the debate about the redd agreement begins with the definition of the term ' forest ' , " said christoph thies of greenpeace .
to date no agreement has been reached in the negotiations : some also want plantations to count as forests , while others think the term should only refer to primary forests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace does n't want plantations to be counted as " forests " " for us at greenpeace it ' quite clear : a forest is a natural ecosystem that is dominated by trees - but not a plantation .
a tree plantation follows the principles of agriculture and is more of a tree farm for us , " thies said .
a tree farm or a plantation hardly stores any co2 .
even worse : to make room for the plantation , rain forest has to be cleared - and in this way co2 and methane is released into the atmosphere .
if this were rewarded in a redd agreement , thies thinks it would lose all credibility .
who does the forest belong to ?
worldwide , over a billion people live off the forest - many of them belong to indigenous people that have not only lived in the forest , but also from the forest .
the norwegian rainforest foundation wants to support and strengthen precisely this population , said lars loevold .
he said that involving indigenous peoples in the debate was not just an ethical question but a strategic decision .
" we are 100 percent convinced that forest protection will only work if we recognize the traditional communal rights of these people , " loevold said .
" for centuries they have maintained and protected the forests .
what looks to us in the west like untouched rain forest , is in fact the result of a very complex ecosystem within which humans have also played a role for centuries .
in this life cycle , a richer biodiversity has been created than if no people had lived there , " loevold added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies show that indigenous people can look after forest better than national parks local administration is more successful than national parks new research supports loevold 's argument that forests which are managed by indigenous peoples and local communities are better protected and have a greater biodiversity than , for example , national parks .
to enable people who actually live from and with the forests to have their voice heard at international climate negotiations , the norwegian rainforest foundation have paid the travel costs of indigenous representatives from all around the world .
the demands of indigenous peoples have become an essential part of climate negotiations .
the point for the director of the norwegian rainforest foundation at redd negotiations in cancun is that the forests should not just degenerate into a short-term investment .
" until now it has been profitable to destroy the rain forest .
some earned money with deforestation , but they did n't have to pay for the costs of the destruction .
the redd agreement is about finding mechanisms which reward people who protect forests , and punish those who destroy the forest , " said lars loevold .
this issue is being addressed by the 194 member countries at the un climate summit in cancun , mexico .
an agreement seems within reach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 07.12.2010 is the eu emergency fund big enough ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb is in charge of monetary but not fiscal policy eu finance ministers said monday that they would not be taking new measures to tackle the current debt crisis in the bloc .
deutsche welle spoke with tom kirchmaier of the london school of economics about the decision . eurozone finance ministers met on monday evening to discuss increasing the emergency fund but ultimately decided it was big enough .
is it ?
at the moment it is enough .
but the problem is a different one .
you arrange a fund like this to send a signal to the market that there is no point in speculating against the currency .
so by not increasing the fund , the eurozone finance ministers send a signal that there might actually be a point in speculating against larger countries like spain .
so in that way , they made the markets less stable , not more .
you do n't think markets are convinced yet that the debt crisis is contained ?
the funds are enough to support countries like greece and portugal , they are not enough to support countries like spain , or belgium , or italy .
it 's an arithmetic game , and you come up with a number that 's around one-and-a-half trillion , or two trillion euros and you come up with a guarantee where you can say , this is rock solid .
the number is just so big that it becomes clear to everybody that a speculator ca n't win .
another idea that had been floated prior to monday evening 's meeting , but was then not discussed , was that of bonds issued jointly by the eurozone countries .
is that a good idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the efsf is not big enough for markets to take it seriously " it 's a good idea in principle , but it 's very far-fetched politically .
one of the problems with the eurozone - and it 's a problem from birth - is that monetary policy is done by the european central bank , but fiscal policy is done by each of the member states .
and that creates almost perverse incentives for the individual member states to over-consume , which is what they have done .
one of the ways to solve this problem is to centralize fiscal policy , i.e. to make more fiscal decisions in brussels .
if you launch a euro bond , you essentially do exactly that because you then unify all the risks which you have in the eurozone .
for it to work , you have to have a centralized fiscal policy .
interestingly , china and sovereign wealth funds are very keen for europe to issue these bonds because they would be highly liquid and a good alternative to a us treasury bond .
both the bigger emergency fund and the euro bonds are supposed to convince markets of the " irreversibility " of the euro , as luxemberg 's prime minister jean claude juncker put it .
is the euro in fact " irreversible " or can you imagine a scenario in which this common currency would fold ?
nothing is irreversible .
it would unravel the minute that germany in particular were to make the tiniest suggestion about leaving .
it would be possible to reverse the euro , but it would have catastrophic consequences .
on one hand , you would see a bank run with weaker countries - everybody would try to get their money and put it in a german bank account and that would lead to an immediate collapse of the banking system in that country .
it would be catastrophic for the european idea , for these weak economies , and if germany were to decide to leave , it would not be good for germany either because the currency would appreciate dramatically .
next week at a eu summit , leaders are expected to agree on permanent eurozone rescue mechanisms , since the current emergency fund expires in 2013 .
what could or what should these permanent mechanisms look like ?
the issue of " permanent " only makes sense if the fund is large and credible enough .
at the moment i do n't see that we are getting any closer to making a credible long-term commitment to stability .
the only really credible commitment would be to integrate fiscal policy further .

he later held one-on-one meetings with the heads of the chinese , russian and british delegations as well as having a working dinner with ashton .
european sources said they were not expecting the geneva talks to produce instant results but hoping to re-engage iran over the longer term .
" we 've said all along that this was a starting point , and the aim was to have another meeting in which we can take things forward , " one eu diplomat told the news agency reuters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 07.12.2010 cash-strapped ireland awaits brutal 2011 austerity budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one down , 5,999,999,999 to go irish finance minister brian lenihan is to present his proposed 2011 budget to parliament later on tuesday , and it 's unlikely to make pleasant reading .
the debt-ridden country needs to fill a six billion euro hole . ireland 's already unpopular ruling party , fianna fail , will on tuesday present the toughest budget in the country 's history .
finance minister brian lenihan has already announced that dublin will be looking to raise an extra six billion euros -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- in 2011 , through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts .
due to the domestic budget presentation , lenihan has been forced to skip the high profile eurogroup meeting in brussels this week addressing the eurozone 's debt woes , sending ministry officials in his place .
the irish government effectively issued an outline of its plans for the coming year two weeks ago , when ironing out a broad four-year national recovery plan in order to qualify for an 85 billion euro rescue deal from the european union and international monetary fund .
the first tranche of these emergency loans will not be released until the budget is passed .
to placate the eu and imf , ireland needs to generate an extra 15 billion euros by 2014 , as it battles to bring its annual budget deficit back within the prescribed eurozone limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
this year 's deficit , which has ballooned due to the government bailout of the country 's biggest moneylender , anglo irish bank , is likely to be 32 percent of gdp .
" the budget is usually the most eagerly anticipated event in the fiscal calendar , " economist dermot o 'leary at goodbody stockbrokers in dublin told the afp news agency .
" this year though , the thunder has been stolen by the release of last week 's four-year plan .
we already know the broad parameters of what will be contained in the budget for 2011 . "
cuts in public sector , taxes to rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands protested when the initial recovery plan was announced roughly two-thirds of the savings are set to come from the public sector .
ireland 's relatively generous welfare spending is likely to take a big hit , with child benefit and social welfare spending facing a reduction of at least 5 percent .
only state pensions are expected to remain unchanged .
thousands of public sector jobs will also be cut , and those civil servants who keep their jobs will face pay cuts or freezes .
changes in tax brackets will generate the rest of the revenue .
by lowering income tax brands and revising the country 's tax credit system , the government will be able to target thousands of irish adults on lower incomes who currently do not have to pay income tax .
a reduction in the country 's minimum wage , which is currently the second highest in the eu at 8.65 euros per hour , is also on the cards .
government promises election once budget passes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even if ireland recovers , prime minister cowen is unlikely to irish prime minister brian cowen 's government might be forced into snap elections if the budget does not pass .
cowen , whose approval ratings are at an all-time low , has also pledged to call elections soon after parliament ratifies the austerity measures .
cowen 's coalition government no longer controls the lower house of parliament , the dail , and will need to find either independent or opposition support .
" the consequences of not passing a budget would be disastrous for ireland and its people , " independent mp michael lowry said in a statement on monday evening , pledging his reluctant support to the government 's proposal .
" despite some adverse reaction in my constituency to this decision i feel duty bound to put the country 's interests first . "
the dail 's other independent lawmaker , jackie healy-rae , has not yet revealed his position .
it 's unclear whether the main opposition group , the center-right fine gael and center-left labour parties , will attempt to thwart the budget in parliament or not .
barring a dramatic change in the public mood , these two parties look certain to rule in coalition once irish voters next go to the polls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 07.12.2010 no real breakthrough as 5 + 1 talks on iran end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 5 + 1 and iran returned to negotiations after 13 months nuclear talks between the 5 + 1 group and iran have ended in geneva with little sign of progress .
although the two sides have agreed to meet again , the sticking point is the demand for iran to suspend uranium enrichment . the negotiations between un security council heavyweights the united states , russia , china , france and britain along with germany - the so called 5 + 1 group - with an iranian delegation were the first in 13 months .
the negotiation teams , headed by eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton for the 5 + 1 and iran 's secretary of the national security council saaed jalili , agreed that a further round of talks would take place at the end of january in turkey . however , iran has already made it clear that it will not discuss its uranium enrichment program , which it insists is for peaceful purposes while western powers fear the fuel would be used for nuclear warheads .
at the last meeting in october 2009 , the 5 + 1 agreed to a proposal that would have allowed iran to ship a major portion of the uranium they had enriched to 3.5 percent to an external destination to undergo further enrichment and to be converted into fuel rods for the small tehran research reactor .
that would remove the potential threat of weapons-grade material being siphoned off within iran for military purposes .
iran originally agreed to this proposal but later reneged on it , having scored a major point by having the 5 + 1 tacitly agree to iran engaging in enrichment , a practice forbidden by security council resolutions .
then in may this year , brazil and turkey tried to re-broker the deal but this attempt was scuppered by the united states which claimed higher levels of uranium had been enriched in iran since the original offer in 2009 and that the new export deal would leave too much material behind in iran .
iran 's stance on enrichment levels proving obstructive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's saeed jalili will present a similar stance to that of 2009 " if iran agrees to suspend further enrichment , up to the 17.5 percent which it has already stated it was pressing ahead with , then there are a whole series of economic incentives which are on the table , " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , told deutsche welle .
" if , on the other hand , as ahmadinejad has said , iran does not want to address the issue of enrichment or make any concessions or compromises on that account , there will be no alternative at this stage but the consideration of further punitive sanctions . "
chances of reaching any agreements or compromises seem very bleak at this time , khonsari added , but there are clear signs that because economic and other pressures are making life very difficult for the iranian regime , ahmadinejad may be looking for a way out without losing face .
" for ahmadinejad and his supporters there are two main reasons for an engagement with washington , " professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" first , they know that an understanding with the us would be popular , particularly among the educated youth and the business community .
the second reason is that ahmadinejad and the political leadership feel that the regime is under serious threat by the united states , and only by the united states . "
perthes said iran 's threat perception , and its deep suspicion of us intentions , are often underestimated in washington despite these issues being driving factors in iranian politics .
while the regime elite still appears to be divided over the prospect of a full-scale rapprochement with the united states , it is believed many share this fear of the us and there is a real desire to avoid further isolation .
with this in mind , the 5 + 1 may consider lessened sanctions - along with other incentives - as a way to achieve progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has so far dismissed the western incentives incentives on offer but tehran remains steadfast " the western powers along with russia and china are offering iran lessened sanctions , the chance to fix world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership in return for explanations of what has gone on in regard to tehran 's nuclear program and realistic assurances that it has no military nuclear intentions , " simon henderson , director of the gulf and energy policy program at the washington institute for near east policy , told deutsche welle .
" the best hope for agreement lies on the possibility of reaching an acceptable compromise regarding the shipment of already enriched uranium from iran to an outside destination , " khonsari said .
" if agreement could be reached on the quantity , and there is a minute chance given past turkish and brazilian mediation that this is possible , there may still be a way out though it will be very difficult . "
there were concerns that the geneva negotiations would be made even more problematic by the latest wikileaks revelations which exposed the level of international concern and distrust of iran , especially among its persian gulf neighbors , and the consideration of many that military action is the best option when it comes to stopping tehran 's nuclear program .
however , experts believe there is little new information in the wikileaks revelations and that all the parties involved in the talks with iran are already aware of the delicate nature of relations .
wikileaks revelations unlikely to add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks revelations on iran are unlikely to affect talks " there is nothing in the wikileaks revelations that the islamic authorities have been unaware of , " khonsari said .
" the iranian regime understands that matters will be ratcheted up if they are unable to reach an agreement and they are aware that , irrespective of all factors , the likelihood of military confrontation is a very real possibility . "
khonsari believes the consensus among iran 's opponents , that confronting an ambitious iran with all its downsides might be a cheaper option than living with a nuclear iran - as highlighted in the wikileaks cables - might possibly alter tehran 's previous calculations .
those gambled on the belief that the americans would never dare to embark on another military adventure in the aftermath of the iraq and afghanistan conflicts .
options running out if current talks fail " the 5 + 1 diplomats think that sanctions will eventually work , " said simon henderson .
" however , it 's hard to say what iran will do next in response . iran might calculate that if it tests a bomb , there would be some condemnation but then the world would have to get used to a new status quo , much in the same way as it did after the indian and pakistani tests in 1998 . "
mehrdad khonsari said the general consensus is that ahmadinejad wants to escalate matters and essentially go to the very brink of war in a bid to shore up his own leadership , which has been under pressure since the opposition protests in 2009 .
" it is believed that ahmadinejad feels a military conflict might help him consolidate his position inside the country , " he concluded .
" in such a case , his major aim is to buy time as it is unlikely that anything positive can be achieved as a result of these negotiations . "

deutsche welle spoke with tom kirchmaier of the london school of economics about the decision . eurozone finance ministers met on monday evening to discuss increasing the emergency fund but ultimately decided it was big enough .
is it ?
at the moment it is enough .
but the problem is a different one .
you arrange a fund like this to send a signal to the market that there is no point in speculating against the currency .
so by not increasing the fund , the eurozone finance ministers send a signal that there might actually be a point in speculating against larger countries like spain .
so in that way , they made the markets less stable , not more .
you do n't think markets are convinced yet that the debt crisis is contained ?
the funds are enough to support countries like greece and portugal , they are not enough to support countries like spain , or belgium , or italy .
it 's an arithmetic game , and you come up with a number that 's around one-and-a-half trillion , or two trillion euros and you come up with a guarantee where you can say , this is rock solid .
the number is just so big that it becomes clear to everybody that a speculator ca n't win .
another idea that had been floated prior to monday evening 's meeting , but was then not discussed , was that of bonds issued jointly by the eurozone countries .
is that a good idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the efsf is not big enough for markets to take it seriously " it 's a good idea in principle , but it 's very far-fetched politically .
one of the problems with the eurozone - and it 's a problem from birth - is that monetary policy is done by the european central bank , but fiscal policy is done by each of the member states .
and that creates almost perverse incentives for the individual member states to over-consume , which is what they have done .
one of the ways to solve this problem is to centralize fiscal policy , i.e. to make more fiscal decisions in brussels .
if you launch a euro bond , you essentially do exactly that because you then unify all the risks which you have in the eurozone .
for it to work , you have to have a centralized fiscal policy .
interestingly , china and sovereign wealth funds are very keen for europe to issue these bonds because they would be highly liquid and a good alternative to a us treasury bond .
both the bigger emergency fund and the euro bonds are supposed to convince markets of the " irreversibility " of the euro , as luxemberg 's prime minister jean claude juncker put it .
is the euro in fact " irreversible " or can you imagine a scenario in which this common currency would fold ?
nothing is irreversible .
it would unravel the minute that germany in particular were to make the tiniest suggestion about leaving .
it would be possible to reverse the euro , but it would have catastrophic consequences .
on one hand , you would see a bank run with weaker countries - everybody would try to get their money and put it in a german bank account and that would lead to an immediate collapse of the banking system in that country .
it would be catastrophic for the european idea , for these weak economies , and if germany were to decide to leave , it would not be good for germany either because the currency would appreciate dramatically .
next week at a eu summit , leaders are expected to agree on permanent eurozone rescue mechanisms , since the current emergency fund expires in 2013 .
what could or what should these permanent mechanisms look like ?
the issue of " permanent " only makes sense if the fund is large and credible enough .
at the moment i do n't see that we are getting any closer to making a credible long-term commitment to stability .
the only really credible commitment would be to integrate fiscal policy further .

serge brammertz told the un security council that serbia holds " the key " to their arrest .
he urged the serbian government to adopt a " more proactive approach " that covers all angles .
this would include targeting individuals and networks that support mladic and hadzic and making clear all those who harbor the fugitives will be punished .
" time is passing and we are not seeing results , " said brammertz .
improving the search for the fugitives the un tribunal headquarters in the hague has indicted mladic for genocide in the 1995 massacre of 8,000 muslims in the bosnian town of srebrenica and the 1992-95 siege of sarajevo .
hadzic , who led a serb enclave in croatia , is wanted for his alleged role in the killing of croatian civilians .
both he and mladic are thought to be hiding in serbia .
the european union has made it clear to belgrade that if serbia wishes to join the bloc , it needs to fully cooperate with the un tribunal and bring the two fugitives to justice .
although serbia claims it is committed to arresting the duo , brammertz said it must “ bridge the gap ” between this statement and the " effectiveness of operations on the ground . "
brammertz said the international community also had a role to play in convincing serbia to make a greater effort in arresting mladic and hadzic by providing " positive incentives . "

although the two sides have agreed to meet again , the sticking point is the demand for iran to suspend uranium enrichment . the negotiations between un security council heavyweights the united states , russia , china , france and britain along with germany - the so called 5 + 1 group - with an iranian delegation were the first in 13 months .
the negotiation teams , headed by eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton for the 5 + 1 and iran 's secretary of the national security council saaed jalili , agreed that a further round of talks would take place at the end of january in turkey . however , iran has already made it clear that it will not discuss its uranium enrichment program , which it insists is for peaceful purposes while western powers fear the fuel would be used for nuclear warheads .
at the last meeting in october 2009 , the 5 + 1 agreed to a proposal that would have allowed iran to ship a major portion of the uranium they had enriched to 3.5 percent to an external destination to undergo further enrichment and to be converted into fuel rods for the small tehran research reactor .
that would remove the potential threat of weapons-grade material being siphoned off within iran for military purposes .
iran originally agreed to this proposal but later reneged on it , having scored a major point by having the 5 + 1 tacitly agree to iran engaging in enrichment , a practice forbidden by security council resolutions .
then in may this year , brazil and turkey tried to re-broker the deal but this attempt was scuppered by the united states which claimed higher levels of uranium had been enriched in iran since the original offer in 2009 and that the new export deal would leave too much material behind in iran .
iran 's stance on enrichment levels proving obstructive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's saeed jalili will present a similar stance to that of 2009 " if iran agrees to suspend further enrichment , up to the 17.5 percent which it has already stated it was pressing ahead with , then there are a whole series of economic incentives which are on the table , " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , told deutsche welle .
" if , on the other hand , as ahmadinejad has said , iran does not want to address the issue of enrichment or make any concessions or compromises on that account , there will be no alternative at this stage but the consideration of further punitive sanctions . "
chances of reaching any agreements or compromises seem very bleak at this time , khonsari added , but there are clear signs that because economic and other pressures are making life very difficult for the iranian regime , ahmadinejad may be looking for a way out without losing face .
" for ahmadinejad and his supporters there are two main reasons for an engagement with washington , " professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" first , they know that an understanding with the us would be popular , particularly among the educated youth and the business community .
the second reason is that ahmadinejad and the political leadership feel that the regime is under serious threat by the united states , and only by the united states . "
perthes said iran 's threat perception , and its deep suspicion of us intentions , are often underestimated in washington despite these issues being driving factors in iranian politics .
while the regime elite still appears to be divided over the prospect of a full-scale rapprochement with the united states , it is believed many share this fear of the us and there is a real desire to avoid further isolation .
with this in mind , the 5 + 1 may consider lessened sanctions - along with other incentives - as a way to achieve progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has so far dismissed the western incentives incentives on offer but tehran remains steadfast " the western powers along with russia and china are offering iran lessened sanctions , the chance to fix world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership in return for explanations of what has gone on in regard to tehran 's nuclear program and realistic assurances that it has no military nuclear intentions , " simon henderson , director of the gulf and energy policy program at the washington institute for near east policy , told deutsche welle .
" the best hope for agreement lies on the possibility of reaching an acceptable compromise regarding the shipment of already enriched uranium from iran to an outside destination , " khonsari said .
" if agreement could be reached on the quantity , and there is a minute chance given past turkish and brazilian mediation that this is possible , there may still be a way out though it will be very difficult . "
there were concerns that the geneva negotiations would be made even more problematic by the latest wikileaks revelations which exposed the level of international concern and distrust of iran , especially among its persian gulf neighbors , and the consideration of many that military action is the best option when it comes to stopping tehran 's nuclear program .
however , experts believe there is little new information in the wikileaks revelations and that all the parties involved in the talks with iran are already aware of the delicate nature of relations .
wikileaks revelations unlikely to add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks revelations on iran are unlikely to affect talks " there is nothing in the wikileaks revelations that the islamic authorities have been unaware of , " khonsari said .
" the iranian regime understands that matters will be ratcheted up if they are unable to reach an agreement and they are aware that , irrespective of all factors , the likelihood of military confrontation is a very real possibility . "
khonsari believes the consensus among iran 's opponents , that confronting an ambitious iran with all its downsides might be a cheaper option than living with a nuclear iran - as highlighted in the wikileaks cables - might possibly alter tehran 's previous calculations .
those gambled on the belief that the americans would never dare to embark on another military adventure in the aftermath of the iraq and afghanistan conflicts .
options running out if current talks fail " the 5 + 1 diplomats think that sanctions will eventually work , " said simon henderson .
" however , it 's hard to say what iran will do next in response . iran might calculate that if it tests a bomb , there would be some condemnation but then the world would have to get used to a new status quo , much in the same way as it did after the indian and pakistani tests in 1998 . "
mehrdad khonsari said the general consensus is that ahmadinejad wants to escalate matters and essentially go to the very brink of war in a bid to shore up his own leadership , which has been under pressure since the opposition protests in 2009 .
" it is believed that ahmadinejad feels a military conflict might help him consolidate his position inside the country , " he concluded .
" in such a case , his major aim is to buy time as it is unlikely that anything positive can be achieved as a result of these negotiations . "

the specification supports both smart cards and future versions of smartphones .
mobile devices equipped with near-field communications -lrb- nfc -rrb- chips would enable customers to pay for their journey at a ticket turnstile with a wave of a cell phone .
known as " cipurse , " the standard was developed by a group of leading technology firms , which announced a new partnership , known as the open standard for public transport -lrb- ospt -rrb- alliance .
" for mobile device manufacturers , the open security standard will be the next ‘ must-have ' checklist item they include in all next-generation nfc implementations , " the group said in a statement .
the ospt alliance described its open system as offering an alternative to proprietary technologies , which the group said " limit choices , are potentially less secure and cost more to acquire , deploy and maintain . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chip maker infineon is a member of the ospt alliance collaborators welcome the developers of the open security standard say their alliance is also open to bringing new partners into the fold .
on tuesday , watchdata technologies ltd. and the open ticketing institute of the netherlands joined the group , which already included inside secure , oberthur technologies and giesecke & devrient , as well as german chip maker infineon technologies .
the cipurse system was welcomed by transit industry representatives - among them the fare system director for singapore 's land transport authority .
" cipurse is an important step towards establishing standardized , secure and interoperable fare collection for all public transport schemes , and we plan to adopt it for future releases of -lrb- singapore 's contactless e-purse application -rrb- cepas , " said silvester prakasam , singapore 's fare system director , in the same statement .
the vice president of engineering with cubic transportation systems , inc . , pradip mistry , also described his company as " thrilled " with the group 's new open security standard .
an eye toward security the alliance is now looking to finalize its new specification – which can be used for smart cards and contactless tickets , as well as mobile phones and other media . though smart card technology has been around for years , the companies behind the open standard wanted to take another look at security .
the mifare classic chip , the technology and security standard widely used in today 's smart cards , saw its encryption cracked in recent years . tilo pannenbaecker , infineon technologies ' vice president and general manager of business line personal and object id , told deutsche welle that the new security standard uses the advanced encryption standard -lrb- aes -rrb- 128 , which he called " a more advanced , more modern cryptography . " but the alliance also found fault with the proprietary nature of the mifare technology .
pannenbaecker said the group 's new specification would allow a range of vendors to offer nfc-capable sim cards and phones . " our security standard that we are proposing now is the ideal security concept for nfc because it is offering advanced security , so chances of fraud and counterfeiting are limited , " he said .
" and it is a technology available at fair and reasonable terms . " the future of financial transactions ? google plans to put an nfc-enabled smartphone on the market this month .
at a web 2.0 summit in san francisco this past november , google 's chief executive eric schmidt said the next-generation devices " will be able to do commerce . " the head of research in motion , the company behind the blackberry smartphone , also expressed interest during the summit in incorporating nfc chips into the firm 's product range - and soon . 2011 could be off to a strong start : charles walton , chief operating officer for inside secure , cited estimates of between 40 and 50 million payment-equipped phones hitting the market next year . " now that the industry is moving to nfc phones and guys like google and apple and others are getting on board with nfc , they are looking for some global standards , " he told news agency afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong and japan already have smart card transit payment systems in place winning over consumers still , some analysts suggest taking a step back - and looking beyond the buzz surrounding the " tap and pay " phenomenon when it comes to mobile phones . " it 's a move in the right direction , " said christophe uzureau , research director of banking and investment services at gartner research , " but we tend to forget the big picture . " uzureau told deutsche welle that mobile providers are keen to seize upon the potential of nfc-enabled phones - but the industry is creating " a lot of hype . " consumers in hong kong , with its " octopus card , " and japan , which has " suica , " are accustomed to using prepaid , contactless means for transit .
but replacing cards with phones is easier said than done . " this only works if all consumers have nfc-enabled phones , and if they are confident in using them , " uzureau said .
" and right now , most consumers are not . " that means mobile operators must convince their customers to increase their usage of nfc-enabled phones - and to do so , they must show them that the chips allow for better financial access and control . but companies might have trouble persuading customers to change their habits .
despite what uzureau called a " perfect supply-side arrangement , " in japan , cash-centric consumers there have been slow to latch on . " on the demand side , most customers do n't see the point of nfc-enabled mobile phones , " he said , adding that having a bit more speed at the point of sale still does n't outweigh the benefits of secure cash transactions . " it 's not going to replace the wallet , " uzureau said . author : amanda price -lrb- afp -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us attorney general eric holder promised ' significant action against wikileaks " we are in the process of making arrangements to meet with the police by consent in order to facilitate the taking of that question and answer that is needed , " said mark stephens .

london 's metropolitan police received an arrest warrant earlier on monday , a police source told the news agency reuters .
australian assange , whose wikileaks website has caused an international sensation over the release of secret us diplomatic cables , denies the allegations .

in brussels on tuesday , eu monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn expressed confidence that this money would not be lost .
" i 'm confident that ireland , with its smart , competent , and stubborn people - and its prospects of recovering -lsb- from -rsb- this situation - will overcome the current challenges . "
tough budget while the final stamp of approval for the bailout loan was being given in brussels , the irish government in dublin announced deep cuts in its 2011 budget .
tax hikes and spending cuts are expected to save the country around 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lenihan unveiled a tough budget on tuesday " as outlined in the plan , six billion euros of the overall adjustment is made in today 's budget .
the scale of this adjustment is demanding but it demonstrates the seriousness of our intent , " said finance minister brian lenihan in an address to ireland 's lower house of parliament .
the budget cuts were necessary to secure the bailout from the eu and the international monetary fund .
tapping the reserves ireland 's bailout comes from the 750 billion euro crisis fund established earlier this year after greece required similar aid .
now , the question is still being asked : will ireland be the only country to access the fund , or will portugal , spain or even italy need support soon ?
and if so , will 750 billion euros be enough ?
for spanish finance minister elena salgado , the problem simply does not exist .
“ the volume of the crisis mechanism seems reasonable to us , ” she said .
but from her , these words seem logical ; spain is trying to soothe the markets .
belgian finance minister didier reynders , who chaired the talks , is more cautious , saying debates on the size of the bailout mechanism will likely continue .

it was 2006 and she had escaped north korea two years earlier .
ji , now 28 , and his younger brother and sister had also fled .
they were hiding out in northeast china .
that ’ s when he suddenly got a phone call .
his mother called him from south korea .
she ’ d decided that china , which often forcibly repatriates north koreans , was too dangerous a place for the family to stay in .
that ’ s why she had gone to the south .
ji ’ s mother had arranged for a broker to escort him and his brother to laos and then on to south korea .
but ji says they couldn ’ t find their sister in time to take her with them .
it was only last september that ji and his family finally located her .
" my sister had no idea whether we were back in north korea or in the south , " ji said .
" she found out through a friend in china that we were in seoul .
we contacted her and we paid a human rights organization to help bring her here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , a group of north korean refugees managed to flee to a german school in beijing the ' underground railroad ' the seoul government recently announced that 20,000 defectors from the north have resettled in south korea , about half of those arriving in just the past few years .
most make it to the south with the help of christian missionaries who take north koreans along what ’ s called the underground railroad that runs through china to southeast asia , where it is easier to seek asylum .
many resettled north koreans , like ji ’ s family , are cooperating with missionaries and have their own network of brokers taking refugees out of china , said tim peters , an american missionary whose seoul-based organization assists defectors in reaching south korea .
" virtually every refugee who makes it safely and resettles in south korea has probably made a sworn oath to two to three to four other family members or very close associates in north korea that the resettled one is going to do everything possible to get those other people out . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rally in seoul against the chinese government 's policy on north korean defectors peters added that some defectors even go back to china themselves to bring loved ones to the south .
and refugees are doing whatever they can to raise funds to help their families , said kim seok hyang , a former official at seoul ’ s ministry of unification , the agency that oversees north korean resettlement .
paying human traffickers kim said defectors are using the few thousand dollars they initially receive as a government stipend to pay off human traffickers to bring their loved ones to the south .
but if that money isn ’ t enough , some turn to the sex trade , kim said .
" they want to sacrifice themselves to get that amount of money . from their point of view they need to save their family members and they have no other choice than -lsb- selling -rsb- their body . "
defector ji sang hyun said he doesn ’ t know how much money his mother paid to have him and his brother and sister brought to south korea .
he is glad that his sister finally made it here so the family can live together once again .
but it ’ s not an entirely happy ending .
ji said , " my father at first didn ’ t want to defect , but when he learned that we were all going to south korea he tried to escape north korea too .
but he was caught by border guards and tortured in a prison camp . "
ji learned that his father died just a few days after he was released .

but know-how , often protected by patents , is trickling way too slowly from industrialized nations to poorer regions . every few years , world leaders get together at high-profile conferences to discuss ways to reduce global warming and save the planet . the 2010 united nations climate change conference is currently being held in cancun , mexico .
but the talks are taking place amid low expectations , after the disappointment of the copenhagen summit last year – which memorably failed to produce any binding agreements .
this came as a particular blow to the g77 countries , which have in fact expanded to 131 mostly developing nations .
their demands include a relaxation , if not a general lifting , of patent protection laws governing renewable energies .
their argument is that it is first and foremost the industrialized nations that are responsible for climate change , while the poorer nations pay the price for the wealthier countries ' mistakes .
therefore industrialized nations should at least give them the benefit of their green energy know-how .
sharing their patents would go some way to paying off their climate debts , the g77 countries say .
the patent imbalance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patents get in the way of technology transfer between developed and developing nations according to a new study compiled by the un environment program , 80 percent of all patented innovations in the area of clean energy technologies are registered by companies in japan , germany , us , south korea , britain and france .
the report , which examines the role of patents in combating climate change , was jointly conducted with the european patent office and the international centre for trade and sustainable development .
" the fact that northern countries keep their expertise on regenerative energies to themselves , puts the south at an additional disadvantage , " says aileen kwa from south center , an intergovernmental policy think tank of developing countries .
as a climate-friendly , affordable alternative to fossil fuels , clean energy is key to the future of the developing world , and allows people to access energy supplies without having to rely on major providers .
moreover , it decentralizes the energy supply .
in countries where the majority of the population is rural , solar panels and geothermal heat pumps installed in individual homes are energy efficient solutions for people who would otherwise go without .
one problem , however , is the frequent lack of local expertise necessary not only to install the technology , but also to maintain it .
not only does the equipment therefore need to be imported – the know-how does to .
if patents are a factor , the whole process soon becomes very costly .
but it 's not only developing nations that have some catching-up to do on the clean energy front .
green technology is still very much in its infancy in croatia , for example , although grassroots projects are slowly beginning to gather momentum .
even in industrialized countries , it seems , introduction of climate protection measures comes with a high price tag . popular misconceptions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in cancun , debate is centering around mobilizing funds and technology transfer to cope with climate change one obstacle to globalized climate control is the general ignorance in the developed world of what exactly the developing world needs .
" indigenous knowledge on protecting natural resources and alternative energy supplies often exists , " points out kwa , stressing that all that 's then needed is a transfer of technology that can be implemented locally .
rainer osterwalder from the european patent office agrees , but says there 's plenty of room for improvement .
" the technology transfer from north to south is still unsatisfactory , " he says .
" one thing that should n't be forgotten is that emerging economies , and china in particular , are increasingly active when it comes to domestic innovation in the area of regenerative energy . "
" patents neither create problems nor solve them , " he says .
in his opinion , more urgent problems include inadequate infrastructure in the developing world ; the lack of an existing market for clean technologies and the lack of opportunity to build one .
adding to the problem is the popular misconception that patents are internationally valid .
in fact , if a patent is n't registered with the patent office of a specific country , then it does n't exist .
" a french company does n't necessarily register the patent for its photovoltaic technology in angola , say , if it believes that there 's no market for such a system in that country , " explains osterwalder .
in developing countries , however , few people are aware that many technologies are not actually patented in their country .
a spanner in the works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes , local expertise is underestimated critics believe that ultimately , patent protection is a major stumbling block in fighting climate change .
in recent years , the european patent office has complained about the ‘ global patent warming , ' stressing that the increasing number of patent applications is slowing down the issue of patents .
the multitude of patent applications does not mean that the world is coming up with more innovations - rather , what is happening is that inventors and companies that already hold patents in one country are lining up at many other national patent offices to get patents for other markets .
ultimately , the purpose of securing a patent is to throw a spanner in the works of rival development .
the patents issue is one that results in the developing world feeling as though it has been left to deal with climate change by itself , by the very countries that are mainly responsible for it .
but industrialized nations retaliate by citing the free market and the necessary protection of intellectual property – and , needless to say , their own economic superiority . whether or not it is justifiable to privatize expertise in the field of regenerative energy is a question that will no doubt be raised at the current summit in cancun .

now , a jewish museum is being built near the site . the construction of warsaw 's jewish museum is currently the most extensive cultural project in poland , though few in neighboring germany even know about it . the museum is being built in what was the warsaw ghetto during the period of nazi occupation .
nearby is the memorial to the victims of the warsaw ghetto uprising , in front of which former german chancellor willy brandt spontaneously knelt 40 years ago , on december 7 , 1970 .
it was an unprecedented act of humility that would become a milestone in polish-german ties . moral obligation to support museum plans for the jewish museum began in 1994 when then german president roman herzog got behind the project and oversaw the launch of a development foundation to fund it .
though the idea for the museum initially came from poland , the country lacked the necessary resources at that time . " roman herzog suddenly endorsed he idea , " said josef thesing , chairman of the development foundation .
" our foundation was started in order to make the idea a reality .
if we had n't managed to secure funding from the beginning , it never would have happened . " so far , the foundation has managed to acquire some 6 million euros -lrb- about $ 8 million -rrb- for the museum project ; by its completion in 2013 , costs are expected to total 90 million euros . thesing added that germany had a moral responsibility to invest in the warsaw museum . " i think that we can demonstrate that there is a different germany now , " he said .
" and , together with poles - who are now our friends in the european community - we can work through our past instead of denying it and look , with our unique perspective , toward a common future . " bildunterschrift : chancellor willy brandt 's humble gesture at the memorial to the victims of the warsaw uprising in 1970 was unplanned , but went down in history rich jewish tradition in poland the path to the future leads first through the past .
few poles are aware that the first known reference to their country was made in hebrew .
poland 's jewish roots go back a thousand years , according to auschwitz survivor marian turski . " we have no jews in poland - almost no jews .
the jews are present in history , they 're present in literature but there 's a vacuum in society , hence , the interest in those topics , " said turski .
" this is why we estimate that this will be one of the most-visited museums in poland . " it was marian turski who conceived the idea for the museum in the early 1990s .
he chairs poland 's jewish historical institute and is now chairman of the jewish museum as well . for turski , there was only one possible location for the museum : the site of the warsaw ghetto and willy brandt 's 1970 gesture of reconciliation . " for a long time , as the chairman of the jewish historical institute , i was the owner of this land , " said turski .
" it was obvious to everybody that there was no better and no more appropriate place than this to build the museum . " bildunterschrift : jewish life is slowly returning to warsaw turning point in understanding history it was n't until a year and a half ago that construction finally began , under the auspices of museum director jerzy halbersztadt .
he said its completion , planned for 2013 , would be a new landmark in the often difficult relationship between germany and poland . " the construction of this museum is a very important turning point , " he said .
" it can not transform the whole country , but it will be a sign of the changes that took place in the last 20 years of democratic development . " the museum wo n't focus solely on the holocaust , but will span from the very beginning of poland 's jewish roots to the present day . that includes the kielce pogrom of 1946 , when townspeople and officials in the polish town turned against the jewish community , killing around 40 people .
the anti-semitic sentiment that sprung up in the late 1960s is also to be addressed , as is the gradual return of judaism in post-communist poland . " our mission is to reach those who do n't understand what it means in the contemporary world to have an open dialogue , revisit history , tell the truth about history whether it 's nice or not , " said halbersztadt .
" those who are not convinced today will be convinced tomorrow , i believe that . " the museum director is expecting some half a million visitors per year to come and contribute to a new understanding of history in the country . author : wolfram stahl -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

assange , wanted on allegations including rape , says foreign powers are leaning upon the swedes . a lawyer for wikileaks founder julian assange said on monday that his client was arranging to meet with british police , who have received a request from sweden for his extradition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us attorney general eric holder promised ' significant action against wikileaks " we are in the process of making arrangements to meet with the police by consent in order to facilitate the taking of that question and answer that is needed , " said mark stephens .
the lawyer added that the interview was expected to happen in the " foreseeable future " but could not give an exact timescale .
the 39-year-old is wanted on allegations of rape , sexual molestation and unlawful coercion .
london 's metropolitan police received an arrest warrant earlier on monday , a police source told the news agency reuters .
australian assange , whose wikileaks website has caused an international sensation over the release of secret us diplomatic cables , denies the allegations .
the extradition request came after swedish prosecutors reopened an investigation into the allegations , being made by two swedish women .
assange 's swedish lawyer said his client believed sweden was being influenced by foreign powers after the november release of the cables , some of which are politically sensitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the latest cable revelations are politically sensitive authorities in sweden said they had provided their british colleagues with all the information they had requested , following apparent legal hitches .
significant prosecution authorized us attorney general eric holder said that " significant " action was being authorized by the government in washington for putting the country 's national security at risk .
swiss authorities on monday shut down a bank account held by assange with the swiss post office 's banking group , claiming he had provided false information .
in france , industry minister eric besson demanded that wikileaks be banned from french web servers being used by the site .
however , a french judge declined to force web provider ovh to go ahead with the closure .
in october , wikileaks angered the pentagon over its release of nearly 400,000 classified documents on the iraq war , which assange said showed 15,000 more civilian deaths than previously thought . in july , the site posted some 77,000 secret us files on the conflict in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 07.12.2010 concern over politicization of top donor governments ’ aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philip tamminga an international organization , which evaluates the effectiveness of donor governments ’ aid for people suffering from conflicts , disasters and climate change , has released its 2010 humanitarian response index . the dara index -lrb- hri -rrb- assesses responses to crises by the world 's top donor governments – members of the disaster action committee of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
now in its fourth year , the hri examines performance under five “ pillars ” of donor practice : response to needs ; prevention , risk reduction and recovery ; working with partners ; protection and international humanitarian law ; and learning and accountability .
denmark tops the hri ranking list followed by ireland , new zealand , norway , and sweden , while the european commission comes in sixth .
the head of the hri team , philip tamminga , talked with deutsche welle about the latest index and how political priorities have impeded the delivery of humanitarian aid to millions .
deutsche welle : germany does n't appear to have done too well in your assessment .
why is that ?
philip tamminga : germany is ranked 14th -lsb- out of 20 -rsb- in the index this year , just after canada and australia , but before japan and france . germany spends a lot less on humanitarian assistance than other countries , and the percentage of its aid dedicated to humanitarian crises is about half of the average of other donors . so it lags somewhat behind other countries .
other factors that explain germany 's position in the ranking is that it has too many restrictive conditions on its aid funding .
this sometimes makes it difficult for the humanitarian organizations it funds to have enough flexibility to direct aid where it is needed or to adapt programmes if the situation changes on the ground - which happens quite often in a disaster or conflict .
germany could also do better at funding un and red cross appeals , and make better use of regular evaluations to improve the quality and effectiveness of the assistance it provides .
germany does have many strengths , though .
for instance , it tends to provide funding rapidly in cases of disasters , and it 's a strong supporter of ngos .
it is also one of the better donor governments in terms of its commitment towards accountability to people affected by crises - making sure aid is effective and responds to their needs . could you explain briefly how exactly the assessment is done – what are the key tools and methodology employed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid is much-needed in many corners of the globe we assess donors by looking at 35 different indicators of how well they support humanitarian action and apply good practices .
the indicators are based on the core concepts contained in the declaration of good humanitarian donorship , which was developed and signed by the world 's main donor governments - including germany - in 2003 .
what we want to see is if governments are respecting the commitments they made , so we send teams to different humanitarian crises and we talk to the different humanitarian organizations about how well the governments that fund their work are applying good practice .
we combine this with publicly available information from published sources on government aid funding , respect of international humanitarian law , and other elements of good donor practice .
this year , our teams visited 14 humanitarian crises areas like haiti , afghanistan , somalia , sudan and pakistan , and we spoke to over 500 senior officials working in these crises from the united nations , the red cross and the red crescent , ngos , donor governments and others .
we also collected nearly 2,000 survey responses .
this gives us a good basis to measure and compare donor governments each year on whether their policies and practices facilitate or impede an effective response to crises .
the report says that there 's ample evidence of politicization of aid .
exactly what evidence do you have to show that political interests have overtaken the commitment to good humanitarian donorship ?
in 10 of the 14 crises we visited , we saw and heard of evidence that donor governments were placing political interests above humanitarian objectives . in some cases , like afghanistan , the use of western military forces to provide humanitarian assistance is compromising the neutrality , impartiality and independence of humanitarian organizations , and putting humanitarian workers and civilians at risk .
we also saw in some places like somalia , the occupied palestinian territories or yemen , some donor governments are putting restrictions on humanitarian organizations that prevents them from working in areas controlled by certain groups like hamas , as part of the " war on terror . "
this means the people in need are not getting the aid they deserve .
in other crises , there are debates about how foreign aid can help win " hearts and minds " or achieve other foreign policy objectives .
one of the most basic humanitarian principles – which donor governments committed themselves to when they signed the good donorship declaration – is that humanitarian assistance should be given without discrimination , and based on needs alone – and not because it may or may not help a government achieve other objectives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastation left behind by the 2005 tsunami the hri report claims that there are gaps in the protection of civilians and that the lack of safe humanitarian access has put vulnerable groups at risk of harm .
basically , this refers to the promotion of international humanitarian law and goes beyond programming issues – is the report referring to diplomacy efforts in this direction ? yes , the report is clear that as a result of politicization , safe access by humanitarian organizations to people affected by crisis is being compromised . because of that , humanitarian workers are at risk , and civilian populations are not getting the protection and assistance they need .
a recent example of this lack of protection was seen in the mass rapes that took place in the democratic republic of the congo .
and the safety of humanitarian workers is also at stake : last year over 260 humanitarians were killed , kidnapped or injured while trying to carry out their work .
you have also accused donors of failing to improve transparency and accountability towards affected people .
which countries have fared well under this pillar and which poorly ?
donor governments are not doing enough to promote better accountability towards people affected by disasters and crises .
there are lots of requirements on humanitarian organizations to report on how they have spent the money they get , and what kind of results , but very few donor governments have in place requirements to monitor and ensure that aid money is being used to meet the needs and priorities of the actual people affected by the crisis .
most professional humanitarian organizations already do this to some extent , but donor governments are not monitoring and following up adequately , and supporting these efforts . another concern is that donor governments are not being transparent or accountable on the aid that they promise . for example , many governments have still not disbursed all the funds that they promised after the earthquake in haiti .
and while the promises are made in the media or in international conferences , most of the time , the people affected do n't receive any information about this , and do n't have any way to participate directly on how that aid will be prioritized or spent .
this is why we call on governments to improve their transparency and accountability . germany tends to do better than other donors in this area , and could perhaps take the lead in building more commitment amongst donor governments .
what 's been donor governments ' response to this ranking system – surely some are n't happy with the whole exercise ?
some governments have told us that they think a ranking system is counterproductive , and does n't encourage or motivate donor governments to do better .
but in fact , some of the lowest ranked donors have told us they appreciate having a tool like the humanitarian response index to benchmark their performance and to know where they stand compared to their peers . the ranking is only a minor part of the exercise , though .
we collect a lot of valuable information about how donors are performing , and we have always offered this information to governments , donor agencies and other stakeholders to use it to understand where a government may need to improve , and where they are doing well .
by visiting 14 crises areas – the biggest evaluation exercise of its kind in the humanitarian sector – we are able to identify trends that affect the quality and impact of aid .
so we have lots of valuable analysis to share with the international community , such as our increasing concerns about politicization of aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food for those who need it most you must have confronted questions relating to legitimacy , though – what gives dara the authority to rank donor performance ?
first of all , dara has a great multi-disciplinary team with extensive experience in the field of evaluating humanitarian action . we were part of the huge tsunami joint evaluation exercise on how the entire humanitarian system responded .
dara looked specifically at the area of donor funding , which gave us insights on how they took decisions , and why good practice was so difficult for them to apply .
that was the basis for us creating the humanitarian response index – to systematically measure donor practice and provide solid , empirical evidence on where donor governments need to improve further . since then , we have carried out hri evaluations in over 35 crises , along with our extensive evaluation experience in other areas .
we also felt it was absolutely critical for an independent , objective evaluation of donor governments .
until the hri was created , there was no way to monitor if donor governments were complying with their commitments .
most of the tools and processes used by donors to assess their own performance are not transparent enough , and do n't look at issues around the quality of their aid , or the relationship with the humanitarian organizations they fund .
we think the hri can be used to stimulate changes and improvements .
has the hri , since its inception in 2007 , had a measurable impact on donors ?
if so , could you give some examples ?
yes .
the index has helped to raise many issues and concerns facing the humanitarian sector in general , and several donor governments have now taken this up as an issue for discussion at the international level .
for example , our findings in the 2008 report called for improvements in the way that humanitarian needs are identified so that aid could be distributed more effectively and fairly .
now , many governments are working with humanitarian organizations to address this gap .
some governments have used our findings as part of their overall evaluation of their aid programs and policies .
and dara has also begun working with some donor governments to provide a more detailed assessment on how they are doing , with recommendations on where to change and improve . next year we hope to carry out an evaluation of the impact of the hri after its first five years , where we can show how and where it has had an influence .
in the meantime , we will continue to offer our support and analysis to governments and other stakeholders who are interested in making sure that aid efforts help people affected by crisis .

although the two sides have agreed to meet again , the sticking point is the demand for iran to suspend uranium enrichment . the negotiations between un security council heavyweights the united states , russia , china , france and britain along with germany - the so called 5 + 1 group - with an iranian delegation were the first in 13 months .
the negotiation teams , headed by eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton for the 5 + 1 and iran 's secretary of the national security council saaed jalili , agreed that a further round of talks would take place at the end of january in turkey . however , iran has already made it clear that it will not discuss its uranium enrichment program , which it insists is for peaceful purposes while western powers fear the fuel would be used for nuclear warheads .
at the last meeting in october 2009 , the 5 + 1 agreed to a proposal that would have allowed iran to ship a major portion of the uranium they had enriched to 3.5 percent to an external destination to undergo further enrichment and to be converted into fuel rods for the small tehran research reactor .
that would remove the potential threat of weapons-grade material being siphoned off within iran for military purposes .
iran originally agreed to this proposal but later reneged on it , having scored a major point by having the 5 + 1 tacitly agree to iran engaging in enrichment , a practice forbidden by security council resolutions .
then in may this year , brazil and turkey tried to re-broker the deal but this attempt was scuppered by the united states which claimed higher levels of uranium had been enriched in iran since the original offer in 2009 and that the new export deal would leave too much material behind in iran .
iran 's stance on enrichment levels proving obstructive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's saeed jalili will present a similar stance to that of 2009 " if iran agrees to suspend further enrichment , up to the 17.5 percent which it has already stated it was pressing ahead with , then there are a whole series of economic incentives which are on the table , " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , told deutsche welle .
" if , on the other hand , as ahmadinejad has said , iran does not want to address the issue of enrichment or make any concessions or compromises on that account , there will be no alternative at this stage but the consideration of further punitive sanctions . "
chances of reaching any agreements or compromises seem very bleak at this time , khonsari added , but there are clear signs that because economic and other pressures are making life very difficult for the iranian regime , ahmadinejad may be looking for a way out without losing face .
" for ahmadinejad and his supporters there are two main reasons for an engagement with washington , " professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" first , they know that an understanding with the us would be popular , particularly among the educated youth and the business community .
the second reason is that ahmadinejad and the political leadership feel that the regime is under serious threat by the united states , and only by the united states . "
perthes said iran 's threat perception , and its deep suspicion of us intentions , are often underestimated in washington despite these issues being driving factors in iranian politics .
while the regime elite still appears to be divided over the prospect of a full-scale rapprochement with the united states , it is believed many share this fear of the us and there is a real desire to avoid further isolation .
with this in mind , the 5 + 1 may consider lessened sanctions - along with other incentives - as a way to achieve progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has so far dismissed the western incentives incentives on offer but tehran remains steadfast " the western powers along with russia and china are offering iran lessened sanctions , the chance to fix world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership in return for explanations of what has gone on in regard to tehran 's nuclear program and realistic assurances that it has no military nuclear intentions , " simon henderson , director of the gulf and energy policy program at the washington institute for near east policy , told deutsche welle .
" the best hope for agreement lies on the possibility of reaching an acceptable compromise regarding the shipment of already enriched uranium from iran to an outside destination , " khonsari said .
" if agreement could be reached on the quantity , and there is a minute chance given past turkish and brazilian mediation that this is possible , there may still be a way out though it will be very difficult . "
there were concerns that the geneva negotiations would be made even more problematic by the latest wikileaks revelations which exposed the level of international concern and distrust of iran , especially among its persian gulf neighbors , and the consideration of many that military action is the best option when it comes to stopping tehran 's nuclear program .
however , experts believe there is little new information in the wikileaks revelations and that all the parties involved in the talks with iran are already aware of the delicate nature of relations .
wikileaks revelations unlikely to add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks revelations on iran are unlikely to affect talks " there is nothing in the wikileaks revelations that the islamic authorities have been unaware of , " khonsari said .
" the iranian regime understands that matters will be ratcheted up if they are unable to reach an agreement and they are aware that , irrespective of all factors , the likelihood of military confrontation is a very real possibility . "
khonsari believes the consensus among iran 's opponents , that confronting an ambitious iran with all its downsides might be a cheaper option than living with a nuclear iran - as highlighted in the wikileaks cables - might possibly alter tehran 's previous calculations .
those gambled on the belief that the americans would never dare to embark on another military adventure in the aftermath of the iraq and afghanistan conflicts .
options running out if current talks fail " the 5 + 1 diplomats think that sanctions will eventually work , " said simon henderson .
" however , it 's hard to say what iran will do next in response . iran might calculate that if it tests a bomb , there would be some condemnation but then the world would have to get used to a new status quo , much in the same way as it did after the indian and pakistani tests in 1998 . "
mehrdad khonsari said the general consensus is that ahmadinejad wants to escalate matters and essentially go to the very brink of war in a bid to shore up his own leadership , which has been under pressure since the opposition protests in 2009 .
" it is believed that ahmadinejad feels a military conflict might help him consolidate his position inside the country , " he concluded .
" in such a case , his major aim is to buy time as it is unlikely that anything positive can be achieved as a result of these negotiations . "

although the two sides have agreed to meet again , the sticking point is the demand for iran to suspend uranium enrichment . the negotiations between un security council heavyweights the united states , russia , china , france and britain along with germany - the so called 5 + 1 group - with an iranian delegation were the first in 13 months .
the negotiation teams , headed by eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton for the 5 + 1 and iran 's secretary of the national security council saaed jalili , agreed that a further round of talks would take place at the end of january in turkey . however , iran has already made it clear that it will not discuss its uranium enrichment program , which it insists is for peaceful purposes while western powers fear the fuel would be used for nuclear warheads .
at the last meeting in october 2009 , the 5 + 1 agreed to a proposal that would have allowed iran to ship a major portion of the uranium they had enriched to 3.5 percent to an external destination to undergo further enrichment and to be converted into fuel rods for the small tehran research reactor .
that would remove the potential threat of weapons-grade material being siphoned off within iran for military purposes .
iran originally agreed to this proposal but later reneged on it , having scored a major point by having the 5 + 1 tacitly agree to iran engaging in enrichment , a practice forbidden by security council resolutions .
then in may this year , brazil and turkey tried to re-broker the deal but this attempt was scuppered by the united states which claimed higher levels of uranium had been enriched in iran since the original offer in 2009 and that the new export deal would leave too much material behind in iran .
iran 's stance on enrichment levels proving obstructive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's saeed jalili will present a similar stance to that of 2009 " if iran agrees to suspend further enrichment , up to the 17.5 percent which it has already stated it was pressing ahead with , then there are a whole series of economic incentives which are on the table , " mehrdad khonsari , senior research consultant at the center for arab & iranian studies in london , told deutsche welle .
" if , on the other hand , as ahmadinejad has said , iran does not want to address the issue of enrichment or make any concessions or compromises on that account , there will be no alternative at this stage but the consideration of further punitive sanctions . "
chances of reaching any agreements or compromises seem very bleak at this time , khonsari added , but there are clear signs that because economic and other pressures are making life very difficult for the iranian regime , ahmadinejad may be looking for a way out without losing face .
" for ahmadinejad and his supporters there are two main reasons for an engagement with washington , " professor volker perthes , director of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" first , they know that an understanding with the us would be popular , particularly among the educated youth and the business community .
the second reason is that ahmadinejad and the political leadership feel that the regime is under serious threat by the united states , and only by the united states . "
perthes said iran 's threat perception , and its deep suspicion of us intentions , are often underestimated in washington despite these issues being driving factors in iranian politics .
while the regime elite still appears to be divided over the prospect of a full-scale rapprochement with the united states , it is believed many share this fear of the us and there is a real desire to avoid further isolation .
with this in mind , the 5 + 1 may consider lessened sanctions - along with other incentives - as a way to achieve progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has so far dismissed the western incentives incentives on offer but tehran remains steadfast " the western powers along with russia and china are offering iran lessened sanctions , the chance to fix world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- membership in return for explanations of what has gone on in regard to tehran 's nuclear program and realistic assurances that it has no military nuclear intentions , " simon henderson , director of the gulf and energy policy program at the washington institute for near east policy , told deutsche welle .
" the best hope for agreement lies on the possibility of reaching an acceptable compromise regarding the shipment of already enriched uranium from iran to an outside destination , " khonsari said .
" if agreement could be reached on the quantity , and there is a minute chance given past turkish and brazilian mediation that this is possible , there may still be a way out though it will be very difficult . "
there were concerns that the geneva negotiations would be made even more problematic by the latest wikileaks revelations which exposed the level of international concern and distrust of iran , especially among its persian gulf neighbors , and the consideration of many that military action is the best option when it comes to stopping tehran 's nuclear program .
however , experts believe there is little new information in the wikileaks revelations and that all the parties involved in the talks with iran are already aware of the delicate nature of relations .
wikileaks revelations unlikely to add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks revelations on iran are unlikely to affect talks " there is nothing in the wikileaks revelations that the islamic authorities have been unaware of , " khonsari said .
" the iranian regime understands that matters will be ratcheted up if they are unable to reach an agreement and they are aware that , irrespective of all factors , the likelihood of military confrontation is a very real possibility . "
khonsari believes the consensus among iran 's opponents , that confronting an ambitious iran with all its downsides might be a cheaper option than living with a nuclear iran - as highlighted in the wikileaks cables - might possibly alter tehran 's previous calculations .
those gambled on the belief that the americans would never dare to embark on another military adventure in the aftermath of the iraq and afghanistan conflicts .
options running out if current talks fail " the 5 + 1 diplomats think that sanctions will eventually work , " said simon henderson .
" however , it 's hard to say what iran will do next in response . iran might calculate that if it tests a bomb , there would be some condemnation but then the world would have to get used to a new status quo , much in the same way as it did after the indian and pakistani tests in 1998 . "
mehrdad khonsari said the general consensus is that ahmadinejad wants to escalate matters and essentially go to the very brink of war in a bid to shore up his own leadership , which has been under pressure since the opposition protests in 2009 .
" it is believed that ahmadinejad feels a military conflict might help him consolidate his position inside the country , " he concluded .
" in such a case , his major aim is to buy time as it is unlikely that anything positive can be achieved as a result of these negotiations . "
