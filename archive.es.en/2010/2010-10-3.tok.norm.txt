in a frantic closing phase , cacau thought he had equalized , but the goal was disallowed , while frankfurt 's halil alintop shot wide in front of an open goal .
the match is stuttgart 's sixth loss from seven games .
equal chances in sunday 's other game , leverkusen and bremen drew 2-2 at the bay arena .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.10.2010 opinion : wulff makes integration centerpiece of unity day speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff stressed islam now has a role in modern germany german president christian wulff has vowed to focus on the hot button issue of integration of immigrants .
and the president made good on that pledge in his speech marking german unity day , dw 's volker wagener says . by using his unity day speech to focus on integration , christian wulff has kept his word .
in the 30 minutes of his speech , more was said about integration and migration than about the topic of german reunification today .
nobody expected wulff to talk about the subject today but it was an important focus . for weeks , the topic has been raging in germany , with a polemical war of words over the issue of those who do not integrate into german life .
it 's claimed that these people live here but do not learn the language or recognize the constitution , and depend on state handouts . wulff adressed the problems but did n't go into detail about the extreme positions in the failed integration policies in germany . learning german is compulsory for all immigrants and german law applies to everyone .
' islam also belongs in germany ' wulff 's arguments about islam were much more far-reaching . christianity and judaism have been part of germany 's past and present said wulff .
" but now islam also belongs in germany , " he added .
no german politician has ever said that so clearly and openly .
but the president basically criticized romantic " multicultural " notions of society , saying they had created illusions rather than solving problems .
it 's a slap in the face , especially for those on the political left . germany , wulff said , has long been a country of immigration .
it 's a message however that still has n't reached everyone in germany 's middle-class , conservative circles .
it will be interesting to see whether and how quickly the excerpts of the president 's speech containing practical suggestions will become political reality .
for instance , offering german classes for the entire family . after all , what 's the use if ali speaks german at school in the mornings and turkish at home in the afternoons because his mother only speaks that one language .
or another suggestion involves islam lessons in german schools .
wulff wants those classes to be held in german by german teachers .
wulff managed to skillfully link the day 's issue - german unity - with that of integration , the topic he 's focusing on during his term in office .
he used the motto of the east germans from 1989 : " we are one people " and expanded the slogan .
the meaning must include all people who live in germany today , he said .
the basic law , the german constitution , leaves the president with little room for political power .
but he can harness the power of words , though not frequently . the president 's role includes being a moral authority and influencing the intellectual climate of the country .
that 's why the first big speech by christian wulff was all the more important .
the day of german unity - above all the 20th anniversary - was a guarantee for him and his message to attract the highest possible attention and probably have the deepest impact .
in view of the fierce debate on integration , wulff used the opportunity to help determine the future political direction .

britain too warned of a " high " terror threat in france and germany . the us state department has issued an alert , warning citizens " to the potential for terrorist attacks in europe . "
the department did not specify a country , issuing the updated guidance for the whole of europe .
the alert , published on the state department 's website , said that " current information suggests " al-qaeda and affiliated groups were continuing to plan commando-style attacks , similar to the 2008 atrocities in mumbai .
separately , the british foreign ministry on sunday updated its advice for citizens traveling to france and germany , warning there was a " high threat " of terrorism in the two european countries .
public spaces could be potential targets american citizens have been warned that public places could be potential targets and that they should " take every precaution to be aware of surroundings . "
potential targets could be railways and subways and other tourist places , according to the us state department .
" terrorists have targeted and attacked subway and rail systems , as well as aviation and maritime services , " the alert said .
it comes as media in the past week reported that intelligence agencies in germany , france , the uk and the us foiled an attempted strike on a series of european cities .
as a result the uk has also updated its travel advice for france and germany , warning there was a " high threat " of terrorism .
british home secretary theresa may said on sunday the us advice was " consistent " with london 's own assessment of the threat .
" as we have consistently made clear , we face a real and serious threat from terrorism , " she said .
" we work closely with our international partners in countering terrorism and the us advice is consistent with our assessment , " she said .
the alert – which the state department issues regarding specific events – is one step down from a travel warning .
a total of 31 travel warnings are in effect for various countries including afghanistan , iraq , israel , sudan and somalia .

and the president made good on that pledge in his speech marking german unity day , dw 's volker wagener says . by using his unity day speech to focus on integration , christian wulff has kept his word .
in the 30 minutes of his speech , more was said about integration and migration than about the topic of german reunification today .
nobody expected wulff to talk about the subject today but it was an important focus . for weeks , the topic has been raging in germany , with a polemical war of words over the issue of those who do not integrate into german life .
it 's claimed that these people live here but do not learn the language or recognize the constitution , and depend on state handouts . wulff adressed the problems but did n't go into detail about the extreme positions in the failed integration policies in germany . learning german is compulsory for all immigrants and german law applies to everyone .
' islam also belongs in germany ' wulff 's arguments about islam were much more far-reaching . christianity and judaism have been part of germany 's past and present said wulff .
" but now islam also belongs in germany , " he added .
no german politician has ever said that so clearly and openly .
but the president basically criticized romantic " multicultural " notions of society , saying they had created illusions rather than solving problems .
it 's a slap in the face , especially for those on the political left . germany , wulff said , has long been a country of immigration .
it 's a message however that still has n't reached everyone in germany 's middle-class , conservative circles .
it will be interesting to see whether and how quickly the excerpts of the president 's speech containing practical suggestions will become political reality .
for instance , offering german classes for the entire family . after all , what 's the use if ali speaks german at school in the mornings and turkish at home in the afternoons because his mother only speaks that one language .
or another suggestion involves islam lessons in german schools .
wulff wants those classes to be held in german by german teachers .
wulff managed to skillfully link the day 's issue - german unity - with that of integration , the topic he 's focusing on during his term in office .
he used the motto of the east germans from 1989 : " we are one people " and expanded the slogan .
the meaning must include all people who live in germany today , he said .
the basic law , the german constitution , leaves the president with little room for political power .
but he can harness the power of words , though not frequently . the president 's role includes being a moral authority and influencing the intellectual climate of the country .
that 's why the first big speech by christian wulff was all the more important .
the day of german unity - above all the 20th anniversary - was a guarantee for him and his message to attract the highest possible attention and probably have the deepest impact .
in view of the fierce debate on integration , wulff used the opportunity to help determine the future political direction .

but another tradition has been going on since 1997 on the same day in germany 's mosques : a nation-wide open house . since 1990 , october 3 has been a holiday in germany to mark the reunification of the country .
but there is another tradition that falls on october 3 : it 's also the day of a nation-wide open house at germany 's mosques .
the first mosque open house took place in 1997 , and this year , the motto is ' the quran - 1400 years , topical and part of everyday life . ' the purpose is to celebrate the revelation of the quran to the prophet muhammad 1400 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year 's open house celebrates the revelation of the quran on the day of the open house , germans - muslims and non muslims alike - are invited to visit mosques and islamic cultural centers around the country .
all told , over 500 sites will open their doors .
according to the turkish-islamic union institute for religion -lrb- ditib -rrb- , at least 5,000 people took the opportunity to visit berlin 's mosques on sunday .
" we muslims with our values are part of this country , " said ditib dialogue organiser rafet ozturk . the first german mosque although the mosque open house has only been taking place since 1997 , the history of mosques in germany goes back much further .
according to the website of the muslim coordination council krm , germany 's first mosque was built in 1739 by the prussian king friedrich wilhelm i. he built it for some of his muslim soldiers so they would have a place to pray , just like their christian comrades in arms had at the soldiers ' church in potsdam .
today , there are over 2,000 mosques in germany .

britain too warned of a " high " terror threat in france and germany . the us state department has issued an alert , warning citizens " to the potential for terrorist attacks in europe . "
the department did not specify a country , issuing the updated guidance for the whole of europe .
the alert , published on the state department 's website , said that " current information suggests " al-qaeda and affiliated groups were continuing to plan commando-style attacks , similar to the 2008 atrocities in mumbai .
separately , the british foreign ministry on sunday updated its advice for citizens traveling to france and germany , warning there was a " high threat " of terrorism in the two european countries .
public spaces could be potential targets american citizens have been warned that public places could be potential targets and that they should " take every precaution to be aware of surroundings . "
potential targets could be railways and subways and other tourist places , according to the us state department .
" terrorists have targeted and attacked subway and rail systems , as well as aviation and maritime services , " the alert said .
it comes as media in the past week reported that intelligence agencies in germany , france , the uk and the us foiled an attempted strike on a series of european cities .
as a result the uk has also updated its travel advice for france and germany , warning there was a " high threat " of terrorism .
british home secretary theresa may said on sunday the us advice was " consistent " with london 's own assessment of the threat .
" as we have consistently made clear , we face a real and serious threat from terrorism , " she said .
" we work closely with our international partners in countering terrorism and the us advice is consistent with our assessment , " she said .
the alert – which the state department issues regarding specific events – is one step down from a travel warning .
a total of 31 travel warnings are in effect for various countries including afghanistan , iraq , israel , sudan and somalia .

drama came just six minutes from time , as stuttgart captain matthieu delpierre was shown a red card for a late tackle on patrick ochs .
yet a 10-man stuttgart gave their home fans some late hope with a close-range goal from pavel pogrebniak in the 85th minute .
in a frantic closing phase , cacau thought he had equalized , but the goal was disallowed , while frankfurt 's halil alintop shot wide in front of an open goal .
the match is stuttgart 's sixth loss from seven games .
equal chances in sunday 's other game , leverkusen and bremen drew 2-2 at the bay arena .
patrick helmes gave leverkusen the lead after 16 minutes .

taking a point each , leverkusen take 4th in the league table , while bremen are 13th .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.10.2010 opinion : wulff makes integration centerpiece of unity day speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff stressed islam now has a role in modern germany german president christian wulff has vowed to focus on the hot button issue of integration of immigrants .
and the president made good on that pledge in his speech marking german unity day , dw 's volker wagener says . by using his unity day speech to focus on integration , christian wulff has kept his word .
in the 30 minutes of his speech , more was said about integration and migration than about the topic of german reunification today .
nobody expected wulff to talk about the subject today but it was an important focus . for weeks , the topic has been raging in germany , with a polemical war of words over the issue of those who do not integrate into german life .
it 's claimed that these people live here but do not learn the language or recognize the constitution , and depend on state handouts . wulff adressed the problems but did n't go into detail about the extreme positions in the failed integration policies in germany . learning german is compulsory for all immigrants and german law applies to everyone .
' islam also belongs in germany ' wulff 's arguments about islam were much more far-reaching . christianity and judaism have been part of germany 's past and present said wulff .
" but now islam also belongs in germany , " he added .
no german politician has ever said that so clearly and openly .
but the president basically criticized romantic " multicultural " notions of society , saying they had created illusions rather than solving problems .
it 's a slap in the face , especially for those on the political left . germany , wulff said , has long been a country of immigration .
it 's a message however that still has n't reached everyone in germany 's middle-class , conservative circles .
it will be interesting to see whether and how quickly the excerpts of the president 's speech containing practical suggestions will become political reality .
for instance , offering german classes for the entire family . after all , what 's the use if ali speaks german at school in the mornings and turkish at home in the afternoons because his mother only speaks that one language .
or another suggestion involves islam lessons in german schools .
wulff wants those classes to be held in german by german teachers .
wulff managed to skillfully link the day 's issue - german unity - with that of integration , the topic he 's focusing on during his term in office .
he used the motto of the east germans from 1989 : " we are one people " and expanded the slogan .
the meaning must include all people who live in germany today , he said .
the basic law , the german constitution , leaves the president with little room for political power .
but he can harness the power of words , though not frequently . the president 's role includes being a moral authority and influencing the intellectual climate of the country .
that 's why the first big speech by christian wulff was all the more important .
the day of german unity - above all the 20th anniversary - was a guarantee for him and his message to attract the highest possible attention and probably have the deepest impact .
in view of the fierce debate on integration , wulff used the opportunity to help determine the future political direction .

and the president made good on that pledge in his speech marking german unity day , dw 's volker wagener says . by using his unity day speech to focus on integration , christian wulff has kept his word .
in the 30 minutes of his speech , more was said about integration and migration than about the topic of german reunification today .
nobody expected wulff to talk about the subject today but it was an important focus . for weeks , the topic has been raging in germany , with a polemical war of words over the issue of those who do not integrate into german life .
it 's claimed that these people live here but do not learn the language or recognize the constitution , and depend on state handouts . wulff adressed the problems but did n't go into detail about the extreme positions in the failed integration policies in germany . learning german is compulsory for all immigrants and german law applies to everyone .
' islam also belongs in germany ' wulff 's arguments about islam were much more far-reaching . christianity and judaism have been part of germany 's past and present said wulff .
" but now islam also belongs in germany , " he added .
no german politician has ever said that so clearly and openly .
but the president basically criticized romantic " multicultural " notions of society , saying they had created illusions rather than solving problems .
it 's a slap in the face , especially for those on the political left . germany , wulff said , has long been a country of immigration .
it 's a message however that still has n't reached everyone in germany 's middle-class , conservative circles .
it will be interesting to see whether and how quickly the excerpts of the president 's speech containing practical suggestions will become political reality .
for instance , offering german classes for the entire family . after all , what 's the use if ali speaks german at school in the mornings and turkish at home in the afternoons because his mother only speaks that one language .
or another suggestion involves islam lessons in german schools .
wulff wants those classes to be held in german by german teachers .
wulff managed to skillfully link the day 's issue - german unity - with that of integration , the topic he 's focusing on during his term in office .
he used the motto of the east germans from 1989 : " we are one people " and expanded the slogan .
the meaning must include all people who live in germany today , he said .
the basic law , the german constitution , leaves the president with little room for political power .
but he can harness the power of words , though not frequently . the president 's role includes being a moral authority and influencing the intellectual climate of the country .
that 's why the first big speech by christian wulff was all the more important .
the day of german unity - above all the 20th anniversary - was a guarantee for him and his message to attract the highest possible attention and probably have the deepest impact .
in view of the fierce debate on integration , wulff used the opportunity to help determine the future political direction .

dortmund upped the game in the second half with lucas barrios scoring in the 52nd minute . it was his fourth goal this season .
barrios capitalized on a throw-in that bayern failed to clear and scored with a deflected shot .
eight minutes later , turkish international nuri sahin scored from a superb free kick , which left the bayern defense helpless .

" our mistakes led to the goals . "
" dortmund did n't get better during the game , we just got worse , " van bommel added .
" it 's difficult but we must keep the faith , " said bayern coach louis van gaal .

in the second half , frankfurt took themselves clear with a second headed goal , this time from brazilian defender chris .
drama came just six minutes from time , as stuttgart captain matthieu delpierre was shown a red card for a late tackle on patrick ochs .
yet a 10-man stuttgart gave their home fans some late hope with a close-range goal from pavel pogrebniak in the 85th minute .
in a frantic closing phase , cacau thought he had equalized , but the goal was disallowed , while frankfurt 's halil alintop shot wide in front of an open goal .
the match is stuttgart 's sixth loss from seven games .
equal chances in sunday 's other game , leverkusen and bremen drew 2-2 at the bay arena .
patrick helmes gave leverkusen the lead after 16 minutes .

taking a point each , leverkusen take 4th in the league table , while bremen are 13th .

in other games , stuttgart stay bottom of the table after a 2-1 defeat to frankfurt while bremen held leverkusen to a 2-2 draw . dortmund clocked up their sixth bundesliga win in a row by defeating champions bayern munich 2-0 on sunday .
it 's the best start of the season in dortmund 's history , and the worst for bayern who have now lost three of their seven games and are languishing in 12th place . for the first 45 minutes , bayern looked like they were in control with mario gomez enjoying his first start of the season and having four good attempts on goal .
however bayern failed to break their poor attack record so far this season and both teams went into the changing rooms at half time even and goalless .
dortmund upped the game in the second half with lucas barrios scoring in the 52nd minute . it was his fourth goal this season .
barrios capitalized on a throw-in that bayern failed to clear and scored with a deflected shot .
eight minutes later , turkish international nuri sahin scored from a superb free kick , which left the bayern defense helpless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund celebrate their win over the team klopp calls ' the best in germany ' ' keep the faith ' " we did n't make the most of our chances , especially in the first half , " said a fuming bayern captain mark van bommel .
" our mistakes led to the goals . "
" dortmund did n't get better during the game , we just got worse , " van bommel added .
" it 's difficult but we must keep the faith , " said bayern coach louis van gaal .
dortmund bounced back from their midweek europa league defeat to humble bayern and keep their number two spot in the table .
" at the moment it 's a good result , but it 's only october , " said coach juergen klopp .
" we have won against the best team in germany .
we can be proud , " he added .
stuttgart sink further at home to frankfurt , stuttgart failed to produce the form to pull them out of the bottom spot of the table , with a 2-1 defeat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the game ended in a dispute over a disallowed cacau goal although initially strong , it was frankfurt who scored first , with a header from theofanis gekas in the 18th minute .
in the second half , frankfurt took themselves clear with a second headed goal , this time from brazilian defender chris .
drama came just six minutes from time , as stuttgart captain matthieu delpierre was shown a red card for a late tackle on patrick ochs .
yet a 10-man stuttgart gave their home fans some late hope with a close-range goal from pavel pogrebniak in the 85th minute .
in a frantic closing phase , cacau thought he had equalized , but the goal was disallowed , while frankfurt 's halil alintop shot wide in front of an open goal .
the match is stuttgart 's sixth loss from seven games .
equal chances in sunday 's other game , leverkusen and bremen drew 2-2 at the bay arena .
patrick helmes gave leverkusen the lead after 16 minutes .
after the break , bremen leveled the score through hugo almeida , then were ahead nine minutes later with a goal from marko marin .
the home side salvaged the point with twelve minutes to go , as eren derdiyok dribbled past three bremen defenders to score just inside the area .
taking a point each , leverkusen take 4th in the league table , while bremen are 13th .

it 's the best start of the season in dortmund 's history , and the worst for bayern who have now lost three of their seven games and are languishing in 12th place . for the first 45 minutes , bayern looked like they were in control with mario gomez enjoying his first start of the season and having four good attempts on goal .
however bayern failed to break their poor attack record so far this season and both teams went into the changing rooms at half time even and goalless .
dortmund upped the game in the second half with lucas barrios scoring in the 52nd minute . it was his fourth goal this season .
barrios capitalized on a throw-in that bayern failed to clear and scored with a deflected shot .
eight minutes later , turkish international nuri sahin scored from a superb free kick , which left the bayern defense helpless .

" our mistakes led to the goals . "
" dortmund did n't get better during the game , we just got worse , " van bommel added .
" it 's difficult but we must keep the faith , " said bayern coach louis van gaal .

in the second half , frankfurt took themselves clear with a second headed goal , this time from brazilian defender chris .
drama came just six minutes from time , as stuttgart captain matthieu delpierre was shown a red card for a late tackle on patrick ochs .
yet a 10-man stuttgart gave their home fans some late hope with a close-range goal from pavel pogrebniak in the 85th minute .
in a frantic closing phase , cacau thought he had equalized , but the goal was disallowed , while frankfurt 's halil alintop shot wide in front of an open goal .
the match is stuttgart 's sixth loss from seven games .
equal chances in sunday 's other game , leverkusen and bremen drew 2-2 at the bay arena .
patrick helmes gave leverkusen the lead after 16 minutes .

nationalist parties are expected to do well , threatening to leave bosnia in its current stalemate . voters in bosnia are going to the polls this sunday , october 3 , to choose a new central parliament , tripartite presidency , and two semi-autonomous assemblies in the serb-run republika srpska and moslem-croat federation .
each of the three ethnic groups – muslims , serbs and croats – has representatives in the legislature and the tripartite presidency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serb leader milorad dodik is pushing for more serb autonomy the ethnically divided country is still suffering from the after-effects of the 1992-1995 bosnian war and has been locked in a political stalemate since the last elections in 2006 .
the international community hopes the vote will bring a new leadership to help the country overcome divisions and implement political reform .
yet pollsters have tipped the election will only further cement the ethnic divisions that have hampered the country 's reforms in past years .
both eu and nato membership however hinge on the country implementing substantial reforms and overcoming its crippling ethnic tensions .

nationalist parties are expected to do well , threatening to leave bosnia in its current stalemate . voters in bosnia are going to the polls this sunday , october 3 , to choose a new central parliament , tripartite presidency , and two semi-autonomous assemblies in the serb-run republika srpska and moslem-croat federation .
each of the three ethnic groups – muslims , serbs and croats – has representatives in the legislature and the tripartite presidency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serb leader milorad dodik is pushing for more serb autonomy the ethnically divided country is still suffering from the after-effects of the 1992-1995 bosnian war and has been locked in a political stalemate since the last elections in 2006 .
the international community hopes the vote will bring a new leadership to help the country overcome divisions and implement political reform .
yet pollsters have tipped the election will only further cement the ethnic divisions that have hampered the country 's reforms in past years .
both eu and nato membership however hinge on the country implementing substantial reforms and overcoming its crippling ethnic tensions .
some 3.1 million voters will be eligible to cast their ballot in the country 's two semi-independent entities .
secession vs. unity campaigning ahead of the vote was dominated by nationalist rhetoric fueling concerns that the troubled balkan country could drift further apart .
milorad dodik , prime minister of the repulika srpska , has in the past gone on record claiming the country 's serbs should have the right to secede .
in the run-up to the election , dodik vowed to preserve the serb entity 's autonomy at the expense of the much needed reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim bosniaks are the largest group in sarajevo bosnian muslims , who make up the largest single group in the country , have dismissed such hardliner talk , warning that riding the nationalist wave could edge the country to the brink of break-up or even a new war .
" we are determined to stop all attacks on our country and our people , " sulejman tihic , head of the muslim party of democratic action said .
" any attempts at secession or the establishment of a third entity will not go through . "
bosnian croat leader dragan covic has based his campaign on calling for a separate croat entity .

and the president made good on that pledge in his speech marking german unity day , dw 's volker wagener says . by using his unity day speech to focus on integration , christian wulff has kept his word .
in the 30 minutes of his speech , more was said about integration and migration than about the topic of german reunification today .
nobody expected wulff to talk about the subject today but it was an important focus . for weeks , the topic has been raging in germany , with a polemical war of words over the issue of those who do not integrate into german life .
it 's claimed that these people live here but do not learn the language or recognize the constitution , and depend on state handouts . wulff adressed the problems but did n't go into detail about the extreme positions in the failed integration policies in germany . learning german is compulsory for all immigrants and german law applies to everyone .
' islam also belongs in germany ' wulff 's arguments about islam were much more far-reaching . christianity and judaism have been part of germany 's past and present said wulff .
" but now islam also belongs in germany , " he added .
no german politician has ever said that so clearly and openly .
but the president basically criticized romantic " multicultural " notions of society , saying they had created illusions rather than solving problems .
it 's a slap in the face , especially for those on the political left . germany , wulff said , has long been a country of immigration .
it 's a message however that still has n't reached everyone in germany 's middle-class , conservative circles .
it will be interesting to see whether and how quickly the excerpts of the president 's speech containing practical suggestions will become political reality .
for instance , offering german classes for the entire family . after all , what 's the use if ali speaks german at school in the mornings and turkish at home in the afternoons because his mother only speaks that one language .
or another suggestion involves islam lessons in german schools .
wulff wants those classes to be held in german by german teachers .
wulff managed to skillfully link the day 's issue - german unity - with that of integration , the topic he 's focusing on during his term in office .
he used the motto of the east germans from 1989 : " we are one people " and expanded the slogan .
the meaning must include all people who live in germany today , he said .
the basic law , the german constitution , leaves the president with little room for political power .
but he can harness the power of words , though not frequently . the president 's role includes being a moral authority and influencing the intellectual climate of the country .
that 's why the first big speech by christian wulff was all the more important .
the day of german unity - above all the 20th anniversary - was a guarantee for him and his message to attract the highest possible attention and probably have the deepest impact .
in view of the fierce debate on integration , wulff used the opportunity to help determine the future political direction .

and the president made good on that pledge in his speech marking german unity day , dw 's volker wagener says . by using his unity day speech to focus on integration , christian wulff has kept his word .
in the 30 minutes of his speech , more was said about integration and migration than about the topic of german reunification today .
nobody expected wulff to talk about the subject today but it was an important focus . for weeks , the topic has been raging in germany , with a polemical war of words over the issue of those who do not integrate into german life .
it 's claimed that these people live here but do not learn the language or recognize the constitution , and depend on state handouts . wulff adressed the problems but did n't go into detail about the extreme positions in the failed integration policies in germany . learning german is compulsory for all immigrants and german law applies to everyone .
' islam also belongs in germany ' wulff 's arguments about islam were much more far-reaching . christianity and judaism have been part of germany 's past and present said wulff .
" but now islam also belongs in germany , " he added .
no german politician has ever said that so clearly and openly .
but the president basically criticized romantic " multicultural " notions of society , saying they had created illusions rather than solving problems .
it 's a slap in the face , especially for those on the political left . germany , wulff said , has long been a country of immigration .
it 's a message however that still has n't reached everyone in germany 's middle-class , conservative circles .
it will be interesting to see whether and how quickly the excerpts of the president 's speech containing practical suggestions will become political reality .
for instance , offering german classes for the entire family . after all , what 's the use if ali speaks german at school in the mornings and turkish at home in the afternoons because his mother only speaks that one language .
or another suggestion involves islam lessons in german schools .
wulff wants those classes to be held in german by german teachers .
wulff managed to skillfully link the day 's issue - german unity - with that of integration , the topic he 's focusing on during his term in office .
he used the motto of the east germans from 1989 : " we are one people " and expanded the slogan .
the meaning must include all people who live in germany today , he said .
the basic law , the german constitution , leaves the president with little room for political power .
but he can harness the power of words , though not frequently . the president 's role includes being a moral authority and influencing the intellectual climate of the country .
that 's why the first big speech by christian wulff was all the more important .

britain too warned of a " high " terror threat in france and germany . the us state department has issued an alert , warning citizens " to the potential for terrorist attacks in europe . "
the department did not specify a country , issuing the updated guidance for the whole of europe .
the alert , published on the state department 's website , said that " current information suggests " al-qaeda and affiliated groups were continuing to plan commando-style attacks , similar to the 2008 atrocities in mumbai .
separately , the british foreign ministry on sunday updated its advice for citizens traveling to france and germany , warning there was a " high threat " of terrorism in the two european countries .
public spaces could be potential targets american citizens have been warned that public places could be potential targets and that they should " take every precaution to be aware of surroundings . "
potential targets could be railways and subways and other tourist places , according to the us state department .
" terrorists have targeted and attacked subway and rail systems , as well as aviation and maritime services , " the alert said .
it comes as media in the past week reported that intelligence agencies in germany , france , the uk and the us foiled an attempted strike on a series of european cities .
as a result the uk has also updated its travel advice for france and germany , warning there was a " high threat " of terrorism .
british home secretary theresa may said on sunday the us advice was " consistent " with london 's own assessment of the threat .
" as we have consistently made clear , we face a real and serious threat from terrorism , " she said .
" we work closely with our international partners in countering terrorism and the us advice is consistent with our assessment , " she said .
the alert – which the state department issues regarding specific events – is one step down from a travel warning .
a total of 31 travel warnings are in effect for various countries including afghanistan , iraq , israel , sudan and somalia .

nationalist parties are expected to do well , threatening to leave bosnia in its current stalemate . voters in bosnia are going to the polls this sunday , october 3 , to choose a new central parliament , tripartite presidency , and two semi-autonomous assemblies in the serb-run republika srpska and moslem-croat federation .

the international community hopes the vote will bring a new leadership to help the country overcome divisions and implement political reform .
yet pollsters have tipped the election will only further cement the ethnic divisions that have hampered the country 's reforms in past years .
both eu and nato membership however hinge on the country implementing substantial reforms and overcoming its crippling ethnic tensions .
some 3.1 million voters will be eligible to cast their ballot in the country 's two semi-independent entities .
secession vs. unity campaigning ahead of the vote was dominated by nationalist rhetoric fueling concerns that the troubled balkan country could drift further apart .
milorad dodik , prime minister of the repulika srpska , has in the past gone on record claiming the country 's serbs should have the right to secede .

and the president made good on that pledge in his speech marking german unity day , dw 's volker wagener says . by using his unity day speech to focus on integration , christian wulff has kept his word .
in the 30 minutes of his speech , more was said about integration and migration than about the topic of german reunification today .
nobody expected wulff to talk about the subject today but it was an important focus . for weeks , the topic has been raging in germany , with a polemical war of words over the issue of those who do not integrate into german life .
it 's claimed that these people live here but do not learn the language or recognize the constitution , and depend on state handouts . wulff adressed the problems but did n't go into detail about the extreme positions in the failed integration policies in germany . learning german is compulsory for all immigrants and german law applies to everyone .
' islam also belongs in germany ' wulff 's arguments about islam were much more far-reaching . christianity and judaism have been part of germany 's past and present said wulff .
" but now islam also belongs in germany , " he added .
no german politician has ever said that so clearly and openly .
but the president basically criticized romantic " multicultural " notions of society , saying they had created illusions rather than solving problems .
it 's a slap in the face , especially for those on the political left . germany , wulff said , has long been a country of immigration .
it 's a message however that still has n't reached everyone in germany 's middle-class , conservative circles .
it will be interesting to see whether and how quickly the excerpts of the president 's speech containing practical suggestions will become political reality .
for instance , offering german classes for the entire family . after all , what 's the use if ali speaks german at school in the mornings and turkish at home in the afternoons because his mother only speaks that one language .
or another suggestion involves islam lessons in german schools .
wulff wants those classes to be held in german by german teachers .
wulff managed to skillfully link the day 's issue - german unity - with that of integration , the topic he 's focusing on during his term in office .
he used the motto of the east germans from 1989 : " we are one people " and expanded the slogan .
the meaning must include all people who live in germany today , he said .
the basic law , the german constitution , leaves the president with little room for political power .
but he can harness the power of words , though not frequently . the president 's role includes being a moral authority and influencing the intellectual climate of the country .
that 's why the first big speech by christian wulff was all the more important .
the day of german unity - above all the 20th anniversary - was a guarantee for him and his message to attract the highest possible attention and probably have the deepest impact .
in view of the fierce debate on integration , wulff used the opportunity to help determine the future political direction .

and the president made good on that pledge in his speech marking german unity day , dw 's volker wagener says . by using his unity day speech to focus on integration , christian wulff has kept his word .
in the 30 minutes of his speech , more was said about integration and migration than about the topic of german reunification today .
nobody expected wulff to talk about the subject today but it was an important focus . for weeks , the topic has been raging in germany , with a polemical war of words over the issue of those who do not integrate into german life .
it 's claimed that these people live here but do not learn the language or recognize the constitution , and depend on state handouts . wulff adressed the problems but did n't go into detail about the extreme positions in the failed integration policies in germany . learning german is compulsory for all immigrants and german law applies to everyone .
' islam also belongs in germany ' wulff 's arguments about islam were much more far-reaching . christianity and judaism have been part of germany 's past and present said wulff .
" but now islam also belongs in germany , " he added .
no german politician has ever said that so clearly and openly .
but the president basically criticized romantic " multicultural " notions of society , saying they had created illusions rather than solving problems .
it 's a slap in the face , especially for those on the political left . germany , wulff said , has long been a country of immigration .
it 's a message however that still has n't reached everyone in germany 's middle-class , conservative circles .
it will be interesting to see whether and how quickly the excerpts of the president 's speech containing practical suggestions will become political reality .
for instance , offering german classes for the entire family . after all , what 's the use if ali speaks german at school in the mornings and turkish at home in the afternoons because his mother only speaks that one language .
or another suggestion involves islam lessons in german schools .
wulff wants those classes to be held in german by german teachers .
wulff managed to skillfully link the day 's issue - german unity - with that of integration , the topic he 's focusing on during his term in office .
he used the motto of the east germans from 1989 : " we are one people " and expanded the slogan .
the meaning must include all people who live in germany today , he said .
the basic law , the german constitution , leaves the president with little room for political power .
but he can harness the power of words , though not frequently . the president 's role includes being a moral authority and influencing the intellectual climate of the country .
that 's why the first big speech by christian wulff was all the more important .
the day of german unity - above all the 20th anniversary - was a guarantee for him and his message to attract the highest possible attention and probably have the deepest impact .
in view of the fierce debate on integration , wulff used the opportunity to help determine the future political direction .

britain too warned of a " high " terror threat in france and germany . the us state department has issued an alert , warning citizens " to the potential for terrorist attacks in europe . "
the department did not specify a country , issuing the updated guidance for the whole of europe .
the alert , published on the state department 's website , said that " current information suggests " al-qaeda and affiliated groups were continuing to plan commando-style attacks , similar to the 2008 atrocities in mumbai .
separately , the british foreign ministry on sunday updated its advice for citizens traveling to france and germany , warning there was a " high threat " of terrorism in the two european countries .
public spaces could be potential targets american citizens have been warned that public places could be potential targets and that they should " take every precaution to be aware of surroundings . "
potential targets could be railways and subways and other tourist places , according to the us state department .
" terrorists have targeted and attacked subway and rail systems , as well as aviation and maritime services , " the alert said .
it comes as media in the past week reported that intelligence agencies in germany , france , the uk and the us foiled an attempted strike on a series of european cities .
as a result the uk has also updated its travel advice for france and germany , warning there was a " high threat " of terrorism .
british home secretary theresa may said on sunday the us advice was " consistent " with london 's own assessment of the threat .
" as we have consistently made clear , we face a real and serious threat from terrorism , " she said .
" we work closely with our international partners in countering terrorism and the us advice is consistent with our assessment , " she said .
the alert – which the state department issues regarding specific events – is one step down from a travel warning .
a total of 31 travel warnings are in effect for various countries including afghanistan , iraq , israel , sudan and somalia .

and the president made good on that pledge in his speech marking german unity day , dw 's volker wagener says . by using his unity day speech to focus on integration , christian wulff has kept his word .
in the 30 minutes of his speech , more was said about integration and migration than about the topic of german reunification today .
nobody expected wulff to talk about the subject today but it was an important focus . for weeks , the topic has been raging in germany , with a polemical war of words over the issue of those who do not integrate into german life .
it 's claimed that these people live here but do not learn the language or recognize the constitution , and depend on state handouts . wulff adressed the problems but did n't go into detail about the extreme positions in the failed integration policies in germany . learning german is compulsory for all immigrants and german law applies to everyone .
' islam also belongs in germany ' wulff 's arguments about islam were much more far-reaching . christianity and judaism have been part of germany 's past and present said wulff .
" but now islam also belongs in germany , " he added .
no german politician has ever said that so clearly and openly .
but the president basically criticized romantic " multicultural " notions of society , saying they had created illusions rather than solving problems .
it 's a slap in the face , especially for those on the political left . germany , wulff said , has long been a country of immigration .
it 's a message however that still has n't reached everyone in germany 's middle-class , conservative circles .
it will be interesting to see whether and how quickly the excerpts of the president 's speech containing practical suggestions will become political reality .
for instance , offering german classes for the entire family . after all , what 's the use if ali speaks german at school in the mornings and turkish at home in the afternoons because his mother only speaks that one language .
or another suggestion involves islam lessons in german schools .
wulff wants those classes to be held in german by german teachers .
wulff managed to skillfully link the day 's issue - german unity - with that of integration , the topic he 's focusing on during his term in office .
he used the motto of the east germans from 1989 : " we are one people " and expanded the slogan .
the meaning must include all people who live in germany today , he said .
the basic law , the german constitution , leaves the president with little room for political power .
but he can harness the power of words , though not frequently . the president 's role includes being a moral authority and influencing the intellectual climate of the country .
that 's why the first big speech by christian wulff was all the more important .
the day of german unity - above all the 20th anniversary - was a guarantee for him and his message to attract the highest possible attention and probably have the deepest impact .
in view of the fierce debate on integration , wulff used the opportunity to help determine the future political direction .

nationalist parties are expected to do well , threatening to leave bosnia in its current stalemate . voters in bosnia are going to the polls this sunday , october 3 , to choose a new central parliament , tripartite presidency , and two semi-autonomous assemblies in the serb-run republika srpska and moslem-croat federation .
each of the three ethnic groups – muslims , serbs and croats – has representatives in the legislature and the tripartite presidency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serb leader milorad dodik is pushing for more serb autonomy the ethnically divided country is still suffering from the after-effects of the 1992-1995 bosnian war and has been locked in a political stalemate since the last elections in 2006 .
the international community hopes the vote will bring a new leadership to help the country overcome divisions and implement political reform .
yet pollsters have tipped the election will only further cement the ethnic divisions that have hampered the country 's reforms in past years .
both eu and nato membership however hinge on the country implementing substantial reforms and overcoming its crippling ethnic tensions .
some 3.1 million voters will be eligible to cast their ballot in the country 's two semi-independent entities .
secession vs. unity campaigning ahead of the vote was dominated by nationalist rhetoric fueling concerns that the troubled balkan country could drift further apart .
milorad dodik , prime minister of the repulika srpska , has in the past gone on record claiming the country 's serbs should have the right to secede .
in the run-up to the election , dodik vowed to preserve the serb entity 's autonomy at the expense of the much needed reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim bosniaks are the largest group in sarajevo bosnian muslims , who make up the largest single group in the country , have dismissed such hardliner talk , warning that riding the nationalist wave could edge the country to the brink of break-up or even a new war .
" we are determined to stop all attacks on our country and our people , " sulejman tihic , head of the muslim party of democratic action said .
" any attempts at secession or the establishment of a third entity will not go through . "
bosnian croat leader dragan covic has based his campaign on calling for a separate croat entity .
since the 1992-95 inter-ethnic war that killed about 100,000 people , bosnia has held five general elections but has lagged in political and economic reforms .
the small country - one of the poorest in europe - remains near the back of the line of balkan countries aspiring to eu and nato membership .

according to the website of the muslim coordination council krm , germany 's first mosque was built in 1739 by the prussian king friedrich wilhelm i. he built it for some of his muslim soldiers so they would have a place to pray , just like their christian comrades in arms had at the soldiers ' church in potsdam .
today , there are over 2,000 mosques in germany .

nationalist parties are expected to do well , threatening to leave bosnia in its current stalemate . voters in bosnia are going to the polls this sunday , october 3 , to choose a new central parliament , tripartite presidency , and two semi-autonomous assemblies in the serb-run republika srpska and moslem-croat federation .
each of the three ethnic groups – muslims , serbs and croats – has representatives in the legislature and the tripartite presidency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serb leader milorad dodik is pushing for more serb autonomy the ethnically divided country is still suffering from the after-effects of the 1992-1995 bosnian war and has been locked in a political stalemate since the last elections in 2006 .
the international community hopes the vote will bring a new leadership to help the country overcome divisions and implement political reform .
yet pollsters have tipped the election will only further cement the ethnic divisions that have hampered the country 's reforms in past years .
both eu and nato membership however hinge on the country implementing substantial reforms and overcoming its crippling ethnic tensions .
some 3.1 million voters will be eligible to cast their ballot in the country 's two semi-independent entities .
secession vs. unity campaigning ahead of the vote was dominated by nationalist rhetoric fueling concerns that the troubled balkan country could drift further apart .
milorad dodik , prime minister of the repulika srpska , has in the past gone on record claiming the country 's serbs should have the right to secede .
in the run-up to the election , dodik vowed to preserve the serb entity 's autonomy at the expense of the much needed reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim bosniaks are the largest group in sarajevo bosnian muslims , who make up the largest single group in the country , have dismissed such hardliner talk , warning that riding the nationalist wave could edge the country to the brink of break-up or even a new war .
" we are determined to stop all attacks on our country and our people , " sulejman tihic , head of the muslim party of democratic action said .
" any attempts at secession or the establishment of a third entity will not go through . "
bosnian croat leader dragan covic has based his campaign on calling for a separate croat entity .
since the 1992-95 inter-ethnic war that killed about 100,000 people , bosnia has held five general elections but has lagged in political and economic reforms .
the small country - one of the poorest in europe - remains near the back of the line of balkan countries aspiring to eu and nato membership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.10.2010 opinion : wulff makes integration centerpiece of unity day speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff stressed islam now has a role in modern germany german president christian wulff has vowed to focus on the hot button issue of integration of immigrants .
and the president made good on that pledge in his speech marking german unity day , dw 's volker wagener says . by using his unity day speech to focus on integration , christian wulff has kept his word .
in the 30 minutes of his speech , more was said about integration and migration than about the topic of german reunification today .
nobody expected wulff to talk about the subject today but it was an important focus . for weeks , the topic has been raging in germany , with a polemical war of words over the issue of those who do not integrate into german life .
it 's claimed that these people live here but do not learn the language or recognize the constitution , and depend on state handouts . wulff adressed the problems but did n't go into detail about the extreme positions in the failed integration policies in germany . learning german is compulsory for all immigrants and german law applies to everyone .
' islam also belongs in germany ' wulff 's arguments about islam were much more far-reaching . christianity and judaism have been part of germany 's past and present said wulff .
" but now islam also belongs in germany , " he added .
no german politician has ever said that so clearly and openly .
but the president basically criticized romantic " multicultural " notions of society , saying they had created illusions rather than solving problems .
it 's a slap in the face , especially for those on the political left . germany , wulff said , has long been a country of immigration .
it 's a message however that still has n't reached everyone in germany 's middle-class , conservative circles .
it will be interesting to see whether and how quickly the excerpts of the president 's speech containing practical suggestions will become political reality .
for instance , offering german classes for the entire family . after all , what 's the use if ali speaks german at school in the mornings and turkish at home in the afternoons because his mother only speaks that one language .
or another suggestion involves islam lessons in german schools .
wulff wants those classes to be held in german by german teachers .
wulff managed to skillfully link the day 's issue - german unity - with that of integration , the topic he 's focusing on during his term in office .
he used the motto of the east germans from 1989 : " we are one people " and expanded the slogan .
the meaning must include all people who live in germany today , he said .
the basic law , the german constitution , leaves the president with little room for political power .
but he can harness the power of words , though not frequently . the president 's role includes being a moral authority and influencing the intellectual climate of the country .
that 's why the first big speech by christian wulff was all the more important .

britain too warned of a " high " terror threat in france and germany . the us state department has issued an alert , warning citizens " to the potential for terrorist attacks in europe . "
the department did not specify a country , issuing the updated guidance for the whole of europe .
the alert , published on the state department 's website , said that " current information suggests " al-qaeda and affiliated groups were continuing to plan commando-style attacks , similar to the 2008 atrocities in mumbai .
separately , the british foreign ministry on sunday updated its advice for citizens traveling to france and germany , warning there was a " high threat " of terrorism in the two european countries .
public spaces could be potential targets american citizens have been warned that public places could be potential targets and that they should " take every precaution to be aware of surroundings . "
potential targets could be railways and subways and other tourist places , according to the us state department .
" terrorists have targeted and attacked subway and rail systems , as well as aviation and maritime services , " the alert said .
it comes as media in the past week reported that intelligence agencies in germany , france , the uk and the us foiled an attempted strike on a series of european cities .
as a result the uk has also updated its travel advice for france and germany , warning there was a " high threat " of terrorism .
british home secretary theresa may said on sunday the us advice was " consistent " with london 's own assessment of the threat .
" as we have consistently made clear , we face a real and serious threat from terrorism , " she said .
" we work closely with our international partners in countering terrorism and the us advice is consistent with our assessment , " she said .
the alert – which the state department issues regarding specific events – is one step down from a travel warning .
a total of 31 travel warnings are in effect for various countries including afghanistan , iraq , israel , sudan and somalia .

nationalist parties are expected to do well , threatening to leave bosnia in its current stalemate . voters in bosnia are going to the polls this sunday , october 3 , to choose a new central parliament , tripartite presidency , and two semi-autonomous assemblies in the serb-run republika srpska and moslem-croat federation .
each of the three ethnic groups – muslims , serbs and croats – has representatives in the legislature and the tripartite presidency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serb leader milorad dodik is pushing for more serb autonomy the ethnically divided country is still suffering from the after-effects of the 1992-1995 bosnian war and has been locked in a political stalemate since the last elections in 2006 .
the international community hopes the vote will bring a new leadership to help the country overcome divisions and implement political reform .
yet pollsters have tipped the election will only further cement the ethnic divisions that have hampered the country 's reforms in past years .
both eu and nato membership however hinge on the country implementing substantial reforms and overcoming its crippling ethnic tensions .
some 3.1 million voters will be eligible to cast their ballot in the country 's two semi-independent entities .
secession vs. unity campaigning ahead of the vote was dominated by nationalist rhetoric fueling concerns that the troubled balkan country could drift further apart .
milorad dodik , prime minister of the repulika srpska , has in the past gone on record claiming the country 's serbs should have the right to secede .
in the run-up to the election , dodik vowed to preserve the serb entity 's autonomy at the expense of the much needed reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim bosniaks are the largest group in sarajevo bosnian muslims , who make up the largest single group in the country , have dismissed such hardliner talk , warning that riding the nationalist wave could edge the country to the brink of break-up or even a new war .
" we are determined to stop all attacks on our country and our people , " sulejman tihic , head of the muslim party of democratic action said .
" any attempts at secession or the establishment of a third entity will not go through . "
bosnian croat leader dragan covic has based his campaign on calling for a separate croat entity .
since the 1992-95 inter-ethnic war that killed about 100,000 people , bosnia has held five general elections but has lagged in political and economic reforms .
the small country - one of the poorest in europe - remains near the back of the line of balkan countries aspiring to eu and nato membership .

nationalist parties are expected to do well , threatening to leave bosnia in its current stalemate . voters in bosnia are going to the polls this sunday , october 3 , to choose a new central parliament , tripartite presidency , and two semi-autonomous assemblies in the serb-run republika srpska and moslem-croat federation .
each of the three ethnic groups – muslims , serbs and croats – has representatives in the legislature and the tripartite presidency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serb leader milorad dodik is pushing for more serb autonomy the ethnically divided country is still suffering from the after-effects of the 1992-1995 bosnian war and has been locked in a political stalemate since the last elections in 2006 .
the international community hopes the vote will bring a new leadership to help the country overcome divisions and implement political reform .
yet pollsters have tipped the election will only further cement the ethnic divisions that have hampered the country 's reforms in past years .
both eu and nato membership however hinge on the country implementing substantial reforms and overcoming its crippling ethnic tensions .
some 3.1 million voters will be eligible to cast their ballot in the country 's two semi-independent entities .
secession vs. unity campaigning ahead of the vote was dominated by nationalist rhetoric fueling concerns that the troubled balkan country could drift further apart .
milorad dodik , prime minister of the repulika srpska , has in the past gone on record claiming the country 's serbs should have the right to secede .
in the run-up to the election , dodik vowed to preserve the serb entity 's autonomy at the expense of the much needed reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim bosniaks are the largest group in sarajevo bosnian muslims , who make up the largest single group in the country , have dismissed such hardliner talk , warning that riding the nationalist wave could edge the country to the brink of break-up or even a new war .
" we are determined to stop all attacks on our country and our people , " sulejman tihic , head of the muslim party of democratic action said .
" any attempts at secession or the establishment of a third entity will not go through . "
bosnian croat leader dragan covic has based his campaign on calling for a separate croat entity .
since the 1992-95 inter-ethnic war that killed about 100,000 people , bosnia has held five general elections but has lagged in political and economic reforms .
the small country - one of the poorest in europe - remains near the back of the line of balkan countries aspiring to eu and nato membership .

nationalist parties are expected to do well , threatening to leave bosnia in its current stalemate . voters in bosnia are going to the polls this sunday , october 3 , to choose a new central parliament , tripartite presidency , and two semi-autonomous assemblies in the serb-run republika srpska and moslem-croat federation .
each of the three ethnic groups – muslims , serbs and croats – has representatives in the legislature and the tripartite presidency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serb leader milorad dodik is pushing for more serb autonomy the ethnically divided country is still suffering from the after-effects of the 1992-1995 bosnian war and has been locked in a political stalemate since the last elections in 2006 .
the international community hopes the vote will bring a new leadership to help the country overcome divisions and implement political reform .
yet pollsters have tipped the election will only further cement the ethnic divisions that have hampered the country 's reforms in past years .
both eu and nato membership however hinge on the country implementing substantial reforms and overcoming its crippling ethnic tensions .
some 3.1 million voters will be eligible to cast their ballot in the country 's two semi-independent entities .
secession vs. unity campaigning ahead of the vote was dominated by nationalist rhetoric fueling concerns that the troubled balkan country could drift further apart .
milorad dodik , prime minister of the repulika srpska , has in the past gone on record claiming the country 's serbs should have the right to secede .
in the run-up to the election , dodik vowed to preserve the serb entity 's autonomy at the expense of the much needed reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim bosniaks are the largest group in sarajevo bosnian muslims , who make up the largest single group in the country , have dismissed such hardliner talk , warning that riding the nationalist wave could edge the country to the brink of break-up or even a new war .
" we are determined to stop all attacks on our country and our people , " sulejman tihic , head of the muslim party of democratic action said .
" any attempts at secession or the establishment of a third entity will not go through . "
bosnian croat leader dragan covic has based his campaign on calling for a separate croat entity .
since the 1992-95 inter-ethnic war that killed about 100,000 people , bosnia has held five general elections but has lagged in political and economic reforms .
the small country - one of the poorest in europe - remains near the back of the line of balkan countries aspiring to eu and nato membership .

and the president made good on that pledge in his speech marking german unity day , dw 's volker wagener says . by using his unity day speech to focus on integration , christian wulff has kept his word .
in the 30 minutes of his speech , more was said about integration and migration than about the topic of german reunification today .
nobody expected wulff to talk about the subject today but it was an important focus . for weeks , the topic has been raging in germany , with a polemical war of words over the issue of those who do not integrate into german life .
it 's claimed that these people live here but do not learn the language or recognize the constitution , and depend on state handouts . wulff adressed the problems but did n't go into detail about the extreme positions in the failed integration policies in germany . learning german is compulsory for all immigrants and german law applies to everyone .
' islam also belongs in germany ' wulff 's arguments about islam were much more far-reaching . christianity and judaism have been part of germany 's past and present said wulff .
" but now islam also belongs in germany , " he added .
no german politician has ever said that so clearly and openly .
but the president basically criticized romantic " multicultural " notions of society , saying they had created illusions rather than solving problems .
it 's a slap in the face , especially for those on the political left . germany , wulff said , has long been a country of immigration .

and the president made good on that pledge in his speech marking german unity day , dw 's volker wagener says . by using his unity day speech to focus on integration , christian wulff has kept his word .
in the 30 minutes of his speech , more was said about integration and migration than about the topic of german reunification today .
nobody expected wulff to talk about the subject today but it was an important focus . for weeks , the topic has been raging in germany , with a polemical war of words over the issue of those who do not integrate into german life .
it 's claimed that these people live here but do not learn the language or recognize the constitution , and depend on state handouts . wulff adressed the problems but did n't go into detail about the extreme positions in the failed integration policies in germany . learning german is compulsory for all immigrants and german law applies to everyone .
' islam also belongs in germany ' wulff 's arguments about islam were much more far-reaching . christianity and judaism have been part of germany 's past and present said wulff .
" but now islam also belongs in germany , " he added .
no german politician has ever said that so clearly and openly .
but the president basically criticized romantic " multicultural " notions of society , saying they had created illusions rather than solving problems .
it 's a slap in the face , especially for those on the political left . germany , wulff said , has long been a country of immigration .
it 's a message however that still has n't reached everyone in germany 's middle-class , conservative circles .
it will be interesting to see whether and how quickly the excerpts of the president 's speech containing practical suggestions will become political reality .
for instance , offering german classes for the entire family . after all , what 's the use if ali speaks german at school in the mornings and turkish at home in the afternoons because his mother only speaks that one language .
or another suggestion involves islam lessons in german schools .
wulff wants those classes to be held in german by german teachers .
wulff managed to skillfully link the day 's issue - german unity - with that of integration , the topic he 's focusing on during his term in office .
he used the motto of the east germans from 1989 : " we are one people " and expanded the slogan .

it 's the best start of the season in dortmund 's history , and the worst for bayern who have now lost three of their seven games and are languishing in 12th place . for the first 45 minutes , bayern looked like they were in control with mario gomez enjoying his first start of the season and having four good attempts on goal .
however bayern failed to break their poor attack record so far this season and both teams went into the changing rooms at half time even and goalless .
dortmund upped the game in the second half with lucas barrios scoring in the 52nd minute . it was his fourth goal this season .
barrios capitalized on a throw-in that bayern failed to clear and scored with a deflected shot .
eight minutes later , turkish international nuri sahin scored from a superb free kick , which left the bayern defense helpless .

drama came just six minutes from time , as stuttgart captain matthieu delpierre was shown a red card for a late tackle on patrick ochs .
yet a 10-man stuttgart gave their home fans some late hope with a close-range goal from pavel pogrebniak in the 85th minute .
in a frantic closing phase , cacau thought he had equalized , but the goal was disallowed , while frankfurt 's halil alintop shot wide in front of an open goal .
the match is stuttgart 's sixth loss from seven games .

however bayern failed to break their poor attack record so far this season and both teams went into the changing rooms at half time even and goalless .
dortmund upped the game in the second half with lucas barrios scoring in the 52nd minute . it was his fourth goal this season .
barrios capitalized on a throw-in that bayern failed to clear and scored with a deflected shot .
eight minutes later , turkish international nuri sahin scored from a superb free kick , which left the bayern defense helpless .

drama came just six minutes from time , as stuttgart captain matthieu delpierre was shown a red card for a late tackle on patrick ochs .
yet a 10-man stuttgart gave their home fans some late hope with a close-range goal from pavel pogrebniak in the 85th minute .
in a frantic closing phase , cacau thought he had equalized , but the goal was disallowed , while frankfurt 's halil alintop shot wide in front of an open goal .

nationalist parties are expected to do well , threatening to leave bosnia in its current stalemate . voters in bosnia are going to the polls this sunday , october 3 , to choose a new central parliament , tripartite presidency , and two semi-autonomous assemblies in the serb-run republika srpska and moslem-croat federation .
each of the three ethnic groups – muslims , serbs and croats – has representatives in the legislature and the tripartite presidency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serb leader milorad dodik is pushing for more serb autonomy the ethnically divided country is still suffering from the after-effects of the 1992-1995 bosnian war and has been locked in a political stalemate since the last elections in 2006 .
the international community hopes the vote will bring a new leadership to help the country overcome divisions and implement political reform .
yet pollsters have tipped the election will only further cement the ethnic divisions that have hampered the country 's reforms in past years .
both eu and nato membership however hinge on the country implementing substantial reforms and overcoming its crippling ethnic tensions .
some 3.1 million voters will be eligible to cast their ballot in the country 's two semi-independent entities .
secession vs. unity campaigning ahead of the vote was dominated by nationalist rhetoric fueling concerns that the troubled balkan country could drift further apart .
milorad dodik , prime minister of the repulika srpska , has in the past gone on record claiming the country 's serbs should have the right to secede .
in the run-up to the election , dodik vowed to preserve the serb entity 's autonomy at the expense of the much needed reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim bosniaks are the largest group in sarajevo bosnian muslims , who make up the largest single group in the country , have dismissed such hardliner talk , warning that riding the nationalist wave could edge the country to the brink of break-up or even a new war .
" we are determined to stop all attacks on our country and our people , " sulejman tihic , head of the muslim party of democratic action said .
" any attempts at secession or the establishment of a third entity will not go through . "
bosnian croat leader dragan covic has based his campaign on calling for a separate croat entity .
since the 1992-95 inter-ethnic war that killed about 100,000 people , bosnia has held five general elections but has lagged in political and economic reforms .
the small country - one of the poorest in europe - remains near the back of the line of balkan countries aspiring to eu and nato membership .

britain too warned of a " high " terror threat in france and germany . the us state department has issued an alert , warning citizens " to the potential for terrorist attacks in europe . "
the department did not specify a country , issuing the updated guidance for the whole of europe .
the alert , published on the state department 's website , said that " current information suggests " al-qaeda and affiliated groups were continuing to plan commando-style attacks , similar to the 2008 atrocities in mumbai .
separately , the british foreign ministry on sunday updated its advice for citizens traveling to france and germany , warning there was a " high threat " of terrorism in the two european countries .
public spaces could be potential targets american citizens have been warned that public places could be potential targets and that they should " take every precaution to be aware of surroundings . "
potential targets could be railways and subways and other tourist places , according to the us state department .
" terrorists have targeted and attacked subway and rail systems , as well as aviation and maritime services , " the alert said .
it comes as media in the past week reported that intelligence agencies in germany , france , the uk and the us foiled an attempted strike on a series of european cities .
as a result the uk has also updated its travel advice for france and germany , warning there was a " high threat " of terrorism .
british home secretary theresa may said on sunday the us advice was " consistent " with london 's own assessment of the threat .
" as we have consistently made clear , we face a real and serious threat from terrorism , " she said .
" we work closely with our international partners in countering terrorism and the us advice is consistent with our assessment , " she said .
the alert – which the state department issues regarding specific events – is one step down from a travel warning .
a total of 31 travel warnings are in effect for various countries including afghanistan , iraq , israel , sudan and somalia .

and the president made good on that pledge in his speech marking german unity day , dw 's volker wagener says . by using his unity day speech to focus on integration , christian wulff has kept his word .
in the 30 minutes of his speech , more was said about integration and migration than about the topic of german reunification today .
nobody expected wulff to talk about the subject today but it was an important focus . for weeks , the topic has been raging in germany , with a polemical war of words over the issue of those who do not integrate into german life .
it 's claimed that these people live here but do not learn the language or recognize the constitution , and depend on state handouts . wulff adressed the problems but did n't go into detail about the extreme positions in the failed integration policies in germany . learning german is compulsory for all immigrants and german law applies to everyone .
' islam also belongs in germany ' wulff 's arguments about islam were much more far-reaching . christianity and judaism have been part of germany 's past and present said wulff .
" but now islam also belongs in germany , " he added .
no german politician has ever said that so clearly and openly .
but the president basically criticized romantic " multicultural " notions of society , saying they had created illusions rather than solving problems .
it 's a slap in the face , especially for those on the political left . germany , wulff said , has long been a country of immigration .
it 's a message however that still has n't reached everyone in germany 's middle-class , conservative circles .
it will be interesting to see whether and how quickly the excerpts of the president 's speech containing practical suggestions will become political reality .
for instance , offering german classes for the entire family . after all , what 's the use if ali speaks german at school in the mornings and turkish at home in the afternoons because his mother only speaks that one language .
or another suggestion involves islam lessons in german schools .
wulff wants those classes to be held in german by german teachers .
wulff managed to skillfully link the day 's issue - german unity - with that of integration , the topic he 's focusing on during his term in office .
he used the motto of the east germans from 1989 : " we are one people " and expanded the slogan .
the meaning must include all people who live in germany today , he said .
the basic law , the german constitution , leaves the president with little room for political power .
but he can harness the power of words , though not frequently . the president 's role includes being a moral authority and influencing the intellectual climate of the country .
that 's why the first big speech by christian wulff was all the more important .
the day of german unity - above all the 20th anniversary - was a guarantee for him and his message to attract the highest possible attention and probably have the deepest impact .
in view of the fierce debate on integration , wulff used the opportunity to help determine the future political direction .

and the president made good on that pledge in his speech marking german unity day , dw 's volker wagener says . by using his unity day speech to focus on integration , christian wulff has kept his word .
in the 30 minutes of his speech , more was said about integration and migration than about the topic of german reunification today .
nobody expected wulff to talk about the subject today but it was an important focus . for weeks , the topic has been raging in germany , with a polemical war of words over the issue of those who do not integrate into german life .
it 's claimed that these people live here but do not learn the language or recognize the constitution , and depend on state handouts . wulff adressed the problems but did n't go into detail about the extreme positions in the failed integration policies in germany . learning german is compulsory for all immigrants and german law applies to everyone .
' islam also belongs in germany ' wulff 's arguments about islam were much more far-reaching . christianity and judaism have been part of germany 's past and present said wulff .
" but now islam also belongs in germany , " he added .
no german politician has ever said that so clearly and openly .
but the president basically criticized romantic " multicultural " notions of society , saying they had created illusions rather than solving problems .
it 's a slap in the face , especially for those on the political left . germany , wulff said , has long been a country of immigration .
it 's a message however that still has n't reached everyone in germany 's middle-class , conservative circles .
it will be interesting to see whether and how quickly the excerpts of the president 's speech containing practical suggestions will become political reality .
for instance , offering german classes for the entire family . after all , what 's the use if ali speaks german at school in the mornings and turkish at home in the afternoons because his mother only speaks that one language .
or another suggestion involves islam lessons in german schools .
wulff wants those classes to be held in german by german teachers .
wulff managed to skillfully link the day 's issue - german unity - with that of integration , the topic he 's focusing on during his term in office .
he used the motto of the east germans from 1989 : " we are one people " and expanded the slogan .
the meaning must include all people who live in germany today , he said .
the basic law , the german constitution , leaves the president with little room for political power .
but he can harness the power of words , though not frequently . the president 's role includes being a moral authority and influencing the intellectual climate of the country .
that 's why the first big speech by christian wulff was all the more important .
the day of german unity - above all the 20th anniversary - was a guarantee for him and his message to attract the highest possible attention and probably have the deepest impact .
in view of the fierce debate on integration , wulff used the opportunity to help determine the future political direction .

british home secretary theresa may said on sunday the us advice was " consistent " with london 's own assessment of the threat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.10.2010 opinion : wulff makes integration centerpiece of unity day speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff stressed islam now has a role in modern germany german president christian wulff has vowed to focus on the hot button issue of integration of immigrants .
and the president made good on that pledge in his speech marking german unity day , dw 's volker wagener says . by using his unity day speech to focus on integration , christian wulff has kept his word .
in the 30 minutes of his speech , more was said about integration and migration than about the topic of german reunification today .
nobody expected wulff to talk about the subject today but it was an important focus . for weeks , the topic has been raging in germany , with a polemical war of words over the issue of those who do not integrate into german life .
it 's claimed that these people live here but do not learn the language or recognize the constitution , and depend on state handouts . wulff adressed the problems but did n't go into detail about the extreme positions in the failed integration policies in germany . learning german is compulsory for all immigrants and german law applies to everyone .
' islam also belongs in germany ' wulff 's arguments about islam were much more far-reaching . christianity and judaism have been part of germany 's past and present said wulff .
" but now islam also belongs in germany , " he added .
no german politician has ever said that so clearly and openly .
but the president basically criticized romantic " multicultural " notions of society , saying they had created illusions rather than solving problems .
it 's a slap in the face , especially for those on the political left . germany , wulff said , has long been a country of immigration .
it 's a message however that still has n't reached everyone in germany 's middle-class , conservative circles .
it will be interesting to see whether and how quickly the excerpts of the president 's speech containing practical suggestions will become political reality .
for instance , offering german classes for the entire family . after all , what 's the use if ali speaks german at school in the mornings and turkish at home in the afternoons because his mother only speaks that one language .
or another suggestion involves islam lessons in german schools .
wulff wants those classes to be held in german by german teachers .
wulff managed to skillfully link the day 's issue - german unity - with that of integration , the topic he 's focusing on during his term in office .
he used the motto of the east germans from 1989 : " we are one people " and expanded the slogan .
the meaning must include all people who live in germany today , he said .
the basic law , the german constitution , leaves the president with little room for political power .
but he can harness the power of words , though not frequently . the president 's role includes being a moral authority and influencing the intellectual climate of the country .
that 's why the first big speech by christian wulff was all the more important .
the day of german unity - above all the 20th anniversary - was a guarantee for him and his message to attract the highest possible attention and probably have the deepest impact .
in view of the fierce debate on integration , wulff used the opportunity to help determine the future political direction .

yet a 10-man stuttgart gave their home fans some late hope with a close-range goal from pavel pogrebniak in the 85th minute .
in a frantic closing phase , cacau thought he had equalized , but the goal was disallowed , while frankfurt 's halil alintop shot wide in front of an open goal .
the match is stuttgart 's sixth loss from seven games .

nationalist parties are expected to do well , threatening to leave bosnia in its current stalemate . voters in bosnia are going to the polls this sunday , october 3 , to choose a new central parliament , tripartite presidency , and two semi-autonomous assemblies in the serb-run republika srpska and moslem-croat federation .
each of the three ethnic groups – muslims , serbs and croats – has representatives in the legislature and the tripartite presidency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serb leader milorad dodik is pushing for more serb autonomy the ethnically divided country is still suffering from the after-effects of the 1992-1995 bosnian war and has been locked in a political stalemate since the last elections in 2006 .
the international community hopes the vote will bring a new leadership to help the country overcome divisions and implement political reform .
yet pollsters have tipped the election will only further cement the ethnic divisions that have hampered the country 's reforms in past years .
both eu and nato membership however hinge on the country implementing substantial reforms and overcoming its crippling ethnic tensions .
some 3.1 million voters will be eligible to cast their ballot in the country 's two semi-independent entities .
secession vs. unity campaigning ahead of the vote was dominated by nationalist rhetoric fueling concerns that the troubled balkan country could drift further apart .
milorad dodik , prime minister of the repulika srpska , has in the past gone on record claiming the country 's serbs should have the right to secede .
in the run-up to the election , dodik vowed to preserve the serb entity 's autonomy at the expense of the much needed reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim bosniaks are the largest group in sarajevo bosnian muslims , who make up the largest single group in the country , have dismissed such hardliner talk , warning that riding the nationalist wave could edge the country to the brink of break-up or even a new war .
" we are determined to stop all attacks on our country and our people , " sulejman tihic , head of the muslim party of democratic action said .
" any attempts at secession or the establishment of a third entity will not go through . "
bosnian croat leader dragan covic has based his campaign on calling for a separate croat entity .
since the 1992-95 inter-ethnic war that killed about 100,000 people , bosnia has held five general elections but has lagged in political and economic reforms .
the small country - one of the poorest in europe - remains near the back of the line of balkan countries aspiring to eu and nato membership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.10.2010 opinion : wulff makes integration centerpiece of unity day speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff stressed islam now has a role in modern germany german president christian wulff has vowed to focus on the hot button issue of integration of immigrants .
and the president made good on that pledge in his speech marking german unity day , dw 's volker wagener says . by using his unity day speech to focus on integration , christian wulff has kept his word .
in the 30 minutes of his speech , more was said about integration and migration than about the topic of german reunification today .
nobody expected wulff to talk about the subject today but it was an important focus . for weeks , the topic has been raging in germany , with a polemical war of words over the issue of those who do not integrate into german life .
it 's claimed that these people live here but do not learn the language or recognize the constitution , and depend on state handouts . wulff adressed the problems but did n't go into detail about the extreme positions in the failed integration policies in germany . learning german is compulsory for all immigrants and german law applies to everyone .
' islam also belongs in germany ' wulff 's arguments about islam were much more far-reaching . christianity and judaism have been part of germany 's past and present said wulff .
" but now islam also belongs in germany , " he added .
no german politician has ever said that so clearly and openly .
but the president basically criticized romantic " multicultural " notions of society , saying they had created illusions rather than solving problems .
it 's a slap in the face , especially for those on the political left . germany , wulff said , has long been a country of immigration .
it 's a message however that still has n't reached everyone in germany 's middle-class , conservative circles .
it will be interesting to see whether and how quickly the excerpts of the president 's speech containing practical suggestions will become political reality .
for instance , offering german classes for the entire family . after all , what 's the use if ali speaks german at school in the mornings and turkish at home in the afternoons because his mother only speaks that one language .
or another suggestion involves islam lessons in german schools .
wulff wants those classes to be held in german by german teachers .
wulff managed to skillfully link the day 's issue - german unity - with that of integration , the topic he 's focusing on during his term in office .
he used the motto of the east germans from 1989 : " we are one people " and expanded the slogan .
the meaning must include all people who live in germany today , he said .
the basic law , the german constitution , leaves the president with little room for political power .
but he can harness the power of words , though not frequently . the president 's role includes being a moral authority and influencing the intellectual climate of the country .
that 's why the first big speech by christian wulff was all the more important .
the day of german unity - above all the 20th anniversary - was a guarantee for him and his message to attract the highest possible attention and probably have the deepest impact .
in view of the fierce debate on integration , wulff used the opportunity to help determine the future political direction .

and the president made good on that pledge in his speech marking german unity day , dw 's volker wagener says . by using his unity day speech to focus on integration , christian wulff has kept his word .
in the 30 minutes of his speech , more was said about integration and migration than about the topic of german reunification today .
nobody expected wulff to talk about the subject today but it was an important focus . for weeks , the topic has been raging in germany , with a polemical war of words over the issue of those who do not integrate into german life .
it 's claimed that these people live here but do not learn the language or recognize the constitution , and depend on state handouts . wulff adressed the problems but did n't go into detail about the extreme positions in the failed integration policies in germany . learning german is compulsory for all immigrants and german law applies to everyone .
' islam also belongs in germany ' wulff 's arguments about islam were much more far-reaching . christianity and judaism have been part of germany 's past and present said wulff .
" but now islam also belongs in germany , " he added .
no german politician has ever said that so clearly and openly .
but the president basically criticized romantic " multicultural " notions of society , saying they had created illusions rather than solving problems .
it 's a slap in the face , especially for those on the political left . germany , wulff said , has long been a country of immigration .
it 's a message however that still has n't reached everyone in germany 's middle-class , conservative circles .
it will be interesting to see whether and how quickly the excerpts of the president 's speech containing practical suggestions will become political reality .
for instance , offering german classes for the entire family . after all , what 's the use if ali speaks german at school in the mornings and turkish at home in the afternoons because his mother only speaks that one language .
or another suggestion involves islam lessons in german schools .
wulff wants those classes to be held in german by german teachers .
wulff managed to skillfully link the day 's issue - german unity - with that of integration , the topic he 's focusing on during his term in office .
he used the motto of the east germans from 1989 : " we are one people " and expanded the slogan .
the meaning must include all people who live in germany today , he said .
the basic law , the german constitution , leaves the president with little room for political power .
but he can harness the power of words , though not frequently . the president 's role includes being a moral authority and influencing the intellectual climate of the country .
that 's why the first big speech by christian wulff was all the more important .
the day of german unity - above all the 20th anniversary - was a guarantee for him and his message to attract the highest possible attention and probably have the deepest impact .
in view of the fierce debate on integration , wulff used the opportunity to help determine the future political direction .

nationalist parties are expected to do well , threatening to leave bosnia in its current stalemate . voters in bosnia are going to the polls this sunday , october 3 , to choose a new central parliament , tripartite presidency , and two semi-autonomous assemblies in the serb-run republika srpska and moslem-croat federation .
each of the three ethnic groups – muslims , serbs and croats – has representatives in the legislature and the tripartite presidency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serb leader milorad dodik is pushing for more serb autonomy the ethnically divided country is still suffering from the after-effects of the 1992-1995 bosnian war and has been locked in a political stalemate since the last elections in 2006 .
the international community hopes the vote will bring a new leadership to help the country overcome divisions and implement political reform .
yet pollsters have tipped the election will only further cement the ethnic divisions that have hampered the country 's reforms in past years .
both eu and nato membership however hinge on the country implementing substantial reforms and overcoming its crippling ethnic tensions .
some 3.1 million voters will be eligible to cast their ballot in the country 's two semi-independent entities .
secession vs. unity campaigning ahead of the vote was dominated by nationalist rhetoric fueling concerns that the troubled balkan country could drift further apart .
milorad dodik , prime minister of the repulika srpska , has in the past gone on record claiming the country 's serbs should have the right to secede .
in the run-up to the election , dodik vowed to preserve the serb entity 's autonomy at the expense of the much needed reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim bosniaks are the largest group in sarajevo bosnian muslims , who make up the largest single group in the country , have dismissed such hardliner talk , warning that riding the nationalist wave could edge the country to the brink of break-up or even a new war .
" we are determined to stop all attacks on our country and our people , " sulejman tihic , head of the muslim party of democratic action said .
" any attempts at secession or the establishment of a third entity will not go through . "
bosnian croat leader dragan covic has based his campaign on calling for a separate croat entity .
since the 1992-95 inter-ethnic war that killed about 100,000 people , bosnia has held five general elections but has lagged in political and economic reforms .
the small country - one of the poorest in europe - remains near the back of the line of balkan countries aspiring to eu and nato membership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.10.2010 opinion : wulff makes integration centerpiece of unity day speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff stressed islam now has a role in modern germany german president christian wulff has vowed to focus on the hot button issue of integration of immigrants .
and the president made good on that pledge in his speech marking german unity day , dw 's volker wagener says . by using his unity day speech to focus on integration , christian wulff has kept his word .
in the 30 minutes of his speech , more was said about integration and migration than about the topic of german reunification today .
nobody expected wulff to talk about the subject today but it was an important focus . for weeks , the topic has been raging in germany , with a polemical war of words over the issue of those who do not integrate into german life .
it 's claimed that these people live here but do not learn the language or recognize the constitution , and depend on state handouts . wulff adressed the problems but did n't go into detail about the extreme positions in the failed integration policies in germany . learning german is compulsory for all immigrants and german law applies to everyone .
' islam also belongs in germany ' wulff 's arguments about islam were much more far-reaching . christianity and judaism have been part of germany 's past and present said wulff .
" but now islam also belongs in germany , " he added .
no german politician has ever said that so clearly and openly .
but the president basically criticized romantic " multicultural " notions of society , saying they had created illusions rather than solving problems .
it 's a slap in the face , especially for those on the political left . germany , wulff said , has long been a country of immigration .
it 's a message however that still has n't reached everyone in germany 's middle-class , conservative circles .
it will be interesting to see whether and how quickly the excerpts of the president 's speech containing practical suggestions will become political reality .
for instance , offering german classes for the entire family . after all , what 's the use if ali speaks german at school in the mornings and turkish at home in the afternoons because his mother only speaks that one language .
or another suggestion involves islam lessons in german schools .
wulff wants those classes to be held in german by german teachers .
wulff managed to skillfully link the day 's issue - german unity - with that of integration , the topic he 's focusing on during his term in office .
he used the motto of the east germans from 1989 : " we are one people " and expanded the slogan .
the meaning must include all people who live in germany today , he said .
the basic law , the german constitution , leaves the president with little room for political power .
but he can harness the power of words , though not frequently . the president 's role includes being a moral authority and influencing the intellectual climate of the country .
that 's why the first big speech by christian wulff was all the more important .
the day of german unity - above all the 20th anniversary - was a guarantee for him and his message to attract the highest possible attention and probably have the deepest impact .
in view of the fierce debate on integration , wulff used the opportunity to help determine the future political direction .
