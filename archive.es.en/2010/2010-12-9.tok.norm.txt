he spoke of men and women " far more deserving of the prize " than him - and he meant people like liu xiaobo .
imprisoned in china , liu received this year 's nobel peace prize after more than two decades of an arduous , non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in china .
obama , on the other hand , received the award for a vision , a change in tone in international relations , and , many argue , in an attempt to settle accounts with his predecessor , george w. bush .
a dissatisfying record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's vision of a world free of nuclear weapons impressed not only the nobel committee while obama has kept his promise of withdrawing combat troops from iraq , he has n't followed through on many of the political projects he received the nobel peace prize for : a new strategic arms reduction treaty with russia , the closing of guantanamo bay detention camp , and a real step forward in meeting the world 's climate challenges .
but who 's to blame ?
did obama lose the moral compass he assigned so much importance to in his nobel speech ?
facing an adverse political climate " obama 's standpoints are better than his record , " marco fey from the peace research institute frankfurt told deutsche welle .
" on a variety of issues , he 's caught in the political climate in the us . "
fey cited the arms reduction treaty ' new start ' as a fitting example .
obama and russian president dmitry medvedev signed the treaty in april 2010 , but it has n't been ratified by the senate so far .
" obama , senior department of state officials , they all support the treaty , " fey said .
" it would be a real milestone in terms of arms control .
but republicans use the most absurd arguments to block it in the senate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the closure of guantanamo bay detention camp remains uncertain political capital is scarce obama 's decision to close down the detention camp at guantanamo bay has met fierce congressional opposition as well . but critics argue that obama has n't really invested his political capital in the measure compared to other projects he pushed through congress - such as health care reform .
the recent conviction of canadian citizen omar ahmed khadr who was brought to guantanamo 's military prison at the age of 16 , exemplifies obama 's lack of self-assertion in putting an end to the facility and its practice .
" who would have thought that , under obama , someone who 's accused of a crime committed at the age of 15 would be tried before a military commission at guantanamo ? "
reed brody from human rights watch told deutsche welle .
promoting human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is this year 's recipient of the nobel peace prize indeed , obama promised to be a persistent advocate of human rights at home and abroad . he has frequently underscored the significance of peaceful activists like liu xiaobo - the first chinese recipient of the award .
liu was an influential participant of the tiananmen protests in 1989 and is a leading author of charta 08 , a manifesto promoting fundamental human rights and democratization in china .
in december 2009 , after a series of earlier internments , he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for " inciting subversion of state power . "
obama and other heads of state have called on the chinese government to release liu .
however , critics argue that obama has failed to make human rights a guiding principle of us relations with other countries - highlighted and , some say , undermined by obama 's recent efforts to expand chinese-american cooperation .
" it 's not helpful when the government repeatedly describes human rights and democracy as issues on which the us and china will inevitably disagree , " brody said . a vision 's prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , al gore gave his nobel speech at oslo 's city hall whether attributed to obama 's political environment or his setting of priorities , the gap between obama 's vision and his actual achievements remains a fact .
yet , obama is sticking to his optimistic rhetoric and continues to set visionary goals , for example , regarding the middle east peace process .
" he 's set the goal of reaching a peace accord within a year , " said fey .
" that 's a very ambitious undertaking . "
as the clash of idealistic expectations and political pragmatism continues to haunt obama 's presidency , one is reminded of what al gore said during his nobel speech in 2007 : " we have everything we need to get started , save perhaps political will , but political will is a renewable resource . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 09.12.2010 hydropower dams threaten livelihoods of cambodia 's poor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cambodia depends on fishing for much of its daily protein as plans to build hydropower dams on the mekong river gather pace , there are warnings that their construction could damage fish stocks , on which millions of cambodia ’ s most vulnerable people rely for protein . on thursday , laos officially inaugurated its latest hydropower dam on a tributary of the mekong , one of the world ’ s longest rivers .
the mekong rises in the tibetan plateau and runs almost 5,000 kilometres through six countries – including laos and cambodia – before it meets the sea in vietnam .
need for more energy countries like laos and cambodia need electricity for their own purposes and to export to their energy-hungry neighbors .
the mekong and its tributaries offer a logical solution – why not dam the river , and push the water through turbines to generate power ?
it is a question that has grown more urgent in recent years .
in another five years , there will be 47 dams on the tributaries of the mekong .
around a dozen more are planned for the mainstream .
but campaigners say blocking the mekong will severely damage fish migration , and cripple fish catches .
that is important because millions in the region rely on this free resource for nutrition and food security .
freshwater fish provide up to 80 percent of the protein eaten by cambodians , and at least one-third of fish in this river are migratory species .
hazards of development a recent projection highlighted the risks if a proposed 11 dams are built on the mainstream of the mekong river – two of them in cambodia .
that would add to 77 dams that are already built or planned for tributaries of the mekong over the next two decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cambodian boy stretches to hoist his makeshift fishing net out of the mekong river dr eric baran is the senior research scientist at the phnom penh office of worldfish , an international research body .
he believes that the consequences of this construction in terms of fish production would be a loss , and this loss is due to the impact on the migratory fish .
" we calculated that the loss of fish by 2030 , if the 11 mainstream dams are built , would amount to between 600,000 tons and 900,000 tons every year .
we ’ re talking about a gigantic number that could have a huge impact on food security in the region , in particular in cambodia and laos . "
cambodia would lose over 200,000 tons of fish – more than half its annual catch .
millions of cambodians live on the cusp of poverty and rely on the bounty of the river to survive .
the mekong river commission – or mrc – is an intergovernmental body set up 15 years ago by cambodia , thailand , laos and vietnam to promote cooperation over the river .
china and myanmar are also involved in the mrc .
a recent report from the mrc recommended that any decisions on whether to build dams on the mainstream mekong be deferred for a decade , since building them would be irreversible , and their impact would be substantial .
it warned cambodia would likely suffer more than any other country from the proposed dams .
the next step is for the politicians to sit down and work out a way forward .
earlier this week cambodia ’ s agriculture and fisheries minister admitted that damming the mekong could interrupt fish migrations .

but some are also unhappy with the decision . not many among the 1.3 billion chinese had heard the name of liu xiaobo before october .
but thanks to an official media campaign against the 54-year old activist , he is now better known than ever .
chinese media campaign against liu the chinese media have reported that liu is being awarded the nobel prize because he has tried to sabotage the " peaceful rise of china " for years .
he has been compared to the dalai lama who got the prize in 1989 and is regarded as a separatist by beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is regarded as a separatist by the chinese government according to chinese media reports , liu xiaobo has been used by western countries as a political tool in order to weaken china and throw the country into chaos .
the nobel peace prize was described as an award to liu for committing treason .
does china need 300 years of colonialism ?
the chinese media have been trying to discredit liu xiaobo in many ways .
for example , they published quotes of liu saying that china would need at least 300 years of colonialism in order to develop properly .
but those lines were quoted out of context , says jin zhong , a journalist based in hong kong .
he is the publisher and editor-in-chief of the liberal magazine " kaifang " – or " open " .
when liu visited hong kong for the first time in 1988 , he was impressed by the freedom and wealth of the then british colony , remembers jin .
when jin asked liu how china should develop in the future , liu answered somewhat ironically : " china needs at least 300 years of colonialism , if hong kong has needed 100 years for this kind of freedom and prosperity . "
debate within the chinese internet community " of course he was exaggerating , " recalls jin , " liu has been a strong supporter of western-style democracy and freedom . "
still , liu 's quote has been widely discussed within the chinese internet community .
patriotic users are upset , whereas their critics wonder why the chinese cadres are sending their offspring abroad to study in western countries , if they are so negative about the west .
honoring china 's democrats most chinese liberal thinkers welcome the nobel peace prize for liu .
they say that it is not only an award for liu ’ s commitment to more democracy in china , it is in fact honoring the whole chinese democracy movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is a co-initiator of the charter ' 08 " there is no better candidate for this prize , " says qian yuejun , a chinese dissident based in germany , " he was the only choice within the chinese pro-democracy movement who really deserves the award . "
in 2008 , liu xiaobo was one of the initiators of the so-called charter ' 08 – a manifesto demanding more democracy and freedom within china .
two days before it was published , liu was arrested and later sentenced to eleven years in prison on subversion charges .
" as co-initiator , liu has gathered over ten thousand supporters for the charter ' 08 within a short period .
no one else within the divided pro-democracy movement can be as convincing as liu .
he is the only one who can mobilize so many people , " explains qian .
divided movement but among the critics of the communist regime , there are also voices against liu xiaobo .
in their eyes , he is too ready to compromise .
" for an intellectual , liu ’ s thinking is very problematic .
he has studied marxist ideology during his time in university , " argues zhong weiguang , another chinese dissident living in germany .
" he embodies the communist ideology .
that is why he doesn ’ t deserve the nobel peace prize . "

he spoke of men and women " far more deserving of the prize " than him - and he meant people like liu xiaobo .
imprisoned in china , liu received this year 's nobel peace prize after more than two decades of an arduous , non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in china .
obama , on the other hand , received the award for a vision , a change in tone in international relations , and , many argue , in an attempt to settle accounts with his predecessor , george w. bush .
a dissatisfying record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's vision of a world free of nuclear weapons impressed not only the nobel committee while obama has kept his promise of withdrawing combat troops from iraq , he has n't followed through on many of the political projects he received the nobel peace prize for : a new strategic arms reduction treaty with russia , the closing of guantanamo bay detention camp , and a real step forward in meeting the world 's climate challenges .
but who 's to blame ?
did obama lose the moral compass he assigned so much importance to in his nobel speech ?
facing an adverse political climate " obama 's standpoints are better than his record , " marco fey from the peace research institute frankfurt told deutsche welle .
" on a variety of issues , he 's caught in the political climate in the us . "
fey cited the arms reduction treaty ' new start ' as a fitting example .
obama and russian president dmitry medvedev signed the treaty in april 2010 , but it has n't been ratified by the senate so far .
" obama , senior department of state officials , they all support the treaty , " fey said .
" it would be a real milestone in terms of arms control .
but republicans use the most absurd arguments to block it in the senate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the closure of guantanamo bay detention camp remains uncertain political capital is scarce obama 's decision to close down the detention camp at guantanamo bay has met fierce congressional opposition as well . but critics argue that obama has n't really invested his political capital in the measure compared to other projects he pushed through congress - such as health care reform .
the recent conviction of canadian citizen omar ahmed khadr who was brought to guantanamo 's military prison at the age of 16 , exemplifies obama 's lack of self-assertion in putting an end to the facility and its practice .
" who would have thought that , under obama , someone who 's accused of a crime committed at the age of 15 would be tried before a military commission at guantanamo ? "
reed brody from human rights watch told deutsche welle .
promoting human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is this year 's recipient of the nobel peace prize indeed , obama promised to be a persistent advocate of human rights at home and abroad . he has frequently underscored the significance of peaceful activists like liu xiaobo - the first chinese recipient of the award .
liu was an influential participant of the tiananmen protests in 1989 and is a leading author of charta 08 , a manifesto promoting fundamental human rights and democratization in china .
in december 2009 , after a series of earlier internments , he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for " inciting subversion of state power . "
obama and other heads of state have called on the chinese government to release liu .
however , critics argue that obama has failed to make human rights a guiding principle of us relations with other countries - highlighted and , some say , undermined by obama 's recent efforts to expand chinese-american cooperation .
" it 's not helpful when the government repeatedly describes human rights and democracy as issues on which the us and china will inevitably disagree , " brody said . a vision 's prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , al gore gave his nobel speech at oslo 's city hall whether attributed to obama 's political environment or his setting of priorities , the gap between obama 's vision and his actual achievements remains a fact .
yet , obama is sticking to his optimistic rhetoric and continues to set visionary goals , for example , regarding the middle east peace process .
" he 's set the goal of reaching a peace accord within a year , " said fey .
" that 's a very ambitious undertaking . "
as the clash of idealistic expectations and political pragmatism continues to haunt obama 's presidency , one is reminded of what al gore said during his nobel speech in 2007 : " we have everything we need to get started , save perhaps political will , but political will is a renewable resource . "

deutsche welle caught up with him at the un climate summit . on december 6 , the swedish parliament awarded nnimmo bassey the so-called " alternative nobel prize " in recognition of his inspired work to strengthen the environmental movement in his home country of nigeria and throughout africa .
as executive director of environmental rights action in nigeria and chair of friends of the earth international , bassey has become one of africa 's leading advocates for environmental protection and human rights .
he has been particularly influential in mobilizing resistance to multinational oil corporations in his country , drawing attention to the environmental devastation they leave behind and their disregard for the rights of the local population .
after receiving his award in stockholm , bassey traveled to cancun , mexico , where deutsche welle interviewed him on the sidelines of the un climate summit .
deutsche welle : how did you feel when you got the prize ?
nnimmo bassey : when i stood on the platform to receive the reward my mind went to many , many things .
and particularly to a fellow nigerian who won the award in 1994 – the late ken saro wiwa , our number one environmentalist and defender of the environment who was executed in 1995 .
he won the award in 1994 .
and when i stood up there , i knew i was standing on the shoulders of a great man who showed me how to fight for environmental justice and how to resist big corporations who are bent not only on destroying nigeria , but on destroying the climate - destroying the climate of the world by pollution and by release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
are you afraid of facing the same fate as ken saro wiwa ?
no , i am not .
i work with the people , i stand with the people , i am running with the people and there is no option !
you know working with people resisting destructive extraction , working with communities and mass movements who are defending the planet is not an option for me .
and so i look at the people , and i join the people , and i know that we are on the right path .
there is no time for fear .
looking at the negotiations here in cancun , do you feel they are focused on the things that really matter , for example oil extraction , destruction of the environment and climate change ? i think the negotiations to a large extent are not focusing on the real issues .
climate change is caused by very fundamental structural , systemic problems .
one of which is the crisis driven by the market .
all the negotiators talk about is how to use the market to soften global warming - carbon offsetting by planting a tree somewhere in africa while you keep polluting in europe .
this is not a solution , because pollution emissions have to stop at the source .
and they are not talking about lifestyle changes ; they are not talking about less consumption and less of production .
now we have big everything : big oil , big water , big fish ; and everything is coming to an end .
and we would expect our negotiators to look at this problem , the problem of overconsumption and overproduction .
we do n't have more than one planet and we can not go on at the speed and the rate and the direction that we are going now .
we can not keep pushing on with fossil-fuel driven civilization .
we have gone beyond half of the known reserves in the world and we 've done this in only a couple of years , maybe 100 years or so .
how are we going to run on a half tank until eternity ?
you see , it is impossible .
so our leaders are here to talk about how to get money , how not to make commitments or reduce emissions and other , poorer countries are looking at how they can get funding from mitigation .
when temperatures increase due to non-binding targets , at five degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels , no amount of money for mitigation , no amount of money for whatever you do is going to suffice .
we will not know life as it is any more .

norbert roettgen called on states to follow germany 's lead and launch a " rethink " on climate change .
" in business , politics and society , we no longer see climate change as a threat , but an opportunity and a challenge , " said roettgen in a speech to delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment minister said a multilateral approach is needed in cancun he said that germany had invested in tackling climate change and as a result it had created jobs and opportunities .
rich vs poor countries major deadlocks have emerged at cancun between rich and developing nations , largely over how to lower greenhouse-gas emissions .
despite wide agreement on issues such as tackling deforestation , adaptation , technology and climate financing , there is little compromise on either side over limiting co2 emissions that cause climate change .
the european union and the united states want more scrutiny of emerging powers ' actions on climate change and anchoring voluntary emission pledges into the wider un process .
eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard said there had been " no sign of progress on the crunch issues . "
meanwhile developing nations put the onus on industrial powers to back an extension of the kyoto protocol , a treaty limiting the gas emissions of wealthy countries that is set to expire in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu climate commissioner hedegaard said little progress has been made the us never ratified kyoto and china was exempted – and now japan is leading a bloc of countries that refuse to back a new treaty without the world 's two largest polluters .
deadline looms the talks end on friday and roettgen told reporters it was now a " difficult point " as the deadline draws close .
however , mexico 's foreign minister , who is chairing the talks said a comprehensive deal among the 190 countries was " within reach . "
" we need to work together in finding the balance that will make cancun a success , " patricia espinosa said .
her comments were echoed by the eu climate commissioner .
" to come out of cancun with nothing is simply not an option , " hedegaard said .

rights group amnesty international , which organized the demonstration , attempted to use the event to hand over a petition signed by some 100,000 people in support of liu .
however , the gates to the embassy remained locked and all windows were shuttered , leading to the protestors piling up the signed petitions outside the building perimeter .
" the chinese government should be celebrating this global recognition of a chinese writer and activist , " said ai secretary general salil shetty . " instead , the government 's very public tantrum has generated even more critical attention inside and outside china , and , ironically , emphasized the significance of liu xiaobo 's message of respect for human rights , " shetty said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang says most nations will boycott the ceremony amnesty and the nobel institute have meanwhile accused beijing of pressuring chinese nationals living in oslo to join counter-protests against liu .
the 54-year-old writer , human rights activist and critic of one-party rule in china was jailed in december 2009 for 11 years on subversion charges after co-authoring a petition calling for a multi-party system in china .
he was awarded the 2010 nobel peace prize for his long non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in the communist state .
however , the move greatly angered china , which saw it as an attempt to meddle in its internal affairs .
pressure on china ' can not succeed ' beijing has gone to great lengths in recent weeks to push for a boycott of the nobel ceremony in oslo , claiming that most of the world was opposed to the nobel committee 's decision to honor liu .
so far , some 20 states , including russia , cuba and venezuela , and most of which have strong commercial ties with beijing , have followed china in shunning the event .
" those people at the nobel committee have to admit they are in the minority .
the chinese people and the overwhelming majority of countries and people in the world oppose what they do , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said .
" any attempt to exert pressure on china ... can not succeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu 's continued detention sparked protests around the world world behind nobel award but the head of the nobel committee , thorbjoern jagland , said thursday that some two-thirds of nations invited to the ceremony were expected to attend , and that the choice of liu as this year 's peace laureate was not a move " against " beijing .
" this is not a prize against china .
this is a prize honoring people in china , " jagland told a press conference traditionally held by the laureate on the day before the prize ceremony .
jagland insisted however it was important to push for political reforms and an opening of civil society to parallel china 's massive economic development .
" to a large extent the future of the world is in the hands of this big country , " he said .
speaking of the empty chair that will represent the absent dissident , jagland said " it is a very strong symbol -lrb- that -rrb- shows how appropriate this prize was . "

the 54-year-old writer , human rights activist and critic of one-party rule in china was jailed in december 2009 for 11 years on subversion charges after co-authoring a petition calling for a multi-party system in china .
he was awarded the 2010 nobel peace prize for his long non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in the communist state .
however , the move greatly angered china , which saw it as an attempt to meddle in its internal affairs .
pressure on china ' can not succeed ' beijing has gone to great lengths in recent weeks to push for a boycott of the nobel ceremony in oslo , claiming that most of the world was opposed to the nobel committee 's decision to honor liu .
so far , some 20 states , including russia , cuba and venezuela , and most of which have strong commercial ties with beijing , have followed china in shunning the event .
" those people at the nobel committee have to admit they are in the minority .
the chinese people and the overwhelming majority of countries and people in the world oppose what they do , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said .
" any attempt to exert pressure on china ... can not succeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu 's continued detention sparked protests around the world world behind nobel award but the head of the nobel committee , thorbjoern jagland , said thursday that some two-thirds of nations invited to the ceremony were expected to attend , and that the choice of liu as this year 's peace laureate was not a move " against " beijing .
" this is not a prize against china .
this is a prize honoring people in china , " jagland told a press conference traditionally held by the laureate on the day before the prize ceremony .
jagland insisted however it was important to push for political reforms and an opening of civil society to parallel china 's massive economic development .
" to a large extent the future of the world is in the hands of this big country , " he said .
speaking of the empty chair that will represent the absent dissident , jagland said " it is a very strong symbol -lrb- that -rrb- shows how appropriate this prize was . "

a two-time dw best of the blogs jury member , his family put up $ 1.5 million worth of bail for his freedom . iranian-canadian blogger hossein derakhshan was temporarily released from a tehran prison , after having been incarcerated for 26 months , according to a report thursday on mashregh news , a conservative iranian news website . the site was among the first to report derakhshan 's conviction at the end of september on charges of " conspiring with hostile governments , disseminating anti-islamic propaganda , disseminating anti-revolutionary propaganda , blasphemy , and operating and managing obscene pornography websites . " the account was confirmed by a source close to the derakhshan family , who wished to remain anonymous and said derakhshan was " happy to be out , " adding " we have been pushing for this for months , especially after his trial , but it has always been refused . " the same source also told deutsche welle that derakhshan " will be out for a couple of days only , " and that the family had put up a bail with a value of $ 1.5 million -lrb- 1.3 million euros -rrb- to ensure derakhshan returns to prison when demanded by authorities . iranian ' blogfather ' began writing online in 2001 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoder , as he became known , began blogging in persian and english in 2001 derakhshan became well-known beginning in 2001 , primarily for having published a persian-language guide to blogging .

" in 2005 and 2006 , he served as a jury member in deutsche welle 's blog awards , also known as the bobs . initially , derakhshan , who was also known by his online moniker hoder , spoke out against the iranian government on his blog .
in january 2006 , he took a highly publicized trip to israel , traveling on his canadian passport , as it is normally forbidden for iranians to travel to israel . several months later his political views shifted , and he became a staunch iranian nationalist in the face of perceived opposition and heated rhetoric from the united states , saying that he supported iran 's right to nuclear weapons . on his persian blog especially , he lashed out at other iranians - many of whom had previously been his friends , peers and colleagues .
mehdi khaliji , an iranian working for a conservative washington , d.c. think tank , even filed a libel suit against derakhshan in 2007 for statements written on derakhshan 's blog . in the autumn of 2008 , derakhshan returned to iran after having lived for many years in canada , france and the united kingdom .
he was arrested on november 1 , 2008 . after a short trial in tehran this summer , derakhshan was sentenced in late september to serve 19.5 years in prison , and was banned for five years from joining any iranian political party .
he was also ordered to pay fines of 30,750 euros , $ 2,900 and 200 british pounds . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle caught up with him at the un climate summit . on december 6 , the swedish parliament awarded nnimmo bassey the so-called " alternative nobel prize " in recognition of his inspired work to strengthen the environmental movement in his home country of nigeria and throughout africa .
as executive director of environmental rights action in nigeria and chair of friends of the earth international , bassey has become one of africa 's leading advocates for environmental protection and human rights .
he has been particularly influential in mobilizing resistance to multinational oil corporations in his country , drawing attention to the environmental devastation they leave behind and their disregard for the rights of the local population .
after receiving his award in stockholm , bassey traveled to cancun , mexico , where deutsche welle interviewed him on the sidelines of the un climate summit .
deutsche welle : how did you feel when you got the prize ?
nnimmo bassey : when i stood on the platform to receive the reward my mind went to many , many things .
and particularly to a fellow nigerian who won the award in 1994 – the late ken saro wiwa , our number one environmentalist and defender of the environment who was executed in 1995 .
he won the award in 1994 .
and when i stood up there , i knew i was standing on the shoulders of a great man who showed me how to fight for environmental justice and how to resist big corporations who are bent not only on destroying nigeria , but on destroying the climate - destroying the climate of the world by pollution and by release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
are you afraid of facing the same fate as ken saro wiwa ?
no , i am not .
i work with the people , i stand with the people , i am running with the people and there is no option !
you know working with people resisting destructive extraction , working with communities and mass movements who are defending the planet is not an option for me .
and so i look at the people , and i join the people , and i know that we are on the right path .
there is no time for fear .
looking at the negotiations here in cancun , do you feel they are focused on the things that really matter , for example oil extraction , destruction of the environment and climate change ? i think the negotiations to a large extent are not focusing on the real issues .
climate change is caused by very fundamental structural , systemic problems .
one of which is the crisis driven by the market .
all the negotiators talk about is how to use the market to soften global warming - carbon offsetting by planting a tree somewhere in africa while you keep polluting in europe .
this is not a solution , because pollution emissions have to stop at the source .
and they are not talking about lifestyle changes ; they are not talking about less consumption and less of production .
now we have big everything : big oil , big water , big fish ; and everything is coming to an end .
and we would expect our negotiators to look at this problem , the problem of overconsumption and overproduction .
we do n't have more than one planet and we can not go on at the speed and the rate and the direction that we are going now .
we can not keep pushing on with fossil-fuel driven civilization .
we have gone beyond half of the known reserves in the world and we 've done this in only a couple of years , maybe 100 years or so .
how are we going to run on a half tank until eternity ?
you see , it is impossible .
so our leaders are here to talk about how to get money , how not to make commitments or reduce emissions and other , poorer countries are looking at how they can get funding from mitigation .
when temperatures increase due to non-binding targets , at five degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels , no amount of money for mitigation , no amount of money for whatever you do is going to suffice .
we will not know life as it is any more .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang says most nations will boycott the ceremony amnesty and the nobel institute have meanwhile accused beijing of pressuring chinese nationals living in oslo to join counter-protests against liu .
the 54-year-old writer , human rights activist and critic of one-party rule in china was jailed in december 2009 for 11 years on subversion charges after co-authoring a petition calling for a multi-party system in china .
he was awarded the 2010 nobel peace prize for his long non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in the communist state .
however , the move greatly angered china , which saw it as an attempt to meddle in its internal affairs .
pressure on china ' can not succeed ' beijing has gone to great lengths in recent weeks to push for a boycott of the nobel ceremony in oslo , claiming that most of the world was opposed to the nobel committee 's decision to honor liu .
so far , some 20 states , including russia , cuba and venezuela , and most of which have strong commercial ties with beijing , have followed china in shunning the event .
" those people at the nobel committee have to admit they are in the minority .
the chinese people and the overwhelming majority of countries and people in the world oppose what they do , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said .
" any attempt to exert pressure on china ... can not succeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu 's continued detention sparked protests around the world world behind nobel award but the head of the nobel committee , thorbjoern jagland , said thursday that some two-thirds of nations invited to the ceremony were expected to attend , and that the choice of liu as this year 's peace laureate was not a move " against " beijing .
" this is not a prize against china .
this is a prize honoring people in china , " jagland told a press conference traditionally held by the laureate on the day before the prize ceremony .
jagland insisted however it was important to push for political reforms and an opening of civil society to parallel china 's massive economic development .
" to a large extent the future of the world is in the hands of this big country , " he said .
speaking of the empty chair that will represent the absent dissident , jagland said " it is a very strong symbol -lrb- that -rrb- shows how appropriate this prize was . "

he spoke of men and women " far more deserving of the prize " than him - and he meant people like liu xiaobo .
imprisoned in china , liu received this year 's nobel peace prize after more than two decades of an arduous , non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in china .
obama , on the other hand , received the award for a vision , a change in tone in international relations , and , many argue , in an attempt to settle accounts with his predecessor , george w. bush .
a dissatisfying record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's vision of a world free of nuclear weapons impressed not only the nobel committee while obama has kept his promise of withdrawing combat troops from iraq , he has n't followed through on many of the political projects he received the nobel peace prize for : a new strategic arms reduction treaty with russia , the closing of guantanamo bay detention camp , and a real step forward in meeting the world 's climate challenges .
but who 's to blame ?
did obama lose the moral compass he assigned so much importance to in his nobel speech ?
facing an adverse political climate " obama 's standpoints are better than his record , " marco fey from the peace research institute frankfurt told deutsche welle .
" on a variety of issues , he 's caught in the political climate in the us . "
fey cited the arms reduction treaty ' new start ' as a fitting example .
obama and russian president dmitry medvedev signed the treaty in april 2010 , but it has n't been ratified by the senate so far .
" obama , senior department of state officials , they all support the treaty , " fey said .
" it would be a real milestone in terms of arms control .
but republicans use the most absurd arguments to block it in the senate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the closure of guantanamo bay detention camp remains uncertain political capital is scarce obama 's decision to close down the detention camp at guantanamo bay has met fierce congressional opposition as well . but critics argue that obama has n't really invested his political capital in the measure compared to other projects he pushed through congress - such as health care reform .
the recent conviction of canadian citizen omar ahmed khadr who was brought to guantanamo 's military prison at the age of 16 , exemplifies obama 's lack of self-assertion in putting an end to the facility and its practice .
" who would have thought that , under obama , someone who 's accused of a crime committed at the age of 15 would be tried before a military commission at guantanamo ? "
reed brody from human rights watch told deutsche welle .
promoting human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is this year 's recipient of the nobel peace prize indeed , obama promised to be a persistent advocate of human rights at home and abroad . he has frequently underscored the significance of peaceful activists like liu xiaobo - the first chinese recipient of the award .
liu was an influential participant of the tiananmen protests in 1989 and is a leading author of charta 08 , a manifesto promoting fundamental human rights and democratization in china .
in december 2009 , after a series of earlier internments , he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for " inciting subversion of state power . "
obama and other heads of state have called on the chinese government to release liu .
however , critics argue that obama has failed to make human rights a guiding principle of us relations with other countries - highlighted and , some say , undermined by obama 's recent efforts to expand chinese-american cooperation .
" it 's not helpful when the government repeatedly describes human rights and democracy as issues on which the us and china will inevitably disagree , " brody said . a vision 's prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , al gore gave his nobel speech at oslo 's city hall whether attributed to obama 's political environment or his setting of priorities , the gap between obama 's vision and his actual achievements remains a fact .
yet , obama is sticking to his optimistic rhetoric and continues to set visionary goals , for example , regarding the middle east peace process .
" he 's set the goal of reaching a peace accord within a year , " said fey .
" that 's a very ambitious undertaking . "
as the clash of idealistic expectations and political pragmatism continues to haunt obama 's presidency , one is reminded of what al gore said during his nobel speech in 2007 : " we have everything we need to get started , save perhaps political will , but political will is a renewable resource . "

koenig stressed to german deputy national security advisor rolf nikel the potential negative implications for bilateral relations between germany and the us , in particular counter-terrorism cooperation , if steps were taken to " seek the arrest or extradition of us citizens / officials , " the documents said .
thirteen operatives , believed to be cia , were eventually charged in indictments in munich and spain , as investigators concluded that the plane that transported masri passed through spanish territory .

rights group amnesty international , which organized the demonstration , attempted to use the event to hand over a petition signed by some 100,000 people in support of liu .
however , the gates to the embassy remained locked and all windows were shuttered , leading to the protestors piling up the signed petitions outside the building perimeter .
" the chinese government should be celebrating this global recognition of a chinese writer and activist , " said ai secretary general salil shetty . " instead , the government 's very public tantrum has generated even more critical attention inside and outside china , and , ironically , emphasized the significance of liu xiaobo 's message of respect for human rights , " shetty said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang says most nations will boycott the ceremony amnesty and the nobel institute have meanwhile accused beijing of pressuring chinese nationals living in oslo to join counter-protests against liu .
the 54-year-old writer , human rights activist and critic of one-party rule in china was jailed in december 2009 for 11 years on subversion charges after co-authoring a petition calling for a multi-party system in china .
he was awarded the 2010 nobel peace prize for his long non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in the communist state .
however , the move greatly angered china , which saw it as an attempt to meddle in its internal affairs .
pressure on china ' can not succeed ' beijing has gone to great lengths in recent weeks to push for a boycott of the nobel ceremony in oslo , claiming that most of the world was opposed to the nobel committee 's decision to honor liu .
so far , some 20 states , including russia , cuba and venezuela , and most of which have strong commercial ties with beijing , have followed china in shunning the event .
" those people at the nobel committee have to admit they are in the minority .
the chinese people and the overwhelming majority of countries and people in the world oppose what they do , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said .
" any attempt to exert pressure on china ... can not succeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu 's continued detention sparked protests around the world world behind nobel award but the head of the nobel committee , thorbjoern jagland , said thursday that some two-thirds of nations invited to the ceremony were expected to attend , and that the choice of liu as this year 's peace laureate was not a move " against " beijing .
" this is not a prize against china .
this is a prize honoring people in china , " jagland told a press conference traditionally held by the laureate on the day before the prize ceremony .
jagland insisted however it was important to push for political reforms and an opening of civil society to parallel china 's massive economic development .
" to a large extent the future of the world is in the hands of this big country , " he said .
speaking of the empty chair that will represent the absent dissident , jagland said " it is a very strong symbol -lrb- that -rrb- shows how appropriate this prize was . "

and with climate change proceeding at the current speed , experts are prepared for worse to come . with the un climate summit underway in cancun , politicians and health experts have met in bonn , germany , to discuss the risks posed to human health by the increasing number of extreme weather events , and ways of helping the population to prepare , adapt – and stay healthy . " it 's not just about people dying from drowning or accidents during the floods , " said juergen becker , secretary of state in bonn ’ s environment ministry .
" we also have to look at measures to tackle water pollution afterwards or problems resulting from mould growing inside affected buildings . " becker cites the heat waves in europe during 2003 and 2006 as examples .
he stresses that even in a wealthy industrialized country like germany , with its good medical infrastructure , there were an estimated 7,000 deaths from heart attacks and heat-related illnesses during the 2003 heat wave - one of the most extreme summer events ever recorded in europe .
the environment expert is also worried about increased flooding in germany in future . over the past 20 years , more than 650,000 people have died in around 14,000 extreme weather events - like storms , floods and heat waves - according to the latest climate risk index published by germanwatch in cancun .

the increase in the number of extreme weather events is quite clearly related to the changing climate , says paul becker , deputy director of germany ’ s meteorological office , the dwd .
it is not only the average temperature that is on the rise , both globally and regionally , says the weather expert . " the extremes are on the rise .
that means hot days for instance .
and clearly , an increase in the number of hot days and also warm nights , which we refer to as tropical , when the temperature does not sink below 20 degrees celsius – obviously have an effect on the human body , " said becker . the world health organization is highly concerned about both the direct and the indirect effects of climate change on health .
srdan matic , a health and environment expert with who europe , says as many as 70,000 people are estimated to have died in europe as a whole during the heat wave of 2003 .
the elderly , children and the homeless are the most vulnerable . matic also cites this summer ’ s heat wave in russia as an example of the type of extreme weather event which results in a high number of deaths and casualties .
initial estimates put the number of extra deaths attributable to the heat wave at between 10 and 20,000 in just two weeks , he says . the problem was compounded by the fires across russia .
in addition to the direct effects , the air pollution caused by smoke also represented a major health hazard .
if the wind had been blowing in a different direction , matic says , other european countries would also have had to deal with the health problems caused by air pollution . other long-term effects in regions where the climate becomes warmer will be water shortages and drought , which clearly have an impact on people 's health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiger mosquitos are finding a new home in a warmer europe the experts are also concerned about invasive species of plants and animals bringing health problems to areas where they were not prevalent before .
meteorologist paul becker mentions allergies and other problems caused by new types of pollen .
the pollen season can also be lengthened by changes in the climate . the arrival of insects previously native in tropical areas is presenting the health experts with another “ headache ” .
the tiger mosquito which spreads dengue fever , for instance , has already moved into european countries like italy , france , spain and switzerland . " learn to live with it " our societies have to adapt to changing climatic conditions , says becker , to protect the population from health problems .
reliable forecasts , early warning systems and good communication are essential elements . in the case of an extreme heat wave , for instance , he says germany already has an early warning system , which makes sure the public is informed about the risks so that , for instance , homes for the elderly can adjust the diet of residents and shift them to cooler accommodation .
flood protection measures are another example he cites , where measures are already being implemented to adapt to climate change . ultimately , says srdan matic from the who , we have got to get used to extreme weather events .
the health services will have to be ready to treat an increasing number of people with asthma attacks or to provide emergency care for people suffering from dehydration during a heat wave , he suggests . but we have to think further than that , says the health expert .

koenig stressed to german deputy national security advisor rolf nikel the potential negative implications for bilateral relations between germany and the us , in particular counter-terrorism cooperation , if steps were taken to " seek the arrest or extradition of us citizens / officials , " the documents said .
thirteen operatives , believed to be cia , were eventually charged in indictments in munich and spain , as investigators concluded that the plane that transported masri passed through spanish territory .

nasa also agrees to make germany an associate partner in its lunar science institute in california . in an agreement signed in washington , d.c. on wednesday , the german space agency , better known by its german acronym dlr , and its american counterpart , nasa , agreed to cooperate more fully on joint operations , planetary observations , and other forms of space science .
the move comes just a week after the german government outlined its new space strategy , where it said germany would expand public investments in space science from its current 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- annually to 1.4 billion euros by 2014 .
that policy also underscored increased collaboration with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , where germany is currently the second-largest funder nation after france .
" many space missions and projects can only be carried out through international cooperation , with nasa for example , because of their complexity and the associated costs , " said johann-dietrich worner , dlr 's chairman , in a statement posted to the dlr 's website .
" this is why dlr , as germany 's national space agency and research center , is endeavoring to set up bilateral collaborations such as this , in addition to its other commitments . "
his american counterpart was equally positive on the new agreement .
" nasa has a long history of successful cooperation with the government of germany and an outstanding relationship with dlr , " said charles bolden , nasa 's administrator , in a statement posted to nasa 's website .
" today 's signing will further enhance our ability to work closely together in a variety of mutually beneficial activities in virtually every nasa mission area . "

germany 's new policy also abandons the moon as a solo national goal , but plans on continuing further study as part of european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , and now nasa , projects .
almost four years ago , german government officials had previously announced plans for a 2013 moon flight , and in 2009 , another government official called for an unmanned moon mission in 2015 .
" the moon is for us , the most important goal for the next 20 years , " said hubert reile , aerospace director of the dlr , in an interview with the german press agency , dpa .

in 2003 , the dairy company parmalat went bankrupt with debts of several billion euros and the firm ’ s top managers were put on trial . the parmalat scandal seven years ago destroyed the savings of some 135,000 people and left a14 billion euro -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- hole in the company 's finances .
on thursday , an italian court is meeting to hand down verdicts on the former managers of the parmalat food conglomerate .
the founder and ceo of parmalat , 72-year-old calisto tanzi , had already been sentenced to 10 years in prison for stock market manipulation in a separate trial .
prosecutors have asked for a 20-year sentence for tanzi as he is accused of a range of financial crimes .
the prosecution has also asked for prison sentences for 16 other defendants including 12 years for tanzi 's brother giovanni , and nine and a half years for fausto tonna , the group 's former financial director .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-ceo calisto tanzi claims he only meant to save parmalat the scandal at the time of its collapse , parmalat employed around 36,000 people in 30 countries and was one of the leaders in the italian business world .
the food company specialized in uht -lrb- ultra high temperature -rrb- milk and daily products .
however , in december 2003 it emerged that the company had a 14 billion euro hole in its financing , and had been in trouble for many years .
the company 's financial woes had been covered up by major falsifications of balance sheets and sophisticated financial fiddling .
parmalat shares lost 97 percent and the company was de-listed from the stock exchange .
the firm was dubbed “ europe 's enron ” and is one of europe 's biggest ever financial scandals .
" parmalat was the symbol of a sick system and the biggest debt factory of european capitalism , " investigator lucia russo said during the trial .
link to the banks during the trial , tanzi 's defence blamed the banks that sold parmalat bonds to small time investors , even when they knew the group was insolvent .
the responsibility of citigroup , deutsche bank , morgan stanley and bank of america is the subject of another trial that is ongoing in milan .
the banks are charged with stock manipulation and if found guilty could face fines of up to 5 million euros and have their profits seized .
following the scandal , parmalat have continued to produce dairy products , retaining the name and the production facilities .
however , all the company 's debts were wiped out before it was re-listed , so its past history does not affect its stock today .

the mekong rises in the tibetan plateau and runs almost 5,000 kilometres through six countries – including laos and cambodia – before it meets the sea in vietnam .
need for more energy countries like laos and cambodia need electricity for their own purposes and to export to their energy-hungry neighbors .
the mekong and its tributaries offer a logical solution – why not dam the river , and push the water through turbines to generate power ?
it is a question that has grown more urgent in recent years .
in another five years , there will be 47 dams on the tributaries of the mekong .
around a dozen more are planned for the mainstream .
but campaigners say blocking the mekong will severely damage fish migration , and cripple fish catches .
that is important because millions in the region rely on this free resource for nutrition and food security .
freshwater fish provide up to 80 percent of the protein eaten by cambodians , and at least one-third of fish in this river are migratory species .
hazards of development a recent projection highlighted the risks if a proposed 11 dams are built on the mainstream of the mekong river – two of them in cambodia .
that would add to 77 dams that are already built or planned for tributaries of the mekong over the next two decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cambodian boy stretches to hoist his makeshift fishing net out of the mekong river dr eric baran is the senior research scientist at the phnom penh office of worldfish , an international research body .
he believes that the consequences of this construction in terms of fish production would be a loss , and this loss is due to the impact on the migratory fish .
" we calculated that the loss of fish by 2030 , if the 11 mainstream dams are built , would amount to between 600,000 tons and 900,000 tons every year .
we ’ re talking about a gigantic number that could have a huge impact on food security in the region , in particular in cambodia and laos . "
cambodia would lose over 200,000 tons of fish – more than half its annual catch .
millions of cambodians live on the cusp of poverty and rely on the bounty of the river to survive .
the mekong river commission – or mrc – is an intergovernmental body set up 15 years ago by cambodia , thailand , laos and vietnam to promote cooperation over the river .
china and myanmar are also involved in the mrc .
a recent report from the mrc recommended that any decisions on whether to build dams on the mainstream mekong be deferred for a decade , since building them would be irreversible , and their impact would be substantial .
it warned cambodia would likely suffer more than any other country from the proposed dams .
the next step is for the politicians to sit down and work out a way forward .
earlier this week cambodia ’ s agriculture and fisheries minister admitted that damming the mekong could interrupt fish migrations .

the mekong rises in the tibetan plateau and runs almost 5,000 kilometres through six countries – including laos and cambodia – before it meets the sea in vietnam .
need for more energy countries like laos and cambodia need electricity for their own purposes and to export to their energy-hungry neighbors .
the mekong and its tributaries offer a logical solution – why not dam the river , and push the water through turbines to generate power ?
it is a question that has grown more urgent in recent years .
in another five years , there will be 47 dams on the tributaries of the mekong .
around a dozen more are planned for the mainstream .
but campaigners say blocking the mekong will severely damage fish migration , and cripple fish catches .
that is important because millions in the region rely on this free resource for nutrition and food security .
freshwater fish provide up to 80 percent of the protein eaten by cambodians , and at least one-third of fish in this river are migratory species .
hazards of development a recent projection highlighted the risks if a proposed 11 dams are built on the mainstream of the mekong river – two of them in cambodia .
that would add to 77 dams that are already built or planned for tributaries of the mekong over the next two decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cambodian boy stretches to hoist his makeshift fishing net out of the mekong river dr eric baran is the senior research scientist at the phnom penh office of worldfish , an international research body .
he believes that the consequences of this construction in terms of fish production would be a loss , and this loss is due to the impact on the migratory fish .
" we calculated that the loss of fish by 2030 , if the 11 mainstream dams are built , would amount to between 600,000 tons and 900,000 tons every year .
we ’ re talking about a gigantic number that could have a huge impact on food security in the region , in particular in cambodia and laos . "
cambodia would lose over 200,000 tons of fish – more than half its annual catch .
millions of cambodians live on the cusp of poverty and rely on the bounty of the river to survive .
the mekong river commission – or mrc – is an intergovernmental body set up 15 years ago by cambodia , thailand , laos and vietnam to promote cooperation over the river .
china and myanmar are also involved in the mrc .
a recent report from the mrc recommended that any decisions on whether to build dams on the mainstream mekong be deferred for a decade , since building them would be irreversible , and their impact would be substantial .
it warned cambodia would likely suffer more than any other country from the proposed dams .
the next step is for the politicians to sit down and work out a way forward .
earlier this week cambodia ’ s agriculture and fisheries minister admitted that damming the mekong could interrupt fish migrations .

calisto tanzi , who was also parmalat 's chief executive , was found guilty on charges of fraudulent bankruptcy and criminal conspiracy in the main trial in the northern italian town of parma in connection with the scandal dubbed " europe 's enron , " in reference to the former firm at the center of the largest corporate collapse in us history .
tanzi maintained his innocence throughout the case .
his attorney , giampiero biancolella , said his client would appeal the verdict .
prosecutors had asked the court for a 20-year sentence for the 72-year-old tanzi over the scandal at the corporation which left a 14-billion-euro -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- hole in the company 's books , and led to 135,000 people losing their savings .
tanzi had already been sentenced to 10 years in prison for stock market manipulation in a separate trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tanzi 's sentence comes on top of a 10-year term handed down earlier the prosecution also asked for prison sentences for 16 other defendants including 12 years for tanzi 's brother giovanni , and nine and a half years for fausto tonna , the group 's former financial director .
at the time of its collapse , parmalat employed around 36,000 people in 30 countries and was one of the leaders in the italian business world .
at the time , the corporate failure was europe 's biggest .
the food company specialized in uht -lrb- ultra high temperature -rrb- milk and daily products .
however , in december 2003 it emerged that the company had a multi-billion-euro hole in its financing , and had been in trouble for many years .
the company 's financial woes had been covered up by major falsifications of balance sheets and sophisticated financial fiddling .
" parmalat was the symbol of a sick system and the biggest debt factory of european capitalism , " investigator lucia russo said during the trial .

norbert roettgen called on states to follow germany 's lead and launch a " rethink " on climate change .
" in business , politics and society , we no longer see climate change as a threat , but an opportunity and a challenge , " said roettgen in a speech to delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment minister said a multilateral approach is needed in cancun he said that germany had invested in tackling climate change and as a result it had created jobs and opportunities .
rich vs poor countries major deadlocks have emerged at cancun between rich and developing nations , largely over how to lower greenhouse-gas emissions .
despite wide agreement on issues such as tackling deforestation , adaptation , technology and climate financing , there is little compromise on either side over limiting co2 emissions that cause climate change .
the european union and the united states want more scrutiny of emerging powers ' actions on climate change and anchoring voluntary emission pledges into the wider un process .
eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard said there had been " no sign of progress on the crunch issues . "
meanwhile developing nations put the onus on industrial powers to back an extension of the kyoto protocol , a treaty limiting the gas emissions of wealthy countries that is set to expire in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu climate commissioner hedegaard said little progress has been made the us never ratified kyoto and china was exempted – and now japan is leading a bloc of countries that refuse to back a new treaty without the world 's two largest polluters .
deadline looms the talks end on friday and roettgen told reporters it was now a " difficult point " as the deadline draws close .
however , mexico 's foreign minister , who is chairing the talks said a comprehensive deal among the 190 countries was " within reach . "
" we need to work together in finding the balance that will make cancun a success , " patricia espinosa said .
her comments were echoed by the eu climate commissioner .
" to come out of cancun with nothing is simply not an option , " hedegaard said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 09.12.2010 climate summit avoids real issues , says alternative nobel prize winner großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bassey is chair of friends of the earth international nigerian environment activist nnimmo bassey was awarded the right livelihood award for his work exposing the ecological and human atrocities of oil extraction .
deutsche welle caught up with him at the un climate summit . on december 6 , the swedish parliament awarded nnimmo bassey the so-called " alternative nobel prize " in recognition of his inspired work to strengthen the environmental movement in his home country of nigeria and throughout africa .
as executive director of environmental rights action in nigeria and chair of friends of the earth international , bassey has become one of africa 's leading advocates for environmental protection and human rights .
he has been particularly influential in mobilizing resistance to multinational oil corporations in his country , drawing attention to the environmental devastation they leave behind and their disregard for the rights of the local population .
after receiving his award in stockholm , bassey traveled to cancun , mexico , where deutsche welle interviewed him on the sidelines of the un climate summit .
deutsche welle : how did you feel when you got the prize ?
nnimmo bassey : when i stood on the platform to receive the reward my mind went to many , many things .
and particularly to a fellow nigerian who won the award in 1994 – the late ken saro wiwa , our number one environmentalist and defender of the environment who was executed in 1995 .
he won the award in 1994 .
and when i stood up there , i knew i was standing on the shoulders of a great man who showed me how to fight for environmental justice and how to resist big corporations who are bent not only on destroying nigeria , but on destroying the climate - destroying the climate of the world by pollution and by release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
are you afraid of facing the same fate as ken saro wiwa ?
no , i am not .
i work with the people , i stand with the people , i am running with the people and there is no option !
you know working with people resisting destructive extraction , working with communities and mass movements who are defending the planet is not an option for me .
and so i look at the people , and i join the people , and i know that we are on the right path .
there is no time for fear .
looking at the negotiations here in cancun , do you feel they are focused on the things that really matter , for example oil extraction , destruction of the environment and climate change ? i think the negotiations to a large extent are not focusing on the real issues .
climate change is caused by very fundamental structural , systemic problems .
one of which is the crisis driven by the market .
all the negotiators talk about is how to use the market to soften global warming - carbon offsetting by planting a tree somewhere in africa while you keep polluting in europe .
this is not a solution , because pollution emissions have to stop at the source .
and they are not talking about lifestyle changes ; they are not talking about less consumption and less of production .
now we have big everything : big oil , big water , big fish ; and everything is coming to an end .
and we would expect our negotiators to look at this problem , the problem of overconsumption and overproduction .
we do n't have more than one planet and we can not go on at the speed and the rate and the direction that we are going now .
we can not keep pushing on with fossil-fuel driven civilization .
we have gone beyond half of the known reserves in the world and we 've done this in only a couple of years , maybe 100 years or so .
how are we going to run on a half tank until eternity ?
you see , it is impossible .
so our leaders are here to talk about how to get money , how not to make commitments or reduce emissions and other , poorer countries are looking at how they can get funding from mitigation .
when temperatures increase due to non-binding targets , at five degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels , no amount of money for mitigation , no amount of money for whatever you do is going to suffice .
we will not know life as it is any more .

on human rights day 2010 tribute is paid to chebeya and others like him . in a special address to mark human rights day on december 10 , un secretary general ban ki-moon praised human rights advocates and their role in the fight against discrimination and exclusion .
ban also called on governments to do more to protect these people - but the appeal came too late for floribert chebeya bahizire .
chebeya was found murdered in kinshasa , the capital of the democratic republic of congo , on june 2 , 2010 .
eyewitnesses said the 46 year-old man was lying on the back seat of an abandoned car , his hands tied .
murders are not uncommon in the drc , a country with a high crime rate , but senior un officials immediately suspected there was more to this particular killing .
" two days ago , an individual with whom i met during my october -lsb- 2009 -rsb- visit to the democratic republic of congo , mr. floribert chebeya bahizire , was killed in kinshasa in circumstances which strongly suggest official involvement , " the un special rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , philip alston , told the human rights council in geneva .
chebeya was " the director of ' voix des sans-voix pour les droits de l 'homme -lsb- voice of the voiceless for human rights -rsb- , ' and a hugely respected human rights leader in the drc , " alston said .
a figure of inspiration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un is active in the drc , one of africa 's most unstable countries alston called for an independent investigation into chebeya 's death , but the drc administration has yet to present a full report . on the day of his death , chebeya had answered a summons from the chief of police in kinshasa ; his last known communication was an sms to his wife saying he was on his way home .
the director of the africa division at the unhcr in geneva , scott campbell , met the activist many times , and described him as " very understated , very soft spoken -lrb- except when he was angry ! -rrb- , very committed and very determined . "
" once there was a human rights issue , or somebody in danger , he would n't let go , " campbell told deutsche welle .
" i do n't know how many times floribert was arrested , mistreated , or threatened with death , -lsb- but -rsb- he continued his work , and this , i think , inspired many others , and continues to inspire many others in the drc today , and outside the drc . "
the challenges facing human rights advocates in the drc are huge .
they must fight against widespread rape and sexual violence by the military and militias , along with extrajudicial executions , torture and numerous cases of death while in police custody .
legal institutions and watchdogs are either weak or non-existent , and there 's an implicit culture of impunity for offenders , especially those under government employ .
the un 's scott campbell considers the drc to be one of the most dangerous places in the world for human rights advocates .
" those that do it inspire me ; they 're a very impressive group , " campbell said .
" they have no guarantees - and cases such as floribert chebeya demonstrate that .
so i take my hat off to those that continue in the struggle today . "
help them to help us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's navi pillay wants more people to get involved many of the world 's most committed and passionate human rights activists are known only to a small circle , and those who do become relatively renowned often do so for tragic reasons , as was the case with chebeya .
the unhcr estimates that hundreds of thousands of people around the world dedicate their lives to human rights ; fighting discrimination against indigenous peoples , against women , or against people with disabilities or illnesses and other marginalized or persecuted groups .
" we need to stand up for their rights , so they can continue to stand up for ours , " the un high commissioner for human rights , navi pillay , said in her human rights day address .
" no formal qualifications are required , " pillay said , appealing for people to join their ranks .
" we can all be human rights defenders , and we all should be !
it just takes commitment and courage . "
of course , it 's not quite that simple , and the un knows it .
every year , thousands of rights activists are harassed , persecuted , arrested or even murdered for their efforts .
however , the un 's position is that a situation only becomes truly hopeless when people give up hope .
" we have seen evolution in so many countries in africa , and elsewhere - certainly in latin america , " scott campbell said , stressing that many human rights activists are ultimately successful .
" i 'm sure if you talked to many in latin american countries in the 1960s or 70s , they would have said the same thing about human rights defenders : ' -lsb- it 's -rsb- an extremely dangerous environment , it 's a bit hopeless , how can things ever change ? '
but these human rights defenders play a critical role in keeping the ball moving forward , in terms of getting towards peace and stability . "

an ngo representative says companies see it that way shortly before human rights day , ngo representatives make clear they face major difficulties in holding european companies accountable for actions in developing countries . in the perennial battle between non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- and big business , do those advocating for human rights even stand a chance ?
that 's a fundamental question many of germany 's ngos asked themselves tuesday in berlin .
without fundamental changes in politics and society , their efforts may be little more than reactionary .
take , for example , the 400 ugandan farming families driven from their land to make room for a neumann kaffee gruppe coffee plantation .
that 's something which weighs on the consciousness of groups like fian deutschland and misereor .
and human rights day will be celebrated on friday – the same day the nobel peace prize is awarded in oslo .
many ngos say the time for change is now .
profits from palm oil guy bertrand says he actually likes palm oil – it 's used in processed food eaten around the world .
but the cameroonian in his mid-30 's says his environmental ngo , forcarfe , keeps a close eye on the activities of socapalm , a private company which produces palm oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffee beans grow where 400 ugandan families used to farm " in my country , an oil palm is worth more than a person , " he told deutsche welle .
" that 's the truth .
a tree is worth more than a human . "
socapalm , which was founded by the government of cameroon , maintains five large domestic plantations for palm oil production .
it was privatized in 2000 under pressure from the world bank .
today four out of five socopalm stakeholders are european .
they are investors from luxembourg and belgium , but most notably the bollore group from france .
once the privatization was underway , the plantations began to expand and consume more land .
militias pushed ethnic bantu and pygmy villagers off of traditional lands they were legally entitled to .
many lost their livelihoods and the small gardens they sustained themselves with .
" the goal of the privatization was that the local population would profit from these economic structures – and that would balance out the loss of land , " bertrand said .
" the promise was of jobs , jobs , jobs .
but none of these promises have come to pass .
socopalm 's employees – even if they do n't come from europe – come from far away . "
few jobs , little security those jobs generated by the privatization are offered by subcontractors on a temporary basis without social benefits or rights to strike .
that 's not just against international labour organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- norms , but also against the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- guidelines for multinational companies , bertrand said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palm oil is eaten in processed foods around the world socopalm 's business strategy is decided in europe , and guy bertrand does n't believe the company is keeping with the ilo and oecd guidelines .
so he lodged complaints against socopalm in several european countries .
but the contact points bertrand has lodged complaints with only examine cases – they do n't have the power to impose sanctions .
furthermore , the contact point in germany is part of a department of the federal ministry for economics and technology -lrb- bmwi -rrb- .
armin paasch , a misereor advisor on global trade and nourishment , says an inherent conflict of interest exists in germany because one role of the bmwi is to help develop foreign trade .
dutch system truly independent the complaints system in the netherlands is more impartial , according to paasch .
" in the netherlands there is one national contact point which is a panel of four experts from various social groups .
ngos , trade unions and others are represented .
and in that case , independence is better guaranteed . "
but another europe-wide hurdle exists for ngos trying to hold companies accountable for their actions abroad – the structures of the companies themselves .
european companies are often able to legally separate themselves from their foreign subsidiaries , rendering them nearly immune to prosecution , paasch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies in africa may use militia and police to protect their interests bertrand said that when those companies prepare to do business in developing countries , they often start with a plan which looks good on paper .
but the actual results vary .
" once they 're here , we 're treated like it 's a war , " he said .
" they take the land and use everything at their disposal – including police and private security companies – to drive us off . "
the real thorn in bertrand 's side is the flagrant disregard multinational companies have for the existing oecd guidelines .
he said he would be happy if at least those standards where upheld .
" when we look at industrialized countries , what hurts us is not their wealth and our poverty , " he said .
" what bothers us is that we have no rights at all . "

on human rights day 2010 tribute is paid to chebeya and others like him . in a special address to mark human rights day on december 10 , un secretary general ban ki-moon praised human rights advocates and their role in the fight against discrimination and exclusion .
ban also called on governments to do more to protect these people - but the appeal came too late for floribert chebeya bahizire .
chebeya was found murdered in kinshasa , the capital of the democratic republic of congo , on june 2 , 2010 .
eyewitnesses said the 46 year-old man was lying on the back seat of an abandoned car , his hands tied .
murders are not uncommon in the drc , a country with a high crime rate , but senior un officials immediately suspected there was more to this particular killing .
" two days ago , an individual with whom i met during my october -lsb- 2009 -rsb- visit to the democratic republic of congo , mr. floribert chebeya bahizire , was killed in kinshasa in circumstances which strongly suggest official involvement , " the un special rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , philip alston , told the human rights council in geneva .
chebeya was " the director of ' voix des sans-voix pour les droits de l 'homme -lsb- voice of the voiceless for human rights -rsb- , ' and a hugely respected human rights leader in the drc , " alston said .
a figure of inspiration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un is active in the drc , one of africa 's most unstable countries alston called for an independent investigation into chebeya 's death , but the drc administration has yet to present a full report . on the day of his death , chebeya had answered a summons from the chief of police in kinshasa ; his last known communication was an sms to his wife saying he was on his way home .
the director of the africa division at the unhcr in geneva , scott campbell , met the activist many times , and described him as " very understated , very soft spoken -lrb- except when he was angry ! -rrb- , very committed and very determined . "
" once there was a human rights issue , or somebody in danger , he would n't let go , " campbell told deutsche welle .
" i do n't know how many times floribert was arrested , mistreated , or threatened with death , -lsb- but -rsb- he continued his work , and this , i think , inspired many others , and continues to inspire many others in the drc today , and outside the drc . "
the challenges facing human rights advocates in the drc are huge .
they must fight against widespread rape and sexual violence by the military and militias , along with extrajudicial executions , torture and numerous cases of death while in police custody .
legal institutions and watchdogs are either weak or non-existent , and there 's an implicit culture of impunity for offenders , especially those under government employ .
the un 's scott campbell considers the drc to be one of the most dangerous places in the world for human rights advocates .
" those that do it inspire me ; they 're a very impressive group , " campbell said .
" they have no guarantees - and cases such as floribert chebeya demonstrate that .
so i take my hat off to those that continue in the struggle today . "
help them to help us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's navi pillay wants more people to get involved many of the world 's most committed and passionate human rights activists are known only to a small circle , and those who do become relatively renowned often do so for tragic reasons , as was the case with chebeya .
the unhcr estimates that hundreds of thousands of people around the world dedicate their lives to human rights ; fighting discrimination against indigenous peoples , against women , or against people with disabilities or illnesses and other marginalized or persecuted groups .
" we need to stand up for their rights , so they can continue to stand up for ours , " the un high commissioner for human rights , navi pillay , said in her human rights day address .
" no formal qualifications are required , " pillay said , appealing for people to join their ranks .
" we can all be human rights defenders , and we all should be !
it just takes commitment and courage . "
of course , it 's not quite that simple , and the un knows it .
every year , thousands of rights activists are harassed , persecuted , arrested or even murdered for their efforts .
however , the un 's position is that a situation only becomes truly hopeless when people give up hope .
" we have seen evolution in so many countries in africa , and elsewhere - certainly in latin america , " scott campbell said , stressing that many human rights activists are ultimately successful .
" i 'm sure if you talked to many in latin american countries in the 1960s or 70s , they would have said the same thing about human rights defenders : ' -lsb- it 's -rsb- an extremely dangerous environment , it 's a bit hopeless , how can things ever change ? '
but these human rights defenders play a critical role in keeping the ball moving forward , in terms of getting towards peace and stability . "

an ngo representative says companies see it that way shortly before human rights day , ngo representatives make clear they face major difficulties in holding european companies accountable for actions in developing countries . in the perennial battle between non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- and big business , do those advocating for human rights even stand a chance ?
that 's a fundamental question many of germany 's ngos asked themselves tuesday in berlin .
without fundamental changes in politics and society , their efforts may be little more than reactionary .
take , for example , the 400 ugandan farming families driven from their land to make room for a neumann kaffee gruppe coffee plantation .
that 's something which weighs on the consciousness of groups like fian deutschland and misereor .
and human rights day will be celebrated on friday – the same day the nobel peace prize is awarded in oslo .
many ngos say the time for change is now .
profits from palm oil guy bertrand says he actually likes palm oil – it 's used in processed food eaten around the world .
but the cameroonian in his mid-30 's says his environmental ngo , forcarfe , keeps a close eye on the activities of socapalm , a private company which produces palm oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffee beans grow where 400 ugandan families used to farm " in my country , an oil palm is worth more than a person , " he told deutsche welle .
" that 's the truth .
a tree is worth more than a human . "
socapalm , which was founded by the government of cameroon , maintains five large domestic plantations for palm oil production .
it was privatized in 2000 under pressure from the world bank .
today four out of five socopalm stakeholders are european .
they are investors from luxembourg and belgium , but most notably the bollore group from france .
once the privatization was underway , the plantations began to expand and consume more land .
militias pushed ethnic bantu and pygmy villagers off of traditional lands they were legally entitled to .
many lost their livelihoods and the small gardens they sustained themselves with .
" the goal of the privatization was that the local population would profit from these economic structures – and that would balance out the loss of land , " bertrand said .
" the promise was of jobs , jobs , jobs .
but none of these promises have come to pass .
socopalm 's employees – even if they do n't come from europe – come from far away . "
few jobs , little security those jobs generated by the privatization are offered by subcontractors on a temporary basis without social benefits or rights to strike .
that 's not just against international labour organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- norms , but also against the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- guidelines for multinational companies , bertrand said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palm oil is eaten in processed foods around the world socopalm 's business strategy is decided in europe , and guy bertrand does n't believe the company is keeping with the ilo and oecd guidelines .
so he lodged complaints against socopalm in several european countries .
but the contact points bertrand has lodged complaints with only examine cases – they do n't have the power to impose sanctions .
furthermore , the contact point in germany is part of a department of the federal ministry for economics and technology -lrb- bmwi -rrb- .
armin paasch , a misereor advisor on global trade and nourishment , says an inherent conflict of interest exists in germany because one role of the bmwi is to help develop foreign trade .
dutch system truly independent the complaints system in the netherlands is more impartial , according to paasch .
" in the netherlands there is one national contact point which is a panel of four experts from various social groups .
ngos , trade unions and others are represented .
and in that case , independence is better guaranteed . "
but another europe-wide hurdle exists for ngos trying to hold companies accountable for their actions abroad – the structures of the companies themselves .
european companies are often able to legally separate themselves from their foreign subsidiaries , rendering them nearly immune to prosecution , paasch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies in africa may use militia and police to protect their interests bertrand said that when those companies prepare to do business in developing countries , they often start with a plan which looks good on paper .
but the actual results vary .
" once they 're here , we 're treated like it 's a war , " he said .
" they take the land and use everything at their disposal – including police and private security companies – to drive us off . "
the real thorn in bertrand 's side is the flagrant disregard multinational companies have for the existing oecd guidelines .
he said he would be happy if at least those standards where upheld .
" when we look at industrialized countries , what hurts us is not their wealth and our poverty , " he said .
" what bothers us is that we have no rights at all . "

he spoke of men and women " far more deserving of the prize " than him - and he meant people like liu xiaobo .
imprisoned in china , liu received this year 's nobel peace prize after more than two decades of an arduous , non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in china .
obama , on the other hand , received the award for a vision , a change in tone in international relations , and , many argue , in an attempt to settle accounts with his predecessor , george w. bush .
a dissatisfying record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's vision of a world free of nuclear weapons impressed not only the nobel committee while obama has kept his promise of withdrawing combat troops from iraq , he has n't followed through on many of the political projects he received the nobel peace prize for : a new strategic arms reduction treaty with russia , the closing of guantanamo bay detention camp , and a real step forward in meeting the world 's climate challenges .
but who 's to blame ?
did obama lose the moral compass he assigned so much importance to in his nobel speech ?
facing an adverse political climate " obama 's standpoints are better than his record , " marco fey from the peace research institute frankfurt told deutsche welle .
" on a variety of issues , he 's caught in the political climate in the us . "
fey cited the arms reduction treaty ' new start ' as a fitting example .
obama and russian president dmitry medvedev signed the treaty in april 2010 , but it has n't been ratified by the senate so far .
" obama , senior department of state officials , they all support the treaty , " fey said .
" it would be a real milestone in terms of arms control .
but republicans use the most absurd arguments to block it in the senate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the closure of guantanamo bay detention camp remains uncertain political capital is scarce obama 's decision to close down the detention camp at guantanamo bay has met fierce congressional opposition as well . but critics argue that obama has n't really invested his political capital in the measure compared to other projects he pushed through congress - such as health care reform .
the recent conviction of canadian citizen omar ahmed khadr who was brought to guantanamo 's military prison at the age of 16 , exemplifies obama 's lack of self-assertion in putting an end to the facility and its practice .
" who would have thought that , under obama , someone who 's accused of a crime committed at the age of 15 would be tried before a military commission at guantanamo ? "
reed brody from human rights watch told deutsche welle .
promoting human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is this year 's recipient of the nobel peace prize indeed , obama promised to be a persistent advocate of human rights at home and abroad . he has frequently underscored the significance of peaceful activists like liu xiaobo - the first chinese recipient of the award .
liu was an influential participant of the tiananmen protests in 1989 and is a leading author of charta 08 , a manifesto promoting fundamental human rights and democratization in china .
in december 2009 , after a series of earlier internments , he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for " inciting subversion of state power . "
obama and other heads of state have called on the chinese government to release liu .
however , critics argue that obama has failed to make human rights a guiding principle of us relations with other countries - highlighted and , some say , undermined by obama 's recent efforts to expand chinese-american cooperation .
" it 's not helpful when the government repeatedly describes human rights and democracy as issues on which the us and china will inevitably disagree , " brody said . a vision 's prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , al gore gave his nobel speech at oslo 's city hall whether attributed to obama 's political environment or his setting of priorities , the gap between obama 's vision and his actual achievements remains a fact .
yet , obama is sticking to his optimistic rhetoric and continues to set visionary goals , for example , regarding the middle east peace process .
" he 's set the goal of reaching a peace accord within a year , " said fey .
" that 's a very ambitious undertaking . "
as the clash of idealistic expectations and political pragmatism continues to haunt obama 's presidency , one is reminded of what al gore said during his nobel speech in 2007 : " we have everything we need to get started , save perhaps political will , but political will is a renewable resource . "

but some are also unhappy with the decision . not many among the 1.3 billion chinese had heard the name of liu xiaobo before october .
but thanks to an official media campaign against the 54-year old activist , he is now better known than ever .
chinese media campaign against liu the chinese media have reported that liu is being awarded the nobel prize because he has tried to sabotage the " peaceful rise of china " for years .
he has been compared to the dalai lama who got the prize in 1989 and is regarded as a separatist by beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is regarded as a separatist by the chinese government according to chinese media reports , liu xiaobo has been used by western countries as a political tool in order to weaken china and throw the country into chaos .
the nobel peace prize was described as an award to liu for committing treason .
does china need 300 years of colonialism ?
the chinese media have been trying to discredit liu xiaobo in many ways .
for example , they published quotes of liu saying that china would need at least 300 years of colonialism in order to develop properly .
but those lines were quoted out of context , says jin zhong , a journalist based in hong kong .
he is the publisher and editor-in-chief of the liberal magazine " kaifang " – or " open " .
when liu visited hong kong for the first time in 1988 , he was impressed by the freedom and wealth of the then british colony , remembers jin .
when jin asked liu how china should develop in the future , liu answered somewhat ironically : " china needs at least 300 years of colonialism , if hong kong has needed 100 years for this kind of freedom and prosperity . "
debate within the chinese internet community " of course he was exaggerating , " recalls jin , " liu has been a strong supporter of western-style democracy and freedom . "
still , liu 's quote has been widely discussed within the chinese internet community .
patriotic users are upset , whereas their critics wonder why the chinese cadres are sending their offspring abroad to study in western countries , if they are so negative about the west .
honoring china 's democrats most chinese liberal thinkers welcome the nobel peace prize for liu .
they say that it is not only an award for liu ’ s commitment to more democracy in china , it is in fact honoring the whole chinese democracy movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is a co-initiator of the charter ' 08 " there is no better candidate for this prize , " says qian yuejun , a chinese dissident based in germany , " he was the only choice within the chinese pro-democracy movement who really deserves the award . "
in 2008 , liu xiaobo was one of the initiators of the so-called charter ' 08 – a manifesto demanding more democracy and freedom within china .
two days before it was published , liu was arrested and later sentenced to eleven years in prison on subversion charges .
" as co-initiator , liu has gathered over ten thousand supporters for the charter ' 08 within a short period .
no one else within the divided pro-democracy movement can be as convincing as liu .
he is the only one who can mobilize so many people , " explains qian .
divided movement but among the critics of the communist regime , there are also voices against liu xiaobo .
in their eyes , he is too ready to compromise .
" for an intellectual , liu ’ s thinking is very problematic .
he has studied marxist ideology during his time in university , " argues zhong weiguang , another chinese dissident living in germany .
" he embodies the communist ideology .
that is why he doesn ’ t deserve the nobel peace prize . "

but some are also unhappy with the decision . not many among the 1.3 billion chinese had heard the name of liu xiaobo before october .
but thanks to an official media campaign against the 54-year old activist , he is now better known than ever .
chinese media campaign against liu the chinese media have reported that liu is being awarded the nobel prize because he has tried to sabotage the " peaceful rise of china " for years .
he has been compared to the dalai lama who got the prize in 1989 and is regarded as a separatist by beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is regarded as a separatist by the chinese government according to chinese media reports , liu xiaobo has been used by western countries as a political tool in order to weaken china and throw the country into chaos .
the nobel peace prize was described as an award to liu for committing treason .
does china need 300 years of colonialism ?
the chinese media have been trying to discredit liu xiaobo in many ways .
for example , they published quotes of liu saying that china would need at least 300 years of colonialism in order to develop properly .
but those lines were quoted out of context , says jin zhong , a journalist based in hong kong .
he is the publisher and editor-in-chief of the liberal magazine " kaifang " – or " open " .
when liu visited hong kong for the first time in 1988 , he was impressed by the freedom and wealth of the then british colony , remembers jin .
when jin asked liu how china should develop in the future , liu answered somewhat ironically : " china needs at least 300 years of colonialism , if hong kong has needed 100 years for this kind of freedom and prosperity . "
debate within the chinese internet community " of course he was exaggerating , " recalls jin , " liu has been a strong supporter of western-style democracy and freedom . "
still , liu 's quote has been widely discussed within the chinese internet community .
patriotic users are upset , whereas their critics wonder why the chinese cadres are sending their offspring abroad to study in western countries , if they are so negative about the west .
honoring china 's democrats most chinese liberal thinkers welcome the nobel peace prize for liu .
they say that it is not only an award for liu ’ s commitment to more democracy in china , it is in fact honoring the whole chinese democracy movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is a co-initiator of the charter ' 08 " there is no better candidate for this prize , " says qian yuejun , a chinese dissident based in germany , " he was the only choice within the chinese pro-democracy movement who really deserves the award . "
in 2008 , liu xiaobo was one of the initiators of the so-called charter ' 08 – a manifesto demanding more democracy and freedom within china .
two days before it was published , liu was arrested and later sentenced to eleven years in prison on subversion charges .
" as co-initiator , liu has gathered over ten thousand supporters for the charter ' 08 within a short period .
no one else within the divided pro-democracy movement can be as convincing as liu .
he is the only one who can mobilize so many people , " explains qian .
divided movement but among the critics of the communist regime , there are also voices against liu xiaobo .
in their eyes , he is too ready to compromise .
" for an intellectual , liu ’ s thinking is very problematic .
he has studied marxist ideology during his time in university , " argues zhong weiguang , another chinese dissident living in germany .
" he embodies the communist ideology .
that is why he doesn ’ t deserve the nobel peace prize . "

he spoke of men and women " far more deserving of the prize " than him - and he meant people like liu xiaobo .
imprisoned in china , liu received this year 's nobel peace prize after more than two decades of an arduous , non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in china .
obama , on the other hand , received the award for a vision , a change in tone in international relations , and , many argue , in an attempt to settle accounts with his predecessor , george w. bush .
a dissatisfying record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's vision of a world free of nuclear weapons impressed not only the nobel committee while obama has kept his promise of withdrawing combat troops from iraq , he has n't followed through on many of the political projects he received the nobel peace prize for : a new strategic arms reduction treaty with russia , the closing of guantanamo bay detention camp , and a real step forward in meeting the world 's climate challenges .
but who 's to blame ?
did obama lose the moral compass he assigned so much importance to in his nobel speech ?
facing an adverse political climate " obama 's standpoints are better than his record , " marco fey from the peace research institute frankfurt told deutsche welle .
" on a variety of issues , he 's caught in the political climate in the us . "
fey cited the arms reduction treaty ' new start ' as a fitting example .
obama and russian president dmitry medvedev signed the treaty in april 2010 , but it has n't been ratified by the senate so far .
" obama , senior department of state officials , they all support the treaty , " fey said .
" it would be a real milestone in terms of arms control .
but republicans use the most absurd arguments to block it in the senate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the closure of guantanamo bay detention camp remains uncertain political capital is scarce obama 's decision to close down the detention camp at guantanamo bay has met fierce congressional opposition as well . but critics argue that obama has n't really invested his political capital in the measure compared to other projects he pushed through congress - such as health care reform .
the recent conviction of canadian citizen omar ahmed khadr who was brought to guantanamo 's military prison at the age of 16 , exemplifies obama 's lack of self-assertion in putting an end to the facility and its practice .
" who would have thought that , under obama , someone who 's accused of a crime committed at the age of 15 would be tried before a military commission at guantanamo ? "
reed brody from human rights watch told deutsche welle .
promoting human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is this year 's recipient of the nobel peace prize indeed , obama promised to be a persistent advocate of human rights at home and abroad . he has frequently underscored the significance of peaceful activists like liu xiaobo - the first chinese recipient of the award .
liu was an influential participant of the tiananmen protests in 1989 and is a leading author of charta 08 , a manifesto promoting fundamental human rights and democratization in china .
in december 2009 , after a series of earlier internments , he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for " inciting subversion of state power . "
obama and other heads of state have called on the chinese government to release liu .
however , critics argue that obama has failed to make human rights a guiding principle of us relations with other countries - highlighted and , some say , undermined by obama 's recent efforts to expand chinese-american cooperation .
" it 's not helpful when the government repeatedly describes human rights and democracy as issues on which the us and china will inevitably disagree , " brody said . a vision 's prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , al gore gave his nobel speech at oslo 's city hall whether attributed to obama 's political environment or his setting of priorities , the gap between obama 's vision and his actual achievements remains a fact .
yet , obama is sticking to his optimistic rhetoric and continues to set visionary goals , for example , regarding the middle east peace process .
" he 's set the goal of reaching a peace accord within a year , " said fey .
" that 's a very ambitious undertaking . "
as the clash of idealistic expectations and political pragmatism continues to haunt obama 's presidency , one is reminded of what al gore said during his nobel speech in 2007 : " we have everything we need to get started , save perhaps political will , but political will is a renewable resource . "

nasa also agrees to make germany an associate partner in its lunar science institute in california . in an agreement signed in washington , d.c. on wednesday , the german space agency , better known by its german acronym dlr , and its american counterpart , nasa , agreed to cooperate more fully on joint operations , planetary observations , and other forms of space science .
the move comes just a week after the german government outlined its new space strategy , where it said germany would expand public investments in space science from its current 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- annually to 1.4 billion euros by 2014 .
that policy also underscored increased collaboration with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , where germany is currently the second-largest funder nation after france .
" many space missions and projects can only be carried out through international cooperation , with nasa for example , because of their complexity and the associated costs , " said johann-dietrich worner , dlr 's chairman , in a statement posted to the dlr 's website .
" this is why dlr , as germany 's national space agency and research center , is endeavoring to set up bilateral collaborations such as this , in addition to its other commitments . "
his american counterpart was equally positive on the new agreement .
" nasa has a long history of successful cooperation with the government of germany and an outstanding relationship with dlr , " said charles bolden , nasa 's administrator , in a statement posted to nasa 's website .
" today 's signing will further enhance our ability to work closely together in a variety of mutually beneficial activities in virtually every nasa mission area . "

germany 's new policy also abandons the moon as a solo national goal , but plans on continuing further study as part of european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , and now nasa , projects .
almost four years ago , german government officials had previously announced plans for a 2013 moon flight , and in 2009 , another government official called for an unmanned moon mission in 2015 .
" the moon is for us , the most important goal for the next 20 years , " said hubert reile , aerospace director of the dlr , in an interview with the german press agency , dpa .

ahead of the talks , prime minister donald tusk announced that us treatment of poland in negotiations over the shield had stripped his country of " all illusions " it had of its nato ally .
obama scrapped his predecessor 's plans to base radar and interceptor missiles in eastern european nato member states back in 2009 as part of his campaign to " reset " relations with moscow .
russia 's objection to the deployment of missiles on its borders led to obama modifying the plans last year , opting to deploy medium- and short-range missile interceptors in poland instead .
at a nato-russia summit in lisbon on nov .
20 , the two former cold war foes agreed to cooperate on missile defense , a factor seen as crucial to improving relations .
in response to nato 's approach , russia agreed to cooperate with the alliance in afghanistan .
the two sides are scheduled to begin discussions next week on how to link nato 's and russia 's separate systems to provide a joint shield aimed at protecting europe against incoming missiles from rogue nations .
a final viability study is expected in july 2011 .
wikileaks reveals nato plans to expand shield to baltics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's baltic members lobbied for inclusion in the shield plan however , further revelations could ratchet up the simmering tensions at these negotiations .
in addition to revealing poland 's fear of russia and the widely held belief among nato member states in the baltics and central europe that russia , their former ally , is their greatest security threat , the latest wikileaks cables also exposed nato plans to extend the missile defense plan to include former soviet states estonia , latvia and lithuania .
the documents also revealed that nine divisions of nato troops would be involved in the protective deployment in the baltics , including soldiers from the us , britain , germany and poland .
the cables claim the expansion was prompted by fierce lobbying by the baltic states and pressure from poland for nato to renew its commitment to its security .
germany was also named as being a major force in pushing through the expansion which has been accepted and integrated into nato plans , according to media reports .
signed by us secretary of state hillary clinton , the cables also detailed plans by nato to keep the expansion secret as not to heighten tensions between the alliance and russia .
russia considers own security as missile deal sours the revelations pertaining to the extended missile shield have bewildered and angered russia just weeks after its breakthrough summit with nato .
russian president dmitry medvedev said the latest leaks showed the " cynicism " of us foreign policy , while prime minister vladimir putin said any " additional threats " on its borders would be counteracted by russian military deployments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us-nato decisions to expand the shield have angered russia " the latest wikileaks revelations that nato had drawn up a secret contingency plan for the defense of poland and the baltic states from potential russian military aggression certainly raised some eyebrows in moscow , " jan gaspers , an expert on european security and defense policy at the university of cambridge 's center of international studies , told deutsche welle .
" selling the planned nato missile defense shield as being exclusively directed against middle eastern rogue states and specifically iran will now become even more difficult . "
while both medvedev and putin claimed that the leaks were of " no consequence " and would not damage us-russia relations , nato 's amendment of its missile shield ambitions has certainly put moscow on alert .
" at the latest nato summit in lisbon , russia was invited to take part in nato 's missile defense scheme , " said gaspers . however , he added that the hostile atmosphere at the osce astana summit at the beginning of this month had once again underlined how difficult cooperation between nato and russia on missile defense and transatlantic security more generally is likely to be .
" russia agreed with the shield but added conditions by introducing a joint nato-russia threat assessment , which many nato members are not keen on doing at all , " jana kobzova , a russia and eastern europe expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
moscow hardens stance ; europe pushes for shield completion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said excluding russia would have consequences putin told cnn television that russia would " ensure its own security " by deploying " new strike forces " and nuclear weapons on its borders with eastern europe should the shield go ahead without them .
reports in the us media suggest that russia moved tactical nuclear warheads to within miles of its border with nato states as recently as late spring in an apparent response to us-nato missile defense installations in these neighboring countries .
" what was launched in lisbon was a long process of negotiations between nato and russia , " kozova said .
" medvedev 's and putin 's statements are aimed at increasing the stakes in these negotiations . " in kozova 's opinion the statements are also face-saving measures aimed at a domestic audience in the aftermath of the agreement in lisbon .
" the russian public still perceives nato as a cold war adversary , and even though russia agreed to closer cooperation with nato , this does not mean that russian politicians will change their rhetoric . "
experts believe that , even if russia is left out and reacts belligerently , the missile shield will still go ahead with european powerhouses like germany pushing the us and nato to commit to securing the continent from external threats .
" however , this commitment will most likely be attached to further concessions on part of certain nato member states in the sphere of nuclear disarmament , " gaspers said .
" indeed , under the current coalition government , the struggle for a world free from nuclear weapons has become a core tenet of german foreign policy .
accordingly , a lot of germany 's nato diplomacy in the months to come will continue to focus on this topic . "

the find suggests there could be mountains made of diamond nearby . a team at the massachusetts institute of technology researching a large gaseous exoplanet , or a planet outside our solar system , have discovered an unusual composition of its atmosphere that could redefine our understanding of how life is formed .
the study was published wednesday in the journal nature .
the planet , known as wasp-12b , is 1.4 times the mass of jupiter and located about 1,200 light years away and was discovered in 2009 by researchers at the united kingdom-based consortium for wide angle search for planets -lrb- wasp -rrb- , who are also co-authors of the new study .

she is the lead author of the study , and now a postdoctoral researcher at princeton university , in the united states . although wasp-12b is a " hot jupiter " - a jupiter-sized , extremely hot planet consisting mainly of gas - and is therefore unlikely to host life , scientists believe the planet 's unique chemistry could overturn our notions of the necessary ingredients for life .
rocky neighbors the researchers believe the abundance of carbon was due to the formation of the planet from rocky materials high in carbon as opposed to icy bodies like comets .
this suggests that there may be an entire range of carbon abundances available for making planets in that system .
if there are any rocky planets in the system , it is likely they are covered in tar-like substances rich in organic substances – since carbon is one of what scientists consider the six essential elements of life -lrb- the other five being oxygen , hydrogen , nitrogen , phosphorus and sulphur -rrb- .
if detected , these smaller planets could also have carbon-rich atmospheres , and any life might have to survive with very little water and oxygen and an abundance of methane .
this is difficult to square with our current knowledge of the chemical properties of life .

hellier believes this is easily imaginable .
" it 's quite possible that there are rocky planets in that system , even though they are too small for us to detect , " he said .
" if there are , then they would have carbon-rich rock , rather than what we have on earth , which is very oxygen-rich – most of the earth 's crust is made out of rock that is roughly half oxygen .

ahead of the talks , prime minister donald tusk announced that us treatment of poland in negotiations over the shield had stripped his country of " all illusions " it had of its nato ally .
obama scrapped his predecessor 's plans to base radar and interceptor missiles in eastern european nato member states back in 2009 as part of his campaign to " reset " relations with moscow .
russia 's objection to the deployment of missiles on its borders led to obama modifying the plans last year , opting to deploy medium- and short-range missile interceptors in poland instead .
at a nato-russia summit in lisbon on nov .
20 , the two former cold war foes agreed to cooperate on missile defense , a factor seen as crucial to improving relations .
in response to nato 's approach , russia agreed to cooperate with the alliance in afghanistan .
the two sides are scheduled to begin discussions next week on how to link nato 's and russia 's separate systems to provide a joint shield aimed at protecting europe against incoming missiles from rogue nations .
a final viability study is expected in july 2011 .
wikileaks reveals nato plans to expand shield to baltics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's baltic members lobbied for inclusion in the shield plan however , further revelations could ratchet up the simmering tensions at these negotiations .
in addition to revealing poland 's fear of russia and the widely held belief among nato member states in the baltics and central europe that russia , their former ally , is their greatest security threat , the latest wikileaks cables also exposed nato plans to extend the missile defense plan to include former soviet states estonia , latvia and lithuania .
the documents also revealed that nine divisions of nato troops would be involved in the protective deployment in the baltics , including soldiers from the us , britain , germany and poland .
the cables claim the expansion was prompted by fierce lobbying by the baltic states and pressure from poland for nato to renew its commitment to its security .
germany was also named as being a major force in pushing through the expansion which has been accepted and integrated into nato plans , according to media reports .
signed by us secretary of state hillary clinton , the cables also detailed plans by nato to keep the expansion secret as not to heighten tensions between the alliance and russia .
russia considers own security as missile deal sours the revelations pertaining to the extended missile shield have bewildered and angered russia just weeks after its breakthrough summit with nato .
russian president dmitry medvedev said the latest leaks showed the " cynicism " of us foreign policy , while prime minister vladimir putin said any " additional threats " on its borders would be counteracted by russian military deployments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us-nato decisions to expand the shield have angered russia " the latest wikileaks revelations that nato had drawn up a secret contingency plan for the defense of poland and the baltic states from potential russian military aggression certainly raised some eyebrows in moscow , " jan gaspers , an expert on european security and defense policy at the university of cambridge 's center of international studies , told deutsche welle .
" selling the planned nato missile defense shield as being exclusively directed against middle eastern rogue states and specifically iran will now become even more difficult . "
while both medvedev and putin claimed that the leaks were of " no consequence " and would not damage us-russia relations , nato 's amendment of its missile shield ambitions has certainly put moscow on alert .
" at the latest nato summit in lisbon , russia was invited to take part in nato 's missile defense scheme , " said gaspers . however , he added that the hostile atmosphere at the osce astana summit at the beginning of this month had once again underlined how difficult cooperation between nato and russia on missile defense and transatlantic security more generally is likely to be .
" russia agreed with the shield but added conditions by introducing a joint nato-russia threat assessment , which many nato members are not keen on doing at all , " jana kobzova , a russia and eastern europe expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
moscow hardens stance ; europe pushes for shield completion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said excluding russia would have consequences putin told cnn television that russia would " ensure its own security " by deploying " new strike forces " and nuclear weapons on its borders with eastern europe should the shield go ahead without them .
reports in the us media suggest that russia moved tactical nuclear warheads to within miles of its border with nato states as recently as late spring in an apparent response to us-nato missile defense installations in these neighboring countries .
" what was launched in lisbon was a long process of negotiations between nato and russia , " kozova said .
" medvedev 's and putin 's statements are aimed at increasing the stakes in these negotiations . " in kozova 's opinion the statements are also face-saving measures aimed at a domestic audience in the aftermath of the agreement in lisbon .
" the russian public still perceives nato as a cold war adversary , and even though russia agreed to closer cooperation with nato , this does not mean that russian politicians will change their rhetoric . "
experts believe that , even if russia is left out and reacts belligerently , the missile shield will still go ahead with european powerhouses like germany pushing the us and nato to commit to securing the continent from external threats .
" however , this commitment will most likely be attached to further concessions on part of certain nato member states in the sphere of nuclear disarmament , " gaspers said .
" indeed , under the current coalition government , the struggle for a world free from nuclear weapons has become a core tenet of german foreign policy .
accordingly , a lot of germany 's nato diplomacy in the months to come will continue to focus on this topic . "

nasa also agrees to make germany an associate partner in its lunar science institute in california . in an agreement signed in washington , d.c. on wednesday , the german space agency , better known by its german acronym dlr , and its american counterpart , nasa , agreed to cooperate more fully on joint operations , planetary observations , and other forms of space science .
the move comes just a week after the german government outlined its new space strategy , where it said germany would expand public investments in space science from its current 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- annually to 1.4 billion euros by 2014 .
that policy also underscored increased collaboration with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , where germany is currently the second-largest funder nation after france .
" many space missions and projects can only be carried out through international cooperation , with nasa for example , because of their complexity and the associated costs , " said johann-dietrich worner , dlr 's chairman , in a statement posted to the dlr 's website .
" this is why dlr , as germany 's national space agency and research center , is endeavoring to set up bilateral collaborations such as this , in addition to its other commitments . "
his american counterpart was equally positive on the new agreement .
" nasa has a long history of successful cooperation with the government of germany and an outstanding relationship with dlr , " said charles bolden , nasa 's administrator , in a statement posted to nasa 's website .
" today 's signing will further enhance our ability to work closely together in a variety of mutually beneficial activities in virtually every nasa mission area . "
germany to continue lunar focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one german official called the moon " the most important goal " in the same deal , nasa also agreed to make the dlr a nasa lunar science institute associate partner .
the institute , which is based in northern california , brings together moon specialists from around the globe to collaborate on their research .
germany 's new policy also abandons the moon as a solo national goal , but plans on continuing further study as part of european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , and now nasa , projects .
almost four years ago , german government officials had previously announced plans for a 2013 moon flight , and in 2009 , another government official called for an unmanned moon mission in 2015 .
" the moon is for us , the most important goal for the next 20 years , " said hubert reile , aerospace director of the dlr , in an interview with the german press agency , dpa .

berlin seems keen on the idea . german interior minister thomas de maiziere is reportedly planning to revolutionize the country 's police force , in a bid to better manage modern dangers like terror threats .
on thursday , a panel of experts commissioned by de maiziere presented their final report to parliament in berlin , suggesting that some kind of merger of the country 's two main policing bodies would help law enforcers respond to terror threats and other 21st century issues .
" to me , the principal suggestion of creating one ' federal police ' out of the federation 's police forces seems convincing and worthy of consideration and pursuit , " interior minister de maiziere said in response to the report .
currently , the federal police -lrb- bundespolizei -rrb- fulfils the more traditional policing role - patrolling beats , dealing with public safety , minor crimes , traffic accidents and so forth - while the federal criminal police office -lrb- bundeskriminalamt or bka -rrb- investigates more serious crimes .
newspaper reports , attributing their information to participants of a recent high-level meeting between the interior ministry and the expert commission , say that merging elements of these forces would help the police to better deal with problems like terror threats - which require a combination of centralized intelligence and rapid local response .
germany has been on a heightened terror alert for several weeks , and this is not likely to change before christmas .
no german fbi the commission said a new security force would not be comparable to the federal bureau of investigation -lrb- fbi -rrb- in the us , as the german constitution clearly seperates police duties on a federal and state level .
according to the koelner stadtanzeiger daily , the two organizations would not have to move , the bka would keep its hq in wiesbaden , and the bundespolizei would stay in potsdam .
interior minister de maiziere also insisted that any changes would not be part of a downsizing scheme .
" the goal here , however , is definitely not to cut jobs , " de maiziere said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the potential merger might be inspired by the fbi in the us the newspaper posits that the bka would be responsible for serious and slightly serious crimes , while the bundespolizei would focus on protecting the public .
the commission report argues that the third main arm of german police , the customs and border control service -lrb- zollkriminalamt -rrb- , should remain an independent entity .
however , the report also recommended that customs officers with a role similar to that of a police officer should coordinate more closely with the german police force , and should fall under the jurisdiction of the interior ministry .
similarly , the federal office for information security - germany 's " internet police " – should work in closer conjunction with the bka .
reform by 2013 ?
" if we go ahead with this , then i would call for us to begin organizing the changes swiftly , even during the current legislative period , " de maiziere told the german parliament .
according to reports in the german press , if a draft law moved smoothly through the houses of parliament , a final bill might be ready by the end of the 2012 legislature period , and implemented the following year .
the investigative commission was chaired by eckhart wertebach , the former president of germany 's constitutional protection committee .
currently , roughly 5,500 people work for the major crimes unit , the bka , and the federal police force employs around 40,000 people .

norbert roettgen called on states to follow germany 's lead and launch a " rethink " on climate change .
" in business , politics and society , we no longer see climate change as a threat , but an opportunity and a challenge , " said roettgen in a speech to delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment minister said a multilateral approach is needed in cancun he said that germany had invested in tackling climate change and as a result it had created jobs and opportunities .
rich vs poor countries major deadlocks have emerged at cancun between rich and developing nations , largely over how to lower greenhouse-gas emissions .
despite wide agreement on issues such as tackling deforestation , adaptation , technology and climate financing , there is little compromise on either side over limiting co2 emissions that cause climate change .
the european union and the united states want more scrutiny of emerging powers ' actions on climate change and anchoring voluntary emission pledges into the wider un process .
eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard said there had been " no sign of progress on the crunch issues . "
meanwhile developing nations put the onus on industrial powers to back an extension of the kyoto protocol , a treaty limiting the gas emissions of wealthy countries that is set to expire in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu climate commissioner hedegaard said little progress has been made the us never ratified kyoto and china was exempted – and now japan is leading a bloc of countries that refuse to back a new treaty without the world 's two largest polluters .
deadline looms the talks end on friday and roettgen told reporters it was now a " difficult point " as the deadline draws close .
however , mexico 's foreign minister , who is chairing the talks said a comprehensive deal among the 190 countries was " within reach . "
" we need to work together in finding the balance that will make cancun a success , " patricia espinosa said .
her comments were echoed by the eu climate commissioner .
" to come out of cancun with nothing is simply not an option , " hedegaard said .

ahead of the talks , prime minister donald tusk announced that us treatment of poland in negotiations over the shield had stripped his country of " all illusions " it had of its nato ally .
obama scrapped his predecessor 's plans to base radar and interceptor missiles in eastern european nato member states back in 2009 as part of his campaign to " reset " relations with moscow .
russia 's objection to the deployment of missiles on its borders led to obama modifying the plans last year , opting to deploy medium- and short-range missile interceptors in poland instead .
at a nato-russia summit in lisbon on nov .
20 , the two former cold war foes agreed to cooperate on missile defense , a factor seen as crucial to improving relations .
in response to nato 's approach , russia agreed to cooperate with the alliance in afghanistan .
the two sides are scheduled to begin discussions next week on how to link nato 's and russia 's separate systems to provide a joint shield aimed at protecting europe against incoming missiles from rogue nations .
a final viability study is expected in july 2011 .
wikileaks reveals nato plans to expand shield to baltics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's baltic members lobbied for inclusion in the shield plan however , further revelations could ratchet up the simmering tensions at these negotiations .
in addition to revealing poland 's fear of russia and the widely held belief among nato member states in the baltics and central europe that russia , their former ally , is their greatest security threat , the latest wikileaks cables also exposed nato plans to extend the missile defense plan to include former soviet states estonia , latvia and lithuania .
the documents also revealed that nine divisions of nato troops would be involved in the protective deployment in the baltics , including soldiers from the us , britain , germany and poland .
the cables claim the expansion was prompted by fierce lobbying by the baltic states and pressure from poland for nato to renew its commitment to its security .
germany was also named as being a major force in pushing through the expansion which has been accepted and integrated into nato plans , according to media reports .
signed by us secretary of state hillary clinton , the cables also detailed plans by nato to keep the expansion secret as not to heighten tensions between the alliance and russia .
russia considers own security as missile deal sours the revelations pertaining to the extended missile shield have bewildered and angered russia just weeks after its breakthrough summit with nato .
russian president dmitry medvedev said the latest leaks showed the " cynicism " of us foreign policy , while prime minister vladimir putin said any " additional threats " on its borders would be counteracted by russian military deployments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us-nato decisions to expand the shield have angered russia " the latest wikileaks revelations that nato had drawn up a secret contingency plan for the defense of poland and the baltic states from potential russian military aggression certainly raised some eyebrows in moscow , " jan gaspers , an expert on european security and defense policy at the university of cambridge 's center of international studies , told deutsche welle .
" selling the planned nato missile defense shield as being exclusively directed against middle eastern rogue states and specifically iran will now become even more difficult . "
while both medvedev and putin claimed that the leaks were of " no consequence " and would not damage us-russia relations , nato 's amendment of its missile shield ambitions has certainly put moscow on alert .
" at the latest nato summit in lisbon , russia was invited to take part in nato 's missile defense scheme , " said gaspers . however , he added that the hostile atmosphere at the osce astana summit at the beginning of this month had once again underlined how difficult cooperation between nato and russia on missile defense and transatlantic security more generally is likely to be .
" russia agreed with the shield but added conditions by introducing a joint nato-russia threat assessment , which many nato members are not keen on doing at all , " jana kobzova , a russia and eastern europe expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
moscow hardens stance ; europe pushes for shield completion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said excluding russia would have consequences putin told cnn television that russia would " ensure its own security " by deploying " new strike forces " and nuclear weapons on its borders with eastern europe should the shield go ahead without them .
reports in the us media suggest that russia moved tactical nuclear warheads to within miles of its border with nato states as recently as late spring in an apparent response to us-nato missile defense installations in these neighboring countries .
" what was launched in lisbon was a long process of negotiations between nato and russia , " kozova said .
" medvedev 's and putin 's statements are aimed at increasing the stakes in these negotiations . " in kozova 's opinion the statements are also face-saving measures aimed at a domestic audience in the aftermath of the agreement in lisbon .
" the russian public still perceives nato as a cold war adversary , and even though russia agreed to closer cooperation with nato , this does not mean that russian politicians will change their rhetoric . "
experts believe that , even if russia is left out and reacts belligerently , the missile shield will still go ahead with european powerhouses like germany pushing the us and nato to commit to securing the continent from external threats .
" however , this commitment will most likely be attached to further concessions on part of certain nato member states in the sphere of nuclear disarmament , " gaspers said .
" indeed , under the current coalition government , the struggle for a world free from nuclear weapons has become a core tenet of german foreign policy .
accordingly , a lot of germany 's nato diplomacy in the months to come will continue to focus on this topic . "

he spoke of men and women " far more deserving of the prize " than him - and he meant people like liu xiaobo .
imprisoned in china , liu received this year 's nobel peace prize after more than two decades of an arduous , non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in china .
obama , on the other hand , received the award for a vision , a change in tone in international relations , and , many argue , in an attempt to settle accounts with his predecessor , george w. bush .
a dissatisfying record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's vision of a world free of nuclear weapons impressed not only the nobel committee while obama has kept his promise of withdrawing combat troops from iraq , he has n't followed through on many of the political projects he received the nobel peace prize for : a new strategic arms reduction treaty with russia , the closing of guantanamo bay detention camp , and a real step forward in meeting the world 's climate challenges .
but who 's to blame ?
did obama lose the moral compass he assigned so much importance to in his nobel speech ?
facing an adverse political climate " obama 's standpoints are better than his record , " marco fey from the peace research institute frankfurt told deutsche welle .
" on a variety of issues , he 's caught in the political climate in the us . "
fey cited the arms reduction treaty ' new start ' as a fitting example .
obama and russian president dmitry medvedev signed the treaty in april 2010 , but it has n't been ratified by the senate so far .
" obama , senior department of state officials , they all support the treaty , " fey said .
" it would be a real milestone in terms of arms control .
but republicans use the most absurd arguments to block it in the senate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the closure of guantanamo bay detention camp remains uncertain political capital is scarce obama 's decision to close down the detention camp at guantanamo bay has met fierce congressional opposition as well . but critics argue that obama has n't really invested his political capital in the measure compared to other projects he pushed through congress - such as health care reform .
the recent conviction of canadian citizen omar ahmed khadr who was brought to guantanamo 's military prison at the age of 16 , exemplifies obama 's lack of self-assertion in putting an end to the facility and its practice .
" who would have thought that , under obama , someone who 's accused of a crime committed at the age of 15 would be tried before a military commission at guantanamo ? "
reed brody from human rights watch told deutsche welle .
promoting human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is this year 's recipient of the nobel peace prize indeed , obama promised to be a persistent advocate of human rights at home and abroad . he has frequently underscored the significance of peaceful activists like liu xiaobo - the first chinese recipient of the award .
liu was an influential participant of the tiananmen protests in 1989 and is a leading author of charta 08 , a manifesto promoting fundamental human rights and democratization in china .
in december 2009 , after a series of earlier internments , he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for " inciting subversion of state power . "
obama and other heads of state have called on the chinese government to release liu .
however , critics argue that obama has failed to make human rights a guiding principle of us relations with other countries - highlighted and , some say , undermined by obama 's recent efforts to expand chinese-american cooperation .
" it 's not helpful when the government repeatedly describes human rights and democracy as issues on which the us and china will inevitably disagree , " brody said . a vision 's prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , al gore gave his nobel speech at oslo 's city hall whether attributed to obama 's political environment or his setting of priorities , the gap between obama 's vision and his actual achievements remains a fact .
yet , obama is sticking to his optimistic rhetoric and continues to set visionary goals , for example , regarding the middle east peace process .
" he 's set the goal of reaching a peace accord within a year , " said fey .
" that 's a very ambitious undertaking . "
as the clash of idealistic expectations and political pragmatism continues to haunt obama 's presidency , one is reminded of what al gore said during his nobel speech in 2007 : " we have everything we need to get started , save perhaps political will , but political will is a renewable resource . "

deutsche welle caught up with him at the un climate summit . on december 6 , the swedish parliament awarded nnimmo bassey the so-called " alternative nobel prize " in recognition of his inspired work to strengthen the environmental movement in his home country of nigeria and throughout africa .
as executive director of environmental rights action in nigeria and chair of friends of the earth international , bassey has become one of africa 's leading advocates for environmental protection and human rights .
he has been particularly influential in mobilizing resistance to multinational oil corporations in his country , drawing attention to the environmental devastation they leave behind and their disregard for the rights of the local population .
after receiving his award in stockholm , bassey traveled to cancun , mexico , where deutsche welle interviewed him on the sidelines of the un climate summit .
deutsche welle : how did you feel when you got the prize ?
nnimmo bassey : when i stood on the platform to receive the reward my mind went to many , many things .
and particularly to a fellow nigerian who won the award in 1994 – the late ken saro wiwa , our number one environmentalist and defender of the environment who was executed in 1995 .
he won the award in 1994 .
and when i stood up there , i knew i was standing on the shoulders of a great man who showed me how to fight for environmental justice and how to resist big corporations who are bent not only on destroying nigeria , but on destroying the climate - destroying the climate of the world by pollution and by release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
are you afraid of facing the same fate as ken saro wiwa ?
no , i am not .
i work with the people , i stand with the people , i am running with the people and there is no option !
you know working with people resisting destructive extraction , working with communities and mass movements who are defending the planet is not an option for me .
and so i look at the people , and i join the people , and i know that we are on the right path .
there is no time for fear .
looking at the negotiations here in cancun , do you feel they are focused on the things that really matter , for example oil extraction , destruction of the environment and climate change ? i think the negotiations to a large extent are not focusing on the real issues .
climate change is caused by very fundamental structural , systemic problems .
one of which is the crisis driven by the market .
all the negotiators talk about is how to use the market to soften global warming - carbon offsetting by planting a tree somewhere in africa while you keep polluting in europe .
this is not a solution , because pollution emissions have to stop at the source .
and they are not talking about lifestyle changes ; they are not talking about less consumption and less of production .
now we have big everything : big oil , big water , big fish ; and everything is coming to an end .
and we would expect our negotiators to look at this problem , the problem of overconsumption and overproduction .
we do n't have more than one planet and we can not go on at the speed and the rate and the direction that we are going now .
we can not keep pushing on with fossil-fuel driven civilization .
we have gone beyond half of the known reserves in the world and we 've done this in only a couple of years , maybe 100 years or so .
how are we going to run on a half tank until eternity ?
you see , it is impossible .
so our leaders are here to talk about how to get money , how not to make commitments or reduce emissions and other , poorer countries are looking at how they can get funding from mitigation .
when temperatures increase due to non-binding targets , at five degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels , no amount of money for mitigation , no amount of money for whatever you do is going to suffice .
we will not know life as it is any more .

but some are also unhappy with the decision . not many among the 1.3 billion chinese had heard the name of liu xiaobo before october .
but thanks to an official media campaign against the 54-year old activist , he is now better known than ever .
chinese media campaign against liu the chinese media have reported that liu is being awarded the nobel prize because he has tried to sabotage the " peaceful rise of china " for years .
he has been compared to the dalai lama who got the prize in 1989 and is regarded as a separatist by beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is regarded as a separatist by the chinese government according to chinese media reports , liu xiaobo has been used by western countries as a political tool in order to weaken china and throw the country into chaos .
the nobel peace prize was described as an award to liu for committing treason .
does china need 300 years of colonialism ?
the chinese media have been trying to discredit liu xiaobo in many ways .
for example , they published quotes of liu saying that china would need at least 300 years of colonialism in order to develop properly .
but those lines were quoted out of context , says jin zhong , a journalist based in hong kong .
he is the publisher and editor-in-chief of the liberal magazine " kaifang " – or " open " .
when liu visited hong kong for the first time in 1988 , he was impressed by the freedom and wealth of the then british colony , remembers jin .
when jin asked liu how china should develop in the future , liu answered somewhat ironically : " china needs at least 300 years of colonialism , if hong kong has needed 100 years for this kind of freedom and prosperity . "
debate within the chinese internet community " of course he was exaggerating , " recalls jin , " liu has been a strong supporter of western-style democracy and freedom . "
still , liu 's quote has been widely discussed within the chinese internet community .
patriotic users are upset , whereas their critics wonder why the chinese cadres are sending their offspring abroad to study in western countries , if they are so negative about the west .
honoring china 's democrats most chinese liberal thinkers welcome the nobel peace prize for liu .
they say that it is not only an award for liu ’ s commitment to more democracy in china , it is in fact honoring the whole chinese democracy movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is a co-initiator of the charter ' 08 " there is no better candidate for this prize , " says qian yuejun , a chinese dissident based in germany , " he was the only choice within the chinese pro-democracy movement who really deserves the award . "
in 2008 , liu xiaobo was one of the initiators of the so-called charter ' 08 – a manifesto demanding more democracy and freedom within china .
two days before it was published , liu was arrested and later sentenced to eleven years in prison on subversion charges .
" as co-initiator , liu has gathered over ten thousand supporters for the charter ' 08 within a short period .
no one else within the divided pro-democracy movement can be as convincing as liu .
he is the only one who can mobilize so many people , " explains qian .
divided movement but among the critics of the communist regime , there are also voices against liu xiaobo .
in their eyes , he is too ready to compromise .
" for an intellectual , liu ’ s thinking is very problematic .
he has studied marxist ideology during his time in university , " argues zhong weiguang , another chinese dissident living in germany .
" he embodies the communist ideology .
that is why he doesn ’ t deserve the nobel peace prize . "

in another five years , there will be 47 dams on the tributaries of the mekong .

that is important because millions in the region rely on this free resource for nutrition and food security .

rights group amnesty international , which organized the demonstration , attempted to use the event to hand over a petition signed by some 100,000 people in support of liu .
however , the gates to the embassy remained locked and all windows were shuttered , leading to the protestors piling up the signed petitions outside the building perimeter .
" the chinese government should be celebrating this global recognition of a chinese writer and activist , " said ai secretary general salil shetty .

rights group amnesty international , which organized the demonstration , attempted to use the event to hand over a petition signed by some 100,000 people in support of liu .
however , the gates to the embassy remained locked and all windows were shuttered , leading to the protestors piling up the signed petitions outside the building perimeter .

koenig stressed to german deputy national security advisor rolf nikel the potential negative implications for bilateral relations between germany and the us , in particular counter-terrorism cooperation , if steps were taken to " seek the arrest or extradition of us citizens / officials , " the documents said .
thirteen operatives , believed to be cia , were eventually charged in indictments in munich and spain , as investigators concluded that the plane that transported masri passed through spanish territory .

the find suggests there could be mountains made of diamond nearby . a team at the massachusetts institute of technology researching a large gaseous exoplanet , or a planet outside our solar system , have discovered an unusual composition of its atmosphere that could redefine our understanding of how life is formed .
the study was published wednesday in the journal nature .
the planet , known as wasp-12b , is 1.4 times the mass of jupiter and located about 1,200 light years away and was discovered in 2009 by researchers at the united kingdom-based consortium for wide angle search for planets -lrb- wasp -rrb- , who are also co-authors of the new study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the so far undetected neighbors of wasp-12b could harbor strange life " this is new territory and will motivate researchers to study what the interiors of carbon-rich planets could be made of , " said nikku madhusudhan , in a statement .
she is the lead author of the study , and now a postdoctoral researcher at princeton university , in the united states . although wasp-12b is a " hot jupiter " - a jupiter-sized , extremely hot planet consisting mainly of gas - and is therefore unlikely to host life , scientists believe the planet 's unique chemistry could overturn our notions of the necessary ingredients for life .
rocky neighbors the researchers believe the abundance of carbon was due to the formation of the planet from rocky materials high in carbon as opposed to icy bodies like comets .
this suggests that there may be an entire range of carbon abundances available for making planets in that system .
if there are any rocky planets in the system , it is likely they are covered in tar-like substances rich in organic substances – since carbon is one of what scientists consider the six essential elements of life -lrb- the other five being oxygen , hydrogen , nitrogen , phosphorus and sulphur -rrb- .
if detected , these smaller planets could also have carbon-rich atmospheres , and any life might have to survive with very little water and oxygen and an abundance of methane .
this is difficult to square with our current knowledge of the chemical properties of life .
but since nasa recently purported to have discovered bacteria that had replaced the phosphorus in its dna with arsenic , scientists may soon be forced to re-consider their assessment of the necessary conditions and elements of life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study of exoplanets is one of the newest branches of astronomy other researchers said that these are considerations for the future .
" the honest answer is that that 's very speculative , " said coel hellier , a professor of astrophysics at keele university in the united kingdom , and another co-author of the paper , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we do n't really know whether life could live in that sort of environment .
there are certainly a lot of planets out there that do have very methane-rich atmospheres and very little oxygen , so it 's certainly worth thinking about . "
diamond mountains the other striking image that the paper posits suggests that the possible rocky planets near wasp-12b could have mountains made of diamond .
hellier believes this is easily imaginable .
" it 's quite possible that there are rocky planets in that system , even though they are too small for us to detect , " he said .
" if there are , then they would have carbon-rich rock , rather than what we have on earth , which is very oxygen-rich – most of the earth 's crust is made out of rock that is roughly half oxygen .
if you have rock in an environment that is very carbon-rich , then you 'd expect to have rocks which could be diamond or graphite , which are different forms of carbon . "
astronomers can figure out a planet 's atmospheric composition by observing its flux , or the light emitted by the planet , at different wavelengths .
the team , coordinated by joe harrington , a planetary scientist at the university of central florida , used nasa 's spitzer space telescope to observe the flux from wasp-12b , at four wavelengths , right before it passed behind its star , an event known as secondary eclipse .
while the first exoplanet was only discovered 15 years ago , there has been an extremely rapid rate of growth since then . " astronomers have now found about 500 of them in total , " heiller added . " we 're really now for the first time able to actually measure and detect what their atmospheres are made of .
this is a significant step towards showing that we now have the technology to do that . "
a cautious view frederic pont , senior lecturer in astrophysics at the university of exeter in the uk , admires the analysis behind the new paper , but is wary of excitable media reports and premature conclusions . " it ’ s very good work , the team is excellent , " he told deutsche welle .
" it ’ s very interesting , but there are i think just seven data points .
usually if you want to take a spectroscopy of a planet you ’ re talking about hundreds of points , so with seven points you need a lot of interpolation . " pont lamented the tendency to oversimplification in the media coverage of new exoplanetary discoveries .
" it ’ s work in progress , right ? " he said .
" usually the way it works is this : a result is published , and then the debate starts , and maybe two or three years later we know what was correct or not .
but in the media we get the impression that the scientific paper is the discovery . " " it ’ s a very complex set of hypotheses to get to these results , " he said of the wasp-12b paper .
" they don ’ t see carbon and oxygen , they see the indirect signature of some molecules and they have to assume the carbon and oxygen equilibrium .
but the results themselves are extraordinary .
they are really at the forefront of what we can do . "

the mekong rises in the tibetan plateau and runs almost 5,000 kilometres through six countries – including laos and cambodia – before it meets the sea in vietnam .
need for more energy countries like laos and cambodia need electricity for their own purposes and to export to their energy-hungry neighbors .

it is a question that has grown more urgent in recent years .
in another five years , there will be 47 dams on the tributaries of the mekong .

freshwater fish provide up to 80 percent of the protein eaten by cambodians , and at least one-third of fish in this river are migratory species .

a planned free trade deal will be the main issue on the agenda .
negotiations have been going on since 2007 , but have hit many stumbling blocks . the european union is india 's largest trade partner with a bilateral trade volume of about 70 billion euros -lrb- 92 billion dollars -rrb- in 2009 .
this figure is projected to grow to over 106 billion euros -lrb- 130 billion dollars -rrb- once a free trade agreement becomes reality .
but the eu insists that india must meet certain conditions first : it should do more to fight global warming and to address social problems such as child labor .
india is unhappy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is unhappy about the eu 's concessions to pakistan rajendra kumar jain , professor of international politics at new delhi 's renowned jawaharlal nehru university is skeptical .
" ever since the negotiations started , india has been emphasizing that no issues must be part of the agreement which are not related to trade or the economy .
my guess is that , due to the pressure by the european parliament , there will be some kind of unclear wording in the end to make everyone happy , " says jain .
he adds that there are other conflicts as well - for example about intellectual property rights or the extension of eu patent rights to india - which would drive up prices of generic drugs in india .
india is also unhappy that the eu announced temporary trade concessions for neighboring pakistan after the floods there .
the measures are meant to help pakistan 's cotton farmers to recover from the disaster .
but delhi has already made it clear that india does not appreciate this kind of emergency relief .
jain says eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the president of the european council , herman van rompuy are sure to raise the issue in their talks with indian prime minister manmohan singh and commerce minister anand sharma .
" india has emphasized two things : first , such trade concessions are against the wto principles .
and second , india has pointed out that the pakistani textile exporters and cotton farmers , whom the eu is planning to support , are not even in the flood-affected regions .
now the eu is probably going to try to convince india not to involve the wto in this .
but this is going to be difficult , because india is a cotton exporter too , and would therefore suffer from these concessions , " asserts jain .
terrorism , and india 's bid for un membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council some observers believe that the eu has neglected its relations with india to some extent , compared to its ties with china .
but jain believes this is changing now .
" i do think that the european union has changed its behavior , mainly because the us has been courting the indians .
nevertheless , china remains the europeans ' number one priority .
but they are worried because india has already struck free trade deals with many , particularly asian countries .
and the eu does not want to be shut out of the huge indian market with its more than a billion consumers . "
besides trade issues , india 's quest for permanent membership of the un security council , as well as terrorism and other security issues , are also expected to be on the agenda in brussels .
after the eu-india summit , prime minister manmohan singh is due to travel to berlin for talks with german chancellor angela merkel on saturday .

the mekong rises in the tibetan plateau and runs almost 5,000 kilometres through six countries – including laos and cambodia – before it meets the sea in vietnam .

the mekong and its tributaries offer a logical solution – why not dam the river , and push the water through turbines to generate power ?
it is a question that has grown more urgent in recent years .
in another five years , there will be 47 dams on the tributaries of the mekong .
around a dozen more are planned for the mainstream .
but campaigners say blocking the mekong will severely damage fish migration , and cripple fish catches .
that is important because millions in the region rely on this free resource for nutrition and food security .
freshwater fish provide up to 80 percent of the protein eaten by cambodians , and at least one-third of fish in this river are migratory species .
hazards of development a recent projection highlighted the risks if a proposed 11 dams are built on the mainstream of the mekong river – two of them in cambodia .
that would add to 77 dams that are already built or planned for tributaries of the mekong over the next two decades .

" we calculated that the loss of fish by 2030 , if the 11 mainstream dams are built , would amount to between 600,000 tons and 900,000 tons every year .

but some are also unhappy with the decision . not many among the 1.3 billion chinese had heard the name of liu xiaobo before october .
but thanks to an official media campaign against the 54-year old activist , he is now better known than ever .
chinese media campaign against liu the chinese media have reported that liu is being awarded the nobel prize because he has tried to sabotage the " peaceful rise of china " for years .
he has been compared to the dalai lama who got the prize in 1989 and is regarded as a separatist by beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is regarded as a separatist by the chinese government according to chinese media reports , liu xiaobo has been used by western countries as a political tool in order to weaken china and throw the country into chaos .
the nobel peace prize was described as an award to liu for committing treason .
does china need 300 years of colonialism ?
the chinese media have been trying to discredit liu xiaobo in many ways .
for example , they published quotes of liu saying that china would need at least 300 years of colonialism in order to develop properly .
but those lines were quoted out of context , says jin zhong , a journalist based in hong kong .
he is the publisher and editor-in-chief of the liberal magazine " kaifang " – or " open " .
when liu visited hong kong for the first time in 1988 , he was impressed by the freedom and wealth of the then british colony , remembers jin .
when jin asked liu how china should develop in the future , liu answered somewhat ironically : " china needs at least 300 years of colonialism , if hong kong has needed 100 years for this kind of freedom and prosperity . "
debate within the chinese internet community " of course he was exaggerating , " recalls jin , " liu has been a strong supporter of western-style democracy and freedom . "
still , liu 's quote has been widely discussed within the chinese internet community .
patriotic users are upset , whereas their critics wonder why the chinese cadres are sending their offspring abroad to study in western countries , if they are so negative about the west .
honoring china 's democrats most chinese liberal thinkers welcome the nobel peace prize for liu .
they say that it is not only an award for liu ’ s commitment to more democracy in china , it is in fact honoring the whole chinese democracy movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is a co-initiator of the charter ' 08 " there is no better candidate for this prize , " says qian yuejun , a chinese dissident based in germany , " he was the only choice within the chinese pro-democracy movement who really deserves the award . "
in 2008 , liu xiaobo was one of the initiators of the so-called charter ' 08 – a manifesto demanding more democracy and freedom within china .
two days before it was published , liu was arrested and later sentenced to eleven years in prison on subversion charges .
" as co-initiator , liu has gathered over ten thousand supporters for the charter ' 08 within a short period .
no one else within the divided pro-democracy movement can be as convincing as liu .
he is the only one who can mobilize so many people , " explains qian .
divided movement but among the critics of the communist regime , there are also voices against liu xiaobo .
in their eyes , he is too ready to compromise .
" for an intellectual , liu ’ s thinking is very problematic .
he has studied marxist ideology during his time in university , " argues zhong weiguang , another chinese dissident living in germany .
" he embodies the communist ideology .
that is why he doesn ’ t deserve the nobel peace prize . "

berlin seems keen on the idea . german interior minister thomas de maiziere is reportedly planning to revolutionize the country 's police force , in a bid to better manage modern dangers like terror threats .
on thursday , a panel of experts commissioned by de maiziere presented their final report to parliament in berlin , suggesting that some kind of merger of the country 's two main policing bodies would help law enforcers respond to terror threats and other 21st century issues .
" to me , the principal suggestion of creating one ' federal police ' out of the federation 's police forces seems convincing and worthy of consideration and pursuit , " interior minister de maiziere said in response to the report .
currently , the federal police -lrb- bundespolizei -rrb- fulfils the more traditional policing role - patrolling beats , dealing with public safety , minor crimes , traffic accidents and so forth - while the federal criminal police office -lrb- bundeskriminalamt or bka -rrb- investigates more serious crimes .
newspaper reports , attributing their information to participants of a recent high-level meeting between the interior ministry and the expert commission , say that merging elements of these forces would help the police to better deal with problems like terror threats - which require a combination of centralized intelligence and rapid local response .
germany has been on a heightened terror alert for several weeks , and this is not likely to change before christmas .
no german fbi the commission said a new security force would not be comparable to the federal bureau of investigation -lrb- fbi -rrb- in the us , as the german constitution clearly seperates police duties on a federal and state level .
according to the koelner stadtanzeiger daily , the two organizations would not have to move , the bka would keep its hq in wiesbaden , and the bundespolizei would stay in potsdam .
interior minister de maiziere also insisted that any changes would not be part of a downsizing scheme .
" the goal here , however , is definitely not to cut jobs , " de maiziere said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the potential merger might be inspired by the fbi in the us the newspaper posits that the bka would be responsible for serious and slightly serious crimes , while the bundespolizei would focus on protecting the public .
the commission report argues that the third main arm of german police , the customs and border control service -lrb- zollkriminalamt -rrb- , should remain an independent entity .
however , the report also recommended that customs officers with a role similar to that of a police officer should coordinate more closely with the german police force , and should fall under the jurisdiction of the interior ministry .
similarly , the federal office for information security - germany 's " internet police " – should work in closer conjunction with the bka .
reform by 2013 ?
" if we go ahead with this , then i would call for us to begin organizing the changes swiftly , even during the current legislative period , " de maiziere told the german parliament .
according to reports in the german press , if a draft law moved smoothly through the houses of parliament , a final bill might be ready by the end of the 2012 legislature period , and implemented the following year .
the investigative commission was chaired by eckhart wertebach , the former president of germany 's constitutional protection committee .
currently , roughly 5,500 people work for the major crimes unit , the bka , and the federal police force employs around 40,000 people .

thirteen operatives , believed to be cia , were eventually charged in indictments in munich and spain , as investigators concluded that the plane that transported masri passed through spanish territory .

does china need 300 years of colonialism ?
the chinese media have been trying to discredit liu xiaobo in many ways .
for example , they published quotes of liu saying that china would need at least 300 years of colonialism in order to develop properly .
but those lines were quoted out of context , says jin zhong , a journalist based in hong kong .
he is the publisher and editor-in-chief of the liberal magazine " kaifang " – or " open " .

when jin asked liu how china should develop in the future , liu answered somewhat ironically : " china needs at least 300 years of colonialism , if hong kong has needed 100 years for this kind of freedom and prosperity . "
debate within the chinese internet community " of course he was exaggerating , " recalls jin , " liu has been a strong supporter of western-style democracy and freedom . "

norbert roettgen called on states to follow germany 's lead and launch a " rethink " on climate change .
" in business , politics and society , we no longer see climate change as a threat , but an opportunity and a challenge , " said roettgen in a speech to delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment minister said a multilateral approach is needed in cancun he said that germany had invested in tackling climate change and as a result it had created jobs and opportunities .
rich vs poor countries major deadlocks have emerged at cancun between rich and developing nations , largely over how to lower greenhouse-gas emissions .
despite wide agreement on issues such as tackling deforestation , adaptation , technology and climate financing , there is little compromise on either side over limiting co2 emissions that cause climate change .
the european union and the united states want more scrutiny of emerging powers ' actions on climate change and anchoring voluntary emission pledges into the wider un process .
eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard said there had been " no sign of progress on the crunch issues . "
meanwhile developing nations put the onus on industrial powers to back an extension of the kyoto protocol , a treaty limiting the gas emissions of wealthy countries that is set to expire in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu climate commissioner hedegaard said little progress has been made the us never ratified kyoto and china was exempted – and now japan is leading a bloc of countries that refuse to back a new treaty without the world 's two largest polluters .
deadline looms the talks end on friday and roettgen told reporters it was now a " difficult point " as the deadline draws close .
however , mexico 's foreign minister , who is chairing the talks said a comprehensive deal among the 190 countries was " within reach . "
" we need to work together in finding the balance that will make cancun a success , " patricia espinosa said .
her comments were echoed by the eu climate commissioner .
" to come out of cancun with nothing is simply not an option , " hedegaard said .

ahead of the talks , prime minister donald tusk announced that us treatment of poland in negotiations over the shield had stripped his country of " all illusions " it had of its nato ally .
obama scrapped his predecessor 's plans to base radar and interceptor missiles in eastern european nato member states back in 2009 as part of his campaign to " reset " relations with moscow .
russia 's objection to the deployment of missiles on its borders led to obama modifying the plans last year , opting to deploy medium- and short-range missile interceptors in poland instead .
at a nato-russia summit in lisbon on nov .
20 , the two former cold war foes agreed to cooperate on missile defense , a factor seen as crucial to improving relations .
in response to nato 's approach , russia agreed to cooperate with the alliance in afghanistan .
the two sides are scheduled to begin discussions next week on how to link nato 's and russia 's separate systems to provide a joint shield aimed at protecting europe against incoming missiles from rogue nations .
a final viability study is expected in july 2011 .
wikileaks reveals nato plans to expand shield to baltics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's baltic members lobbied for inclusion in the shield plan however , further revelations could ratchet up the simmering tensions at these negotiations .
in addition to revealing poland 's fear of russia and the widely held belief among nato member states in the baltics and central europe that russia , their former ally , is their greatest security threat , the latest wikileaks cables also exposed nato plans to extend the missile defense plan to include former soviet states estonia , latvia and lithuania .
the documents also revealed that nine divisions of nato troops would be involved in the protective deployment in the baltics , including soldiers from the us , britain , germany and poland .
the cables claim the expansion was prompted by fierce lobbying by the baltic states and pressure from poland for nato to renew its commitment to its security .
germany was also named as being a major force in pushing through the expansion which has been accepted and integrated into nato plans , according to media reports .
signed by us secretary of state hillary clinton , the cables also detailed plans by nato to keep the expansion secret as not to heighten tensions between the alliance and russia .
russia considers own security as missile deal sours the revelations pertaining to the extended missile shield have bewildered and angered russia just weeks after its breakthrough summit with nato .
russian president dmitry medvedev said the latest leaks showed the " cynicism " of us foreign policy , while prime minister vladimir putin said any " additional threats " on its borders would be counteracted by russian military deployments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us-nato decisions to expand the shield have angered russia " the latest wikileaks revelations that nato had drawn up a secret contingency plan for the defense of poland and the baltic states from potential russian military aggression certainly raised some eyebrows in moscow , " jan gaspers , an expert on european security and defense policy at the university of cambridge 's center of international studies , told deutsche welle .
" selling the planned nato missile defense shield as being exclusively directed against middle eastern rogue states and specifically iran will now become even more difficult . "
while both medvedev and putin claimed that the leaks were of " no consequence " and would not damage us-russia relations , nato 's amendment of its missile shield ambitions has certainly put moscow on alert .
" at the latest nato summit in lisbon , russia was invited to take part in nato 's missile defense scheme , " said gaspers . however , he added that the hostile atmosphere at the osce astana summit at the beginning of this month had once again underlined how difficult cooperation between nato and russia on missile defense and transatlantic security more generally is likely to be .
" russia agreed with the shield but added conditions by introducing a joint nato-russia threat assessment , which many nato members are not keen on doing at all , " jana kobzova , a russia and eastern europe expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
moscow hardens stance ; europe pushes for shield completion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said excluding russia would have consequences putin told cnn television that russia would " ensure its own security " by deploying " new strike forces " and nuclear weapons on its borders with eastern europe should the shield go ahead without them .
reports in the us media suggest that russia moved tactical nuclear warheads to within miles of its border with nato states as recently as late spring in an apparent response to us-nato missile defense installations in these neighboring countries .
" what was launched in lisbon was a long process of negotiations between nato and russia , " kozova said .
" medvedev 's and putin 's statements are aimed at increasing the stakes in these negotiations . " in kozova 's opinion the statements are also face-saving measures aimed at a domestic audience in the aftermath of the agreement in lisbon .
" the russian public still perceives nato as a cold war adversary , and even though russia agreed to closer cooperation with nato , this does not mean that russian politicians will change their rhetoric . "
experts believe that , even if russia is left out and reacts belligerently , the missile shield will still go ahead with european powerhouses like germany pushing the us and nato to commit to securing the continent from external threats .
" however , this commitment will most likely be attached to further concessions on part of certain nato member states in the sphere of nuclear disarmament , " gaspers said .
" indeed , under the current coalition government , the struggle for a world free from nuclear weapons has become a core tenet of german foreign policy .
accordingly , a lot of germany 's nato diplomacy in the months to come will continue to focus on this topic . "

norbert roettgen called on states to follow germany 's lead and launch a " rethink " on climate change .
" in business , politics and society , we no longer see climate change as a threat , but an opportunity and a challenge , " said roettgen in a speech to delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment minister said a multilateral approach is needed in cancun he said that germany had invested in tackling climate change and as a result it had created jobs and opportunities .
rich vs poor countries major deadlocks have emerged at cancun between rich and developing nations , largely over how to lower greenhouse-gas emissions .
despite wide agreement on issues such as tackling deforestation , adaptation , technology and climate financing , there is little compromise on either side over limiting co2 emissions that cause climate change .
the european union and the united states want more scrutiny of emerging powers ' actions on climate change and anchoring voluntary emission pledges into the wider un process .
eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard said there had been " no sign of progress on the crunch issues . "
meanwhile developing nations put the onus on industrial powers to back an extension of the kyoto protocol , a treaty limiting the gas emissions of wealthy countries that is set to expire in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu climate commissioner hedegaard said little progress has been made the us never ratified kyoto and china was exempted – and now japan is leading a bloc of countries that refuse to back a new treaty without the world 's two largest polluters .
deadline looms the talks end on friday and roettgen told reporters it was now a " difficult point " as the deadline draws close .
however , mexico 's foreign minister , who is chairing the talks said a comprehensive deal among the 190 countries was " within reach . "
" we need to work together in finding the balance that will make cancun a success , " patricia espinosa said .
her comments were echoed by the eu climate commissioner .
" to come out of cancun with nothing is simply not an option , " hedegaard said .

he spoke of men and women " far more deserving of the prize " than him - and he meant people like liu xiaobo .
imprisoned in china , liu received this year 's nobel peace prize after more than two decades of an arduous , non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in china .
obama , on the other hand , received the award for a vision , a change in tone in international relations , and , many argue , in an attempt to settle accounts with his predecessor , george w. bush .
a dissatisfying record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's vision of a world free of nuclear weapons impressed not only the nobel committee while obama has kept his promise of withdrawing combat troops from iraq , he has n't followed through on many of the political projects he received the nobel peace prize for : a new strategic arms reduction treaty with russia , the closing of guantanamo bay detention camp , and a real step forward in meeting the world 's climate challenges .
but who 's to blame ?
did obama lose the moral compass he assigned so much importance to in his nobel speech ?
facing an adverse political climate " obama 's standpoints are better than his record , " marco fey from the peace research institute frankfurt told deutsche welle .
" on a variety of issues , he 's caught in the political climate in the us . "
fey cited the arms reduction treaty ' new start ' as a fitting example .
obama and russian president dmitry medvedev signed the treaty in april 2010 , but it has n't been ratified by the senate so far .
" obama , senior department of state officials , they all support the treaty , " fey said .
" it would be a real milestone in terms of arms control .
but republicans use the most absurd arguments to block it in the senate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the closure of guantanamo bay detention camp remains uncertain political capital is scarce obama 's decision to close down the detention camp at guantanamo bay has met fierce congressional opposition as well . but critics argue that obama has n't really invested his political capital in the measure compared to other projects he pushed through congress - such as health care reform .
the recent conviction of canadian citizen omar ahmed khadr who was brought to guantanamo 's military prison at the age of 16 , exemplifies obama 's lack of self-assertion in putting an end to the facility and its practice .
" who would have thought that , under obama , someone who 's accused of a crime committed at the age of 15 would be tried before a military commission at guantanamo ? "
reed brody from human rights watch told deutsche welle .
promoting human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is this year 's recipient of the nobel peace prize indeed , obama promised to be a persistent advocate of human rights at home and abroad . he has frequently underscored the significance of peaceful activists like liu xiaobo - the first chinese recipient of the award .
liu was an influential participant of the tiananmen protests in 1989 and is a leading author of charta 08 , a manifesto promoting fundamental human rights and democratization in china .
in december 2009 , after a series of earlier internments , he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for " inciting subversion of state power . "
obama and other heads of state have called on the chinese government to release liu .
however , critics argue that obama has failed to make human rights a guiding principle of us relations with other countries - highlighted and , some say , undermined by obama 's recent efforts to expand chinese-american cooperation .
" it 's not helpful when the government repeatedly describes human rights and democracy as issues on which the us and china will inevitably disagree , " brody said . a vision 's prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , al gore gave his nobel speech at oslo 's city hall whether attributed to obama 's political environment or his setting of priorities , the gap between obama 's vision and his actual achievements remains a fact .
yet , obama is sticking to his optimistic rhetoric and continues to set visionary goals , for example , regarding the middle east peace process .
" he 's set the goal of reaching a peace accord within a year , " said fey .
" that 's a very ambitious undertaking . "
as the clash of idealistic expectations and political pragmatism continues to haunt obama 's presidency , one is reminded of what al gore said during his nobel speech in 2007 : " we have everything we need to get started , save perhaps political will , but political will is a renewable resource . "

in january 2006 , he took a highly publicized trip to israel , traveling on his canadian passport , as it is normally forbidden for iranians to travel to israel . several months later his political views shifted , and he became a staunch iranian nationalist in the face of perceived opposition and heated rhetoric from the united states , saying that he supported iran 's right to nuclear weapons . on his persian blog especially , he lashed out at other iranians - many of whom had previously been his friends , peers and colleagues .
mehdi khaliji , an iranian working for a conservative washington , d.c. think tank , even filed a libel suit against derakhshan in 2007 for statements written on derakhshan 's blog . in the autumn of 2008 , derakhshan returned to iran after having lived for many years in canada , france and the united kingdom .
he was arrested on november 1 , 2008 . after a short trial in tehran this summer , derakhshan was sentenced in late september to serve 19.5 years in prison , and was banned for five years from joining any iranian political party .

" in 2005 and 2006 , he served as a jury member in deutsche welle 's blog awards , also known as the bobs . initially , derakhshan , who was also known by his online moniker hoder , spoke out against the iranian government on his blog .
in january 2006 , he took a highly publicized trip to israel , traveling on his canadian passport , as it is normally forbidden for iranians to travel to israel . several months later his political views shifted , and he became a staunch iranian nationalist in the face of perceived opposition and heated rhetoric from the united states , saying that he supported iran 's right to nuclear weapons . on his persian blog especially , he lashed out at other iranians - many of whom had previously been his friends , peers and colleagues .
mehdi khaliji , an iranian working for a conservative washington , d.c. think tank , even filed a libel suit against derakhshan in 2007 for statements written on derakhshan 's blog . in the autumn of 2008 , derakhshan returned to iran after having lived for many years in canada , france and the united kingdom .
he was arrested on november 1 , 2008 . after a short trial in tehran this summer , derakhshan was sentenced in late september to serve 19.5 years in prison , and was banned for five years from joining any iranian political party .
he was also ordered to pay fines of 30,750 euros , $ 2,900 and 200 british pounds . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 09.12.2010 missile shield plans cause rift between us , europe and russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspicions and distrust could derail plans for a missile shield the leaders of the united states and poland have met in washington in a bid to disperse the new clouds which have settled over relations between those nations involved in planning a protective missile shield in europe . poland 's president bronislaw komorowski held talks on wednesday with us president barack obama in the wake of new wikileaks revelations which showed polish anger at washington 's abandoning of its original shield plans and its increasing cosiness with russia .
ahead of the talks , prime minister donald tusk announced that us treatment of poland in negotiations over the shield had stripped his country of " all illusions " it had of its nato ally .
obama scrapped his predecessor 's plans to base radar and interceptor missiles in eastern european nato member states back in 2009 as part of his campaign to " reset " relations with moscow .
russia 's objection to the deployment of missiles on its borders led to obama modifying the plans last year , opting to deploy medium- and short-range missile interceptors in poland instead .
at a nato-russia summit in lisbon on nov .
20 , the two former cold war foes agreed to cooperate on missile defense , a factor seen as crucial to improving relations .
in response to nato 's approach , russia agreed to cooperate with the alliance in afghanistan .
the two sides are scheduled to begin discussions next week on how to link nato 's and russia 's separate systems to provide a joint shield aimed at protecting europe against incoming missiles from rogue nations .
a final viability study is expected in july 2011 .
wikileaks reveals nato plans to expand shield to baltics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's baltic members lobbied for inclusion in the shield plan however , further revelations could ratchet up the simmering tensions at these negotiations .
in addition to revealing poland 's fear of russia and the widely held belief among nato member states in the baltics and central europe that russia , their former ally , is their greatest security threat , the latest wikileaks cables also exposed nato plans to extend the missile defense plan to include former soviet states estonia , latvia and lithuania .
the documents also revealed that nine divisions of nato troops would be involved in the protective deployment in the baltics , including soldiers from the us , britain , germany and poland .
the cables claim the expansion was prompted by fierce lobbying by the baltic states and pressure from poland for nato to renew its commitment to its security .
germany was also named as being a major force in pushing through the expansion which has been accepted and integrated into nato plans , according to media reports .
signed by us secretary of state hillary clinton , the cables also detailed plans by nato to keep the expansion secret as not to heighten tensions between the alliance and russia .
russia considers own security as missile deal sours the revelations pertaining to the extended missile shield have bewildered and angered russia just weeks after its breakthrough summit with nato .
russian president dmitry medvedev said the latest leaks showed the " cynicism " of us foreign policy , while prime minister vladimir putin said any " additional threats " on its borders would be counteracted by russian military deployments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us-nato decisions to expand the shield have angered russia " the latest wikileaks revelations that nato had drawn up a secret contingency plan for the defense of poland and the baltic states from potential russian military aggression certainly raised some eyebrows in moscow , " jan gaspers , an expert on european security and defense policy at the university of cambridge 's center of international studies , told deutsche welle .
" selling the planned nato missile defense shield as being exclusively directed against middle eastern rogue states and specifically iran will now become even more difficult . "
while both medvedev and putin claimed that the leaks were of " no consequence " and would not damage us-russia relations , nato 's amendment of its missile shield ambitions has certainly put moscow on alert .
" at the latest nato summit in lisbon , russia was invited to take part in nato 's missile defense scheme , " said gaspers . however , he added that the hostile atmosphere at the osce astana summit at the beginning of this month had once again underlined how difficult cooperation between nato and russia on missile defense and transatlantic security more generally is likely to be .
" russia agreed with the shield but added conditions by introducing a joint nato-russia threat assessment , which many nato members are not keen on doing at all , " jana kobzova , a russia and eastern europe expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
moscow hardens stance ; europe pushes for shield completion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said excluding russia would have consequences putin told cnn television that russia would " ensure its own security " by deploying " new strike forces " and nuclear weapons on its borders with eastern europe should the shield go ahead without them .
reports in the us media suggest that russia moved tactical nuclear warheads to within miles of its border with nato states as recently as late spring in an apparent response to us-nato missile defense installations in these neighboring countries .
" what was launched in lisbon was a long process of negotiations between nato and russia , " kozova said .
" medvedev 's and putin 's statements are aimed at increasing the stakes in these negotiations . " in kozova 's opinion the statements are also face-saving measures aimed at a domestic audience in the aftermath of the agreement in lisbon .
" the russian public still perceives nato as a cold war adversary , and even though russia agreed to closer cooperation with nato , this does not mean that russian politicians will change their rhetoric . "
experts believe that , even if russia is left out and reacts belligerently , the missile shield will still go ahead with european powerhouses like germany pushing the us and nato to commit to securing the continent from external threats .
" however , this commitment will most likely be attached to further concessions on part of certain nato member states in the sphere of nuclear disarmament , " gaspers said .
" indeed , under the current coalition government , the struggle for a world free from nuclear weapons has become a core tenet of german foreign policy .
accordingly , a lot of germany 's nato diplomacy in the months to come will continue to focus on this topic . "

but some are also unhappy with the decision . not many among the 1.3 billion chinese had heard the name of liu xiaobo before october .
but thanks to an official media campaign against the 54-year old activist , he is now better known than ever .
chinese media campaign against liu the chinese media have reported that liu is being awarded the nobel prize because he has tried to sabotage the " peaceful rise of china " for years .
he has been compared to the dalai lama who got the prize in 1989 and is regarded as a separatist by beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is regarded as a separatist by the chinese government according to chinese media reports , liu xiaobo has been used by western countries as a political tool in order to weaken china and throw the country into chaos .
the nobel peace prize was described as an award to liu for committing treason .
does china need 300 years of colonialism ?
the chinese media have been trying to discredit liu xiaobo in many ways .
for example , they published quotes of liu saying that china would need at least 300 years of colonialism in order to develop properly .
but those lines were quoted out of context , says jin zhong , a journalist based in hong kong .
he is the publisher and editor-in-chief of the liberal magazine " kaifang " – or " open " .
when liu visited hong kong for the first time in 1988 , he was impressed by the freedom and wealth of the then british colony , remembers jin .
when jin asked liu how china should develop in the future , liu answered somewhat ironically : " china needs at least 300 years of colonialism , if hong kong has needed 100 years for this kind of freedom and prosperity . "
debate within the chinese internet community " of course he was exaggerating , " recalls jin , " liu has been a strong supporter of western-style democracy and freedom . "
still , liu 's quote has been widely discussed within the chinese internet community .
patriotic users are upset , whereas their critics wonder why the chinese cadres are sending their offspring abroad to study in western countries , if they are so negative about the west .
honoring china 's democrats most chinese liberal thinkers welcome the nobel peace prize for liu .
they say that it is not only an award for liu ’ s commitment to more democracy in china , it is in fact honoring the whole chinese democracy movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is a co-initiator of the charter ' 08 " there is no better candidate for this prize , " says qian yuejun , a chinese dissident based in germany , " he was the only choice within the chinese pro-democracy movement who really deserves the award . "
in 2008 , liu xiaobo was one of the initiators of the so-called charter ' 08 – a manifesto demanding more democracy and freedom within china .
two days before it was published , liu was arrested and later sentenced to eleven years in prison on subversion charges .
" as co-initiator , liu has gathered over ten thousand supporters for the charter ' 08 within a short period .
no one else within the divided pro-democracy movement can be as convincing as liu .
he is the only one who can mobilize so many people , " explains qian .
divided movement but among the critics of the communist regime , there are also voices against liu xiaobo .
in their eyes , he is too ready to compromise .
" for an intellectual , liu ’ s thinking is very problematic .
he has studied marxist ideology during his time in university , " argues zhong weiguang , another chinese dissident living in germany .
" he embodies the communist ideology .
that is why he doesn ’ t deserve the nobel peace prize . "

nasa also agrees to make germany an associate partner in its lunar science institute in california . in an agreement signed in washington , d.c. on wednesday , the german space agency , better known by its german acronym dlr , and its american counterpart , nasa , agreed to cooperate more fully on joint operations , planetary observations , and other forms of space science .
the move comes just a week after the german government outlined its new space strategy , where it said germany would expand public investments in space science from its current 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- annually to 1.4 billion euros by 2014 .
that policy also underscored increased collaboration with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , where germany is currently the second-largest funder nation after france .
" many space missions and projects can only be carried out through international cooperation , with nasa for example , because of their complexity and the associated costs , " said johann-dietrich worner , dlr 's chairman , in a statement posted to the dlr 's website .
" this is why dlr , as germany 's national space agency and research center , is endeavoring to set up bilateral collaborations such as this , in addition to its other commitments . "
his american counterpart was equally positive on the new agreement .
" nasa has a long history of successful cooperation with the government of germany and an outstanding relationship with dlr , " said charles bolden , nasa 's administrator , in a statement posted to nasa 's website .
" today 's signing will further enhance our ability to work closely together in a variety of mutually beneficial activities in virtually every nasa mission area . "

the institute , which is based in northern california , brings together moon specialists from around the globe to collaborate on their research .
germany 's new policy also abandons the moon as a solo national goal , but plans on continuing further study as part of european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , and now nasa , projects .
almost four years ago , german government officials had previously announced plans for a 2013 moon flight , and in 2009 , another government official called for an unmanned moon mission in 2015 .
" the moon is for us , the most important goal for the next 20 years , " said hubert reile , aerospace director of the dlr , in an interview with the german press agency , dpa .

rights group amnesty international , which organized the demonstration , attempted to use the event to hand over a petition signed by some 100,000 people in support of liu .
however , the gates to the embassy remained locked and all windows were shuttered , leading to the protestors piling up the signed petitions outside the building perimeter .
" the chinese government should be celebrating this global recognition of a chinese writer and activist , " said ai secretary general salil shetty . " instead , the government 's very public tantrum has generated even more critical attention inside and outside china , and , ironically , emphasized the significance of liu xiaobo 's message of respect for human rights , " shetty said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang says most nations will boycott the ceremony amnesty and the nobel institute have meanwhile accused beijing of pressuring chinese nationals living in oslo to join counter-protests against liu .
the 54-year-old writer , human rights activist and critic of one-party rule in china was jailed in december 2009 for 11 years on subversion charges after co-authoring a petition calling for a multi-party system in china .
he was awarded the 2010 nobel peace prize for his long non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in the communist state .
however , the move greatly angered china , which saw it as an attempt to meddle in its internal affairs .
pressure on china ' can not succeed ' beijing has gone to great lengths in recent weeks to push for a boycott of the nobel ceremony in oslo , claiming that most of the world was opposed to the nobel committee 's decision to honor liu .
so far , some 20 states , including russia , cuba and venezuela , and most of which have strong commercial ties with beijing , have followed china in shunning the event .
" those people at the nobel committee have to admit they are in the minority .
the chinese people and the overwhelming majority of countries and people in the world oppose what they do , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said .
" any attempt to exert pressure on china ... can not succeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu 's continued detention sparked protests around the world world behind nobel award but the head of the nobel committee , thorbjoern jagland , said thursday that some two-thirds of nations invited to the ceremony were expected to attend , and that the choice of liu as this year 's peace laureate was not a move " against " beijing .
" this is not a prize against china .
this is a prize honoring people in china , " jagland told a press conference traditionally held by the laureate on the day before the prize ceremony .
jagland insisted however it was important to push for political reforms and an opening of civil society to parallel china 's massive economic development .
" to a large extent the future of the world is in the hands of this big country , " he said .
speaking of the empty chair that will represent the absent dissident , jagland said " it is a very strong symbol -lrb- that -rrb- shows how appropriate this prize was . "

the find suggests there could be mountains made of diamond nearby . a team at the massachusetts institute of technology researching a large gaseous exoplanet , or a planet outside our solar system , have discovered an unusual composition of its atmosphere that could redefine our understanding of how life is formed .
the study was published wednesday in the journal nature .
the planet , known as wasp-12b , is 1.4 times the mass of jupiter and located about 1,200 light years away and was discovered in 2009 by researchers at the united kingdom-based consortium for wide angle search for planets -lrb- wasp -rrb- , who are also co-authors of the new study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the so far undetected neighbors of wasp-12b could harbor strange life " this is new territory and will motivate researchers to study what the interiors of carbon-rich planets could be made of , " said nikku madhusudhan , in a statement .
she is the lead author of the study , and now a postdoctoral researcher at princeton university , in the united states . although wasp-12b is a " hot jupiter " - a jupiter-sized , extremely hot planet consisting mainly of gas - and is therefore unlikely to host life , scientists believe the planet 's unique chemistry could overturn our notions of the necessary ingredients for life .
rocky neighbors the researchers believe the abundance of carbon was due to the formation of the planet from rocky materials high in carbon as opposed to icy bodies like comets .
this suggests that there may be an entire range of carbon abundances available for making planets in that system .
if there are any rocky planets in the system , it is likely they are covered in tar-like substances rich in organic substances – since carbon is one of what scientists consider the six essential elements of life -lrb- the other five being oxygen , hydrogen , nitrogen , phosphorus and sulphur -rrb- .
if detected , these smaller planets could also have carbon-rich atmospheres , and any life might have to survive with very little water and oxygen and an abundance of methane .
this is difficult to square with our current knowledge of the chemical properties of life .
but since nasa recently purported to have discovered bacteria that had replaced the phosphorus in its dna with arsenic , scientists may soon be forced to re-consider their assessment of the necessary conditions and elements of life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study of exoplanets is one of the newest branches of astronomy other researchers said that these are considerations for the future .
" the honest answer is that that 's very speculative , " said coel hellier , a professor of astrophysics at keele university in the united kingdom , and another co-author of the paper , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we do n't really know whether life could live in that sort of environment .
there are certainly a lot of planets out there that do have very methane-rich atmospheres and very little oxygen , so it 's certainly worth thinking about . "
diamond mountains the other striking image that the paper posits suggests that the possible rocky planets near wasp-12b could have mountains made of diamond .
hellier believes this is easily imaginable .
" it 's quite possible that there are rocky planets in that system , even though they are too small for us to detect , " he said .
" if there are , then they would have carbon-rich rock , rather than what we have on earth , which is very oxygen-rich – most of the earth 's crust is made out of rock that is roughly half oxygen .
if you have rock in an environment that is very carbon-rich , then you 'd expect to have rocks which could be diamond or graphite , which are different forms of carbon . "
astronomers can figure out a planet 's atmospheric composition by observing its flux , or the light emitted by the planet , at different wavelengths .
the team , coordinated by joe harrington , a planetary scientist at the university of central florida , used nasa 's spitzer space telescope to observe the flux from wasp-12b , at four wavelengths , right before it passed behind its star , an event known as secondary eclipse .
while the first exoplanet was only discovered 15 years ago , there has been an extremely rapid rate of growth since then . " astronomers have now found about 500 of them in total , " heiller added . " we 're really now for the first time able to actually measure and detect what their atmospheres are made of .
this is a significant step towards showing that we now have the technology to do that . "
a cautious view frederic pont , senior lecturer in astrophysics at the university of exeter in the uk , admires the analysis behind the new paper , but is wary of excitable media reports and premature conclusions . " it ’ s very good work , the team is excellent , " he told deutsche welle .
" it ’ s very interesting , but there are i think just seven data points .
usually if you want to take a spectroscopy of a planet you ’ re talking about hundreds of points , so with seven points you need a lot of interpolation . " pont lamented the tendency to oversimplification in the media coverage of new exoplanetary discoveries .
" it ’ s work in progress , right ? " he said .
" usually the way it works is this : a result is published , and then the debate starts , and maybe two or three years later we know what was correct or not .
but in the media we get the impression that the scientific paper is the discovery . " " it ’ s a very complex set of hypotheses to get to these results , " he said of the wasp-12b paper .
" they don ’ t see carbon and oxygen , they see the indirect signature of some molecules and they have to assume the carbon and oxygen equilibrium .
but the results themselves are extraordinary .
they are really at the forefront of what we can do . "

and with climate change proceeding at the current speed , experts are prepared for worse to come . with the un climate summit underway in cancun , politicians and health experts have met in bonn , germany , to discuss the risks posed to human health by the increasing number of extreme weather events , and ways of helping the population to prepare , adapt – and stay healthy . " it 's not just about people dying from drowning or accidents during the floods , " said juergen becker , secretary of state in bonn ’ s environment ministry .
" we also have to look at measures to tackle water pollution afterwards or problems resulting from mould growing inside affected buildings . " becker cites the heat waves in europe during 2003 and 2006 as examples .
he stresses that even in a wealthy industrialized country like germany , with its good medical infrastructure , there were an estimated 7,000 deaths from heart attacks and heat-related illnesses during the 2003 heat wave - one of the most extreme summer events ever recorded in europe .
the environment expert is also worried about increased flooding in germany in future . over the past 20 years , more than 650,000 people have died in around 14,000 extreme weather events - like storms , floods and heat waves - according to the latest climate risk index published by germanwatch in cancun .
and with climate change proceeding at the current speed that number is likely to keep increasing . the german environment ministry , the environment agency , the german meteorological office dwd and the world health organization europe all say it 's high time to get prepared for worse to come . extreme weather through climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old and young are most at risk from climate change .
the increase in the number of extreme weather events is quite clearly related to the changing climate , says paul becker , deputy director of germany ’ s meteorological office , the dwd .
it is not only the average temperature that is on the rise , both globally and regionally , says the weather expert . " the extremes are on the rise .
that means hot days for instance .
and clearly , an increase in the number of hot days and also warm nights , which we refer to as tropical , when the temperature does not sink below 20 degrees celsius – obviously have an effect on the human body , " said becker . the world health organization is highly concerned about both the direct and the indirect effects of climate change on health .
srdan matic , a health and environment expert with who europe , says as many as 70,000 people are estimated to have died in europe as a whole during the heat wave of 2003 .
the elderly , children and the homeless are the most vulnerable . matic also cites this summer ’ s heat wave in russia as an example of the type of extreme weather event which results in a high number of deaths and casualties .
initial estimates put the number of extra deaths attributable to the heat wave at between 10 and 20,000 in just two weeks , he says . the problem was compounded by the fires across russia .
in addition to the direct effects , the air pollution caused by smoke also represented a major health hazard .
if the wind had been blowing in a different direction , matic says , other european countries would also have had to deal with the health problems caused by air pollution . other long-term effects in regions where the climate becomes warmer will be water shortages and drought , which clearly have an impact on people 's health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiger mosquitos are finding a new home in a warmer europe the experts are also concerned about invasive species of plants and animals bringing health problems to areas where they were not prevalent before .
meteorologist paul becker mentions allergies and other problems caused by new types of pollen .
the pollen season can also be lengthened by changes in the climate . the arrival of insects previously native in tropical areas is presenting the health experts with another “ headache ” .
the tiger mosquito which spreads dengue fever , for instance , has already moved into european countries like italy , france , spain and switzerland . " learn to live with it " our societies have to adapt to changing climatic conditions , says becker , to protect the population from health problems .
reliable forecasts , early warning systems and good communication are essential elements . in the case of an extreme heat wave , for instance , he says germany already has an early warning system , which makes sure the public is informed about the risks so that , for instance , homes for the elderly can adjust the diet of residents and shift them to cooler accommodation .
flood protection measures are another example he cites , where measures are already being implemented to adapt to climate change . ultimately , says srdan matic from the who , we have got to get used to extreme weather events .
the health services will have to be ready to treat an increasing number of people with asthma attacks or to provide emergency care for people suffering from dehydration during a heat wave , he suggests . but we have to think further than that , says the health expert .
ultimately , we have to adjust the way we move around , the way we build our houses , heat them and cool them to adapt to a changing climate .
the message , he says , is " learn to live with it . " author : irene quaile editor : gudrun heise , andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he spoke of men and women " far more deserving of the prize " than him - and he meant people like liu xiaobo .
imprisoned in china , liu received this year 's nobel peace prize after more than two decades of an arduous , non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in china .
obama , on the other hand , received the award for a vision , a change in tone in international relations , and , many argue , in an attempt to settle accounts with his predecessor , george w. bush .
a dissatisfying record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's vision of a world free of nuclear weapons impressed not only the nobel committee while obama has kept his promise of withdrawing combat troops from iraq , he has n't followed through on many of the political projects he received the nobel peace prize for : a new strategic arms reduction treaty with russia , the closing of guantanamo bay detention camp , and a real step forward in meeting the world 's climate challenges .
but who 's to blame ?
did obama lose the moral compass he assigned so much importance to in his nobel speech ?
facing an adverse political climate " obama 's standpoints are better than his record , " marco fey from the peace research institute frankfurt told deutsche welle .
" on a variety of issues , he 's caught in the political climate in the us . "
fey cited the arms reduction treaty ' new start ' as a fitting example .
obama and russian president dmitry medvedev signed the treaty in april 2010 , but it has n't been ratified by the senate so far .
" obama , senior department of state officials , they all support the treaty , " fey said .
" it would be a real milestone in terms of arms control .
but republicans use the most absurd arguments to block it in the senate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the closure of guantanamo bay detention camp remains uncertain political capital is scarce obama 's decision to close down the detention camp at guantanamo bay has met fierce congressional opposition as well . but critics argue that obama has n't really invested his political capital in the measure compared to other projects he pushed through congress - such as health care reform .
the recent conviction of canadian citizen omar ahmed khadr who was brought to guantanamo 's military prison at the age of 16 , exemplifies obama 's lack of self-assertion in putting an end to the facility and its practice .
" who would have thought that , under obama , someone who 's accused of a crime committed at the age of 15 would be tried before a military commission at guantanamo ? "
reed brody from human rights watch told deutsche welle .
promoting human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is this year 's recipient of the nobel peace prize indeed , obama promised to be a persistent advocate of human rights at home and abroad . he has frequently underscored the significance of peaceful activists like liu xiaobo - the first chinese recipient of the award .
liu was an influential participant of the tiananmen protests in 1989 and is a leading author of charta 08 , a manifesto promoting fundamental human rights and democratization in china .
in december 2009 , after a series of earlier internments , he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for " inciting subversion of state power . "
obama and other heads of state have called on the chinese government to release liu .
however , critics argue that obama has failed to make human rights a guiding principle of us relations with other countries - highlighted and , some say , undermined by obama 's recent efforts to expand chinese-american cooperation .
" it 's not helpful when the government repeatedly describes human rights and democracy as issues on which the us and china will inevitably disagree , " brody said . a vision 's prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , al gore gave his nobel speech at oslo 's city hall whether attributed to obama 's political environment or his setting of priorities , the gap between obama 's vision and his actual achievements remains a fact .
yet , obama is sticking to his optimistic rhetoric and continues to set visionary goals , for example , regarding the middle east peace process .
" he 's set the goal of reaching a peace accord within a year , " said fey .
" that 's a very ambitious undertaking . "
as the clash of idealistic expectations and political pragmatism continues to haunt obama 's presidency , one is reminded of what al gore said during his nobel speech in 2007 : " we have everything we need to get started , save perhaps political will , but political will is a renewable resource . "

the mekong rises in the tibetan plateau and runs almost 5,000 kilometres through six countries – including laos and cambodia – before it meets the sea in vietnam .
need for more energy countries like laos and cambodia need electricity for their own purposes and to export to their energy-hungry neighbors .
the mekong and its tributaries offer a logical solution – why not dam the river , and push the water through turbines to generate power ?
it is a question that has grown more urgent in recent years .
in another five years , there will be 47 dams on the tributaries of the mekong .
around a dozen more are planned for the mainstream .
but campaigners say blocking the mekong will severely damage fish migration , and cripple fish catches .
that is important because millions in the region rely on this free resource for nutrition and food security .
freshwater fish provide up to 80 percent of the protein eaten by cambodians , and at least one-third of fish in this river are migratory species .
hazards of development a recent projection highlighted the risks if a proposed 11 dams are built on the mainstream of the mekong river – two of them in cambodia .
that would add to 77 dams that are already built or planned for tributaries of the mekong over the next two decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cambodian boy stretches to hoist his makeshift fishing net out of the mekong river dr eric baran is the senior research scientist at the phnom penh office of worldfish , an international research body .
he believes that the consequences of this construction in terms of fish production would be a loss , and this loss is due to the impact on the migratory fish .
" we calculated that the loss of fish by 2030 , if the 11 mainstream dams are built , would amount to between 600,000 tons and 900,000 tons every year .
we ’ re talking about a gigantic number that could have a huge impact on food security in the region , in particular in cambodia and laos . "
cambodia would lose over 200,000 tons of fish – more than half its annual catch .
millions of cambodians live on the cusp of poverty and rely on the bounty of the river to survive .
the mekong river commission – or mrc – is an intergovernmental body set up 15 years ago by cambodia , thailand , laos and vietnam to promote cooperation over the river .
china and myanmar are also involved in the mrc .
a recent report from the mrc recommended that any decisions on whether to build dams on the mainstream mekong be deferred for a decade , since building them would be irreversible , and their impact would be substantial .
it warned cambodia would likely suffer more than any other country from the proposed dams .
the next step is for the politicians to sit down and work out a way forward .
earlier this week cambodia ’ s agriculture and fisheries minister admitted that damming the mekong could interrupt fish migrations .

deutsche welle caught up with him at the un climate summit . on december 6 , the swedish parliament awarded nnimmo bassey the so-called " alternative nobel prize " in recognition of his inspired work to strengthen the environmental movement in his home country of nigeria and throughout africa .
as executive director of environmental rights action in nigeria and chair of friends of the earth international , bassey has become one of africa 's leading advocates for environmental protection and human rights .
he has been particularly influential in mobilizing resistance to multinational oil corporations in his country , drawing attention to the environmental devastation they leave behind and their disregard for the rights of the local population .
after receiving his award in stockholm , bassey traveled to cancun , mexico , where deutsche welle interviewed him on the sidelines of the un climate summit .
deutsche welle : how did you feel when you got the prize ?
nnimmo bassey : when i stood on the platform to receive the reward my mind went to many , many things .
and particularly to a fellow nigerian who won the award in 1994 – the late ken saro wiwa , our number one environmentalist and defender of the environment who was executed in 1995 .
he won the award in 1994 .
and when i stood up there , i knew i was standing on the shoulders of a great man who showed me how to fight for environmental justice and how to resist big corporations who are bent not only on destroying nigeria , but on destroying the climate - destroying the climate of the world by pollution and by release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
are you afraid of facing the same fate as ken saro wiwa ?
no , i am not .
i work with the people , i stand with the people , i am running with the people and there is no option !
you know working with people resisting destructive extraction , working with communities and mass movements who are defending the planet is not an option for me .
and so i look at the people , and i join the people , and i know that we are on the right path .
there is no time for fear .
looking at the negotiations here in cancun , do you feel they are focused on the things that really matter , for example oil extraction , destruction of the environment and climate change ? i think the negotiations to a large extent are not focusing on the real issues .
climate change is caused by very fundamental structural , systemic problems .
one of which is the crisis driven by the market .
all the negotiators talk about is how to use the market to soften global warming - carbon offsetting by planting a tree somewhere in africa while you keep polluting in europe .
this is not a solution , because pollution emissions have to stop at the source .
and they are not talking about lifestyle changes ; they are not talking about less consumption and less of production .
now we have big everything : big oil , big water , big fish ; and everything is coming to an end .
and we would expect our negotiators to look at this problem , the problem of overconsumption and overproduction .
we do n't have more than one planet and we can not go on at the speed and the rate and the direction that we are going now .
we can not keep pushing on with fossil-fuel driven civilization .
we have gone beyond half of the known reserves in the world and we 've done this in only a couple of years , maybe 100 years or so .
how are we going to run on a half tank until eternity ?
you see , it is impossible .
so our leaders are here to talk about how to get money , how not to make commitments or reduce emissions and other , poorer countries are looking at how they can get funding from mitigation .
when temperatures increase due to non-binding targets , at five degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels , no amount of money for mitigation , no amount of money for whatever you do is going to suffice .
we will not know life as it is any more .

on human rights day 2010 tribute is paid to chebeya and others like him . in a special address to mark human rights day on december 10 , un secretary general ban ki-moon praised human rights advocates and their role in the fight against discrimination and exclusion .
ban also called on governments to do more to protect these people - but the appeal came too late for floribert chebeya bahizire .
chebeya was found murdered in kinshasa , the capital of the democratic republic of congo , on june 2 , 2010 .
eyewitnesses said the 46 year-old man was lying on the back seat of an abandoned car , his hands tied .
murders are not uncommon in the drc , a country with a high crime rate , but senior un officials immediately suspected there was more to this particular killing .
" two days ago , an individual with whom i met during my october -lsb- 2009 -rsb- visit to the democratic republic of congo , mr. floribert chebeya bahizire , was killed in kinshasa in circumstances which strongly suggest official involvement , " the un special rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , philip alston , told the human rights council in geneva .
chebeya was " the director of ' voix des sans-voix pour les droits de l 'homme -lsb- voice of the voiceless for human rights -rsb- , ' and a hugely respected human rights leader in the drc , " alston said .
a figure of inspiration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un is active in the drc , one of africa 's most unstable countries alston called for an independent investigation into chebeya 's death , but the drc administration has yet to present a full report . on the day of his death , chebeya had answered a summons from the chief of police in kinshasa ; his last known communication was an sms to his wife saying he was on his way home .
the director of the africa division at the unhcr in geneva , scott campbell , met the activist many times , and described him as " very understated , very soft spoken -lrb- except when he was angry ! -rrb- , very committed and very determined . "
" once there was a human rights issue , or somebody in danger , he would n't let go , " campbell told deutsche welle .
" i do n't know how many times floribert was arrested , mistreated , or threatened with death , -lsb- but -rsb- he continued his work , and this , i think , inspired many others , and continues to inspire many others in the drc today , and outside the drc . "
the challenges facing human rights advocates in the drc are huge .
they must fight against widespread rape and sexual violence by the military and militias , along with extrajudicial executions , torture and numerous cases of death while in police custody .
legal institutions and watchdogs are either weak or non-existent , and there 's an implicit culture of impunity for offenders , especially those under government employ .
the un 's scott campbell considers the drc to be one of the most dangerous places in the world for human rights advocates .
" those that do it inspire me ; they 're a very impressive group , " campbell said .
" they have no guarantees - and cases such as floribert chebeya demonstrate that .
so i take my hat off to those that continue in the struggle today . "
help them to help us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's navi pillay wants more people to get involved many of the world 's most committed and passionate human rights activists are known only to a small circle , and those who do become relatively renowned often do so for tragic reasons , as was the case with chebeya .
the unhcr estimates that hundreds of thousands of people around the world dedicate their lives to human rights ; fighting discrimination against indigenous peoples , against women , or against people with disabilities or illnesses and other marginalized or persecuted groups .
" we need to stand up for their rights , so they can continue to stand up for ours , " the un high commissioner for human rights , navi pillay , said in her human rights day address .
" no formal qualifications are required , " pillay said , appealing for people to join their ranks .
" we can all be human rights defenders , and we all should be !
it just takes commitment and courage . "
of course , it 's not quite that simple , and the un knows it .
every year , thousands of rights activists are harassed , persecuted , arrested or even murdered for their efforts .
however , the un 's position is that a situation only becomes truly hopeless when people give up hope .
" we have seen evolution in so many countries in africa , and elsewhere - certainly in latin america , " scott campbell said , stressing that many human rights activists are ultimately successful .
" i 'm sure if you talked to many in latin american countries in the 1960s or 70s , they would have said the same thing about human rights defenders : ' -lsb- it 's -rsb- an extremely dangerous environment , it 's a bit hopeless , how can things ever change ? '
but these human rights defenders play a critical role in keeping the ball moving forward , in terms of getting towards peace and stability . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 09.12.2010 missile shield plans cause rift between us , europe and russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspicions and distrust could derail plans for a missile shield the leaders of the united states and poland have met in washington in a bid to disperse the new clouds which have settled over relations between those nations involved in planning a protective missile shield in europe . poland 's president bronislaw komorowski held talks on wednesday with us president barack obama in the wake of new wikileaks revelations which showed polish anger at washington 's abandoning of its original shield plans and its increasing cosiness with russia .
ahead of the talks , prime minister donald tusk announced that us treatment of poland in negotiations over the shield had stripped his country of " all illusions " it had of its nato ally .
obama scrapped his predecessor 's plans to base radar and interceptor missiles in eastern european nato member states back in 2009 as part of his campaign to " reset " relations with moscow .
russia 's objection to the deployment of missiles on its borders led to obama modifying the plans last year , opting to deploy medium- and short-range missile interceptors in poland instead .
at a nato-russia summit in lisbon on nov .
20 , the two former cold war foes agreed to cooperate on missile defense , a factor seen as crucial to improving relations .
in response to nato 's approach , russia agreed to cooperate with the alliance in afghanistan .
the two sides are scheduled to begin discussions next week on how to link nato 's and russia 's separate systems to provide a joint shield aimed at protecting europe against incoming missiles from rogue nations .
a final viability study is expected in july 2011 .
wikileaks reveals nato plans to expand shield to baltics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's baltic members lobbied for inclusion in the shield plan however , further revelations could ratchet up the simmering tensions at these negotiations .
in addition to revealing poland 's fear of russia and the widely held belief among nato member states in the baltics and central europe that russia , their former ally , is their greatest security threat , the latest wikileaks cables also exposed nato plans to extend the missile defense plan to include former soviet states estonia , latvia and lithuania .
the documents also revealed that nine divisions of nato troops would be involved in the protective deployment in the baltics , including soldiers from the us , britain , germany and poland .
the cables claim the expansion was prompted by fierce lobbying by the baltic states and pressure from poland for nato to renew its commitment to its security .
germany was also named as being a major force in pushing through the expansion which has been accepted and integrated into nato plans , according to media reports .
signed by us secretary of state hillary clinton , the cables also detailed plans by nato to keep the expansion secret as not to heighten tensions between the alliance and russia .
russia considers own security as missile deal sours the revelations pertaining to the extended missile shield have bewildered and angered russia just weeks after its breakthrough summit with nato .
russian president dmitry medvedev said the latest leaks showed the " cynicism " of us foreign policy , while prime minister vladimir putin said any " additional threats " on its borders would be counteracted by russian military deployments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us-nato decisions to expand the shield have angered russia " the latest wikileaks revelations that nato had drawn up a secret contingency plan for the defense of poland and the baltic states from potential russian military aggression certainly raised some eyebrows in moscow , " jan gaspers , an expert on european security and defense policy at the university of cambridge 's center of international studies , told deutsche welle .
" selling the planned nato missile defense shield as being exclusively directed against middle eastern rogue states and specifically iran will now become even more difficult . "
while both medvedev and putin claimed that the leaks were of " no consequence " and would not damage us-russia relations , nato 's amendment of its missile shield ambitions has certainly put moscow on alert .
" at the latest nato summit in lisbon , russia was invited to take part in nato 's missile defense scheme , " said gaspers . however , he added that the hostile atmosphere at the osce astana summit at the beginning of this month had once again underlined how difficult cooperation between nato and russia on missile defense and transatlantic security more generally is likely to be .
" russia agreed with the shield but added conditions by introducing a joint nato-russia threat assessment , which many nato members are not keen on doing at all , " jana kobzova , a russia and eastern europe expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
moscow hardens stance ; europe pushes for shield completion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said excluding russia would have consequences putin told cnn television that russia would " ensure its own security " by deploying " new strike forces " and nuclear weapons on its borders with eastern europe should the shield go ahead without them .
reports in the us media suggest that russia moved tactical nuclear warheads to within miles of its border with nato states as recently as late spring in an apparent response to us-nato missile defense installations in these neighboring countries .
" what was launched in lisbon was a long process of negotiations between nato and russia , " kozova said .
" medvedev 's and putin 's statements are aimed at increasing the stakes in these negotiations . " in kozova 's opinion the statements are also face-saving measures aimed at a domestic audience in the aftermath of the agreement in lisbon .
" the russian public still perceives nato as a cold war adversary , and even though russia agreed to closer cooperation with nato , this does not mean that russian politicians will change their rhetoric . "
experts believe that , even if russia is left out and reacts belligerently , the missile shield will still go ahead with european powerhouses like germany pushing the us and nato to commit to securing the continent from external threats .
" however , this commitment will most likely be attached to further concessions on part of certain nato member states in the sphere of nuclear disarmament , " gaspers said .
" indeed , under the current coalition government , the struggle for a world free from nuclear weapons has become a core tenet of german foreign policy .
accordingly , a lot of germany 's nato diplomacy in the months to come will continue to focus on this topic . "

koenig stressed to german deputy national security advisor rolf nikel the potential negative implications for bilateral relations between germany and the us , in particular counter-terrorism cooperation , if steps were taken to " seek the arrest or extradition of us citizens / officials , " the documents said .
thirteen operatives , believed to be cia , were eventually charged in indictments in munich and spain , as investigators concluded that the plane that transported masri passed through spanish territory .

norbert roettgen called on states to follow germany 's lead and launch a " rethink " on climate change .
" in business , politics and society , we no longer see climate change as a threat , but an opportunity and a challenge , " said roettgen in a speech to delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment minister said a multilateral approach is needed in cancun he said that germany had invested in tackling climate change and as a result it had created jobs and opportunities .
rich vs poor countries major deadlocks have emerged at cancun between rich and developing nations , largely over how to lower greenhouse-gas emissions .
despite wide agreement on issues such as tackling deforestation , adaptation , technology and climate financing , there is little compromise on either side over limiting co2 emissions that cause climate change .
the european union and the united states want more scrutiny of emerging powers ' actions on climate change and anchoring voluntary emission pledges into the wider un process .
eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard said there had been " no sign of progress on the crunch issues . "
meanwhile developing nations put the onus on industrial powers to back an extension of the kyoto protocol , a treaty limiting the gas emissions of wealthy countries that is set to expire in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu climate commissioner hedegaard said little progress has been made the us never ratified kyoto and china was exempted – and now japan is leading a bloc of countries that refuse to back a new treaty without the world 's two largest polluters .
deadline looms the talks end on friday and roettgen told reporters it was now a " difficult point " as the deadline draws close .
however , mexico 's foreign minister , who is chairing the talks said a comprehensive deal among the 190 countries was " within reach . "
" we need to work together in finding the balance that will make cancun a success , " patricia espinosa said .
her comments were echoed by the eu climate commissioner .
" to come out of cancun with nothing is simply not an option , " hedegaard said .

that 's a fundamental question many of germany 's ngos asked themselves tuesday in berlin .
without fundamental changes in politics and society , their efforts may be little more than reactionary .
take , for example , the 400 ugandan farming families driven from their land to make room for a neumann kaffee gruppe coffee plantation .
that 's something which weighs on the consciousness of groups like fian deutschland and misereor .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffee beans grow where 400 ugandan families used to farm " in my country , an oil palm is worth more than a person , " he told deutsche welle .
" that 's the truth .
a tree is worth more than a human . "
socapalm , which was founded by the government of cameroon , maintains five large domestic plantations for palm oil production .
it was privatized in 2000 under pressure from the world bank .
today four out of five socopalm stakeholders are european .
they are investors from luxembourg and belgium , but most notably the bollore group from france .
once the privatization was underway , the plantations began to expand and consume more land .
militias pushed ethnic bantu and pygmy villagers off of traditional lands they were legally entitled to .
many lost their livelihoods and the small gardens they sustained themselves with .
" the goal of the privatization was that the local population would profit from these economic structures – and that would balance out the loss of land , " bertrand said .
" the promise was of jobs , jobs , jobs .
but none of these promises have come to pass .
socopalm 's employees – even if they do n't come from europe – come from far away . "
few jobs , little security those jobs generated by the privatization are offered by subcontractors on a temporary basis without social benefits or rights to strike .
that 's not just against international labour organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- norms , but also against the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- guidelines for multinational companies , bertrand said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palm oil is eaten in processed foods around the world socopalm 's business strategy is decided in europe , and guy bertrand does n't believe the company is keeping with the ilo and oecd guidelines .
so he lodged complaints against socopalm in several european countries .
but the contact points bertrand has lodged complaints with only examine cases – they do n't have the power to impose sanctions .
furthermore , the contact point in germany is part of a department of the federal ministry for economics and technology -lrb- bmwi -rrb- .
armin paasch , a misereor advisor on global trade and nourishment , says an inherent conflict of interest exists in germany because one role of the bmwi is to help develop foreign trade .
dutch system truly independent the complaints system in the netherlands is more impartial , according to paasch .
" in the netherlands there is one national contact point which is a panel of four experts from various social groups .
ngos , trade unions and others are represented .
and in that case , independence is better guaranteed . "
but another europe-wide hurdle exists for ngos trying to hold companies accountable for their actions abroad – the structures of the companies themselves .
european companies are often able to legally separate themselves from their foreign subsidiaries , rendering them nearly immune to prosecution , paasch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european companies in africa may use militia and police to protect their interests bertrand said that when those companies prepare to do business in developing countries , they often start with a plan which looks good on paper .
but the actual results vary .
" once they 're here , we 're treated like it 's a war , " he said .
" they take the land and use everything at their disposal – including police and private security companies – to drive us off . "
the real thorn in bertrand 's side is the flagrant disregard multinational companies have for the existing oecd guidelines .
he said he would be happy if at least those standards where upheld .
" when we look at industrialized countries , what hurts us is not their wealth and our poverty , " he said .
" what bothers us is that we have no rights at all . "

a two-time dw best of the blogs jury member , his family put up $ 1.5 million worth of bail for his freedom . iranian-canadian blogger hossein derakhshan was temporarily released from a tehran prison , after having been incarcerated for 26 months , according to a report thursday on mashregh news , a conservative iranian news website . the site was among the first to report derakhshan 's conviction at the end of september on charges of " conspiring with hostile governments , disseminating anti-islamic propaganda , disseminating anti-revolutionary propaganda , blasphemy , and operating and managing obscene pornography websites . " the account was confirmed by a source close to the derakhshan family , who wished to remain anonymous and said derakhshan was " happy to be out , " adding " we have been pushing for this for months , especially after his trial , but it has always been refused . " the same source also told deutsche welle that derakhshan " will be out for a couple of days only , " and that the family had put up a bail with a value of $ 1.5 million -lrb- 1.3 million euros -rrb- to ensure derakhshan returns to prison when demanded by authorities . iranian ' blogfather ' began writing online in 2001 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoder , as he became known , began blogging in persian and english in 2001 derakhshan became well-known beginning in 2001 , primarily for having published a persian-language guide to blogging .

" in 2005 and 2006 , he served as a jury member in deutsche welle 's blog awards , also known as the bobs . initially , derakhshan , who was also known by his online moniker hoder , spoke out against the iranian government on his blog .
in january 2006 , he took a highly publicized trip to israel , traveling on his canadian passport , as it is normally forbidden for iranians to travel to israel . several months later his political views shifted , and he became a staunch iranian nationalist in the face of perceived opposition and heated rhetoric from the united states , saying that he supported iran 's right to nuclear weapons . on his persian blog especially , he lashed out at other iranians - many of whom had previously been his friends , peers and colleagues .
mehdi khaliji , an iranian working for a conservative washington , d.c. think tank , even filed a libel suit against derakhshan in 2007 for statements written on derakhshan 's blog . in the autumn of 2008 , derakhshan returned to iran after having lived for many years in canada , france and the united kingdom .
he was arrested on november 1 , 2008 . after a short trial in tehran this summer , derakhshan was sentenced in late september to serve 19.5 years in prison , and was banned for five years from joining any iranian political party .
he was also ordered to pay fines of 30,750 euros , $ 2,900 and 200 british pounds . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nasa also agrees to make germany an associate partner in its lunar science institute in california . in an agreement signed in washington , d.c. on wednesday , the german space agency , better known by its german acronym dlr , and its american counterpart , nasa , agreed to cooperate more fully on joint operations , planetary observations , and other forms of space science .
the move comes just a week after the german government outlined its new space strategy , where it said germany would expand public investments in space science from its current 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- annually to 1.4 billion euros by 2014 .
that policy also underscored increased collaboration with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , where germany is currently the second-largest funder nation after france .
" many space missions and projects can only be carried out through international cooperation , with nasa for example , because of their complexity and the associated costs , " said johann-dietrich worner , dlr 's chairman , in a statement posted to the dlr 's website .
" this is why dlr , as germany 's national space agency and research center , is endeavoring to set up bilateral collaborations such as this , in addition to its other commitments . "
his american counterpart was equally positive on the new agreement .
" nasa has a long history of successful cooperation with the government of germany and an outstanding relationship with dlr , " said charles bolden , nasa 's administrator , in a statement posted to nasa 's website .
" today 's signing will further enhance our ability to work closely together in a variety of mutually beneficial activities in virtually every nasa mission area . "

germany 's new policy also abandons the moon as a solo national goal , but plans on continuing further study as part of european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , and now nasa , projects .
almost four years ago , german government officials had previously announced plans for a 2013 moon flight , and in 2009 , another government official called for an unmanned moon mission in 2015 .
" the moon is for us , the most important goal for the next 20 years , " said hubert reile , aerospace director of the dlr , in an interview with the german press agency , dpa .

but some are also unhappy with the decision . not many among the 1.3 billion chinese had heard the name of liu xiaobo before october .
but thanks to an official media campaign against the 54-year old activist , he is now better known than ever .
chinese media campaign against liu the chinese media have reported that liu is being awarded the nobel prize because he has tried to sabotage the " peaceful rise of china " for years .
he has been compared to the dalai lama who got the prize in 1989 and is regarded as a separatist by beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is regarded as a separatist by the chinese government according to chinese media reports , liu xiaobo has been used by western countries as a political tool in order to weaken china and throw the country into chaos .
the nobel peace prize was described as an award to liu for committing treason .
does china need 300 years of colonialism ?
the chinese media have been trying to discredit liu xiaobo in many ways .
for example , they published quotes of liu saying that china would need at least 300 years of colonialism in order to develop properly .
but those lines were quoted out of context , says jin zhong , a journalist based in hong kong .
he is the publisher and editor-in-chief of the liberal magazine " kaifang " – or " open " .
when liu visited hong kong for the first time in 1988 , he was impressed by the freedom and wealth of the then british colony , remembers jin .
when jin asked liu how china should develop in the future , liu answered somewhat ironically : " china needs at least 300 years of colonialism , if hong kong has needed 100 years for this kind of freedom and prosperity . "
debate within the chinese internet community " of course he was exaggerating , " recalls jin , " liu has been a strong supporter of western-style democracy and freedom . "
still , liu 's quote has been widely discussed within the chinese internet community .
patriotic users are upset , whereas their critics wonder why the chinese cadres are sending their offspring abroad to study in western countries , if they are so negative about the west .
honoring china 's democrats most chinese liberal thinkers welcome the nobel peace prize for liu .
they say that it is not only an award for liu ’ s commitment to more democracy in china , it is in fact honoring the whole chinese democracy movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is a co-initiator of the charter ' 08 " there is no better candidate for this prize , " says qian yuejun , a chinese dissident based in germany , " he was the only choice within the chinese pro-democracy movement who really deserves the award . "
in 2008 , liu xiaobo was one of the initiators of the so-called charter ' 08 – a manifesto demanding more democracy and freedom within china .
two days before it was published , liu was arrested and later sentenced to eleven years in prison on subversion charges .
" as co-initiator , liu has gathered over ten thousand supporters for the charter ' 08 within a short period .
no one else within the divided pro-democracy movement can be as convincing as liu .
he is the only one who can mobilize so many people , " explains qian .
divided movement but among the critics of the communist regime , there are also voices against liu xiaobo .
in their eyes , he is too ready to compromise .
" for an intellectual , liu ’ s thinking is very problematic .
he has studied marxist ideology during his time in university , " argues zhong weiguang , another chinese dissident living in germany .
" he embodies the communist ideology .
that is why he doesn ’ t deserve the nobel peace prize . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 09.12.2010 german , american space agencies sign agreement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea is to cooperate more joint operations and research the two countries pledge expansion of collaborative research .
nasa also agrees to make germany an associate partner in its lunar science institute in california . in an agreement signed in washington , d.c. on wednesday , the german space agency , better known by its german acronym dlr , and its american counterpart , nasa , agreed to cooperate more fully on joint operations , planetary observations , and other forms of space science .
the move comes just a week after the german government outlined its new space strategy , where it said germany would expand public investments in space science from its current 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- annually to 1.4 billion euros by 2014 .
that policy also underscored increased collaboration with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , where germany is currently the second-largest funder nation after france .
" many space missions and projects can only be carried out through international cooperation , with nasa for example , because of their complexity and the associated costs , " said johann-dietrich worner , dlr 's chairman , in a statement posted to the dlr 's website .
" this is why dlr , as germany 's national space agency and research center , is endeavoring to set up bilateral collaborations such as this , in addition to its other commitments . "
his american counterpart was equally positive on the new agreement .
" nasa has a long history of successful cooperation with the government of germany and an outstanding relationship with dlr , " said charles bolden , nasa 's administrator , in a statement posted to nasa 's website .
" today 's signing will further enhance our ability to work closely together in a variety of mutually beneficial activities in virtually every nasa mission area . "
germany to continue lunar focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one german official called the moon " the most important goal " in the same deal , nasa also agreed to make the dlr a nasa lunar science institute associate partner .
the institute , which is based in northern california , brings together moon specialists from around the globe to collaborate on their research .
germany 's new policy also abandons the moon as a solo national goal , but plans on continuing further study as part of european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , and now nasa , projects .
almost four years ago , german government officials had previously announced plans for a 2013 moon flight , and in 2009 , another government official called for an unmanned moon mission in 2015 .
" the moon is for us , the most important goal for the next 20 years , " said hubert reile , aerospace director of the dlr , in an interview with the german press agency , dpa .

norbert roettgen called on states to follow germany 's lead and launch a " rethink " on climate change .
" in business , politics and society , we no longer see climate change as a threat , but an opportunity and a challenge , " said roettgen in a speech to delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment minister said a multilateral approach is needed in cancun he said that germany had invested in tackling climate change and as a result it had created jobs and opportunities .
rich vs poor countries major deadlocks have emerged at cancun between rich and developing nations , largely over how to lower greenhouse-gas emissions .
despite wide agreement on issues such as tackling deforestation , adaptation , technology and climate financing , there is little compromise on either side over limiting co2 emissions that cause climate change .
the european union and the united states want more scrutiny of emerging powers ' actions on climate change and anchoring voluntary emission pledges into the wider un process .
eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard said there had been " no sign of progress on the crunch issues . "
meanwhile developing nations put the onus on industrial powers to back an extension of the kyoto protocol , a treaty limiting the gas emissions of wealthy countries that is set to expire in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu climate commissioner hedegaard said little progress has been made the us never ratified kyoto and china was exempted – and now japan is leading a bloc of countries that refuse to back a new treaty without the world 's two largest polluters .
deadline looms the talks end on friday and roettgen told reporters it was now a " difficult point " as the deadline draws close .
however , mexico 's foreign minister , who is chairing the talks said a comprehensive deal among the 190 countries was " within reach . "
" we need to work together in finding the balance that will make cancun a success , " patricia espinosa said .
her comments were echoed by the eu climate commissioner .
" to come out of cancun with nothing is simply not an option , " hedegaard said .

deutsche welle caught up with him at the un climate summit . on december 6 , the swedish parliament awarded nnimmo bassey the so-called " alternative nobel prize " in recognition of his inspired work to strengthen the environmental movement in his home country of nigeria and throughout africa .
as executive director of environmental rights action in nigeria and chair of friends of the earth international , bassey has become one of africa 's leading advocates for environmental protection and human rights .
he has been particularly influential in mobilizing resistance to multinational oil corporations in his country , drawing attention to the environmental devastation they leave behind and their disregard for the rights of the local population .
after receiving his award in stockholm , bassey traveled to cancun , mexico , where deutsche welle interviewed him on the sidelines of the un climate summit .
deutsche welle : how did you feel when you got the prize ?
nnimmo bassey : when i stood on the platform to receive the reward my mind went to many , many things .
and particularly to a fellow nigerian who won the award in 1994 – the late ken saro wiwa , our number one environmentalist and defender of the environment who was executed in 1995 .
he won the award in 1994 .
and when i stood up there , i knew i was standing on the shoulders of a great man who showed me how to fight for environmental justice and how to resist big corporations who are bent not only on destroying nigeria , but on destroying the climate - destroying the climate of the world by pollution and by release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
are you afraid of facing the same fate as ken saro wiwa ?
no , i am not .
i work with the people , i stand with the people , i am running with the people and there is no option !
you know working with people resisting destructive extraction , working with communities and mass movements who are defending the planet is not an option for me .
and so i look at the people , and i join the people , and i know that we are on the right path .
there is no time for fear .
looking at the negotiations here in cancun , do you feel they are focused on the things that really matter , for example oil extraction , destruction of the environment and climate change ? i think the negotiations to a large extent are not focusing on the real issues .
climate change is caused by very fundamental structural , systemic problems .
one of which is the crisis driven by the market .
all the negotiators talk about is how to use the market to soften global warming - carbon offsetting by planting a tree somewhere in africa while you keep polluting in europe .
this is not a solution , because pollution emissions have to stop at the source .
and they are not talking about lifestyle changes ; they are not talking about less consumption and less of production .
now we have big everything : big oil , big water , big fish ; and everything is coming to an end .
and we would expect our negotiators to look at this problem , the problem of overconsumption and overproduction .
we do n't have more than one planet and we can not go on at the speed and the rate and the direction that we are going now .
we can not keep pushing on with fossil-fuel driven civilization .
we have gone beyond half of the known reserves in the world and we 've done this in only a couple of years , maybe 100 years or so .
how are we going to run on a half tank until eternity ?
you see , it is impossible .
so our leaders are here to talk about how to get money , how not to make commitments or reduce emissions and other , poorer countries are looking at how they can get funding from mitigation .
when temperatures increase due to non-binding targets , at five degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels , no amount of money for mitigation , no amount of money for whatever you do is going to suffice .
we will not know life as it is any more .

but some are also unhappy with the decision . not many among the 1.3 billion chinese had heard the name of liu xiaobo before october .
but thanks to an official media campaign against the 54-year old activist , he is now better known than ever .
chinese media campaign against liu the chinese media have reported that liu is being awarded the nobel prize because he has tried to sabotage the " peaceful rise of china " for years .
he has been compared to the dalai lama who got the prize in 1989 and is regarded as a separatist by beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama is regarded as a separatist by the chinese government according to chinese media reports , liu xiaobo has been used by western countries as a political tool in order to weaken china and throw the country into chaos .
the nobel peace prize was described as an award to liu for committing treason .
does china need 300 years of colonialism ?
the chinese media have been trying to discredit liu xiaobo in many ways .
for example , they published quotes of liu saying that china would need at least 300 years of colonialism in order to develop properly .
but those lines were quoted out of context , says jin zhong , a journalist based in hong kong .
he is the publisher and editor-in-chief of the liberal magazine " kaifang " – or " open " .
when liu visited hong kong for the first time in 1988 , he was impressed by the freedom and wealth of the then british colony , remembers jin .
when jin asked liu how china should develop in the future , liu answered somewhat ironically : " china needs at least 300 years of colonialism , if hong kong has needed 100 years for this kind of freedom and prosperity . "
debate within the chinese internet community " of course he was exaggerating , " recalls jin , " liu has been a strong supporter of western-style democracy and freedom . "
still , liu 's quote has been widely discussed within the chinese internet community .
patriotic users are upset , whereas their critics wonder why the chinese cadres are sending their offspring abroad to study in western countries , if they are so negative about the west .
honoring china 's democrats most chinese liberal thinkers welcome the nobel peace prize for liu .
they say that it is not only an award for liu ’ s commitment to more democracy in china , it is in fact honoring the whole chinese democracy movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is a co-initiator of the charter ' 08 " there is no better candidate for this prize , " says qian yuejun , a chinese dissident based in germany , " he was the only choice within the chinese pro-democracy movement who really deserves the award . "
in 2008 , liu xiaobo was one of the initiators of the so-called charter ' 08 – a manifesto demanding more democracy and freedom within china .
two days before it was published , liu was arrested and later sentenced to eleven years in prison on subversion charges .
" as co-initiator , liu has gathered over ten thousand supporters for the charter ' 08 within a short period .
no one else within the divided pro-democracy movement can be as convincing as liu .
he is the only one who can mobilize so many people , " explains qian .
divided movement but among the critics of the communist regime , there are also voices against liu xiaobo .
in their eyes , he is too ready to compromise .
" for an intellectual , liu ’ s thinking is very problematic .
he has studied marxist ideology during his time in university , " argues zhong weiguang , another chinese dissident living in germany .
" he embodies the communist ideology .
that is why he doesn ’ t deserve the nobel peace prize . "

and with climate change proceeding at the current speed , experts are prepared for worse to come . with the un climate summit underway in cancun , politicians and health experts have met in bonn , germany , to discuss the risks posed to human health by the increasing number of extreme weather events , and ways of helping the population to prepare , adapt – and stay healthy . " it 's not just about people dying from drowning or accidents during the floods , " said juergen becker , secretary of state in bonn ’ s environment ministry .
" we also have to look at measures to tackle water pollution afterwards or problems resulting from mould growing inside affected buildings . " becker cites the heat waves in europe during 2003 and 2006 as examples .
he stresses that even in a wealthy industrialized country like germany , with its good medical infrastructure , there were an estimated 7,000 deaths from heart attacks and heat-related illnesses during the 2003 heat wave - one of the most extreme summer events ever recorded in europe .
the environment expert is also worried about increased flooding in germany in future . over the past 20 years , more than 650,000 people have died in around 14,000 extreme weather events - like storms , floods and heat waves - according to the latest climate risk index published by germanwatch in cancun .
and with climate change proceeding at the current speed that number is likely to keep increasing . the german environment ministry , the environment agency , the german meteorological office dwd and the world health organization europe all say it 's high time to get prepared for worse to come . extreme weather through climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old and young are most at risk from climate change .
the increase in the number of extreme weather events is quite clearly related to the changing climate , says paul becker , deputy director of germany ’ s meteorological office , the dwd .
it is not only the average temperature that is on the rise , both globally and regionally , says the weather expert . " the extremes are on the rise .
that means hot days for instance .
and clearly , an increase in the number of hot days and also warm nights , which we refer to as tropical , when the temperature does not sink below 20 degrees celsius – obviously have an effect on the human body , " said becker . the world health organization is highly concerned about both the direct and the indirect effects of climate change on health .
srdan matic , a health and environment expert with who europe , says as many as 70,000 people are estimated to have died in europe as a whole during the heat wave of 2003 .
the elderly , children and the homeless are the most vulnerable . matic also cites this summer ’ s heat wave in russia as an example of the type of extreme weather event which results in a high number of deaths and casualties .
initial estimates put the number of extra deaths attributable to the heat wave at between 10 and 20,000 in just two weeks , he says . the problem was compounded by the fires across russia .
in addition to the direct effects , the air pollution caused by smoke also represented a major health hazard .
if the wind had been blowing in a different direction , matic says , other european countries would also have had to deal with the health problems caused by air pollution . other long-term effects in regions where the climate becomes warmer will be water shortages and drought , which clearly have an impact on people 's health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiger mosquitos are finding a new home in a warmer europe the experts are also concerned about invasive species of plants and animals bringing health problems to areas where they were not prevalent before .
meteorologist paul becker mentions allergies and other problems caused by new types of pollen .
the pollen season can also be lengthened by changes in the climate . the arrival of insects previously native in tropical areas is presenting the health experts with another “ headache ” .
the tiger mosquito which spreads dengue fever , for instance , has already moved into european countries like italy , france , spain and switzerland . " learn to live with it " our societies have to adapt to changing climatic conditions , says becker , to protect the population from health problems .
reliable forecasts , early warning systems and good communication are essential elements . in the case of an extreme heat wave , for instance , he says germany already has an early warning system , which makes sure the public is informed about the risks so that , for instance , homes for the elderly can adjust the diet of residents and shift them to cooler accommodation .

and with climate change proceeding at the current speed , experts are prepared for worse to come . with the un climate summit underway in cancun , politicians and health experts have met in bonn , germany , to discuss the risks posed to human health by the increasing number of extreme weather events , and ways of helping the population to prepare , adapt – and stay healthy . " it 's not just about people dying from drowning or accidents during the floods , " said juergen becker , secretary of state in bonn ’ s environment ministry .
" we also have to look at measures to tackle water pollution afterwards or problems resulting from mould growing inside affected buildings . " becker cites the heat waves in europe during 2003 and 2006 as examples .
he stresses that even in a wealthy industrialized country like germany , with its good medical infrastructure , there were an estimated 7,000 deaths from heart attacks and heat-related illnesses during the 2003 heat wave - one of the most extreme summer events ever recorded in europe .
the environment expert is also worried about increased flooding in germany in future . over the past 20 years , more than 650,000 people have died in around 14,000 extreme weather events - like storms , floods and heat waves - according to the latest climate risk index published by germanwatch in cancun .
and with climate change proceeding at the current speed that number is likely to keep increasing . the german environment ministry , the environment agency , the german meteorological office dwd and the world health organization europe all say it 's high time to get prepared for worse to come . extreme weather through climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old and young are most at risk from climate change .
the increase in the number of extreme weather events is quite clearly related to the changing climate , says paul becker , deputy director of germany ’ s meteorological office , the dwd .
it is not only the average temperature that is on the rise , both globally and regionally , says the weather expert . " the extremes are on the rise .
that means hot days for instance .
and clearly , an increase in the number of hot days and also warm nights , which we refer to as tropical , when the temperature does not sink below 20 degrees celsius – obviously have an effect on the human body , " said becker . the world health organization is highly concerned about both the direct and the indirect effects of climate change on health .
srdan matic , a health and environment expert with who europe , says as many as 70,000 people are estimated to have died in europe as a whole during the heat wave of 2003 .
the elderly , children and the homeless are the most vulnerable . matic also cites this summer ’ s heat wave in russia as an example of the type of extreme weather event which results in a high number of deaths and casualties .
initial estimates put the number of extra deaths attributable to the heat wave at between 10 and 20,000 in just two weeks , he says . the problem was compounded by the fires across russia .
in addition to the direct effects , the air pollution caused by smoke also represented a major health hazard .
if the wind had been blowing in a different direction , matic says , other european countries would also have had to deal with the health problems caused by air pollution . other long-term effects in regions where the climate becomes warmer will be water shortages and drought , which clearly have an impact on people 's health . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiger mosquitos are finding a new home in a warmer europe the experts are also concerned about invasive species of plants and animals bringing health problems to areas where they were not prevalent before .
meteorologist paul becker mentions allergies and other problems caused by new types of pollen .
the pollen season can also be lengthened by changes in the climate . the arrival of insects previously native in tropical areas is presenting the health experts with another “ headache ” .
the tiger mosquito which spreads dengue fever , for instance , has already moved into european countries like italy , france , spain and switzerland . " learn to live with it " our societies have to adapt to changing climatic conditions , says becker , to protect the population from health problems .
reliable forecasts , early warning systems and good communication are essential elements . in the case of an extreme heat wave , for instance , he says germany already has an early warning system , which makes sure the public is informed about the risks so that , for instance , homes for the elderly can adjust the diet of residents and shift them to cooler accommodation .
flood protection measures are another example he cites , where measures are already being implemented to adapt to climate change . ultimately , says srdan matic from the who , we have got to get used to extreme weather events .

the find suggests there could be mountains made of diamond nearby . a team at the massachusetts institute of technology researching a large gaseous exoplanet , or a planet outside our solar system , have discovered an unusual composition of its atmosphere that could redefine our understanding of how life is formed .
the study was published wednesday in the journal nature .
the planet , known as wasp-12b , is 1.4 times the mass of jupiter and located about 1,200 light years away and was discovered in 2009 by researchers at the united kingdom-based consortium for wide angle search for planets -lrb- wasp -rrb- , who are also co-authors of the new study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the so far undetected neighbors of wasp-12b could harbor strange life " this is new territory and will motivate researchers to study what the interiors of carbon-rich planets could be made of , " said nikku madhusudhan , in a statement .
she is the lead author of the study , and now a postdoctoral researcher at princeton university , in the united states . although wasp-12b is a " hot jupiter " - a jupiter-sized , extremely hot planet consisting mainly of gas - and is therefore unlikely to host life , scientists believe the planet 's unique chemistry could overturn our notions of the necessary ingredients for life .
rocky neighbors the researchers believe the abundance of carbon was due to the formation of the planet from rocky materials high in carbon as opposed to icy bodies like comets .
this suggests that there may be an entire range of carbon abundances available for making planets in that system .
if there are any rocky planets in the system , it is likely they are covered in tar-like substances rich in organic substances – since carbon is one of what scientists consider the six essential elements of life -lrb- the other five being oxygen , hydrogen , nitrogen , phosphorus and sulphur -rrb- .
if detected , these smaller planets could also have carbon-rich atmospheres , and any life might have to survive with very little water and oxygen and an abundance of methane .
this is difficult to square with our current knowledge of the chemical properties of life .
but since nasa recently purported to have discovered bacteria that had replaced the phosphorus in its dna with arsenic , scientists may soon be forced to re-consider their assessment of the necessary conditions and elements of life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study of exoplanets is one of the newest branches of astronomy other researchers said that these are considerations for the future .
" the honest answer is that that 's very speculative , " said coel hellier , a professor of astrophysics at keele university in the united kingdom , and another co-author of the paper , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we do n't really know whether life could live in that sort of environment .
there are certainly a lot of planets out there that do have very methane-rich atmospheres and very little oxygen , so it 's certainly worth thinking about . "
diamond mountains the other striking image that the paper posits suggests that the possible rocky planets near wasp-12b could have mountains made of diamond .
hellier believes this is easily imaginable .
" it 's quite possible that there are rocky planets in that system , even though they are too small for us to detect , " he said .
" if there are , then they would have carbon-rich rock , rather than what we have on earth , which is very oxygen-rich – most of the earth 's crust is made out of rock that is roughly half oxygen .
if you have rock in an environment that is very carbon-rich , then you 'd expect to have rocks which could be diamond or graphite , which are different forms of carbon . "
astronomers can figure out a planet 's atmospheric composition by observing its flux , or the light emitted by the planet , at different wavelengths .
the team , coordinated by joe harrington , a planetary scientist at the university of central florida , used nasa 's spitzer space telescope to observe the flux from wasp-12b , at four wavelengths , right before it passed behind its star , an event known as secondary eclipse .
while the first exoplanet was only discovered 15 years ago , there has been an extremely rapid rate of growth since then . " astronomers have now found about 500 of them in total , " heiller added . " we 're really now for the first time able to actually measure and detect what their atmospheres are made of .
this is a significant step towards showing that we now have the technology to do that . "
a cautious view frederic pont , senior lecturer in astrophysics at the university of exeter in the uk , admires the analysis behind the new paper , but is wary of excitable media reports and premature conclusions . " it ’ s very good work , the team is excellent , " he told deutsche welle .
" it ’ s very interesting , but there are i think just seven data points .
usually if you want to take a spectroscopy of a planet you ’ re talking about hundreds of points , so with seven points you need a lot of interpolation . " pont lamented the tendency to oversimplification in the media coverage of new exoplanetary discoveries .
" it ’ s work in progress , right ? " he said .
" usually the way it works is this : a result is published , and then the debate starts , and maybe two or three years later we know what was correct or not .
but in the media we get the impression that the scientific paper is the discovery . " " it ’ s a very complex set of hypotheses to get to these results , " he said of the wasp-12b paper .
" they don ’ t see carbon and oxygen , they see the indirect signature of some molecules and they have to assume the carbon and oxygen equilibrium .
but the results themselves are extraordinary .
they are really at the forefront of what we can do . "

a two-time dw best of the blogs jury member , his family put up $ 1.5 million worth of bail for his freedom . iranian-canadian blogger hossein derakhshan was temporarily released from a tehran prison , after having been incarcerated for 26 months , according to a report thursday on mashregh news , a conservative iranian news website . the site was among the first to report derakhshan 's conviction at the end of september on charges of " conspiring with hostile governments , disseminating anti-islamic propaganda , disseminating anti-revolutionary propaganda , blasphemy , and operating and managing obscene pornography websites . " the account was confirmed by a source close to the derakhshan family , who wished to remain anonymous and said derakhshan was " happy to be out , " adding " we have been pushing for this for months , especially after his trial , but it has always been refused . " the same source also told deutsche welle that derakhshan " will be out for a couple of days only , " and that the family had put up a bail with a value of $ 1.5 million -lrb- 1.3 million euros -rrb- to ensure derakhshan returns to prison when demanded by authorities . iranian ' blogfather ' began writing online in 2001 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoder , as he became known , began blogging in persian and english in 2001 derakhshan became well-known beginning in 2001 , primarily for having published a persian-language guide to blogging .
as he continued to blog in persian and english , he was soon after widely interviewed in western media outlets , where he was dubbed iran 's " blogfather . " in 2005 and 2006 , he served as a jury member in deutsche welle 's blog awards , also known as the bobs . initially , derakhshan , who was also known by his online moniker hoder , spoke out against the iranian government on his blog .
in january 2006 , he took a highly publicized trip to israel , traveling on his canadian passport , as it is normally forbidden for iranians to travel to israel . several months later his political views shifted , and he became a staunch iranian nationalist in the face of perceived opposition and heated rhetoric from the united states , saying that he supported iran 's right to nuclear weapons . on his persian blog especially , he lashed out at other iranians - many of whom had previously been his friends , peers and colleagues .
mehdi khaliji , an iranian working for a conservative washington , d.c. think tank , even filed a libel suit against derakhshan in 2007 for statements written on derakhshan 's blog . in the autumn of 2008 , derakhshan returned to iran after having lived for many years in canada , france and the united kingdom .
he was arrested on november 1 , 2008 . after a short trial in tehran this summer , derakhshan was sentenced in late september to serve 19.5 years in prison , and was banned for five years from joining any iranian political party .
he was also ordered to pay fines of 30,750 euros , $ 2,900 and 200 british pounds . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

koenig stressed to german deputy national security advisor rolf nikel the potential negative implications for bilateral relations between germany and the us , in particular counter-terrorism cooperation , if steps were taken to " seek the arrest or extradition of us citizens / officials , " the documents said .
thirteen operatives , believed to be cia , were eventually charged in indictments in munich and spain , as investigators concluded that the plane that transported masri passed through spanish territory .

a two-time dw best of the blogs jury member , his family put up $ 1.5 million worth of bail for his freedom . iranian-canadian blogger hossein derakhshan was temporarily released from a tehran prison , after having been incarcerated for 26 months , according to a report thursday on mashregh news , a conservative iranian news website . the site was among the first to report derakhshan 's conviction at the end of september on charges of " conspiring with hostile governments , disseminating anti-islamic propaganda , disseminating anti-revolutionary propaganda , blasphemy , and operating and managing obscene pornography websites . " the account was confirmed by a source close to the derakhshan family , who wished to remain anonymous and said derakhshan was " happy to be out , " adding " we have been pushing for this for months , especially after his trial , but it has always been refused . " the same source also told deutsche welle that derakhshan " will be out for a couple of days only , " and that the family had put up a bail with a value of $ 1.5 million -lrb- 1.3 million euros -rrb- to ensure derakhshan returns to prison when demanded by authorities . iranian ' blogfather ' began writing online in 2001 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoder , as he became known , began blogging in persian and english in 2001 derakhshan became well-known beginning in 2001 , primarily for having published a persian-language guide to blogging .
as he continued to blog in persian and english , he was soon after widely interviewed in western media outlets , where he was dubbed iran 's " blogfather . " in 2005 and 2006 , he served as a jury member in deutsche welle 's blog awards , also known as the bobs . initially , derakhshan , who was also known by his online moniker hoder , spoke out against the iranian government on his blog .
in january 2006 , he took a highly publicized trip to israel , traveling on his canadian passport , as it is normally forbidden for iranians to travel to israel . several months later his political views shifted , and he became a staunch iranian nationalist in the face of perceived opposition and heated rhetoric from the united states , saying that he supported iran 's right to nuclear weapons . on his persian blog especially , he lashed out at other iranians - many of whom had previously been his friends , peers and colleagues .
mehdi khaliji , an iranian working for a conservative washington , d.c. think tank , even filed a libel suit against derakhshan in 2007 for statements written on derakhshan 's blog . in the autumn of 2008 , derakhshan returned to iran after having lived for many years in canada , france and the united kingdom .
he was arrested on november 1 , 2008 . after a short trial in tehran this summer , derakhshan was sentenced in late september to serve 19.5 years in prison , and was banned for five years from joining any iranian political party .
he was also ordered to pay fines of 30,750 euros , $ 2,900 and 200 british pounds . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 09.12.2010 german , american space agencies sign agreement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea is to cooperate more joint operations and research the two countries pledge expansion of collaborative research .
nasa also agrees to make germany an associate partner in its lunar science institute in california . in an agreement signed in washington , d.c. on wednesday , the german space agency , better known by its german acronym dlr , and its american counterpart , nasa , agreed to cooperate more fully on joint operations , planetary observations , and other forms of space science .
the move comes just a week after the german government outlined its new space strategy , where it said germany would expand public investments in space science from its current 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- annually to 1.4 billion euros by 2014 .
that policy also underscored increased collaboration with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , where germany is currently the second-largest funder nation after france .
" many space missions and projects can only be carried out through international cooperation , with nasa for example , because of their complexity and the associated costs , " said johann-dietrich worner , dlr 's chairman , in a statement posted to the dlr 's website .
" this is why dlr , as germany 's national space agency and research center , is endeavoring to set up bilateral collaborations such as this , in addition to its other commitments . "
his american counterpart was equally positive on the new agreement .
" nasa has a long history of successful cooperation with the government of germany and an outstanding relationship with dlr , " said charles bolden , nasa 's administrator , in a statement posted to nasa 's website .
" today 's signing will further enhance our ability to work closely together in a variety of mutually beneficial activities in virtually every nasa mission area . "
germany to continue lunar focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one german official called the moon " the most important goal " in the same deal , nasa also agreed to make the dlr a nasa lunar science institute associate partner .
the institute , which is based in northern california , brings together moon specialists from around the globe to collaborate on their research .
germany 's new policy also abandons the moon as a solo national goal , but plans on continuing further study as part of european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , and now nasa , projects .
almost four years ago , german government officials had previously announced plans for a 2013 moon flight , and in 2009 , another government official called for an unmanned moon mission in 2015 .
" the moon is for us , the most important goal for the next 20 years , " said hubert reile , aerospace director of the dlr , in an interview with the german press agency , dpa .

deutsche welle caught up with him at the un climate summit . on december 6 , the swedish parliament awarded nnimmo bassey the so-called " alternative nobel prize " in recognition of his inspired work to strengthen the environmental movement in his home country of nigeria and throughout africa .
as executive director of environmental rights action in nigeria and chair of friends of the earth international , bassey has become one of africa 's leading advocates for environmental protection and human rights .
he has been particularly influential in mobilizing resistance to multinational oil corporations in his country , drawing attention to the environmental devastation they leave behind and their disregard for the rights of the local population .
after receiving his award in stockholm , bassey traveled to cancun , mexico , where deutsche welle interviewed him on the sidelines of the un climate summit .
deutsche welle : how did you feel when you got the prize ?
nnimmo bassey : when i stood on the platform to receive the reward my mind went to many , many things .
and particularly to a fellow nigerian who won the award in 1994 – the late ken saro wiwa , our number one environmentalist and defender of the environment who was executed in 1995 .
he won the award in 1994 .
and when i stood up there , i knew i was standing on the shoulders of a great man who showed me how to fight for environmental justice and how to resist big corporations who are bent not only on destroying nigeria , but on destroying the climate - destroying the climate of the world by pollution and by release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
are you afraid of facing the same fate as ken saro wiwa ?
no , i am not .
i work with the people , i stand with the people , i am running with the people and there is no option !
you know working with people resisting destructive extraction , working with communities and mass movements who are defending the planet is not an option for me .
and so i look at the people , and i join the people , and i know that we are on the right path .
there is no time for fear .
looking at the negotiations here in cancun , do you feel they are focused on the things that really matter , for example oil extraction , destruction of the environment and climate change ? i think the negotiations to a large extent are not focusing on the real issues .
climate change is caused by very fundamental structural , systemic problems .
one of which is the crisis driven by the market .
all the negotiators talk about is how to use the market to soften global warming - carbon offsetting by planting a tree somewhere in africa while you keep polluting in europe .
this is not a solution , because pollution emissions have to stop at the source .
and they are not talking about lifestyle changes ; they are not talking about less consumption and less of production .
now we have big everything : big oil , big water , big fish ; and everything is coming to an end .
and we would expect our negotiators to look at this problem , the problem of overconsumption and overproduction .
we do n't have more than one planet and we can not go on at the speed and the rate and the direction that we are going now .
we can not keep pushing on with fossil-fuel driven civilization .
we have gone beyond half of the known reserves in the world and we 've done this in only a couple of years , maybe 100 years or so .
how are we going to run on a half tank until eternity ?
you see , it is impossible .
so our leaders are here to talk about how to get money , how not to make commitments or reduce emissions and other , poorer countries are looking at how they can get funding from mitigation .
when temperatures increase due to non-binding targets , at five degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels , no amount of money for mitigation , no amount of money for whatever you do is going to suffice .
we will not know life as it is any more .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 09.12.2010 astronomers unlock new secrets of exoplanets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wasp-12b has been found to be a carbon-rich planet a team of scientists at the massachusetts institute of technology have discovered the first planetary atmosphere with more carbon than oxygen .
the find suggests there could be mountains made of diamond nearby . a team at the massachusetts institute of technology researching a large gaseous exoplanet , or a planet outside our solar system , have discovered an unusual composition of its atmosphere that could redefine our understanding of how life is formed .
the study was published wednesday in the journal nature .
the planet , known as wasp-12b , is 1.4 times the mass of jupiter and located about 1,200 light years away and was discovered in 2009 by researchers at the united kingdom-based consortium for wide angle search for planets -lrb- wasp -rrb- , who are also co-authors of the new study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the so far undetected neighbors of wasp-12b could harbor strange life " this is new territory and will motivate researchers to study what the interiors of carbon-rich planets could be made of , " said nikku madhusudhan , in a statement .
she is the lead author of the study , and now a postdoctoral researcher at princeton university , in the united states . although wasp-12b is a " hot jupiter " - a jupiter-sized , extremely hot planet consisting mainly of gas - and is therefore unlikely to host life , scientists believe the planet 's unique chemistry could overturn our notions of the necessary ingredients for life .
rocky neighbors the researchers believe the abundance of carbon was due to the formation of the planet from rocky materials high in carbon as opposed to icy bodies like comets .
this suggests that there may be an entire range of carbon abundances available for making planets in that system .
if there are any rocky planets in the system , it is likely they are covered in tar-like substances rich in organic substances – since carbon is one of what scientists consider the six essential elements of life -lrb- the other five being oxygen , hydrogen , nitrogen , phosphorus and sulphur -rrb- .
if detected , these smaller planets could also have carbon-rich atmospheres , and any life might have to survive with very little water and oxygen and an abundance of methane .
this is difficult to square with our current knowledge of the chemical properties of life .
but since nasa recently purported to have discovered bacteria that had replaced the phosphorus in its dna with arsenic , scientists may soon be forced to re-consider their assessment of the necessary conditions and elements of life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study of exoplanets is one of the newest branches of astronomy other researchers said that these are considerations for the future .
" the honest answer is that that 's very speculative , " said coel hellier , a professor of astrophysics at keele university in the united kingdom , and another co-author of the paper , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we do n't really know whether life could live in that sort of environment .
there are certainly a lot of planets out there that do have very methane-rich atmospheres and very little oxygen , so it 's certainly worth thinking about . "
diamond mountains the other striking image that the paper posits suggests that the possible rocky planets near wasp-12b could have mountains made of diamond .
hellier believes this is easily imaginable .
" it 's quite possible that there are rocky planets in that system , even though they are too small for us to detect , " he said .
" if there are , then they would have carbon-rich rock , rather than what we have on earth , which is very oxygen-rich – most of the earth 's crust is made out of rock that is roughly half oxygen .
if you have rock in an environment that is very carbon-rich , then you 'd expect to have rocks which could be diamond or graphite , which are different forms of carbon . "
astronomers can figure out a planet 's atmospheric composition by observing its flux , or the light emitted by the planet , at different wavelengths .
the team , coordinated by joe harrington , a planetary scientist at the university of central florida , used nasa 's spitzer space telescope to observe the flux from wasp-12b , at four wavelengths , right before it passed behind its star , an event known as secondary eclipse .
while the first exoplanet was only discovered 15 years ago , there has been an extremely rapid rate of growth since then . " astronomers have now found about 500 of them in total , " heiller added . " we 're really now for the first time able to actually measure and detect what their atmospheres are made of .
this is a significant step towards showing that we now have the technology to do that . "
a cautious view frederic pont , senior lecturer in astrophysics at the university of exeter in the uk , admires the analysis behind the new paper , but is wary of excitable media reports and premature conclusions . " it ’ s very good work , the team is excellent , " he told deutsche welle .
" it ’ s very interesting , but there are i think just seven data points .
usually if you want to take a spectroscopy of a planet you ’ re talking about hundreds of points , so with seven points you need a lot of interpolation . " pont lamented the tendency to oversimplification in the media coverage of new exoplanetary discoveries .
" it ’ s work in progress , right ? " he said .
" usually the way it works is this : a result is published , and then the debate starts , and maybe two or three years later we know what was correct or not .
but in the media we get the impression that the scientific paper is the discovery . " " it ’ s a very complex set of hypotheses to get to these results , " he said of the wasp-12b paper .
" they don ’ t see carbon and oxygen , they see the indirect signature of some molecules and they have to assume the carbon and oxygen equilibrium .
but the results themselves are extraordinary .
they are really at the forefront of what we can do . "

norbert roettgen called on states to follow germany 's lead and launch a " rethink " on climate change .
" in business , politics and society , we no longer see climate change as a threat , but an opportunity and a challenge , " said roettgen in a speech to delegates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the environment minister said a multilateral approach is needed in cancun he said that germany had invested in tackling climate change and as a result it had created jobs and opportunities .
rich vs poor countries major deadlocks have emerged at cancun between rich and developing nations , largely over how to lower greenhouse-gas emissions .
despite wide agreement on issues such as tackling deforestation , adaptation , technology and climate financing , there is little compromise on either side over limiting co2 emissions that cause climate change .
the european union and the united states want more scrutiny of emerging powers ' actions on climate change and anchoring voluntary emission pledges into the wider un process .
eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard said there had been " no sign of progress on the crunch issues . "
meanwhile developing nations put the onus on industrial powers to back an extension of the kyoto protocol , a treaty limiting the gas emissions of wealthy countries that is set to expire in 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu climate commissioner hedegaard said little progress has been made the us never ratified kyoto and china was exempted – and now japan is leading a bloc of countries that refuse to back a new treaty without the world 's two largest polluters .
deadline looms the talks end on friday and roettgen told reporters it was now a " difficult point " as the deadline draws close .
however , mexico 's foreign minister , who is chairing the talks said a comprehensive deal among the 190 countries was " within reach . "
" we need to work together in finding the balance that will make cancun a success , " patricia espinosa said .
her comments were echoed by the eu climate commissioner .
" to come out of cancun with nothing is simply not an option , " hedegaard said .

thirteen operatives , believed to be cia , were eventually charged in indictments in munich and spain , as investigators concluded that the plane that transported masri passed through spanish territory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 09.12.2010 hydropower dams threaten livelihoods of cambodia 's poor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cambodia depends on fishing for much of its daily protein as plans to build hydropower dams on the mekong river gather pace , there are warnings that their construction could damage fish stocks , on which millions of cambodia ’ s most vulnerable people rely for protein . on thursday , laos officially inaugurated its latest hydropower dam on a tributary of the mekong , one of the world ’ s longest rivers .
the mekong rises in the tibetan plateau and runs almost 5,000 kilometres through six countries – including laos and cambodia – before it meets the sea in vietnam .
need for more energy countries like laos and cambodia need electricity for their own purposes and to export to their energy-hungry neighbors .
the mekong and its tributaries offer a logical solution – why not dam the river , and push the water through turbines to generate power ?
it is a question that has grown more urgent in recent years .
in another five years , there will be 47 dams on the tributaries of the mekong .
around a dozen more are planned for the mainstream .
but campaigners say blocking the mekong will severely damage fish migration , and cripple fish catches .
that is important because millions in the region rely on this free resource for nutrition and food security .
freshwater fish provide up to 80 percent of the protein eaten by cambodians , and at least one-third of fish in this river are migratory species .
hazards of development a recent projection highlighted the risks if a proposed 11 dams are built on the mainstream of the mekong river – two of them in cambodia .
that would add to 77 dams that are already built or planned for tributaries of the mekong over the next two decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cambodian boy stretches to hoist his makeshift fishing net out of the mekong river dr eric baran is the senior research scientist at the phnom penh office of worldfish , an international research body .
he believes that the consequences of this construction in terms of fish production would be a loss , and this loss is due to the impact on the migratory fish .
" we calculated that the loss of fish by 2030 , if the 11 mainstream dams are built , would amount to between 600,000 tons and 900,000 tons every year .
we ’ re talking about a gigantic number that could have a huge impact on food security in the region , in particular in cambodia and laos . "
cambodia would lose over 200,000 tons of fish – more than half its annual catch .
millions of cambodians live on the cusp of poverty and rely on the bounty of the river to survive .
the mekong river commission – or mrc – is an intergovernmental body set up 15 years ago by cambodia , thailand , laos and vietnam to promote cooperation over the river .
china and myanmar are also involved in the mrc .
a recent report from the mrc recommended that any decisions on whether to build dams on the mainstream mekong be deferred for a decade , since building them would be irreversible , and their impact would be substantial .
it warned cambodia would likely suffer more than any other country from the proposed dams .
the next step is for the politicians to sit down and work out a way forward .
earlier this week cambodia ’ s agriculture and fisheries minister admitted that damming the mekong could interrupt fish migrations .

rights group amnesty international , which organized the demonstration , attempted to use the event to hand over a petition signed by some 100,000 people in support of liu .
however , the gates to the embassy remained locked and all windows were shuttered , leading to the protestors piling up the signed petitions outside the building perimeter .
" the chinese government should be celebrating this global recognition of a chinese writer and activist , " said ai secretary general salil shetty . " instead , the government 's very public tantrum has generated even more critical attention inside and outside china , and , ironically , emphasized the significance of liu xiaobo 's message of respect for human rights , " shetty said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang says most nations will boycott the ceremony amnesty and the nobel institute have meanwhile accused beijing of pressuring chinese nationals living in oslo to join counter-protests against liu .
the 54-year-old writer , human rights activist and critic of one-party rule in china was jailed in december 2009 for 11 years on subversion charges after co-authoring a petition calling for a multi-party system in china .
he was awarded the 2010 nobel peace prize for his long non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in the communist state .
however , the move greatly angered china , which saw it as an attempt to meddle in its internal affairs .
pressure on china ' can not succeed ' beijing has gone to great lengths in recent weeks to push for a boycott of the nobel ceremony in oslo , claiming that most of the world was opposed to the nobel committee 's decision to honor liu .
so far , some 20 states , including russia , cuba and venezuela , and most of which have strong commercial ties with beijing , have followed china in shunning the event .
" those people at the nobel committee have to admit they are in the minority .

" this is not a prize against china .
this is a prize honoring people in china , " jagland told a press conference traditionally held by the laureate on the day before the prize ceremony .
jagland insisted however it was important to push for political reforms and an opening of civil society to parallel china 's massive economic development .
" to a large extent the future of the world is in the hands of this big country , " he said .
speaking of the empty chair that will represent the absent dissident , jagland said " it is a very strong symbol -lrb- that -rrb- shows how appropriate this prize was . "

the mekong rises in the tibetan plateau and runs almost 5,000 kilometres through six countries – including laos and cambodia – before it meets the sea in vietnam .
need for more energy countries like laos and cambodia need electricity for their own purposes and to export to their energy-hungry neighbors .
the mekong and its tributaries offer a logical solution – why not dam the river , and push the water through turbines to generate power ?
it is a question that has grown more urgent in recent years .
in another five years , there will be 47 dams on the tributaries of the mekong .
around a dozen more are planned for the mainstream .
but campaigners say blocking the mekong will severely damage fish migration , and cripple fish catches .
that is important because millions in the region rely on this free resource for nutrition and food security .
freshwater fish provide up to 80 percent of the protein eaten by cambodians , and at least one-third of fish in this river are migratory species .
hazards of development a recent projection highlighted the risks if a proposed 11 dams are built on the mainstream of the mekong river – two of them in cambodia .
that would add to 77 dams that are already built or planned for tributaries of the mekong over the next two decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cambodian boy stretches to hoist his makeshift fishing net out of the mekong river dr eric baran is the senior research scientist at the phnom penh office of worldfish , an international research body .
he believes that the consequences of this construction in terms of fish production would be a loss , and this loss is due to the impact on the migratory fish .
" we calculated that the loss of fish by 2030 , if the 11 mainstream dams are built , would amount to between 600,000 tons and 900,000 tons every year .
we ’ re talking about a gigantic number that could have a huge impact on food security in the region , in particular in cambodia and laos . "
cambodia would lose over 200,000 tons of fish – more than half its annual catch .
millions of cambodians live on the cusp of poverty and rely on the bounty of the river to survive .
the mekong river commission – or mrc – is an intergovernmental body set up 15 years ago by cambodia , thailand , laos and vietnam to promote cooperation over the river .
china and myanmar are also involved in the mrc .
a recent report from the mrc recommended that any decisions on whether to build dams on the mainstream mekong be deferred for a decade , since building them would be irreversible , and their impact would be substantial .
it warned cambodia would likely suffer more than any other country from the proposed dams .
the next step is for the politicians to sit down and work out a way forward .
earlier this week cambodia ’ s agriculture and fisheries minister admitted that damming the mekong could interrupt fish migrations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 09.12.2010 obama 's moral compass : a year after his nobel peace prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the anniversary of his nobel speech , obama 's vision remains what it was : a vision as human rights organizations celebrate this year 's nobel peace price winner liu xiaobo , obama is struggling to close the gap between idealistic expectations and political pragmatism a year after his nobel speech . on december 10 , 2009 , president barack obama delivered his nobel speech in the city hall of oslo , norway .
he spoke of men and women " far more deserving of the prize " than him - and he meant people like liu xiaobo .
imprisoned in china , liu received this year 's nobel peace prize after more than two decades of an arduous , non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in china .
obama , on the other hand , received the award for a vision , a change in tone in international relations , and , many argue , in an attempt to settle accounts with his predecessor , george w. bush .
a dissatisfying record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's vision of a world free of nuclear weapons impressed not only the nobel committee while obama has kept his promise of withdrawing combat troops from iraq , he has n't followed through on many of the political projects he received the nobel peace prize for : a new strategic arms reduction treaty with russia , the closing of guantanamo bay detention camp , and a real step forward in meeting the world 's climate challenges .
but who 's to blame ?
did obama lose the moral compass he assigned so much importance to in his nobel speech ?
facing an adverse political climate " obama 's standpoints are better than his record , " marco fey from the peace research institute frankfurt told deutsche welle .
" on a variety of issues , he 's caught in the political climate in the us . "
fey cited the arms reduction treaty ' new start ' as a fitting example .
obama and russian president dmitry medvedev signed the treaty in april 2010 , but it has n't been ratified by the senate so far .
" obama , senior department of state officials , they all support the treaty , " fey said .
" it would be a real milestone in terms of arms control .
but republicans use the most absurd arguments to block it in the senate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the closure of guantanamo bay detention camp remains uncertain political capital is scarce obama 's decision to close down the detention camp at guantanamo bay has met fierce congressional opposition as well . but critics argue that obama has n't really invested his political capital in the measure compared to other projects he pushed through congress - such as health care reform .
the recent conviction of canadian citizen omar ahmed khadr who was brought to guantanamo 's military prison at the age of 16 , exemplifies obama 's lack of self-assertion in putting an end to the facility and its practice .
" who would have thought that , under obama , someone who 's accused of a crime committed at the age of 15 would be tried before a military commission at guantanamo ? "
reed brody from human rights watch told deutsche welle .
promoting human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is this year 's recipient of the nobel peace prize indeed , obama promised to be a persistent advocate of human rights at home and abroad . he has frequently underscored the significance of peaceful activists like liu xiaobo - the first chinese recipient of the award .
liu was an influential participant of the tiananmen protests in 1989 and is a leading author of charta 08 , a manifesto promoting fundamental human rights and democratization in china .
in december 2009 , after a series of earlier internments , he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for " inciting subversion of state power . "
obama and other heads of state have called on the chinese government to release liu .
however , critics argue that obama has failed to make human rights a guiding principle of us relations with other countries - highlighted and , some say , undermined by obama 's recent efforts to expand chinese-american cooperation .
" it 's not helpful when the government repeatedly describes human rights and democracy as issues on which the us and china will inevitably disagree , " brody said . a vision 's prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , al gore gave his nobel speech at oslo 's city hall whether attributed to obama 's political environment or his setting of priorities , the gap between obama 's vision and his actual achievements remains a fact .
yet , obama is sticking to his optimistic rhetoric and continues to set visionary goals , for example , regarding the middle east peace process .
" he 's set the goal of reaching a peace accord within a year , " said fey .
" that 's a very ambitious undertaking . "

the mekong rises in the tibetan plateau and runs almost 5,000 kilometres through six countries – including laos and cambodia – before it meets the sea in vietnam .
need for more energy countries like laos and cambodia need electricity for their own purposes and to export to their energy-hungry neighbors .
the mekong and its tributaries offer a logical solution – why not dam the river , and push the water through turbines to generate power ?
it is a question that has grown more urgent in recent years .
in another five years , there will be 47 dams on the tributaries of the mekong .
around a dozen more are planned for the mainstream .
but campaigners say blocking the mekong will severely damage fish migration , and cripple fish catches .
that is important because millions in the region rely on this free resource for nutrition and food security .
freshwater fish provide up to 80 percent of the protein eaten by cambodians , and at least one-third of fish in this river are migratory species .
hazards of development a recent projection highlighted the risks if a proposed 11 dams are built on the mainstream of the mekong river – two of them in cambodia .
that would add to 77 dams that are already built or planned for tributaries of the mekong over the next two decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cambodian boy stretches to hoist his makeshift fishing net out of the mekong river dr eric baran is the senior research scientist at the phnom penh office of worldfish , an international research body .
he believes that the consequences of this construction in terms of fish production would be a loss , and this loss is due to the impact on the migratory fish .
" we calculated that the loss of fish by 2030 , if the 11 mainstream dams are built , would amount to between 600,000 tons and 900,000 tons every year .
we ’ re talking about a gigantic number that could have a huge impact on food security in the region , in particular in cambodia and laos . "
cambodia would lose over 200,000 tons of fish – more than half its annual catch .
millions of cambodians live on the cusp of poverty and rely on the bounty of the river to survive .
the mekong river commission – or mrc – is an intergovernmental body set up 15 years ago by cambodia , thailand , laos and vietnam to promote cooperation over the river .
china and myanmar are also involved in the mrc .
a recent report from the mrc recommended that any decisions on whether to build dams on the mainstream mekong be deferred for a decade , since building them would be irreversible , and their impact would be substantial .
it warned cambodia would likely suffer more than any other country from the proposed dams .
the next step is for the politicians to sit down and work out a way forward .
earlier this week cambodia ’ s agriculture and fisheries minister admitted that damming the mekong could interrupt fish migrations .

rights group amnesty international , which organized the demonstration , attempted to use the event to hand over a petition signed by some 100,000 people in support of liu .
however , the gates to the embassy remained locked and all windows were shuttered , leading to the protestors piling up the signed petitions outside the building perimeter .
" the chinese government should be celebrating this global recognition of a chinese writer and activist , " said ai secretary general salil shetty . " instead , the government 's very public tantrum has generated even more critical attention inside and outside china , and , ironically , emphasized the significance of liu xiaobo 's message of respect for human rights , " shetty said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang says most nations will boycott the ceremony amnesty and the nobel institute have meanwhile accused beijing of pressuring chinese nationals living in oslo to join counter-protests against liu .
the 54-year-old writer , human rights activist and critic of one-party rule in china was jailed in december 2009 for 11 years on subversion charges after co-authoring a petition calling for a multi-party system in china .
he was awarded the 2010 nobel peace prize for his long non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in the communist state .
however , the move greatly angered china , which saw it as an attempt to meddle in its internal affairs .
pressure on china ' can not succeed ' beijing has gone to great lengths in recent weeks to push for a boycott of the nobel ceremony in oslo , claiming that most of the world was opposed to the nobel committee 's decision to honor liu .
so far , some 20 states , including russia , cuba and venezuela , and most of which have strong commercial ties with beijing , have followed china in shunning the event .
" those people at the nobel committee have to admit they are in the minority .
the chinese people and the overwhelming majority of countries and people in the world oppose what they do , " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said .
" any attempt to exert pressure on china ... can not succeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu 's continued detention sparked protests around the world world behind nobel award but the head of the nobel committee , thorbjoern jagland , said thursday that some two-thirds of nations invited to the ceremony were expected to attend , and that the choice of liu as this year 's peace laureate was not a move " against " beijing .
" this is not a prize against china .
this is a prize honoring people in china , " jagland told a press conference traditionally held by the laureate on the day before the prize ceremony .
jagland insisted however it was important to push for political reforms and an opening of civil society to parallel china 's massive economic development .
" to a large extent the future of the world is in the hands of this big country , " he said .

he spoke of men and women " far more deserving of the prize " than him - and he meant people like liu xiaobo .
imprisoned in china , liu received this year 's nobel peace prize after more than two decades of an arduous , non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in china .
obama , on the other hand , received the award for a vision , a change in tone in international relations , and , many argue , in an attempt to settle accounts with his predecessor , george w. bush .
a dissatisfying record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's vision of a world free of nuclear weapons impressed not only the nobel committee while obama has kept his promise of withdrawing combat troops from iraq , he has n't followed through on many of the political projects he received the nobel peace prize for : a new strategic arms reduction treaty with russia , the closing of guantanamo bay detention camp , and a real step forward in meeting the world 's climate challenges .
but who 's to blame ?
did obama lose the moral compass he assigned so much importance to in his nobel speech ?
facing an adverse political climate " obama 's standpoints are better than his record , " marco fey from the peace research institute frankfurt told deutsche welle .
" on a variety of issues , he 's caught in the political climate in the us . "
fey cited the arms reduction treaty ' new start ' as a fitting example .
obama and russian president dmitry medvedev signed the treaty in april 2010 , but it has n't been ratified by the senate so far .
" obama , senior department of state officials , they all support the treaty , " fey said .
" it would be a real milestone in terms of arms control .
but republicans use the most absurd arguments to block it in the senate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the closure of guantanamo bay detention camp remains uncertain political capital is scarce obama 's decision to close down the detention camp at guantanamo bay has met fierce congressional opposition as well . but critics argue that obama has n't really invested his political capital in the measure compared to other projects he pushed through congress - such as health care reform .
the recent conviction of canadian citizen omar ahmed khadr who was brought to guantanamo 's military prison at the age of 16 , exemplifies obama 's lack of self-assertion in putting an end to the facility and its practice .
" who would have thought that , under obama , someone who 's accused of a crime committed at the age of 15 would be tried before a military commission at guantanamo ? "
reed brody from human rights watch told deutsche welle .
promoting human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is this year 's recipient of the nobel peace prize indeed , obama promised to be a persistent advocate of human rights at home and abroad . he has frequently underscored the significance of peaceful activists like liu xiaobo - the first chinese recipient of the award .
liu was an influential participant of the tiananmen protests in 1989 and is a leading author of charta 08 , a manifesto promoting fundamental human rights and democratization in china .
in december 2009 , after a series of earlier internments , he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for " inciting subversion of state power . "
obama and other heads of state have called on the chinese government to release liu .
however , critics argue that obama has failed to make human rights a guiding principle of us relations with other countries - highlighted and , some say , undermined by obama 's recent efforts to expand chinese-american cooperation .
" it 's not helpful when the government repeatedly describes human rights and democracy as issues on which the us and china will inevitably disagree , " brody said . a vision 's prospects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , al gore gave his nobel speech at oslo 's city hall whether attributed to obama 's political environment or his setting of priorities , the gap between obama 's vision and his actual achievements remains a fact .
yet , obama is sticking to his optimistic rhetoric and continues to set visionary goals , for example , regarding the middle east peace process .
" he 's set the goal of reaching a peace accord within a year , " said fey .
" that 's a very ambitious undertaking . "
as the clash of idealistic expectations and political pragmatism continues to haunt obama 's presidency , one is reminded of what al gore said during his nobel speech in 2007 : " we have everything we need to get started , save perhaps political will , but political will is a renewable resource . "
