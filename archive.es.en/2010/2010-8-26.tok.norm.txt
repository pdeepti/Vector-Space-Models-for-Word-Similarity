program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.08.2010 dw experts try their luck again with forecasts for bundesliga round 2 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a trip to the repair shop , the dw crystal ball returns this season , deutsche welle 's sports team are laying it on the line and predicting the results of all the bundesliga matches .
after a less than successful start , see what we predict for the second round . it 's round 2 of the 2010/11 bundesliga season and the dw experts are hoping to do a little better than last week when only one game was predicted correctly .
the crystal ball was obviously on the fritz -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- . the opening weekend of the season is always a lottery for forecasters because there is very little of the season 's form book to refer to so with a little more to go on , we hope to have more success with the next round of games . friday , august 27 kaiserslautern – bayern munich bayern looked boringly comfortable for long stretches against wolfsburg in their opening day win but finished the match with the margin a lot closer than it should have been .
kaiserslautern had a somewhat easier game against cologne and performed well , scoring three goals away from home .
bayern showed class and strength in front of their own supporters but these qualities will be tested on the road .
i can see the champions experiencing a slight , early blip in kaiserslautern . prediction : 2-2 saturday , august 28 schalke – hanover schalke blinked first in their match in hamburg last week and as a result lost to one of the teams which could rival them in the race for european places this season .
it 's early yet and the defeat wo n't end schalke 's challenge , but coach felix magath will be upset to have conceded points to one of the top teams already .
expect the royal blues to respond to magath 's wrath by soundly beating hanover in gelsenkirchen with raul marking his bundesliga home debut with at least one goal . prediction : schalke 3-1 bremen – cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen are back to winning ways .
bad news for cologne few would have expected bremen to be on the end of the kind of score line they normally inflict on the opposition .
losing 4-1 to hoffenheim was the worst possible start for thomas schaaf 's team .
luckily they had a confidence-restoring win in europe during the week to get their heads straight again and with qualification for the champions league group stages assured , werder can focus on climbing back up the bundesliga table .
they will begin their climb with victory over cologne who already look like relegation fodder after capitulating at home to kaiserslautern . prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg – mainz steve mcclaren 's wolves looked disjointed against bayern , but did manage 20 minutes of supreme offensive fotball - enough to give the champions a scare .
however , they looked far from cohesive at the back and even against mainz in their first home game of the season , wolfsburg may still not find the right gear .
mainz produced a good display to heap early woe on stuttgart , a team which finished strongly last season .
i think they 'll worry wolfsburg and grab a goal but the wolves will snatch a draw . prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg hit-man ruud hopes to be on target again reports that ruud van nistlerooy 's legs have gone appear to have been wildly exaggerated .
the dutch striker looked all the better for missing out on world cup action this summer , and as a result hamburg should get at least a good half-season out him before the inevitable wear and tear takes its toll .
frankfurt were unlucky to lose 2-1 to hanover last week and i can see them having a harder time against hsv , especially if ruud is still in the same mood as he was against schalke .
hamburg did n't travel well last season , dropping crucial points away from home , but still i think they 'll edge this one . prediction : hamburg 1-0 nuremberg – freiburg freiburg are going to struggle this season as their opening day defeat to st. pauli indicated . losing 3-1 at home to a newly-promoted side does not bode well for a team which has a long-standing relationship with the lower reaches of the bundesliga .
games like the one coming up against nuremberg need to be won if this is not to be a long fight against relegation for freiburg but i do n't see them getting the full quota of points this week .
the best freiburg can hope for is a draw - but i think they 'll get it . prediction : 1-1 st. pauli – hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will give st. pauli more problems than freiburg st. pauli will be flying after their victory over freiburg but they are in danger of crashing to earth against hoffenheim .
they may have their special supporters behind them on saturday but the gulf in class is likely to be too big for pauli .
one forgets that hoffenheim were once the village team made good , such is their standing in the top division now .
st. pauli might appear to be lambs to the slaughter in the wake of hoffenheim 's giving bremen a hiding , but i think the men from the rhine-neckar will have a harder job in hamburg .
that 's not to say they wo n't still win , though . prediction : hoffenheim 2-0 leverkusen - moenchengladbach bayer leverkusen have started in much the same way as they began last season - and by beating dortmund 2-0 away from home , michael ballack and co. have laid down a marker .
dortmund were tough to beat last year and can be expected to be difficult opponents this season , a fact that adds even more gloss to leverkusen 's win .

after a less than successful start , see what we predict for the second round . it 's round 2 of the 2010/11 bundesliga season and the dw experts are hoping to do a little better than last week when only one game was predicted correctly .
the crystal ball was obviously on the fritz -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- . the opening weekend of the season is always a lottery for forecasters because there is very little of the season 's form book to refer to so with a little more to go on , we hope to have more success with the next round of games . friday , august 27 kaiserslautern – bayern munich bayern looked boringly comfortable for long stretches against wolfsburg in their opening day win but finished the match with the margin a lot closer than it should have been .
kaiserslautern had a somewhat easier game against cologne and performed well , scoring three goals away from home .
bayern showed class and strength in front of their own supporters but these qualities will be tested on the road .
i can see the champions experiencing a slight , early blip in kaiserslautern . prediction : 2-2 saturday , august 28 schalke – hanover schalke blinked first in their match in hamburg last week and as a result lost to one of the teams which could rival them in the race for european places this season .
it 's early yet and the defeat wo n't end schalke 's challenge , but coach felix magath will be upset to have conceded points to one of the top teams already .
expect the royal blues to respond to magath 's wrath by soundly beating hanover in gelsenkirchen with raul marking his bundesliga home debut with at least one goal . prediction : schalke 3-1 bremen – cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen are back to winning ways .
bad news for cologne few would have expected bremen to be on the end of the kind of score line they normally inflict on the opposition .
losing 4-1 to hoffenheim was the worst possible start for thomas schaaf 's team .
luckily they had a confidence-restoring win in europe during the week to get their heads straight again and with qualification for the champions league group stages assured , werder can focus on climbing back up the bundesliga table .
they will begin their climb with victory over cologne who already look like relegation fodder after capitulating at home to kaiserslautern . prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg – mainz steve mcclaren 's wolves looked disjointed against bayern , but did manage 20 minutes of supreme offensive fotball - enough to give the champions a scare .
however , they looked far from cohesive at the back and even against mainz in their first home game of the season , wolfsburg may still not find the right gear .
mainz produced a good display to heap early woe on stuttgart , a team which finished strongly last season .
i think they 'll worry wolfsburg and grab a goal but the wolves will snatch a draw . prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg hit-man ruud hopes to be on target again reports that ruud van nistlerooy 's legs have gone appear to have been wildly exaggerated .
the dutch striker looked all the better for missing out on world cup action this summer , and as a result hamburg should get at least a good half-season out him before the inevitable wear and tear takes its toll .
frankfurt were unlucky to lose 2-1 to hanover last week and i can see them having a harder time against hsv , especially if ruud is still in the same mood as he was against schalke .
hamburg did n't travel well last season , dropping crucial points away from home , but still i think they 'll edge this one . prediction : hamburg 1-0 nuremberg – freiburg freiburg are going to struggle this season as their opening day defeat to st. pauli indicated . losing 3-1 at home to a newly-promoted side does not bode well for a team which has a long-standing relationship with the lower reaches of the bundesliga .
games like the one coming up against nuremberg need to be won if this is not to be a long fight against relegation for freiburg but i do n't see them getting the full quota of points this week .
the best freiburg can hope for is a draw - but i think they 'll get it . prediction : 1-1 st. pauli – hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will give st. pauli more problems than freiburg st. pauli will be flying after their victory over freiburg but they are in danger of crashing to earth against hoffenheim .
they may have their special supporters behind them on saturday but the gulf in class is likely to be too big for pauli .
one forgets that hoffenheim were once the village team made good , such is their standing in the top division now .
st. pauli might appear to be lambs to the slaughter in the wake of hoffenheim 's giving bremen a hiding , but i think the men from the rhine-neckar will have a harder job in hamburg .
that 's not to say they wo n't still win , though . prediction : hoffenheim 2-0 leverkusen - moenchengladbach bayer leverkusen have started in much the same way as they began last season - and by beating dortmund 2-0 away from home , michael ballack and co. have laid down a marker .
dortmund were tough to beat last year and can be expected to be difficult opponents this season , a fact that adds even more gloss to leverkusen 's win .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 26.08.2010 iceman likely laid to rest , study suggests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was oetzi given a burial ceremony ?
when the corpse of a 5,000-year-old human was uncovered nearly 20 years ago , archaeologists assumed the iceman 's death was anything but ceremonious .
researchers now think oetzi may have received a proper alpine burial . a study released on thursday suggests that oetzi , a human specimen found in the alps of south tyrol nearly two decades ago , was not " frozen in time and place " following his death five millennia ago .
a team of italian and american researchers now believe the iceman actually received a proper burial ceremony atop a mountain pass , months after his death .
oetzi was initially discovered in 1991 at the tisenjoch alpine pass along the border between austria and italy .
researchers theorized that the iceman died of a battle-related arrow wound to the shoulder .
it followed that oetzi 's personal belongings were frozen with him after his death in the upper reaches of the alps .
yet according to a new study published today in the journal antiquity , those conclusions were not based on detailed mapping of the grave site . a team of archaeologists , anthropologists and geo-specialists used spatial analysis to pinpoint the distribution of the man 's belongings and the corpse itself - leading them to propose that his body was ceremoniously placed on elevated rock , some five meters -lrb- about 16 feet -rrb- away from his eventual discovery site . " we concluded that he died in april , and in april the pass was probably full of snow , " said alessandro vanzetti , an archaeologist at the la sapienza university of rome and one of the study 's authors .
" he could n't have died on the spot , furthermore , he did n't die on this stone , as had been reported . "
botanical evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers have not reached consensus on the circumstances of oetzi 's death the team analyzed pollen ingested by oetzi before his death and compared it with pollen found in the ice surrounding him , noting a " mismatch " between his death in april - which the team suspected occurred at a lower altitude - and his possible burial in august or september .
researchers concluded that the iceman died in a different location , and that his body was recovered .
" we think he was kept in some kind of cellar , " vanzetti told deutsche welle .
citing regional historical knowledge , the study noted that in oetzi 's day , the dead were customarily placed in farmsteads called " masi " before the winter snow and ice melted .
" it was used by people in tyrol during the cold seasons , " he said .
" when one was dead , it was impossible to bury immediately , because the ground was frozen . "
" he was a very important person , so people decided to bury him on the pass , " vanzetti added .
luca bondioli , co-author of the paper and an anthropologist with at the national museum of prehistory and ethnology in italy , described oetzi as " an individual of the elite . "
" the fact that we have a new interpretation of the discovery is important , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the study noted that previous oetzi research was based on the initial interpretation of the iceman find and his belongings as " frozen in time and place . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say the iceman died from an arrow wound to the shoulder distribution data but the team 's findings suggested that the iceman 's personal effects were carefully placed near his body during a burial ceremony , not simply scattered around him as he lay dying .
" there is a strong indication that the distribution can be explained by gravity and movement in the ice , " vanzetti said .
the archaeologist and his colleagues proposed that oetzi and his grave goods were placed on an area of raised natural stone .
later on , according to the study , " cyclical thawing and freezing " caused the corpse and the burial items to shift .
the distribution was likely variable : lighter objects , such as hair and oetzi 's quiver , did not move in the same way as more weighty items , such as fur , leather and the body itself .
lingering questions yet not all researchers in the field are prepared to accept the burial theory .
albert zink , who was involved in efforts to map oetzi 's dna and serves as head of the institute for mummies and the iceman , said the team 's conclusion was " not very convincing . "
" there there are several things which i think are clearly in contrast to a burial , " he told deutsche welle , citing the unusual placement of the bow , which had been stood upright , as well as the random distribution of oetzi 's belongings .

when the corpse of a 5,000-year-old human was uncovered nearly 20 years ago , archaeologists assumed the iceman 's death was anything but ceremonious .
researchers now think oetzi may have received a proper alpine burial . a study released on thursday suggests that oetzi , a human specimen found in the alps of south tyrol nearly two decades ago , was not " frozen in time and place " following his death five millennia ago .
a team of italian and american researchers now believe the iceman actually received a proper burial ceremony atop a mountain pass , months after his death .
oetzi was initially discovered in 1991 at the tisenjoch alpine pass along the border between austria and italy .
researchers theorized that the iceman died of a battle-related arrow wound to the shoulder .
it followed that oetzi 's personal belongings were frozen with him after his death in the upper reaches of the alps .
yet according to a new study published today in the journal antiquity , those conclusions were not based on detailed mapping of the grave site . a team of archaeologists , anthropologists and geo-specialists used spatial analysis to pinpoint the distribution of the man 's belongings and the corpse itself - leading them to propose that his body was ceremoniously placed on elevated rock , some five meters -lrb- about 16 feet -rrb- away from his eventual discovery site . " we concluded that he died in april , and in april the pass was probably full of snow , " said alessandro vanzetti , an archaeologist at the la sapienza university of rome and one of the study 's authors .
" he could n't have died on the spot , furthermore , he did n't die on this stone , as had been reported . "
botanical evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers have not reached consensus on the circumstances of oetzi 's death the team analyzed pollen ingested by oetzi before his death and compared it with pollen found in the ice surrounding him , noting a " mismatch " between his death in april - which the team suspected occurred at a lower altitude - and his possible burial in august or september .
researchers concluded that the iceman died in a different location , and that his body was recovered .
" we think he was kept in some kind of cellar , " vanzetti told deutsche welle .
citing regional historical knowledge , the study noted that in oetzi 's day , the dead were customarily placed in farmsteads called " masi " before the winter snow and ice melted .
" it was used by people in tyrol during the cold seasons , " he said .
" when one was dead , it was impossible to bury immediately , because the ground was frozen . "
" he was a very important person , so people decided to bury him on the pass , " vanzetti added .
luca bondioli , co-author of the paper and an anthropologist with at the national museum of prehistory and ethnology in italy , described oetzi as " an individual of the elite . "
" the fact that we have a new interpretation of the discovery is important , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the study noted that previous oetzi research was based on the initial interpretation of the iceman find and his belongings as " frozen in time and place . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say the iceman died from an arrow wound to the shoulder distribution data but the team 's findings suggested that the iceman 's personal effects were carefully placed near his body during a burial ceremony , not simply scattered around him as he lay dying .
" there is a strong indication that the distribution can be explained by gravity and movement in the ice , " vanzetti said .
the archaeologist and his colleagues proposed that oetzi and his grave goods were placed on an area of raised natural stone .
later on , according to the study , " cyclical thawing and freezing " caused the corpse and the burial items to shift .
the distribution was likely variable : lighter objects , such as hair and oetzi 's quiver , did not move in the same way as more weighty items , such as fur , leather and the body itself .
lingering questions yet not all researchers in the field are prepared to accept the burial theory .
albert zink , who was involved in efforts to map oetzi 's dna and serves as head of the institute for mummies and the iceman , said the team 's conclusion was " not very convincing . "
" there there are several things which i think are clearly in contrast to a burial , " he told deutsche welle , citing the unusual placement of the bow , which had been stood upright , as well as the random distribution of oetzi 's belongings .
moreover , the iceman was found with his right arm in a vertical position that zink said would have been corrected before a burial . nevertheless , the new theory speaks to certain missing links in the iceman story - including why oetzi was found with unfinished weaponry .

when the corpse of a 5,000-year-old human was uncovered nearly 20 years ago , archaeologists assumed the iceman 's death was anything but ceremonious .
researchers now think oetzi may have received a proper alpine burial . a study released on thursday suggests that oetzi , a human specimen found in the alps of south tyrol nearly two decades ago , was not " frozen in time and place " following his death five millennia ago .
a team of italian and american researchers now believe the iceman actually received a proper burial ceremony atop a mountain pass , months after his death .
oetzi was initially discovered in 1991 at the tisenjoch alpine pass along the border between austria and italy .
researchers theorized that the iceman died of a battle-related arrow wound to the shoulder .
it followed that oetzi 's personal belongings were frozen with him after his death in the upper reaches of the alps .
yet according to a new study published today in the journal antiquity , those conclusions were not based on detailed mapping of the grave site . a team of archaeologists , anthropologists and geo-specialists used spatial analysis to pinpoint the distribution of the man 's belongings and the corpse itself - leading them to propose that his body was ceremoniously placed on elevated rock , some five meters -lrb- about 16 feet -rrb- away from his eventual discovery site . " we concluded that he died in april , and in april the pass was probably full of snow , " said alessandro vanzetti , an archaeologist at the la sapienza university of rome and one of the study 's authors .
" he could n't have died on the spot , furthermore , he did n't die on this stone , as had been reported . "
botanical evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers have not reached consensus on the circumstances of oetzi 's death the team analyzed pollen ingested by oetzi before his death and compared it with pollen found in the ice surrounding him , noting a " mismatch " between his death in april - which the team suspected occurred at a lower altitude - and his possible burial in august or september .
researchers concluded that the iceman died in a different location , and that his body was recovered .
" we think he was kept in some kind of cellar , " vanzetti told deutsche welle .
citing regional historical knowledge , the study noted that in oetzi 's day , the dead were customarily placed in farmsteads called " masi " before the winter snow and ice melted .
" it was used by people in tyrol during the cold seasons , " he said .
" when one was dead , it was impossible to bury immediately , because the ground was frozen . "
" he was a very important person , so people decided to bury him on the pass , " vanzetti added .
luca bondioli , co-author of the paper and an anthropologist with at the national museum of prehistory and ethnology in italy , described oetzi as " an individual of the elite . "
" the fact that we have a new interpretation of the discovery is important , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the study noted that previous oetzi research was based on the initial interpretation of the iceman find and his belongings as " frozen in time and place . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say the iceman died from an arrow wound to the shoulder distribution data but the team 's findings suggested that the iceman 's personal effects were carefully placed near his body during a burial ceremony , not simply scattered around him as he lay dying .
" there is a strong indication that the distribution can be explained by gravity and movement in the ice , " vanzetti said .
the archaeologist and his colleagues proposed that oetzi and his grave goods were placed on an area of raised natural stone .
later on , according to the study , " cyclical thawing and freezing " caused the corpse and the burial items to shift .
the distribution was likely variable : lighter objects , such as hair and oetzi 's quiver , did not move in the same way as more weighty items , such as fur , leather and the body itself .
lingering questions yet not all researchers in the field are prepared to accept the burial theory .
albert zink , who was involved in efforts to map oetzi 's dna and serves as head of the institute for mummies and the iceman , said the team 's conclusion was " not very convincing . "
" there there are several things which i think are clearly in contrast to a burial , " he told deutsche welle , citing the unusual placement of the bow , which had been stood upright , as well as the random distribution of oetzi 's belongings .
moreover , the iceman was found with his right arm in a vertical position that zink said would have been corrected before a burial . nevertheless , the new theory speaks to certain missing links in the iceman story - including why oetzi was found with unfinished weaponry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 26.08.2010 concerns raised over security of new german id cards großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new id cards include a chip containing encrypted data from november 2010 anyone needing a new id card in germany will be able to get a feature-rich enhanced card , which stores a host of data .
but experts are not impressed by the security features on the new id cards . the german government is introducing new id cards from november .
the new cards , the size of a standard credit card , will have additional functions alongside the standard personal information .
an embedded chip will contain a digital photo and encrypted personal data .
this new feature will allow card-holders to make online transactions with state authorities .
german interior minister thomas de maiziere is confident that the new cards will be more secure than older versions : " with these new id cards , we 'll have the highest-ever level of security for all legally binding online activities , " de maiziere said .
danger from hackers but experts have raised doubts about this assertion .
some are worried that the new cards are not secure enough , and that widespread identity misuse may be just around the corner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos computer club tested out the new cards it specialists from the chaos computer club , a german-based hackers ' organization , have scrutinized the new cards on behalf of german public broadcaster ard .
they found that the card readers being issued by the government to enable users to make online transactions were not as secure as they should be .
hackers from the " chaos computer club " claim that simple spying malware could put sensitive data slip into the wrong hands , because the card readers require external keyboards .
if hackers get past the computer 's firewall , they can see everything the user is typing , including , potentially , the pin-code for their id card .
once they have a pin-code , hackers could access all sorts of other personal information stored on the cards .
consumer protection activist michael bobrowski is concerned about such identity theft .
" id card owners stand to incur huge losses , " he said .
" and they 'd have to prove to the bank or other institutions that a given transaction was not initiated by them .
for ordinary pc users , this will hardly be feasible . "
the scheme is proving costly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere is confident about the security of the cards the opposition free democrats ' legal affairs spokesman , christian ahrendt , is also worried about identity theft .
he believes that the chips in the new id cards are a waste of taxpayers ' money .
" this was our main point of criticism when id cards equipped with chips were first debated and later decided on in the previous grand coalition government of christian and social democrats , " ahrendt said .
" there 's simply no need for the state to sponsor private institutions ' efforts to make on-line services more secure . "
interior minister de maiziere , of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats has not said whether the state would finance safer , more expensive card readers . the basic readers have already cost the government 24 million euros -lrb- $ 30.5 million -rrb- .

but experts are not impressed by the security features on the new id cards . the german government is introducing new id cards from november .
the new cards , the size of a standard credit card , will have additional functions alongside the standard personal information .
an embedded chip will contain a digital photo and encrypted personal data .
this new feature will allow card-holders to make online transactions with state authorities .
german interior minister thomas de maiziere is confident that the new cards will be more secure than older versions : " with these new id cards , we 'll have the highest-ever level of security for all legally binding online activities , " de maiziere said .
danger from hackers but experts have raised doubts about this assertion .
some are worried that the new cards are not secure enough , and that widespread identity misuse may be just around the corner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos computer club tested out the new cards it specialists from the chaos computer club , a german-based hackers ' organization , have scrutinized the new cards on behalf of german public broadcaster ard .
they found that the card readers being issued by the government to enable users to make online transactions were not as secure as they should be .
hackers from the " chaos computer club " claim that simple spying malware could put sensitive data slip into the wrong hands , because the card readers require external keyboards .

" this was our main point of criticism when id cards equipped with chips were first debated and later decided on in the previous grand coalition government of christian and social democrats , " ahrendt said .
" there 's simply no need for the state to sponsor private institutions ' efforts to make on-line services more secure . "

" there are a growing number of chinese who like european cars and have the money to afford them . "
opel tested the waters in china last year , selling around 4,000 cars , according to kroemer .
in the first half of 2010 , china passed the united states as gm 's biggest national market .
together with chevy and buick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has become the world 's largest market for new car sales kroemer declined to say which models opel plans to sell in china .
currently , gm markets its cadillac , chevrolet and buick brands in the country , in addition to vehicles manufactured by wuling , a chinese carmaker in which the us auto giant has a 30 percent stake .
until now , vehicles made by opel were only sold outside europe under gm 's buick nameplate .
in addition to china , opel will begin selling vehicles in australia and later in several other markets in the asia-pacific and south american regions , according to kroemer .
" this is great news for opel and i believe the company has good opportunities in the country , " said christoph stuermer , an auto analyst with ihs global insight in frankfurt .
export first , assemble locally later stuermer expects opel will initially export cars to china until it establishes a market position in the country .
but eventually , he said , the company will need to assemble cars locally to avoid import taxes , which can increase the price of vehicles by as much as 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm adds opel to its line of brands in china opel will compete with germany 's other big carmakers , bmw , daimler and volkswagen , which have been operating in china for some time .
china has become the world 's biggest auto market based on the number of new vehicles sold .
automakers around the world are looking to the country to drive revenue amid weak global demand .
but growth has dropped since last year when the government boosted demand with tax cuts and subsidies .
in recent months , chinese auto sales have declined steadily , falling from 19.4 percent in june to 17.2 percent in july , according to the china automotive technology and research center .

on thursday several demonstrators climbed onto a roof , temporarily stopping the demolition . police in stuttgart say that work to raze part of the city 's old aboveground train station was stopped for several hours on thursday when seven people occupied part of the building 's roof .
the protestors were then removed and arrested by special police forces .
other demonstrators blocked train platforms , causing a high-speed tgv train to paris to be delayed by about an hour .
construction workers began the demolition of the north wing of the stuttgart train station under police protection on wednesday , as thousands continued to demonstrate against the renovation project .
activists claimed 12,000 people had participated in the protests , while police put the number at 6,000 .
up to 50,000 demonstrators are anticipated on friday .
growing tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tension between protestors and police is growing demonstrations against the project have been going on for weeks , and their growing boldness has raised tensions .
the police president in stuttgart , siegfried stumpf , said wednesday 's protests had " lost their peaceful character . "
" this has moved way beyond understandable protests and civil disobedience , " he said , saying firefighters and rescue workers had been harassed and that groups blockading streets had thrown bottles .
a spokesman for the park protectors group , which opposes the project , denied any violence and said that " the politicians , through the police , are trying to criminalize us . "
the " stuttgart 21 " construction project is to link the city with one of europe 's longest high-speed rail lines by converting it from a terminus , which forces trains to pull in and out , to an underground through-station that trains can pass through .
supporters say the project will cut down travel times , create jobs and attract investors , but opponents say its estimated cost of seven billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- is too high .
environmentalists say the current plan is not necessary and that its effect on rail traffic would be limited .

in may , bayern munich came closer than any other german club since 2002 to winning the title . bayern - losing finalists against inter milan in may - are among the top seeds and were drawn thursday against as roma , fc basel and cfr cluj in group e of this season 's champions league competition .
the german champions qualified automatically after securing the bundesliga title and therefore avoided the likes of italian giants inter and ac milan , english premiership big-boys manchester united , chelsea and arsenal , spanish champions barcelona and perennial qualifiers lyon from france 's ligue 1 .
clubs from the same country can not not be drawn against each other in the group stage and for tv purposes are kept on opposite sides of the draw as far as possible , so bayern have also avoided playing one of their bundesliga rivals - at least for now .
bayern look to hit the ground running bayern have been slowly building a head of steam in this competition over the past few seasons and since louis van gaal took charge they 've been picking up speed .
from being a team seemingly predestined to get knocked out in the quarterfinals , bayern have quietly developed into a club ready to challenge for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are hoping for happier end to the 2011 competition however , they faltered badly in the early stages of the competition last season , almost crashing out at the group stage with only a heroic performance against juventus preventing them from slipping into the europa league .
but with every passing round , the bavarian giants had an unbeatable air about them .
they marched through against teams like manchester united and lyon with a strange certainty that they would reach the final and had many convinced that they could win it .
unfortunately , it was not to be .
this season , a strong showing against another italian team will be needed .
as roma ran inter milan close to the serie a title last season and will prove obstinate opposition for bayern , especially at the stadio olimpico .
the german champions should have the measure of the italians at home but bayern 's visit to rome could prove tricky .
there should n't be any problem for the germans against fc basel so qualification should be assured , regardless of which way the results go against roma and cluj . if bayern can avoid the pitfalls which almost cost them the chance of making the knockout phase last time and find their european groove earlier this season , then they 'll be a strong bet to repeat their run to the previous final and who knows - perhaps even win it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have yet to fulfill their champions league potential bremen hope to recapture barnstorming form werder bremen , recently qualified at the expense of sampdoria , return to the champions league after a couple of seasons away from europe ’ s premier club competition .
the impressive and dramatic performances by thomas schaaf 's side against their italian opposition in the qualifying round certainly suggests that bremen will be an entertaining addition to the group stages , but how will they fare against teams like reigning champions inter milan , dutch champions fc twente and tottenham hotspurs ?
bremen have never really worried the latter stages of the champions league despite consistently reaching the knockout rounds during their strong , mid-noughties period of bundesliga ascendance .
however , they ’ ve been off the boil for the latter part of the decade and have not managed to regain the consistency which saw them continually challenging for the bundesliga title and qualifying for the champions league .
it remains to be seen how inter milan play under new coach rafa benitez , but however the former liverpool coach chooses to line the european champions up , it 's still effectively the same team that won the trophy last season .
bremen will be in for a fight both at home and away .
they may fancy their chances against new boys tottenham hotspurs but the english premiership side looked far from over-awed in qualifying , so werder will have to draw on their experience to snuff out spurs ' enthusiasm over two games .
fc twente shocked the eredivisie last season under current wolfsburg coach steve mcclaren , so who 's to say they wo n't spring a surprise in the champions league ?
they 're unlikely to win it but they could cause bremen problems .
at best , werder could get through in second but it looks a tough group for the north germans .
schalke faces tough group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope magath and raul can plot a successful course schalke , the third team in the bundesliga trio , have a tricky group consisting of lyon , benfica and happoel tel aviv .
but while schalke teams in the past have been finding their way through european competition with little knowledgeable guidance , they have a hard-headed coach with experience of the business end of the european cup in felix magath .
a winner and runner-up with hamburg as a player , magath coached bayern in three champions league campaigns , reaching the quarterfinals in 2004/05 and the first knockout round the following year .
he also took bayern to the knockout round in the 2006/07 competition but was fired for poor bundesliga form before their quarterfinal defeat to ac milan .
magath also has the most prolific goal scorer in champions league history on his books in the form of raul .
the former real madrid talisman and captain has three champions league winner ’ s medals to his name as well as an unprecedented 66 strikes in the competition .
as a result schalke will be going into this season ’ s champions league with an experienced leader off the pitch and an experienced one on it .
lyon have been here so many times before that they treat the champions league as if it was an extension of their domestic competition .
but , as bayern found out last season , this sometimes works against them .
lyon may not be equipped to deal with both this season , and schalke will hope to get a victory against them either home or away .
benfica could be the wild card in the group .
the portuguese are renowned for swift counterattacking play and their style may be a little cavalier for the germans .
these games could be very hard for schalke .
but the germans should get the points they need to at least challenge for the second qualifying spot against hapoel tel aviv .

in may , bayern munich came closer than any other german club since 2002 to winning the title . bayern - losing finalists against inter milan in may - are among the top seeds and were drawn thursday against as roma , fc basel and cfr cluj in group e of this season 's champions league competition .
the german champions qualified automatically after securing the bundesliga title and therefore avoided the likes of italian giants inter and ac milan , english premiership big-boys manchester united , chelsea and arsenal , spanish champions barcelona and perennial qualifiers lyon from france 's ligue 1 .
clubs from the same country can not not be drawn against each other in the group stage and for tv purposes are kept on opposite sides of the draw as far as possible , so bayern have also avoided playing one of their bundesliga rivals - at least for now .
bayern look to hit the ground running bayern have been slowly building a head of steam in this competition over the past few seasons and since louis van gaal took charge they 've been picking up speed .
from being a team seemingly predestined to get knocked out in the quarterfinals , bayern have quietly developed into a club ready to challenge for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are hoping for happier end to the 2011 competition however , they faltered badly in the early stages of the competition last season , almost crashing out at the group stage with only a heroic performance against juventus preventing them from slipping into the europa league .
but with every passing round , the bavarian giants had an unbeatable air about them .
they marched through against teams like manchester united and lyon with a strange certainty that they would reach the final and had many convinced that they could win it .
unfortunately , it was not to be .
this season , a strong showing against another italian team will be needed .
as roma ran inter milan close to the serie a title last season and will prove obstinate opposition for bayern , especially at the stadio olimpico .
the german champions should have the measure of the italians at home but bayern 's visit to rome could prove tricky .
there should n't be any problem for the germans against fc basel so qualification should be assured , regardless of which way the results go against roma and cluj . if bayern can avoid the pitfalls which almost cost them the chance of making the knockout phase last time and find their european groove earlier this season , then they 'll be a strong bet to repeat their run to the previous final and who knows - perhaps even win it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have yet to fulfill their champions league potential bremen hope to recapture barnstorming form werder bremen , recently qualified at the expense of sampdoria , return to the champions league after a couple of seasons away from europe ’ s premier club competition .
the impressive and dramatic performances by thomas schaaf 's side against their italian opposition in the qualifying round certainly suggests that bremen will be an entertaining addition to the group stages , but how will they fare against teams like reigning champions inter milan , dutch champions fc twente and tottenham hotspurs ?
bremen have never really worried the latter stages of the champions league despite consistently reaching the knockout rounds during their strong , mid-noughties period of bundesliga ascendance .
however , they ’ ve been off the boil for the latter part of the decade and have not managed to regain the consistency which saw them continually challenging for the bundesliga title and qualifying for the champions league .
it remains to be seen how inter milan play under new coach rafa benitez , but however the former liverpool coach chooses to line the european champions up , it 's still effectively the same team that won the trophy last season .
bremen will be in for a fight both at home and away .
they may fancy their chances against new boys tottenham hotspurs but the english premiership side looked far from over-awed in qualifying , so werder will have to draw on their experience to snuff out spurs ' enthusiasm over two games .
fc twente shocked the eredivisie last season under current wolfsburg coach steve mcclaren , so who 's to say they wo n't spring a surprise in the champions league ?
they 're unlikely to win it but they could cause bremen problems .
at best , werder could get through in second but it looks a tough group for the north germans .
schalke faces tough group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope magath and raul can plot a successful course schalke , the third team in the bundesliga trio , have a tricky group consisting of lyon , benfica and happoel tel aviv .
but while schalke teams in the past have been finding their way through european competition with little knowledgeable guidance , they have a hard-headed coach with experience of the business end of the european cup in felix magath .
a winner and runner-up with hamburg as a player , magath coached bayern in three champions league campaigns , reaching the quarterfinals in 2004/05 and the first knockout round the following year .
he also took bayern to the knockout round in the 2006/07 competition but was fired for poor bundesliga form before their quarterfinal defeat to ac milan .
magath also has the most prolific goal scorer in champions league history on his books in the form of raul .
the former real madrid talisman and captain has three champions league winner ’ s medals to his name as well as an unprecedented 66 strikes in the competition .
as a result schalke will be going into this season ’ s champions league with an experienced leader off the pitch and an experienced one on it .
lyon have been here so many times before that they treat the champions league as if it was an extension of their domestic competition .
but , as bayern found out last season , this sometimes works against them .
lyon may not be equipped to deal with both this season , and schalke will hope to get a victory against them either home or away .
benfica could be the wild card in the group .
the portuguese are renowned for swift counterattacking play and their style may be a little cavalier for the germans .
these games could be very hard for schalke .
but the germans should get the points they need to at least challenge for the second qualifying spot against hapoel tel aviv .

the rise is largely due to germany 's strong economic performance . germany 's surprisingly good economic performance has made consumers more optimistic about the economy and their personal income , according to a report released on thursday .
the nuremburg-based market research institute gfk bases its monthly forward-looking consumer sentiment index on a survey of about 2,000 german households .
the overall index for september was 4.1 points - the highest in 14 months .
that figure is up from a revised august index of 4 points .
" the extremely good news on the economic development and continued positive reports on the labour market have led to robust consumer sentiment in august , " the gfk report said .
" there are currently good indications that consumer sentiment in germany is experiencing a sustained upward trend . "
the increase was largely due to germany 's higher-than-expected growth in gross domestic product during the second quarter , the gfk said .
the 2.2-percent jump in output was the largest quarterly increase since german reunification in 1990 .
germany 's central bank expects an overall growth of three percent by the end of 2010 .

the 28-year-old benaissa is a member of the popular girl band no angels . she discovered she was hiv positive in 1999 when she was three months pregnant .
she was arrested in april 2009 for having unprotected sex with three men in 2004 and 2006 and failing to inform them of her hiv status .
to do so can be classified as aggravated assault under german law .
both the state prosecutor peter liesenfeld and her defense had asked the courts for the suspended sentence in the trial , which ended on wednesday .
liesenfeld cited her confession and her expression of remorse as reasons for lighter sentence .
" i made a huge mistake , " benaissa said in an emotional apology during the closing arguments .
" i am sorry from the bottom of my heart , " she said . " i would love to turn back the clock , but i ca n't . "

because she and the man both have a strain of the virus that is relatively rare in germany , medical experts had determined the man had almost certainly been infected by benaissa .
she was also convicted of attempted aggravated assault for having unprotected sex with another man who did not contract the virus .
she said she was afraid that her career would be negatively impacted if it became public that she is hiv positive .

instead of jail time , the pop star is expected to complete 300 hours of community service and attend regular counseling sessions .
no angels , which first formed in 2000 and got back together in 2007 after a brief break , are expected to restart their tour .
that tour was interrupted last year when benaissa was arrested just before performing in frankfurt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 26.08.2010 german pop star gets suspended sentence in hiv case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadja benaissa expressed remorse for her actions the high-profile case of german pop singer nadja benaissa , who was charged with aggravated assault for having unprotected sex while she knew she was hiv positive , has ended in a two-year suspended sentence . a german court has given pop singer nadja benaissa a two-year suspended sentence for having unprotected sex while failing to tell her sexual partners she was hiv positive .
the 28-year-old benaissa is a member of the popular girl band no angels . she discovered she was hiv positive in 1999 when she was three months pregnant .
she was arrested in april 2009 for having unprotected sex with three men in 2004 and 2006 and failing to inform them of her hiv status .
to do so can be classified as aggravated assault under german law .
both the state prosecutor peter liesenfeld and her defense had asked the courts for the suspended sentence in the trial , which ended on wednesday .
liesenfeld cited her confession and her expression of remorse as reasons for lighter sentence .
" i made a huge mistake , " benaissa said in an emotional apology during the closing arguments .
" i am sorry from the bottom of my heart , " she said . " i would love to turn back the clock , but i ca n't . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after discovering her hiv status , benaissa -lrb- right -rrb- found success with the girl band no angels almost certainly infected the man but the 34-year-old man she infected with hiv gave an angry testimony during the trial , saying she had caused " a lot of suffering in this world . "
because she and the man both have a strain of the virus that is relatively rare in germany , medical experts had determined the man had almost certainly been infected by benaissa .
she was also convicted of attempted aggravated assault for having unprotected sex with another man who did not contract the virus .
she said she was afraid that her career would be negatively impacted if it became public that she is hiv positive .
a return to the stage ?
instead of jail time , the pop star is expected to complete 300 hours of community service and attend regular counseling sessions .
no angels , which first formed in 2000 and got back together in 2007 after a brief break , are expected to restart their tour .
that tour was interrupted last year when benaissa was arrested just before performing in frankfurt .

this week , journalists flocked around " the hoff " when , at a berlin press conference , he announced he would be giving major concerts in germany beginning in february 2011 .
his daughters , taylor ann and hayley amber , aka pop duo " bella vida , " are to accompany him on tour .
hasselhoff had already laid the groundwork for his musical comeback when he appeared on " musikantenstadl " - a popular german-swiss-austrian folk music production - this past spring .
this month , he 's traveling around germany promoting the upcoming tour .
discovering during a radio interview in july with german broadcaster swr1 that his german roots are not near kassel in the heart of the country , as he had thought , but in bremen further north , he endeared audiences in germany by claiming the news was " the best present " he 'd ever received .
the broadcaster had commissioned a german researcher to look into the american celebrity 's ancestry .
according to news agency afp , the singer had orginally intended to buy property in hasselhof , a town similarly written to the star 's last name and located near kassel .
making a splash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasselhoff -lrb- center back -rrb- was the hunk in the popular " baywatch " tv show during the berlin press conference on wednesday , however , " knight rider " and " baywatch " hunk hasselhoff revealed some of his darker side when he spoke openly about elements in his recent autobiography , " making waves . "
he said dealing with his alcoholism was a " daily struggle , " and was frank when he admitted that writing the autobiography was " like therapy . "
hasselhoff had reaped scorn when he appeared on mtv 's european music awards in berlin last year and slurred the words of his laudation .
an internet video also showed him trying to munch a hamburger while more than a little under the influence , news magazine stern noted .
the 58-year-old made a splash over 20 years ago in germany , recording an english-language cover version of the 1970 's german hit " auf der strasse nach sueden , " calling it " looking for freedom . "
it scaled the german charts quickly , just as a new tide of revolution began rolling through eastern europe , culminating in the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 .
hasselhoff helped east and west germans celebrate together on new year 's eve that year for the first time in decades when he sang his " looking for freedom " hit at the brandenburg gate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 26.08.2010 no angels hiv trial shows difficulty of proving guilt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benaissa was diagnosed with hiv when she was pregnant the trial of the former singer of the girl group no angels demonstrates how hard it is to prove if someone definitely infected another person with hiv .
but the law cracks down on those who risk infecting others . having unprotected sex with a partner who is not aware of his or her partner 's hiv infection , is a criminal offense in germany , but , medically , it is hard to trace the source of an infection .
a ruling in 1988 , which forced those infected with hiv to declare their condition to sexual partners , is the current legal basis for the trial of the former singer of the girl group no angels , nadja benaissa .
" at the moment , the law states that anyone who is infected must insist on using protection or inform his or her partner of the infection , " felix damm , a lawyer specializing in media and copyright law , told deutsche welle .
" if he or she does not do that , they 're committing a crime , " he says .
aggravated assault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infecting someone with hiv during unprotected sex is a crime in germany the offense is classed as grievous bodily harm , or aggravated assault , because " an hiv infection is incurable and , when it leads to aids , is also lethal , " said damm .
it carries a sentence of six months to 10 years .
it is been more than two decades since the first person was convicted based on the 1988 ruling , some of them because they deliberately infected sexual partners , others were convicted because they were simply careless .
in june 2007 , for example , a 38-year-old man from the western city of cologne was sentenced to eight years in prison for deliberately passing on the hi virus to four women .
he even sent them text messages saying " have fun with hiv " .
the latest case was that of a decorator in the northern city of kiel in june 2010 , who was sentenced to five years in jail for infecting two women with hiv during unprotected sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is often hard to determine the source of the infection medical tests tricky it is not always easy , however , to prove who passed on the virus to a person .
" you can do certain tests to find out if two viruses from two individual people are closely related , " claudia kuecherer from the robert-koch institute told deutsche welle .
" but there 's no absolute proof that would hold up in court .
these so-called phylogenetic tests ca n't ascertain the direction of the infection , " she explained .
proof is even harder to obtain , the more time passes from the time of the infection .
the virus mutates very quickly after the point of infection , making it harder to ascertain if it is related to the virus of the person who passed it on .
as a result , medical tests are not the only evidence used to reach a verdict .
taking responsibility over two decades have passed since the 1988 ruling and some believe it is time for a review of the law used in cases like that of benaissa , based on the fact that , these days , people are much more aware of hiv and should therefore , be in a position to act responsibly .
" i think everyone should be responsible and take precautions , whether they have hiv or not " damm told deutsche welle .
" and if we apply that principle of responsibility to our criminal law , then people who have hiv would not necessarily have to declare their infection and would therefore no longer commit an offense , " he said .

but the law cracks down on those who risk infecting others . having unprotected sex with a partner who is not aware of his or her partner 's hiv infection , is a criminal offense in germany , but , medically , it is hard to trace the source of an infection .
a ruling in 1988 , which forced those infected with hiv to declare their condition to sexual partners , is the current legal basis for the trial of the former singer of the girl group no angels , nadja benaissa .
" at the moment , the law states that anyone who is infected must insist on using protection or inform his or her partner of the infection , " felix damm , a lawyer specializing in media and copyright law , told deutsche welle .
" if he or she does not do that , they 're committing a crime , " he says .
aggravated assault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infecting someone with hiv during unprotected sex is a crime in germany the offense is classed as grievous bodily harm , or aggravated assault , because " an hiv infection is incurable and , when it leads to aids , is also lethal , " said damm .
it carries a sentence of six months to 10 years .
it is been more than two decades since the first person was convicted based on the 1988 ruling , some of them because they deliberately infected sexual partners , others were convicted because they were simply careless .
in june 2007 , for example , a 38-year-old man from the western city of cologne was sentenced to eight years in prison for deliberately passing on the hi virus to four women .
he even sent them text messages saying " have fun with hiv " .
the latest case was that of a decorator in the northern city of kiel in june 2010 , who was sentenced to five years in jail for infecting two women with hiv during unprotected sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is often hard to determine the source of the infection medical tests tricky it is not always easy , however , to prove who passed on the virus to a person .
" you can do certain tests to find out if two viruses from two individual people are closely related , " claudia kuecherer from the robert-koch institute told deutsche welle .
" but there 's no absolute proof that would hold up in court .
these so-called phylogenetic tests ca n't ascertain the direction of the infection , " she explained .
proof is even harder to obtain , the more time passes from the time of the infection .
the virus mutates very quickly after the point of infection , making it harder to ascertain if it is related to the virus of the person who passed it on .
as a result , medical tests are not the only evidence used to reach a verdict .
taking responsibility over two decades have passed since the 1988 ruling and some believe it is time for a review of the law used in cases like that of benaissa , based on the fact that , these days , people are much more aware of hiv and should therefore , be in a position to act responsibly .
" i think everyone should be responsible and take precautions , whether they have hiv or not " damm told deutsche welle .
" and if we apply that principle of responsibility to our criminal law , then people who have hiv would not necessarily have to declare their infection and would therefore no longer commit an offense , " he said .

he said serbia , however , would have to " come to terms " with the loss of kosovo as a province . german foreign minister guido westerwelle urged serbia on thursday to drop its challenges to kosovo 's independence and instead focus its energy on joining the european union .
" in our view , one can only be a member of the european union if one aims for cooperation and is prepared to resolve neighborly difficulties cooperatively , " he told reporters in belgrade .
westerwelle used his first visit to serbia to meet with prime minister mirko cvetkovic , president boris tadic and opposition leaders . he expressed his disagreement with a recent resolution against the secession of kosovo presented by the country to the united nations general assembly .
" the independence of kosovo is a reality , " westerwelle said in a speech at the university of belgrade .
" reconciliation is only possible when one grasps the reality . "
germany has joined 68 other countries in recognizing kosovo 's independence , but serbia adamantly opposes it .
in july , the international court of justice found kosovo 's secession was in line with international law . serbia rejected the ruling and instead is pressing the un to restart talks on the state 's status .
a european resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence has been a highly controversial subject westerwelle said the eu would be willing to broker direct talks between serbia and kosovo to resolve the dispute and questioned serbia 's choice to take the issue to the un instead .
" when someone in europe wants to solve something including conflicts -lsb- … -rsb- the road should first lead to brussels , not to new york , " he said .
on to bosnia , kosovo later thursday , westerwelle is to visit the bosnian capital , sarajevo , where proposed political reforms have long been stalled . parliamentary and presidential elections are scheduled for october .
western powers hope the results will shift the politics away from ethnic divisions and toward a more unified country .
but with two rival autonomous regions , the mainly muslim and croat federation of bosnia and herzegovina and serb-majority republika srpska , bosnia and herzegovina is the most politically unstable of the former yugoslav republics .
westerwelle began his tour in croatia on wednesday , where he provided an optimistic outlook for the country 's prospects of joining the eu .
he continues to kosovo on friday , where he is to visit the 1,400-strong german contingent of kfor , nato 's peacekeeping force in kosovo .

he said serbia , however , would have to " come to terms " with the loss of kosovo as a province . german foreign minister guido westerwelle urged serbia on thursday to drop its challenges to kosovo 's independence and instead focus its energy on joining the european union .
" in our view , one can only be a member of the european union if one aims for cooperation and is prepared to resolve neighborly difficulties cooperatively , " he told reporters in belgrade .
westerwelle used his first visit to serbia to meet with prime minister mirko cvetkovic , president boris tadic and opposition leaders . he expressed his disagreement with a recent resolution against the secession of kosovo presented by the country to the united nations general assembly .

western powers hope the results will shift the politics away from ethnic divisions and toward a more unified country .

westerwelle began his tour in croatia on wednesday , where he provided an optimistic outlook for the country 's prospects of joining the eu .
he continues to kosovo on friday , where he is to visit the 1,400-strong german contingent of kfor , nato 's peacekeeping force in kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.08.2010 dw experts try their luck again with forecasts for bundesliga round 2 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a trip to the repair shop , the dw crystal ball returns this season , deutsche welle 's sports team are laying it on the line and predicting the results of all the bundesliga matches .
after a less than successful start , see what we predict for the second round . it 's round 2 of the 2010/11 bundesliga season and the dw experts are hoping to do a little better than last week when only one game was predicted correctly .
the crystal ball was obviously on the fritz -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- . the opening weekend of the season is always a lottery for forecasters because there is very little of the season 's form book to refer to so with a little more to go on , we hope to have more success with the next round of games . friday , august 27 kaiserslautern – bayern munich bayern looked boringly comfortable for long stretches against wolfsburg in their opening day win but finished the match with the margin a lot closer than it should have been .
kaiserslautern had a somewhat easier game against cologne and performed well , scoring three goals away from home .
bayern showed class and strength in front of their own supporters but these qualities will be tested on the road .
i can see the champions experiencing a slight , early blip in kaiserslautern . prediction : 2-2 saturday , august 28 schalke – hanover schalke blinked first in their match in hamburg last week and as a result lost to one of the teams which could rival them in the race for european places this season .
it 's early yet and the defeat wo n't end schalke 's challenge , but coach felix magath will be upset to have conceded points to one of the top teams already .
expect the royal blues to respond to magath 's wrath by soundly beating hanover in gelsenkirchen with raul marking his bundesliga home debut with at least one goal . prediction : schalke 3-1 bremen – cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen are back to winning ways .
bad news for cologne few would have expected bremen to be on the end of the kind of score line they normally inflict on the opposition .
losing 4-1 to hoffenheim was the worst possible start for thomas schaaf 's team .
luckily they had a confidence-restoring win in europe during the week to get their heads straight again and with qualification for the champions league group stages assured , werder can focus on climbing back up the bundesliga table .
they will begin their climb with victory over cologne who already look like relegation fodder after capitulating at home to kaiserslautern . prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg – mainz steve mcclaren 's wolves looked disjointed against bayern , but did manage 20 minutes of supreme offensive fotball - enough to give the champions a scare .
however , they looked far from cohesive at the back and even against mainz in their first home game of the season , wolfsburg may still not find the right gear .
mainz produced a good display to heap early woe on stuttgart , a team which finished strongly last season .
i think they 'll worry wolfsburg and grab a goal but the wolves will snatch a draw . prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg hit-man ruud hopes to be on target again reports that ruud van nistlerooy 's legs have gone appear to have been wildly exaggerated .
the dutch striker looked all the better for missing out on world cup action this summer , and as a result hamburg should get at least a good half-season out him before the inevitable wear and tear takes its toll .
frankfurt were unlucky to lose 2-1 to hanover last week and i can see them having a harder time against hsv , especially if ruud is still in the same mood as he was against schalke .
hamburg did n't travel well last season , dropping crucial points away from home , but still i think they 'll edge this one . prediction : hamburg 1-0 nuremberg – freiburg freiburg are going to struggle this season as their opening day defeat to st. pauli indicated . losing 3-1 at home to a newly-promoted side does not bode well for a team which has a long-standing relationship with the lower reaches of the bundesliga .
games like the one coming up against nuremberg need to be won if this is not to be a long fight against relegation for freiburg but i do n't see them getting the full quota of points this week .
the best freiburg can hope for is a draw - but i think they 'll get it . prediction : 1-1 st. pauli – hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will give st. pauli more problems than freiburg st. pauli will be flying after their victory over freiburg but they are in danger of crashing to earth against hoffenheim .
they may have their special supporters behind them on saturday but the gulf in class is likely to be too big for pauli .
one forgets that hoffenheim were once the village team made good , such is their standing in the top division now .
st. pauli might appear to be lambs to the slaughter in the wake of hoffenheim 's giving bremen a hiding , but i think the men from the rhine-neckar will have a harder job in hamburg .
that 's not to say they wo n't still win , though . prediction : hoffenheim 2-0 leverkusen - moenchengladbach bayer leverkusen have started in much the same way as they began last season - and by beating dortmund 2-0 away from home , michael ballack and co. have laid down a marker .
dortmund were tough to beat last year and can be expected to be difficult opponents this season , a fact that adds even more gloss to leverkusen 's win .
ballack 's boys will be too much for gladbach who just scraped a draw with nuremberg last week . prediction : leverkusen 3-1 sunday , august 29 stuttgart – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart boss christian gross hopes for something to clap both teams expected more from their opening games in which both were defeated , and both will be eager to put those false starts behind them .
however , stuttgart and dortmund both saw europa league action on thursday and could be running on fumes as they seek full fitness in the early season . whatever happens , these two sides will give whatever they 've got .
i see dortmund edging stuttgart through sheer power . prediction : dortmund 2-1 last week 's result : 5 points bayern – wolfsburg 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:1 , one point -rrb- hoffenheim – bremen 4:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:2 , one point -rrb- moenchengladbach – nuremberg 1:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , no points -rrb- cologne – kaiserslautern 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- freiburg – st. pauli 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- hanover – frankfurt 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , no points -rrb- hamburg – schalke 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , three points -rrb- mainz – stuttgart 2:0 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , no points -rrb- dortmund – leverkusen 0:2 -lrb- dw prediction 2:2 , no points -rrb- three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crystal ball was obviously on the fritz -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- . the opening weekend of the season is always a lottery for forecasters because there is very little of the season 's form book to refer to so with a little more to go on , we hope to have more success with the next round of games . friday , august 27 kaiserslautern – bayern munich bayern looked boringly comfortable for long stretches against wolfsburg in their opening day win but finished the match with the margin a lot closer than it should have been .
kaiserslautern had a somewhat easier game against cologne and performed well , scoring three goals away from home .
bayern showed class and strength in front of their own supporters but these qualities will be tested on the road .
i can see the champions experiencing a slight , early blip in kaiserslautern . prediction : 2-2 saturday , august 28 schalke – hanover schalke blinked first in their match in hamburg last week and as a result lost to one of the teams which could rival them in the race for european places this season .
it 's early yet and the defeat wo n't end schalke 's challenge , but coach felix magath will be upset to have conceded points to one of the top teams already .

bad news for cologne few would have expected bremen to be on the end of the kind of score line they normally inflict on the opposition .
losing 4-1 to hoffenheim was the worst possible start for thomas schaaf 's team .
luckily they had a confidence-restoring win in europe during the week to get their heads straight again and with qualification for the champions league group stages assured , werder can focus on climbing back up the bundesliga table .
they will begin their climb with victory over cologne who already look like relegation fodder after capitulating at home to kaiserslautern . prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg – mainz steve mcclaren 's wolves looked disjointed against bayern , but did manage 20 minutes of supreme offensive fotball - enough to give the champions a scare .
however , they looked far from cohesive at the back and even against mainz in their first home game of the season , wolfsburg may still not find the right gear .
mainz produced a good display to heap early woe on stuttgart , a team which finished strongly last season .
i think they 'll worry wolfsburg and grab a goal but the wolves will snatch a draw . prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg hit-man ruud hopes to be on target again reports that ruud van nistlerooy 's legs have gone appear to have been wildly exaggerated .
the dutch striker looked all the better for missing out on world cup action this summer , and as a result hamburg should get at least a good half-season out him before the inevitable wear and tear takes its toll .
frankfurt were unlucky to lose 2-1 to hanover last week and i can see them having a harder time against hsv , especially if ruud is still in the same mood as he was against schalke .
hamburg did n't travel well last season , dropping crucial points away from home , but still i think they 'll edge this one . prediction : hamburg 1-0 nuremberg – freiburg freiburg are going to struggle this season as their opening day defeat to st. pauli indicated . losing 3-1 at home to a newly-promoted side does not bode well for a team which has a long-standing relationship with the lower reaches of the bundesliga .
games like the one coming up against nuremberg need to be won if this is not to be a long fight against relegation for freiburg but i do n't see them getting the full quota of points this week .
the best freiburg can hope for is a draw - but i think they 'll get it . prediction : 1-1 st. pauli – hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will give st. pauli more problems than freiburg st. pauli will be flying after their victory over freiburg but they are in danger of crashing to earth against hoffenheim .
they may have their special supporters behind them on saturday but the gulf in class is likely to be too big for pauli .
one forgets that hoffenheim were once the village team made good , such is their standing in the top division now .
st. pauli might appear to be lambs to the slaughter in the wake of hoffenheim 's giving bremen a hiding , but i think the men from the rhine-neckar will have a harder job in hamburg .
that 's not to say they wo n't still win , though . prediction : hoffenheim 2-0 leverkusen - moenchengladbach bayer leverkusen have started in much the same way as they began last season - and by beating dortmund 2-0 away from home , michael ballack and co. have laid down a marker .
dortmund were tough to beat last year and can be expected to be difficult opponents this season , a fact that adds even more gloss to leverkusen 's win .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 26.08.2010 prolonging nuclear power may stymie investment into renewables großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants were turned off for most of 2009 a new report has outlined why ending the use of nuclear energy matters for the development of renewable energy infrastructure .
its sponsors say the nuclear power fight is post-war germany 's largest-ever economic dispute . in the midst of an ongoing debate over whether to extend the lifespan of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , a new report has revealed that the continued availability of nuclear power would likely cause a decrease in investment into renewable energies .
increases in wind and solar energy capacities will eventually lead to nuclear power plants being used less , the report states .
the reason : energy from renewable sources enjoys legal priority over nuclear and coal power .
it is fed into the grid before electricity from non-renewable sources .
as the capacity of electricity from wind or solar sources increases , conventional electricity sources will only be needed to fill in gaps when there is a lack of wind or sun .
but it takes about 50 hours to restart a nuclear power plant that has been completely shut down , meaning it would be necessary to keep the plant running at 50 or 60 percent capacity .
gas powered turbines , however , can be turned on within 20 minutes and can also be run on biogas .
other possibilities to bridge fluctuations in renewable electricity output include the decentralized approach of using micro-power stations or accessing the batteries of electric cars .
companies likely to fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conventional power might only be needed when the wind is n't blowing germany 's four largest energy companies - e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw - will do everything in their power to avoid losing billions on their investments into nuclear power , the report assumes .
supposing the lifespans of the power plant are increased by 28 years , energy companies will have to come to terms with turning them off some 15,800 times between 2020 and the date when the last plant is shut down .
that would cost them between 21 and 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 26.7 billion to $ 101.7 billion -rrb- , unless they successfully lobby to overturn the priority that electricity from renewable sources enjoys and pushed for the construction of those sources to be capped .
gero lucking , of the renewable energy company lichtblick , which sponsored the study , described the dilemma as the " largest post-war economic dispute " in germany .
olav hohmeyer , professor of economics and energy and environmental management at the university of flensburg , authored the study .
according to hohmeyer , electricity needs can entirely be met through renewable energy sources by 2050 .
nuclear power plant lifespans will not need to be extended , nor will there be an electricity deficit to be covered by new coal-fired power plants .
" nuclear power plants are not flexible enough to safely react to changing weather conditions and compensate for fluctuations in wind and sunshine , " hohmeyer said .
hohmeyer 's report states the last nuclear power plant can be removed from the grid in 2023 and the last coal-fired power plant in 2046 .
extending the lifespans of nuclear power plants by 40 years in germany - as has been proposed by the government - would damage vital investment interests and set back the switch to renewable energy by decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased renewable energy could curb the need for nuclear energy monopoly-like structures florian noto of the german nature conservancy represents a group of 21 environmental organizations banded together against nuclear energy .
he said an already-permitted nuclear power plant can generate inexpensive electricity for energy companies , when nuclear waste , risk-based costs and insurance are not taken into account .
" a newly-constructed eco-power plant ca n't necessarily keep up , " he told deutsche welle .
" if the old nuclear power plants just keep running , then progress wo n't be made and little will be invested -lsb- … -rsb- it would actually lead to an investment bottleneck . "
noto also pointed out that four of the 17 nuclear power plants in germany were out of commission for more than 10 months during 2009 , and that at times as many as eight of them were out of commission .
a more diverse and decentralized energy market could lead to lower electricity prices for consumers , according to noto .
" the fact is these companies are actually too dominant , and an economic counterweight needs to be created .
if more new energy companies join this market - if the market is expanded - then that will lead to these monopolistic structures going away , " he said .
electricity from renewable sources will become less expensive in comparison to conventionally generated electricity as prices of raw materials rise , the report states .
by 2050 its additional monthly price compared to conventionally generated electricity could be between just three and 17 euros for an average household using 3,000 kilowatt hours .

its sponsors say the nuclear power fight is post-war germany 's largest-ever economic dispute . in the midst of an ongoing debate over whether to extend the lifespan of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , a new report has revealed that the continued availability of nuclear power would likely cause a decrease in investment into renewable energies .
increases in wind and solar energy capacities will eventually lead to nuclear power plants being used less , the report states .
the reason : energy from renewable sources enjoys legal priority over nuclear and coal power .
it is fed into the grid before electricity from non-renewable sources .
as the capacity of electricity from wind or solar sources increases , conventional electricity sources will only be needed to fill in gaps when there is a lack of wind or sun .
but it takes about 50 hours to restart a nuclear power plant that has been completely shut down , meaning it would be necessary to keep the plant running at 50 or 60 percent capacity .
gas powered turbines , however , can be turned on within 20 minutes and can also be run on biogas .
other possibilities to bridge fluctuations in renewable electricity output include the decentralized approach of using micro-power stations or accessing the batteries of electric cars .
companies likely to fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conventional power might only be needed when the wind is n't blowing germany 's four largest energy companies - e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw - will do everything in their power to avoid losing billions on their investments into nuclear power , the report assumes .
supposing the lifespans of the power plant are increased by 28 years , energy companies will have to come to terms with turning them off some 15,800 times between 2020 and the date when the last plant is shut down .
that would cost them between 21 and 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 26.7 billion to $ 101.7 billion -rrb- , unless they successfully lobby to overturn the priority that electricity from renewable sources enjoys and pushed for the construction of those sources to be capped .
gero lucking , of the renewable energy company lichtblick , which sponsored the study , described the dilemma as the " largest post-war economic dispute " in germany .
olav hohmeyer , professor of economics and energy and environmental management at the university of flensburg , authored the study .
according to hohmeyer , electricity needs can entirely be met through renewable energy sources by 2050 .
nuclear power plant lifespans will not need to be extended , nor will there be an electricity deficit to be covered by new coal-fired power plants .
" nuclear power plants are not flexible enough to safely react to changing weather conditions and compensate for fluctuations in wind and sunshine , " hohmeyer said .
hohmeyer 's report states the last nuclear power plant can be removed from the grid in 2023 and the last coal-fired power plant in 2046 .
extending the lifespans of nuclear power plants by 40 years in germany - as has been proposed by the government - would damage vital investment interests and set back the switch to renewable energy by decades .

he said an already-permitted nuclear power plant can generate inexpensive electricity for energy companies , when nuclear waste , risk-based costs and insurance are not taken into account .
" a newly-constructed eco-power plant ca n't necessarily keep up , " he told deutsche welle .
" if the old nuclear power plants just keep running , then progress wo n't be made and little will be invested -lsb- … -rsb- it would actually lead to an investment bottleneck . "
noto also pointed out that four of the 17 nuclear power plants in germany were out of commission for more than 10 months during 2009 , and that at times as many as eight of them were out of commission .
a more diverse and decentralized energy market could lead to lower electricity prices for consumers , according to noto .
" the fact is these companies are actually too dominant , and an economic counterweight needs to be created .
if more new energy companies join this market - if the market is expanded - then that will lead to these monopolistic structures going away , " he said .
electricity from renewable sources will become less expensive in comparison to conventionally generated electricity as prices of raw materials rise , the report states .
by 2050 its additional monthly price compared to conventionally generated electricity could be between just three and 17 euros for an average household using 3,000 kilowatt hours .

its sponsors say the nuclear power fight is post-war germany 's largest-ever economic dispute . in the midst of an ongoing debate over whether to extend the lifespan of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , a new report has revealed that the continued availability of nuclear power would likely cause a decrease in investment into renewable energies .
increases in wind and solar energy capacities will eventually lead to nuclear power plants being used less , the report states .
the reason : energy from renewable sources enjoys legal priority over nuclear and coal power .
it is fed into the grid before electricity from non-renewable sources .
as the capacity of electricity from wind or solar sources increases , conventional electricity sources will only be needed to fill in gaps when there is a lack of wind or sun .
but it takes about 50 hours to restart a nuclear power plant that has been completely shut down , meaning it would be necessary to keep the plant running at 50 or 60 percent capacity .
gas powered turbines , however , can be turned on within 20 minutes and can also be run on biogas .
other possibilities to bridge fluctuations in renewable electricity output include the decentralized approach of using micro-power stations or accessing the batteries of electric cars .
companies likely to fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conventional power might only be needed when the wind is n't blowing germany 's four largest energy companies - e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw - will do everything in their power to avoid losing billions on their investments into nuclear power , the report assumes .
supposing the lifespans of the power plant are increased by 28 years , energy companies will have to come to terms with turning them off some 15,800 times between 2020 and the date when the last plant is shut down .
that would cost them between 21 and 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 26.7 billion to $ 101.7 billion -rrb- , unless they successfully lobby to overturn the priority that electricity from renewable sources enjoys and pushed for the construction of those sources to be capped .
gero lucking , of the renewable energy company lichtblick , which sponsored the study , described the dilemma as the " largest post-war economic dispute " in germany .
olav hohmeyer , professor of economics and energy and environmental management at the university of flensburg , authored the study .
according to hohmeyer , electricity needs can entirely be met through renewable energy sources by 2050 .
nuclear power plant lifespans will not need to be extended , nor will there be an electricity deficit to be covered by new coal-fired power plants .
" nuclear power plants are not flexible enough to safely react to changing weather conditions and compensate for fluctuations in wind and sunshine , " hohmeyer said .
hohmeyer 's report states the last nuclear power plant can be removed from the grid in 2023 and the last coal-fired power plant in 2046 .
extending the lifespans of nuclear power plants by 40 years in germany - as has been proposed by the government - would damage vital investment interests and set back the switch to renewable energy by decades .

" if the old nuclear power plants just keep running , then progress wo n't be made and little will be invested -lsb- … -rsb- it would actually lead to an investment bottleneck . "
noto also pointed out that four of the 17 nuclear power plants in germany were out of commission for more than 10 months during 2009 , and that at times as many as eight of them were out of commission .
a more diverse and decentralized energy market could lead to lower electricity prices for consumers , according to noto .
" the fact is these companies are actually too dominant , and an economic counterweight needs to be created .
if more new energy companies join this market - if the market is expanded - then that will lead to these monopolistic structures going away , " he said .
electricity from renewable sources will become less expensive in comparison to conventionally generated electricity as prices of raw materials rise , the report states .
by 2050 its additional monthly price compared to conventionally generated electricity could be between just three and 17 euros for an average household using 3,000 kilowatt hours .

but experts are not impressed by the security features on the new id cards . the german government is introducing new id cards from november .
the new cards , the size of a standard credit card , will have additional functions alongside the standard personal information .
an embedded chip will contain a digital photo and encrypted personal data .
this new feature will allow card-holders to make online transactions with state authorities .
german interior minister thomas de maiziere is confident that the new cards will be more secure than older versions : " with these new id cards , we 'll have the highest-ever level of security for all legally binding online activities , " de maiziere said .
danger from hackers but experts have raised doubts about this assertion .
some are worried that the new cards are not secure enough , and that widespread identity misuse may be just around the corner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos computer club tested out the new cards it specialists from the chaos computer club , a german-based hackers ' organization , have scrutinized the new cards on behalf of german public broadcaster ard .
they found that the card readers being issued by the government to enable users to make online transactions were not as secure as they should be .
hackers from the " chaos computer club " claim that simple spying malware could put sensitive data slip into the wrong hands , because the card readers require external keyboards .
if hackers get past the computer 's firewall , they can see everything the user is typing , including , potentially , the pin-code for their id card .
once they have a pin-code , hackers could access all sorts of other personal information stored on the cards .
consumer protection activist michael bobrowski is concerned about such identity theft .
" id card owners stand to incur huge losses , " he said .
" and they 'd have to prove to the bank or other institutions that a given transaction was not initiated by them .
for ordinary pc users , this will hardly be feasible . "
the scheme is proving costly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere is confident about the security of the cards the opposition free democrats ' legal affairs spokesman , christian ahrendt , is also worried about identity theft .
he believes that the chips in the new id cards are a waste of taxpayers ' money .
" this was our main point of criticism when id cards equipped with chips were first debated and later decided on in the previous grand coalition government of christian and social democrats , " ahrendt said .
" there 's simply no need for the state to sponsor private institutions ' efforts to make on-line services more secure . "
interior minister de maiziere , of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats has not said whether the state would finance safer , more expensive card readers . the basic readers have already cost the government 24 million euros -lrb- $ 30.5 million -rrb- .

on thursday several demonstrators climbed onto a roof , temporarily stopping the demolition . police in stuttgart say that work to raze part of the city 's old aboveground train station was stopped for several hours on thursday when seven people occupied part of the building 's roof .
the protestors were then removed and arrested by special police forces .
other demonstrators blocked train platforms , causing a high-speed tgv train to paris to be delayed by about an hour .
construction workers began the demolition of the north wing of the stuttgart train station under police protection on wednesday , as thousands continued to demonstrate against the renovation project .
activists claimed 12,000 people had participated in the protests , while police put the number at 6,000 .
up to 50,000 demonstrators are anticipated on friday .
growing tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tension between protestors and police is growing demonstrations against the project have been going on for weeks , and their growing boldness has raised tensions .
the police president in stuttgart , siegfried stumpf , said wednesday 's protests had " lost their peaceful character . "
" this has moved way beyond understandable protests and civil disobedience , " he said , saying firefighters and rescue workers had been harassed and that groups blockading streets had thrown bottles .
a spokesman for the park protectors group , which opposes the project , denied any violence and said that " the politicians , through the police , are trying to criminalize us . "
the " stuttgart 21 " construction project is to link the city with one of europe 's longest high-speed rail lines by converting it from a terminus , which forces trains to pull in and out , to an underground through-station that trains can pass through .
supporters say the project will cut down travel times , create jobs and attract investors , but opponents say its estimated cost of seven billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- is too high .
environmentalists say the current plan is not necessary and that its effect on rail traffic would be limited .

the rise is largely due to germany 's strong economic performance . germany 's surprisingly good economic performance has made consumers more optimistic about the economy and their personal income , according to a report released on thursday .
the nuremburg-based market research institute gfk bases its monthly forward-looking consumer sentiment index on a survey of about 2,000 german households .
the overall index for september was 4.1 points - the highest in 14 months .
that figure is up from a revised august index of 4 points .
" the extremely good news on the economic development and continued positive reports on the labour market have led to robust consumer sentiment in august , " the gfk report said .
" there are currently good indications that consumer sentiment in germany is experiencing a sustained upward trend . "
the increase was largely due to germany 's higher-than-expected growth in gross domestic product during the second quarter , the gfk said .
the 2.2-percent jump in output was the largest quarterly increase since german reunification in 1990 .
germany 's central bank expects an overall growth of three percent by the end of 2010 .

he said serbia , however , would have to " come to terms " with the loss of kosovo as a province . german foreign minister guido westerwelle urged serbia on thursday to drop its challenges to kosovo 's independence and instead focus its energy on joining the european union .
" in our view , one can only be a member of the european union if one aims for cooperation and is prepared to resolve neighborly difficulties cooperatively , " he told reporters in belgrade .
westerwelle used his first visit to serbia to meet with prime minister mirko cvetkovic , president boris tadic and opposition leaders . he expressed his disagreement with a recent resolution against the secession of kosovo presented by the country to the united nations general assembly .
" the independence of kosovo is a reality , " westerwelle said in a speech at the university of belgrade .
" reconciliation is only possible when one grasps the reality . "
germany has joined 68 other countries in recognizing kosovo 's independence , but serbia adamantly opposes it .
in july , the international court of justice found kosovo 's secession was in line with international law . serbia rejected the ruling and instead is pressing the un to restart talks on the state 's status .
a european resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence has been a highly controversial subject westerwelle said the eu would be willing to broker direct talks between serbia and kosovo to resolve the dispute and questioned serbia 's choice to take the issue to the un instead .
" when someone in europe wants to solve something including conflicts -lsb- … -rsb- the road should first lead to brussels , not to new york , " he said .
on to bosnia , kosovo later thursday , westerwelle is to visit the bosnian capital , sarajevo , where proposed political reforms have long been stalled . parliamentary and presidential elections are scheduled for october .
western powers hope the results will shift the politics away from ethnic divisions and toward a more unified country .
but with two rival autonomous regions , the mainly muslim and croat federation of bosnia and herzegovina and serb-majority republika srpska , bosnia and herzegovina is the most politically unstable of the former yugoslav republics .
westerwelle began his tour in croatia on wednesday , where he provided an optimistic outlook for the country 's prospects of joining the eu .
he continues to kosovo on friday , where he is to visit the 1,400-strong german contingent of kfor , nato 's peacekeeping force in kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.08.2010 dw experts try their luck again with forecasts for bundesliga round 2 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a trip to the repair shop , the dw crystal ball returns this season , deutsche welle 's sports team are laying it on the line and predicting the results of all the bundesliga matches .
after a less than successful start , see what we predict for the second round . it 's round 2 of the 2010/11 bundesliga season and the dw experts are hoping to do a little better than last week when only one game was predicted correctly .
the crystal ball was obviously on the fritz -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- . the opening weekend of the season is always a lottery for forecasters because there is very little of the season 's form book to refer to so with a little more to go on , we hope to have more success with the next round of games . friday , august 27 kaiserslautern – bayern munich bayern looked boringly comfortable for long stretches against wolfsburg in their opening day win but finished the match with the margin a lot closer than it should have been .
kaiserslautern had a somewhat easier game against cologne and performed well , scoring three goals away from home .
bayern showed class and strength in front of their own supporters but these qualities will be tested on the road .
i can see the champions experiencing a slight , early blip in kaiserslautern . prediction : 2-2 saturday , august 28 schalke – hanover schalke blinked first in their match in hamburg last week and as a result lost to one of the teams which could rival them in the race for european places this season .
it 's early yet and the defeat wo n't end schalke 's challenge , but coach felix magath will be upset to have conceded points to one of the top teams already .
expect the royal blues to respond to magath 's wrath by soundly beating hanover in gelsenkirchen with raul marking his bundesliga home debut with at least one goal . prediction : schalke 3-1 bremen – cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen are back to winning ways .
bad news for cologne few would have expected bremen to be on the end of the kind of score line they normally inflict on the opposition .
losing 4-1 to hoffenheim was the worst possible start for thomas schaaf 's team .
luckily they had a confidence-restoring win in europe during the week to get their heads straight again and with qualification for the champions league group stages assured , werder can focus on climbing back up the bundesliga table .
they will begin their climb with victory over cologne who already look like relegation fodder after capitulating at home to kaiserslautern . prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg – mainz steve mcclaren 's wolves looked disjointed against bayern , but did manage 20 minutes of supreme offensive fotball - enough to give the champions a scare .
however , they looked far from cohesive at the back and even against mainz in their first home game of the season , wolfsburg may still not find the right gear .
mainz produced a good display to heap early woe on stuttgart , a team which finished strongly last season .
i think they 'll worry wolfsburg and grab a goal but the wolves will snatch a draw . prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg hit-man ruud hopes to be on target again reports that ruud van nistlerooy 's legs have gone appear to have been wildly exaggerated .
the dutch striker looked all the better for missing out on world cup action this summer , and as a result hamburg should get at least a good half-season out him before the inevitable wear and tear takes its toll .
frankfurt were unlucky to lose 2-1 to hanover last week and i can see them having a harder time against hsv , especially if ruud is still in the same mood as he was against schalke .
hamburg did n't travel well last season , dropping crucial points away from home , but still i think they 'll edge this one . prediction : hamburg 1-0 nuremberg – freiburg freiburg are going to struggle this season as their opening day defeat to st. pauli indicated . losing 3-1 at home to a newly-promoted side does not bode well for a team which has a long-standing relationship with the lower reaches of the bundesliga .
games like the one coming up against nuremberg need to be won if this is not to be a long fight against relegation for freiburg but i do n't see them getting the full quota of points this week .
the best freiburg can hope for is a draw - but i think they 'll get it . prediction : 1-1 st. pauli – hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will give st. pauli more problems than freiburg st. pauli will be flying after their victory over freiburg but they are in danger of crashing to earth against hoffenheim .
they may have their special supporters behind them on saturday but the gulf in class is likely to be too big for pauli .
one forgets that hoffenheim were once the village team made good , such is their standing in the top division now .
st. pauli might appear to be lambs to the slaughter in the wake of hoffenheim 's giving bremen a hiding , but i think the men from the rhine-neckar will have a harder job in hamburg .
that 's not to say they wo n't still win , though . prediction : hoffenheim 2-0 leverkusen - moenchengladbach bayer leverkusen have started in much the same way as they began last season - and by beating dortmund 2-0 away from home , michael ballack and co. have laid down a marker .
dortmund were tough to beat last year and can be expected to be difficult opponents this season , a fact that adds even more gloss to leverkusen 's win .
ballack 's boys will be too much for gladbach who just scraped a draw with nuremberg last week . prediction : leverkusen 3-1 sunday , august 29 stuttgart – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart boss christian gross hopes for something to clap both teams expected more from their opening games in which both were defeated , and both will be eager to put those false starts behind them .
however , stuttgart and dortmund both saw europa league action on thursday and could be running on fumes as they seek full fitness in the early season . whatever happens , these two sides will give whatever they 've got .
i see dortmund edging stuttgart through sheer power . prediction : dortmund 2-1 last week 's result : 5 points bayern – wolfsburg 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:1 , one point -rrb- hoffenheim – bremen 4:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:2 , one point -rrb- moenchengladbach – nuremberg 1:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , no points -rrb- cologne – kaiserslautern 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- freiburg – st. pauli 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- hanover – frankfurt 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , no points -rrb- hamburg – schalke 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , three points -rrb- mainz – stuttgart 2:0 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , no points -rrb- dortmund – leverkusen 0:2 -lrb- dw prediction 2:2 , no points -rrb- three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a less than successful start , see what we predict for the second round . it 's round 2 of the 2010/11 bundesliga season and the dw experts are hoping to do a little better than last week when only one game was predicted correctly .
the crystal ball was obviously on the fritz -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- . the opening weekend of the season is always a lottery for forecasters because there is very little of the season 's form book to refer to so with a little more to go on , we hope to have more success with the next round of games . friday , august 27 kaiserslautern – bayern munich bayern looked boringly comfortable for long stretches against wolfsburg in their opening day win but finished the match with the margin a lot closer than it should have been .
kaiserslautern had a somewhat easier game against cologne and performed well , scoring three goals away from home .
bayern showed class and strength in front of their own supporters but these qualities will be tested on the road .
i can see the champions experiencing a slight , early blip in kaiserslautern . prediction : 2-2 saturday , august 28 schalke – hanover schalke blinked first in their match in hamburg last week and as a result lost to one of the teams which could rival them in the race for european places this season .
it 's early yet and the defeat wo n't end schalke 's challenge , but coach felix magath will be upset to have conceded points to one of the top teams already .
expect the royal blues to respond to magath 's wrath by soundly beating hanover in gelsenkirchen with raul marking his bundesliga home debut with at least one goal . prediction : schalke 3-1 bremen – cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen are back to winning ways .
bad news for cologne few would have expected bremen to be on the end of the kind of score line they normally inflict on the opposition .
losing 4-1 to hoffenheim was the worst possible start for thomas schaaf 's team .
luckily they had a confidence-restoring win in europe during the week to get their heads straight again and with qualification for the champions league group stages assured , werder can focus on climbing back up the bundesliga table .
they will begin their climb with victory over cologne who already look like relegation fodder after capitulating at home to kaiserslautern . prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg – mainz steve mcclaren 's wolves looked disjointed against bayern , but did manage 20 minutes of supreme offensive fotball - enough to give the champions a scare .
however , they looked far from cohesive at the back and even against mainz in their first home game of the season , wolfsburg may still not find the right gear .
mainz produced a good display to heap early woe on stuttgart , a team which finished strongly last season .
i think they 'll worry wolfsburg and grab a goal but the wolves will snatch a draw . prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg hit-man ruud hopes to be on target again reports that ruud van nistlerooy 's legs have gone appear to have been wildly exaggerated .
the dutch striker looked all the better for missing out on world cup action this summer , and as a result hamburg should get at least a good half-season out him before the inevitable wear and tear takes its toll .
frankfurt were unlucky to lose 2-1 to hanover last week and i can see them having a harder time against hsv , especially if ruud is still in the same mood as he was against schalke .
hamburg did n't travel well last season , dropping crucial points away from home , but still i think they 'll edge this one . prediction : hamburg 1-0 nuremberg – freiburg freiburg are going to struggle this season as their opening day defeat to st. pauli indicated . losing 3-1 at home to a newly-promoted side does not bode well for a team which has a long-standing relationship with the lower reaches of the bundesliga .
games like the one coming up against nuremberg need to be won if this is not to be a long fight against relegation for freiburg but i do n't see them getting the full quota of points this week .
the best freiburg can hope for is a draw - but i think they 'll get it . prediction : 1-1 st. pauli – hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will give st. pauli more problems than freiburg st. pauli will be flying after their victory over freiburg but they are in danger of crashing to earth against hoffenheim .
they may have their special supporters behind them on saturday but the gulf in class is likely to be too big for pauli .
one forgets that hoffenheim were once the village team made good , such is their standing in the top division now .
st. pauli might appear to be lambs to the slaughter in the wake of hoffenheim 's giving bremen a hiding , but i think the men from the rhine-neckar will have a harder job in hamburg .
that 's not to say they wo n't still win , though . prediction : hoffenheim 2-0 leverkusen - moenchengladbach bayer leverkusen have started in much the same way as they began last season - and by beating dortmund 2-0 away from home , michael ballack and co. have laid down a marker .
dortmund were tough to beat last year and can be expected to be difficult opponents this season , a fact that adds even more gloss to leverkusen 's win .
ballack 's boys will be too much for gladbach who just scraped a draw with nuremberg last week . prediction : leverkusen 3-1 sunday , august 29 stuttgart – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart boss christian gross hopes for something to clap both teams expected more from their opening games in which both were defeated , and both will be eager to put those false starts behind them .
however , stuttgart and dortmund both saw europa league action on thursday and could be running on fumes as they seek full fitness in the early season . whatever happens , these two sides will give whatever they 've got .
i see dortmund edging stuttgart through sheer power . prediction : dortmund 2-1 last week 's result : 5 points bayern – wolfsburg 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:1 , one point -rrb- hoffenheim – bremen 4:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:2 , one point -rrb- moenchengladbach – nuremberg 1:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , no points -rrb- cologne – kaiserslautern 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- freiburg – st. pauli 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- hanover – frankfurt 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , no points -rrb- hamburg – schalke 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , three points -rrb- mainz – stuttgart 2:0 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , no points -rrb- dortmund – leverkusen 0:2 -lrb- dw prediction 2:2 , no points -rrb- three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a less than successful start , see what we predict for the second round . it 's round 2 of the 2010/11 bundesliga season and the dw experts are hoping to do a little better than last week when only one game was predicted correctly .
the crystal ball was obviously on the fritz -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- . the opening weekend of the season is always a lottery for forecasters because there is very little of the season 's form book to refer to so with a little more to go on , we hope to have more success with the next round of games . friday , august 27 kaiserslautern – bayern munich bayern looked boringly comfortable for long stretches against wolfsburg in their opening day win but finished the match with the margin a lot closer than it should have been .
kaiserslautern had a somewhat easier game against cologne and performed well , scoring three goals away from home .
bayern showed class and strength in front of their own supporters but these qualities will be tested on the road .
i can see the champions experiencing a slight , early blip in kaiserslautern . prediction : 2-2 saturday , august 28 schalke – hanover schalke blinked first in their match in hamburg last week and as a result lost to one of the teams which could rival them in the race for european places this season .
it 's early yet and the defeat wo n't end schalke 's challenge , but coach felix magath will be upset to have conceded points to one of the top teams already .
expect the royal blues to respond to magath 's wrath by soundly beating hanover in gelsenkirchen with raul marking his bundesliga home debut with at least one goal . prediction : schalke 3-1 bremen – cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen are back to winning ways .
bad news for cologne few would have expected bremen to be on the end of the kind of score line they normally inflict on the opposition .
losing 4-1 to hoffenheim was the worst possible start for thomas schaaf 's team .
luckily they had a confidence-restoring win in europe during the week to get their heads straight again and with qualification for the champions league group stages assured , werder can focus on climbing back up the bundesliga table .
they will begin their climb with victory over cologne who already look like relegation fodder after capitulating at home to kaiserslautern . prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg – mainz steve mcclaren 's wolves looked disjointed against bayern , but did manage 20 minutes of supreme offensive fotball - enough to give the champions a scare .
however , they looked far from cohesive at the back and even against mainz in their first home game of the season , wolfsburg may still not find the right gear .
mainz produced a good display to heap early woe on stuttgart , a team which finished strongly last season .
i think they 'll worry wolfsburg and grab a goal but the wolves will snatch a draw . prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg hit-man ruud hopes to be on target again reports that ruud van nistlerooy 's legs have gone appear to have been wildly exaggerated .
the dutch striker looked all the better for missing out on world cup action this summer , and as a result hamburg should get at least a good half-season out him before the inevitable wear and tear takes its toll .
frankfurt were unlucky to lose 2-1 to hanover last week and i can see them having a harder time against hsv , especially if ruud is still in the same mood as he was against schalke .
hamburg did n't travel well last season , dropping crucial points away from home , but still i think they 'll edge this one . prediction : hamburg 1-0 nuremberg – freiburg freiburg are going to struggle this season as their opening day defeat to st. pauli indicated . losing 3-1 at home to a newly-promoted side does not bode well for a team which has a long-standing relationship with the lower reaches of the bundesliga .
games like the one coming up against nuremberg need to be won if this is not to be a long fight against relegation for freiburg but i do n't see them getting the full quota of points this week .
the best freiburg can hope for is a draw - but i think they 'll get it . prediction : 1-1 st. pauli – hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will give st. pauli more problems than freiburg st. pauli will be flying after their victory over freiburg but they are in danger of crashing to earth against hoffenheim .
they may have their special supporters behind them on saturday but the gulf in class is likely to be too big for pauli .
one forgets that hoffenheim were once the village team made good , such is their standing in the top division now .
st. pauli might appear to be lambs to the slaughter in the wake of hoffenheim 's giving bremen a hiding , but i think the men from the rhine-neckar will have a harder job in hamburg .
that 's not to say they wo n't still win , though . prediction : hoffenheim 2-0 leverkusen - moenchengladbach bayer leverkusen have started in much the same way as they began last season - and by beating dortmund 2-0 away from home , michael ballack and co. have laid down a marker .
dortmund were tough to beat last year and can be expected to be difficult opponents this season , a fact that adds even more gloss to leverkusen 's win .
ballack 's boys will be too much for gladbach who just scraped a draw with nuremberg last week . prediction : leverkusen 3-1 sunday , august 29 stuttgart – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart boss christian gross hopes for something to clap both teams expected more from their opening games in which both were defeated , and both will be eager to put those false starts behind them .
however , stuttgart and dortmund both saw europa league action on thursday and could be running on fumes as they seek full fitness in the early season . whatever happens , these two sides will give whatever they 've got .

now , new research indicates that nature might be lending a hand : according to a study published in the journal science on tuesday , microbes are consuming and breaking down the huge underwater plume of crude in the gulf of mexico . a team led by terry hazen of the lawrence berkeley national laboratory , monitored the oil plume starting in may – and that meant tracking the microbes eating it .
the study involved work at 17 deepwater sites to gather more than 200 samples .
scientists found that microbes were consuming the oil without significantly depleting oxygen levels . more recently , the team failed to detect the underwater plume , indicating that microbes were gobbling it up . us scientists say about 4.9 million barrels of oil have leaked into the gulf since april , more than five times the amount spilled during the exxon valdez disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spill clean-up effort has involved skimming operations and dispersants a scientific snapshot the latest findings seemed to run counter to a study published in the same journal on august 19 , which noted no marked signs of microbial biodegradation .
scientists from the woods hole oceanographic institute examining the plume 's chemical composition noted that dissolved oxygen levels within the plume were close to the levels recorded outside it . chris reddy , a woods hole scientist , said those oxygen levels indicated that if microbes were consuming the oil , they were doing so very slowly . " any self-respecting microbe will want to eat oil – it is like butter , " he said .
" but microbes are a lot like teenagers . they do what they want , when they want , and so it 's difficult often to make predictions about microbial degradation – and in fact , it may vary substantially in the gulf at any one time . " the woods hole scientists confirmed the plume 's existence , measuring more than 1,100 meters below the surface , with crude stretching out over a minimum distance of 35 kilometers from the wellhead . reddy added that the plume did not appear as a chocolate mousse-like concentration . " the water samples , when we ’ re right in the plume , look like spring water – and you certainly didn ’ t see any oil droplets , and you certainly didn ’ t smell it , " he said . " but that doesn ’ t mean that there ’ s no detectable oil . " bildunterschrift : woods hole scientists said the oil plume stretched at least 35 kilometers more work planned scientists from woods hole said their study only amounted to a two-week snapshot of the plume in june . they refused to say what effects it may have on the ecosystem – and reddy said more studies are in the pipeline , including some that focus on whether microbes are consuming the oil . " microbes eat compounds like we eat at a buffet , " he said .
" they like some compounds better than others .
they leave behind a fingerprint of what they chose to eat . ” as the new study indicates , the berkeley scientists succeeded in detecting that fingerprint .
scientists involved in the woods hole study did not register markedly lower levels of oxygen that would suggest the presence of bacteria .
but terry hazen , lead author of the latest report , said he believes the bacteria did n't require large amounts of oxygen to eat the oil in the first place . " these bugs have been adapted to using oil as a carbon source over millions of years because the gulf of mexico receives the equivalent of more than an exxon valdez spill every single year – and it 's been doing that for millions of years from natural seeps , " he said . bildunterschrift : a study confirmed the existence of a plume of oil in the gulf of mexico the spill 's environmental toll hazen said it is difficult to predict how this might affect marine life in the gulf . meanwhile , the oil industry has remained mum on the topic : the american petroleum institute , which represents oil companies in washington , d.c. , said commenting on the oil spill 's possible biological effects would only amount to speculation at this point . sylvia earle , an oceanographer and the former chief scientist for the u.s. national oceanic and atospheric administration , was also reluctant to predict which species might be hurt by the spill .
she said that wildlife populations close to the sites of other major spills have suffered in the past , adding that we may never know just what has been lost . " the deeper you go , the less we know , " earle said . " we do know that there are deep corals , but because all of the gulf has n't been surveyed , we have a spotty record – but we know that they 're there . " " where we 've looked , we 've found them , " she added .
" some of these are thousands of years old . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the long-term environmental impact of the spill is still unclear a wake-up call the oceanographer worries that the oil and the chemicals added to break-up the oil will push a weakened ecosystem to the brink . the gulf of mexico already suffers from dead zones – areas where oxygen levels are so low that aquatic life ca n't survive there .
earle hopes the bp oil spill will serve as a wake-up call , alerting the public to the need to save the seas . " the ocean is the cornerstone of our life-support system , " she said . " it drives the chemistry of the planet .
it shapes the way the world works – from the temperature , to oxygen in the atmosphere , to the carbon cycle , the nitrogen cycle . " " modify the ocean , and you 've modified everything , " earle said . regardless of whether the bp oil spill majorly modifies marine life , many are calling for continued monitoring .
they believe problems , just like the oil plume , could be lurking just under the surface . author : laura iiyama -lrb- arp -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de mud continues to hold oil under blown-out well , bp says bp said it reached a " milestone " in keeping more oil from gushing into the gulf of mexico .
the spill is now the largest in history , but experts are expected to show that its impact will be less than some feared .
-lrb- 04.08.2010 -rrb- paying for their messes : the record for oil companies is n't stellar people affected by the exxon valdez oil-spill disaster had to wait two decades before being compensated .
it could well be the same with bp , since oil concerns often find ways to avoid paying compensation after spills .
-lrb- 20.07.2010 -rrb- us underestimated extent of gulf of mexico disaster , two studies show new reports suggest that as much as 80 percent of the oil that leaked into the gulf of mexico may still be in the ocean .

now , new research indicates that nature might be lending a hand : according to a study published in the journal science on tuesday , microbes are consuming and breaking down the huge underwater plume of crude in the gulf of mexico . a team led by terry hazen of the lawrence berkeley national laboratory , monitored the oil plume starting in may – and that meant tracking the microbes eating it .
the study involved work at 17 deepwater sites to gather more than 200 samples .
scientists found that microbes were consuming the oil without significantly depleting oxygen levels . more recently , the team failed to detect the underwater plume , indicating that microbes were gobbling it up . us scientists say about 4.9 million barrels of oil have leaked into the gulf since april , more than five times the amount spilled during the exxon valdez disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spill clean-up effort has involved skimming operations and dispersants a scientific snapshot the latest findings seemed to run counter to a study published in the same journal on august 19 , which noted no marked signs of microbial biodegradation .
scientists from the woods hole oceanographic institute examining the plume 's chemical composition noted that dissolved oxygen levels within the plume were close to the levels recorded outside it . chris reddy , a woods hole scientist , said those oxygen levels indicated that if microbes were consuming the oil , they were doing so very slowly . " any self-respecting microbe will want to eat oil – it is like butter , " he said .
" but microbes are a lot like teenagers . they do what they want , when they want , and so it 's difficult often to make predictions about microbial degradation – and in fact , it may vary substantially in the gulf at any one time . " the woods hole scientists confirmed the plume 's existence , measuring more than 1,100 meters below the surface , with crude stretching out over a minimum distance of 35 kilometers from the wellhead . reddy added that the plume did not appear as a chocolate mousse-like concentration . " the water samples , when we ’ re right in the plume , look like spring water – and you certainly didn ’ t see any oil droplets , and you certainly didn ’ t smell it , " he said . " but that doesn ’ t mean that there ’ s no detectable oil . " bildunterschrift : woods hole scientists said the oil plume stretched at least 35 kilometers more work planned scientists from woods hole said their study only amounted to a two-week snapshot of the plume in june . they refused to say what effects it may have on the ecosystem – and reddy said more studies are in the pipeline , including some that focus on whether microbes are consuming the oil . " microbes eat compounds like we eat at a buffet , " he said .
" they like some compounds better than others .
they leave behind a fingerprint of what they chose to eat . ” as the new study indicates , the berkeley scientists succeeded in detecting that fingerprint .
scientists involved in the woods hole study did not register markedly lower levels of oxygen that would suggest the presence of bacteria .
but terry hazen , lead author of the latest report , said he believes the bacteria did n't require large amounts of oxygen to eat the oil in the first place . " these bugs have been adapted to using oil as a carbon source over millions of years because the gulf of mexico receives the equivalent of more than an exxon valdez spill every single year – and it 's been doing that for millions of years from natural seeps , " he said . bildunterschrift : a study confirmed the existence of a plume of oil in the gulf of mexico the spill 's environmental toll hazen said it is difficult to predict how this might affect marine life in the gulf . meanwhile , the oil industry has remained mum on the topic : the american petroleum institute , which represents oil companies in washington , d.c. , said commenting on the oil spill 's possible biological effects would only amount to speculation at this point . sylvia earle , an oceanographer and the former chief scientist for the u.s. national oceanic and atospheric administration , was also reluctant to predict which species might be hurt by the spill .
she said that wildlife populations close to the sites of other major spills have suffered in the past , adding that we may never know just what has been lost . " the deeper you go , the less we know , " earle said . " we do know that there are deep corals , but because all of the gulf has n't been surveyed , we have a spotty record – but we know that they 're there . " " where we 've looked , we 've found them , " she added .
" some of these are thousands of years old . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the long-term environmental impact of the spill is still unclear a wake-up call the oceanographer worries that the oil and the chemicals added to break-up the oil will push a weakened ecosystem to the brink . the gulf of mexico already suffers from dead zones – areas where oxygen levels are so low that aquatic life ca n't survive there .
earle hopes the bp oil spill will serve as a wake-up call , alerting the public to the need to save the seas . " the ocean is the cornerstone of our life-support system , " she said . " it drives the chemistry of the planet .
it shapes the way the world works – from the temperature , to oxygen in the atmosphere , to the carbon cycle , the nitrogen cycle . " " modify the ocean , and you 've modified everything , " earle said . regardless of whether the bp oil spill majorly modifies marine life , many are calling for continued monitoring .
they believe problems , just like the oil plume , could be lurking just under the surface . author : laura iiyama -lrb- arp -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de mud continues to hold oil under blown-out well , bp says bp said it reached a " milestone " in keeping more oil from gushing into the gulf of mexico .

but the law cracks down on those who risk infecting others . having unprotected sex with a partner who is not aware of his or her partner 's hiv infection , is a criminal offense in germany , but , medically , it is hard to trace the source of an infection .
a ruling in 1988 , which forced those infected with hiv to declare their condition to sexual partners , is the current legal basis for the trial of the former singer of the girl group no angels , nadja benaissa .
" at the moment , the law states that anyone who is infected must insist on using protection or inform his or her partner of the infection , " felix damm , a lawyer specializing in media and copyright law , told deutsche welle .
" if he or she does not do that , they 're committing a crime , " he says .
aggravated assault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infecting someone with hiv during unprotected sex is a crime in germany the offense is classed as grievous bodily harm , or aggravated assault , because " an hiv infection is incurable and , when it leads to aids , is also lethal , " said damm .
it carries a sentence of six months to 10 years .
it is been more than two decades since the first person was convicted based on the 1988 ruling , some of them because they deliberately infected sexual partners , others were convicted because they were simply careless .
in june 2007 , for example , a 38-year-old man from the western city of cologne was sentenced to eight years in prison for deliberately passing on the hi virus to four women .
he even sent them text messages saying " have fun with hiv " .
the latest case was that of a decorator in the northern city of kiel in june 2010 , who was sentenced to five years in jail for infecting two women with hiv during unprotected sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is often hard to determine the source of the infection medical tests tricky it is not always easy , however , to prove who passed on the virus to a person .
" you can do certain tests to find out if two viruses from two individual people are closely related , " claudia kuecherer from the robert-koch institute told deutsche welle .
" but there 's no absolute proof that would hold up in court .
these so-called phylogenetic tests ca n't ascertain the direction of the infection , " she explained .
proof is even harder to obtain , the more time passes from the time of the infection .
the virus mutates very quickly after the point of infection , making it harder to ascertain if it is related to the virus of the person who passed it on .
as a result , medical tests are not the only evidence used to reach a verdict .
taking responsibility over two decades have passed since the 1988 ruling and some believe it is time for a review of the law used in cases like that of benaissa , based on the fact that , these days , people are much more aware of hiv and should therefore , be in a position to act responsibly .
" i think everyone should be responsible and take precautions , whether they have hiv or not " damm told deutsche welle .
" and if we apply that principle of responsibility to our criminal law , then people who have hiv would not necessarily have to declare their infection and would therefore no longer commit an offense , " he said .

but the law cracks down on those who risk infecting others . having unprotected sex with a partner who is not aware of his or her partner 's hiv infection , is a criminal offense in germany , but , medically , it is hard to trace the source of an infection .
a ruling in 1988 , which forced those infected with hiv to declare their condition to sexual partners , is the current legal basis for the trial of the former singer of the girl group no angels , nadja benaissa .
" at the moment , the law states that anyone who is infected must insist on using protection or inform his or her partner of the infection , " felix damm , a lawyer specializing in media and copyright law , told deutsche welle .
" if he or she does not do that , they 're committing a crime , " he says .
aggravated assault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infecting someone with hiv during unprotected sex is a crime in germany the offense is classed as grievous bodily harm , or aggravated assault , because " an hiv infection is incurable and , when it leads to aids , is also lethal , " said damm .
it carries a sentence of six months to 10 years .
it is been more than two decades since the first person was convicted based on the 1988 ruling , some of them because they deliberately infected sexual partners , others were convicted because they were simply careless .
in june 2007 , for example , a 38-year-old man from the western city of cologne was sentenced to eight years in prison for deliberately passing on the hi virus to four women .
he even sent them text messages saying " have fun with hiv " .
the latest case was that of a decorator in the northern city of kiel in june 2010 , who was sentenced to five years in jail for infecting two women with hiv during unprotected sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is often hard to determine the source of the infection medical tests tricky it is not always easy , however , to prove who passed on the virus to a person .
" you can do certain tests to find out if two viruses from two individual people are closely related , " claudia kuecherer from the robert-koch institute told deutsche welle .
" but there 's no absolute proof that would hold up in court .
these so-called phylogenetic tests ca n't ascertain the direction of the infection , " she explained .
proof is even harder to obtain , the more time passes from the time of the infection .
the virus mutates very quickly after the point of infection , making it harder to ascertain if it is related to the virus of the person who passed it on .
as a result , medical tests are not the only evidence used to reach a verdict .
taking responsibility over two decades have passed since the 1988 ruling and some believe it is time for a review of the law used in cases like that of benaissa , based on the fact that , these days , people are much more aware of hiv and should therefore , be in a position to act responsibly .
" i think everyone should be responsible and take precautions , whether they have hiv or not " damm told deutsche welle .
" and if we apply that principle of responsibility to our criminal law , then people who have hiv would not necessarily have to declare their infection and would therefore no longer commit an offense , " he said .

this week , journalists flocked around " the hoff " when , at a berlin press conference , he announced he would be giving major concerts in germany beginning in february 2011 .
his daughters , taylor ann and hayley amber , aka pop duo " bella vida , " are to accompany him on tour .
hasselhoff had already laid the groundwork for his musical comeback when he appeared on " musikantenstadl " - a popular german-swiss-austrian folk music production - this past spring .
this month , he 's traveling around germany promoting the upcoming tour .
discovering during a radio interview in july with german broadcaster swr1 that his german roots are not near kassel in the heart of the country , as he had thought , but in bremen further north , he endeared audiences in germany by claiming the news was " the best present " he 'd ever received .

hasselhoff helped east and west germans celebrate together on new year 's eve that year for the first time in decades when he sang his " looking for freedom " hit at the brandenburg gate .

the 28-year-old benaissa is a member of the popular girl band no angels . she discovered she was hiv positive in 1999 when she was three months pregnant .
she was arrested in april 2009 for having unprotected sex with three men in 2004 and 2006 and failing to inform them of her hiv status .
to do so can be classified as aggravated assault under german law .
both the state prosecutor peter liesenfeld and her defense had asked the courts for the suspended sentence in the trial , which ended on wednesday .
liesenfeld cited her confession and her expression of remorse as reasons for lighter sentence .
" i made a huge mistake , " benaissa said in an emotional apology during the closing arguments .
" i am sorry from the bottom of my heart , " she said . " i would love to turn back the clock , but i ca n't . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after discovering her hiv status , benaissa -lrb- right -rrb- found success with the girl band no angels almost certainly infected the man but the 34-year-old man she infected with hiv gave an angry testimony during the trial , saying she had caused " a lot of suffering in this world . "
because she and the man both have a strain of the virus that is relatively rare in germany , medical experts had determined the man had almost certainly been infected by benaissa .
she was also convicted of attempted aggravated assault for having unprotected sex with another man who did not contract the virus .
she said she was afraid that her career would be negatively impacted if it became public that she is hiv positive .
a return to the stage ?
instead of jail time , the pop star is expected to complete 300 hours of community service and attend regular counseling sessions .
no angels , which first formed in 2000 and got back together in 2007 after a brief break , are expected to restart their tour .
that tour was interrupted last year when benaissa was arrested just before performing in frankfurt .

the 28-year-old benaissa is a member of the popular girl band no angels . she discovered she was hiv positive in 1999 when she was three months pregnant .
she was arrested in april 2009 for having unprotected sex with three men in 2004 and 2006 and failing to inform them of her hiv status .
to do so can be classified as aggravated assault under german law .
both the state prosecutor peter liesenfeld and her defense had asked the courts for the suspended sentence in the trial , which ended on wednesday .
liesenfeld cited her confession and her expression of remorse as reasons for lighter sentence .
" i made a huge mistake , " benaissa said in an emotional apology during the closing arguments .
" i am sorry from the bottom of my heart , " she said . " i would love to turn back the clock , but i ca n't . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after discovering her hiv status , benaissa -lrb- right -rrb- found success with the girl band no angels almost certainly infected the man but the 34-year-old man she infected with hiv gave an angry testimony during the trial , saying she had caused " a lot of suffering in this world . "
because she and the man both have a strain of the virus that is relatively rare in germany , medical experts had determined the man had almost certainly been infected by benaissa .
she was also convicted of attempted aggravated assault for having unprotected sex with another man who did not contract the virus .
she said she was afraid that her career would be negatively impacted if it became public that she is hiv positive .
a return to the stage ?
instead of jail time , the pop star is expected to complete 300 hours of community service and attend regular counseling sessions .
no angels , which first formed in 2000 and got back together in 2007 after a brief break , are expected to restart their tour .
that tour was interrupted last year when benaissa was arrested just before performing in frankfurt .

the 28-year-old benaissa is a member of the popular girl band no angels . she discovered she was hiv positive in 1999 when she was three months pregnant .
she was arrested in april 2009 for having unprotected sex with three men in 2004 and 2006 and failing to inform them of her hiv status .
to do so can be classified as aggravated assault under german law .
both the state prosecutor peter liesenfeld and her defense had asked the courts for the suspended sentence in the trial , which ended on wednesday .
liesenfeld cited her confession and her expression of remorse as reasons for lighter sentence .
" i made a huge mistake , " benaissa said in an emotional apology during the closing arguments .
" i am sorry from the bottom of my heart , " she said . " i would love to turn back the clock , but i ca n't . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after discovering her hiv status , benaissa -lrb- right -rrb- found success with the girl band no angels almost certainly infected the man but the 34-year-old man she infected with hiv gave an angry testimony during the trial , saying she had caused " a lot of suffering in this world . "
because she and the man both have a strain of the virus that is relatively rare in germany , medical experts had determined the man had almost certainly been infected by benaissa .
she was also convicted of attempted aggravated assault for having unprotected sex with another man who did not contract the virus .
she said she was afraid that her career would be negatively impacted if it became public that she is hiv positive .

in may , bayern munich came closer than any other german club since 2002 to winning the title . bayern - losing finalists against inter milan in may - are among the top seeds and were drawn thursday against as roma , fc basel and cfr cluj in group e of this season 's champions league competition .
the german champions qualified automatically after securing the bundesliga title and therefore avoided the likes of italian giants inter and ac milan , english premiership big-boys manchester united , chelsea and arsenal , spanish champions barcelona and perennial qualifiers lyon from france 's ligue 1 .
clubs from the same country can not not be drawn against each other in the group stage and for tv purposes are kept on opposite sides of the draw as far as possible , so bayern have also avoided playing one of their bundesliga rivals - at least for now .
bayern look to hit the ground running bayern have been slowly building a head of steam in this competition over the past few seasons and since louis van gaal took charge they 've been picking up speed .
from being a team seemingly predestined to get knocked out in the quarterfinals , bayern have quietly developed into a club ready to challenge for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are hoping for happier end to the 2011 competition however , they faltered badly in the early stages of the competition last season , almost crashing out at the group stage with only a heroic performance against juventus preventing them from slipping into the europa league .
but with every passing round , the bavarian giants had an unbeatable air about them .
they marched through against teams like manchester united and lyon with a strange certainty that they would reach the final and had many convinced that they could win it .
unfortunately , it was not to be .
this season , a strong showing against another italian team will be needed .
as roma ran inter milan close to the serie a title last season and will prove obstinate opposition for bayern , especially at the stadio olimpico .
the german champions should have the measure of the italians at home but bayern 's visit to rome could prove tricky .
there should n't be any problem for the germans against fc basel so qualification should be assured , regardless of which way the results go against roma and cluj . if bayern can avoid the pitfalls which almost cost them the chance of making the knockout phase last time and find their european groove earlier this season , then they 'll be a strong bet to repeat their run to the previous final and who knows - perhaps even win it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have yet to fulfill their champions league potential bremen hope to recapture barnstorming form werder bremen , recently qualified at the expense of sampdoria , return to the champions league after a couple of seasons away from europe ’ s premier club competition .
the impressive and dramatic performances by thomas schaaf 's side against their italian opposition in the qualifying round certainly suggests that bremen will be an entertaining addition to the group stages , but how will they fare against teams like reigning champions inter milan , dutch champions fc twente and tottenham hotspurs ?
bremen have never really worried the latter stages of the champions league despite consistently reaching the knockout rounds during their strong , mid-noughties period of bundesliga ascendance .
however , they ’ ve been off the boil for the latter part of the decade and have not managed to regain the consistency which saw them continually challenging for the bundesliga title and qualifying for the champions league .
it remains to be seen how inter milan play under new coach rafa benitez , but however the former liverpool coach chooses to line the european champions up , it 's still effectively the same team that won the trophy last season .
bremen will be in for a fight both at home and away .
they may fancy their chances against new boys tottenham hotspurs but the english premiership side looked far from over-awed in qualifying , so werder will have to draw on their experience to snuff out spurs ' enthusiasm over two games .
fc twente shocked the eredivisie last season under current wolfsburg coach steve mcclaren , so who 's to say they wo n't spring a surprise in the champions league ?
they 're unlikely to win it but they could cause bremen problems .
at best , werder could get through in second but it looks a tough group for the north germans .
schalke faces tough group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope magath and raul can plot a successful course schalke , the third team in the bundesliga trio , have a tricky group consisting of lyon , benfica and happoel tel aviv .
but while schalke teams in the past have been finding their way through european competition with little knowledgeable guidance , they have a hard-headed coach with experience of the business end of the european cup in felix magath .
a winner and runner-up with hamburg as a player , magath coached bayern in three champions league campaigns , reaching the quarterfinals in 2004/05 and the first knockout round the following year .
he also took bayern to the knockout round in the 2006/07 competition but was fired for poor bundesliga form before their quarterfinal defeat to ac milan .
magath also has the most prolific goal scorer in champions league history on his books in the form of raul .
the former real madrid talisman and captain has three champions league winner ’ s medals to his name as well as an unprecedented 66 strikes in the competition .
as a result schalke will be going into this season ’ s champions league with an experienced leader off the pitch and an experienced one on it .
lyon have been here so many times before that they treat the champions league as if it was an extension of their domestic competition .
but , as bayern found out last season , this sometimes works against them .
lyon may not be equipped to deal with both this season , and schalke will hope to get a victory against them either home or away .
benfica could be the wild card in the group .
the portuguese are renowned for swift counterattacking play and their style may be a little cavalier for the germans .
these games could be very hard for schalke .
but the germans should get the points they need to at least challenge for the second qualifying spot against hapoel tel aviv .

schalke faces tough group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope magath and raul can plot a successful course schalke , the third team in the bundesliga trio , have a tricky group consisting of lyon , benfica and happoel tel aviv .
but while schalke teams in the past have been finding their way through european competition with little knowledgeable guidance , they have a hard-headed coach with experience of the business end of the european cup in felix magath .
a winner and runner-up with hamburg as a player , magath coached bayern in three champions league campaigns , reaching the quarterfinals in 2004/05 and the first knockout round the following year .
he also took bayern to the knockout round in the 2006/07 competition but was fired for poor bundesliga form before their quarterfinal defeat to ac milan .
magath also has the most prolific goal scorer in champions league history on his books in the form of raul .
the former real madrid talisman and captain has three champions league winner ’ s medals to his name as well as an unprecedented 66 strikes in the competition .
as a result schalke will be going into this season ’ s champions league with an experienced leader off the pitch and an experienced one on it .
lyon have been here so many times before that they treat the champions league as if it was an extension of their domestic competition .
but , as bayern found out last season , this sometimes works against them .
lyon may not be equipped to deal with both this season , and schalke will hope to get a victory against them either home or away .
benfica could be the wild card in the group .
the portuguese are renowned for swift counterattacking play and their style may be a little cavalier for the germans .
these games could be very hard for schalke .
but the germans should get the points they need to at least challenge for the second qualifying spot against hapoel tel aviv .

in may , bayern munich came closer than any other german club since 2002 to winning the title . bayern - losing finalists against inter milan in may - are among the top seeds and were drawn thursday against as roma , fc basel and cfr cluj in group e of this season 's champions league competition .
the german champions qualified automatically after securing the bundesliga title and therefore avoided the likes of italian giants inter and ac milan , english premiership big-boys manchester united , chelsea and arsenal , spanish champions barcelona and perennial qualifiers lyon from france 's ligue 1 .
clubs from the same country can not not be drawn against each other in the group stage and for tv purposes are kept on opposite sides of the draw as far as possible , so bayern have also avoided playing one of their bundesliga rivals - at least for now .
bayern look to hit the ground running bayern have been slowly building a head of steam in this competition over the past few seasons and since louis van gaal took charge they 've been picking up speed .
from being a team seemingly predestined to get knocked out in the quarterfinals , bayern have quietly developed into a club ready to challenge for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are hoping for happier end to the 2011 competition however , they faltered badly in the early stages of the competition last season , almost crashing out at the group stage with only a heroic performance against juventus preventing them from slipping into the europa league .
but with every passing round , the bavarian giants had an unbeatable air about them .
they marched through against teams like manchester united and lyon with a strange certainty that they would reach the final and had many convinced that they could win it .
unfortunately , it was not to be .
this season , a strong showing against another italian team will be needed .
as roma ran inter milan close to the serie a title last season and will prove obstinate opposition for bayern , especially at the stadio olimpico .
the german champions should have the measure of the italians at home but bayern 's visit to rome could prove tricky .
there should n't be any problem for the germans against fc basel so qualification should be assured , regardless of which way the results go against roma and cluj . if bayern can avoid the pitfalls which almost cost them the chance of making the knockout phase last time and find their european groove earlier this season , then they 'll be a strong bet to repeat their run to the previous final and who knows - perhaps even win it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have yet to fulfill their champions league potential bremen hope to recapture barnstorming form werder bremen , recently qualified at the expense of sampdoria , return to the champions league after a couple of seasons away from europe ’ s premier club competition .
the impressive and dramatic performances by thomas schaaf 's side against their italian opposition in the qualifying round certainly suggests that bremen will be an entertaining addition to the group stages , but how will they fare against teams like reigning champions inter milan , dutch champions fc twente and tottenham hotspurs ?
bremen have never really worried the latter stages of the champions league despite consistently reaching the knockout rounds during their strong , mid-noughties period of bundesliga ascendance .
however , they ’ ve been off the boil for the latter part of the decade and have not managed to regain the consistency which saw them continually challenging for the bundesliga title and qualifying for the champions league .
it remains to be seen how inter milan play under new coach rafa benitez , but however the former liverpool coach chooses to line the european champions up , it 's still effectively the same team that won the trophy last season .
bremen will be in for a fight both at home and away .
they may fancy their chances against new boys tottenham hotspurs but the english premiership side looked far from over-awed in qualifying , so werder will have to draw on their experience to snuff out spurs ' enthusiasm over two games .
fc twente shocked the eredivisie last season under current wolfsburg coach steve mcclaren , so who 's to say they wo n't spring a surprise in the champions league ?
they 're unlikely to win it but they could cause bremen problems .
at best , werder could get through in second but it looks a tough group for the north germans .

in may , bayern munich came closer than any other german club since 2002 to winning the title . bayern - losing finalists against inter milan in may - are among the top seeds and were drawn thursday against as roma , fc basel and cfr cluj in group e of this season 's champions league competition .
the german champions qualified automatically after securing the bundesliga title and therefore avoided the likes of italian giants inter and ac milan , english premiership big-boys manchester united , chelsea and arsenal , spanish champions barcelona and perennial qualifiers lyon from france 's ligue 1 .
clubs from the same country can not not be drawn against each other in the group stage and for tv purposes are kept on opposite sides of the draw as far as possible , so bayern have also avoided playing one of their bundesliga rivals - at least for now .
bayern look to hit the ground running bayern have been slowly building a head of steam in this competition over the past few seasons and since louis van gaal took charge they 've been picking up speed .
from being a team seemingly predestined to get knocked out in the quarterfinals , bayern have quietly developed into a club ready to challenge for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are hoping for happier end to the 2011 competition however , they faltered badly in the early stages of the competition last season , almost crashing out at the group stage with only a heroic performance against juventus preventing them from slipping into the europa league .
but with every passing round , the bavarian giants had an unbeatable air about them .
they marched through against teams like manchester united and lyon with a strange certainty that they would reach the final and had many convinced that they could win it .
unfortunately , it was not to be .
this season , a strong showing against another italian team will be needed .
as roma ran inter milan close to the serie a title last season and will prove obstinate opposition for bayern , especially at the stadio olimpico .
the german champions should have the measure of the italians at home but bayern 's visit to rome could prove tricky .
there should n't be any problem for the germans against fc basel so qualification should be assured , regardless of which way the results go against roma and cluj . if bayern can avoid the pitfalls which almost cost them the chance of making the knockout phase last time and find their european groove earlier this season , then they 'll be a strong bet to repeat their run to the previous final and who knows - perhaps even win it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have yet to fulfill their champions league potential bremen hope to recapture barnstorming form werder bremen , recently qualified at the expense of sampdoria , return to the champions league after a couple of seasons away from europe ’ s premier club competition .
the impressive and dramatic performances by thomas schaaf 's side against their italian opposition in the qualifying round certainly suggests that bremen will be an entertaining addition to the group stages , but how will they fare against teams like reigning champions inter milan , dutch champions fc twente and tottenham hotspurs ?
bremen have never really worried the latter stages of the champions league despite consistently reaching the knockout rounds during their strong , mid-noughties period of bundesliga ascendance .
however , they ’ ve been off the boil for the latter part of the decade and have not managed to regain the consistency which saw them continually challenging for the bundesliga title and qualifying for the champions league .
it remains to be seen how inter milan play under new coach rafa benitez , but however the former liverpool coach chooses to line the european champions up , it 's still effectively the same team that won the trophy last season .
bremen will be in for a fight both at home and away .
they may fancy their chances against new boys tottenham hotspurs but the english premiership side looked far from over-awed in qualifying , so werder will have to draw on their experience to snuff out spurs ' enthusiasm over two games .
fc twente shocked the eredivisie last season under current wolfsburg coach steve mcclaren , so who 's to say they wo n't spring a surprise in the champions league ?
they 're unlikely to win it but they could cause bremen problems .
at best , werder could get through in second but it looks a tough group for the north germans .
schalke faces tough group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope magath and raul can plot a successful course schalke , the third team in the bundesliga trio , have a tricky group consisting of lyon , benfica and happoel tel aviv .
but while schalke teams in the past have been finding their way through european competition with little knowledgeable guidance , they have a hard-headed coach with experience of the business end of the european cup in felix magath .
a winner and runner-up with hamburg as a player , magath coached bayern in three champions league campaigns , reaching the quarterfinals in 2004/05 and the first knockout round the following year .
he also took bayern to the knockout round in the 2006/07 competition but was fired for poor bundesliga form before their quarterfinal defeat to ac milan .
magath also has the most prolific goal scorer in champions league history on his books in the form of raul .
the former real madrid talisman and captain has three champions league winner ’ s medals to his name as well as an unprecedented 66 strikes in the competition .
as a result schalke will be going into this season ’ s champions league with an experienced leader off the pitch and an experienced one on it .
lyon have been here so many times before that they treat the champions league as if it was an extension of their domestic competition .
but , as bayern found out last season , this sometimes works against them .
lyon may not be equipped to deal with both this season , and schalke will hope to get a victory against them either home or away .
benfica could be the wild card in the group .
the portuguese are renowned for swift counterattacking play and their style may be a little cavalier for the germans .
these games could be very hard for schalke .
but the germans should get the points they need to at least challenge for the second qualifying spot against hapoel tel aviv .

" we will market opel as a european designed car in the premium segment , " company spokesman andreas kroemer told deutsche welle .
" there are a growing number of chinese who like european cars and have the money to afford them . "

when the corpse of a 5,000-year-old human was uncovered nearly 20 years ago , archaeologists assumed the iceman 's death was anything but ceremonious .
researchers now think oetzi may have received a proper alpine burial . a study released on thursday suggests that oetzi , a human specimen found in the alps of south tyrol nearly two decades ago , was not " frozen in time and place " following his death five millennia ago .
a team of italian and american researchers now believe the iceman actually received a proper burial ceremony atop a mountain pass , months after his death .
oetzi was initially discovered in 1991 at the tisenjoch alpine pass along the border between austria and italy .
researchers theorized that the iceman died of a battle-related arrow wound to the shoulder .
it followed that oetzi 's personal belongings were frozen with him after his death in the upper reaches of the alps .
yet according to a new study published today in the journal antiquity , those conclusions were not based on detailed mapping of the grave site . a team of archaeologists , anthropologists and geo-specialists used spatial analysis to pinpoint the distribution of the man 's belongings and the corpse itself - leading them to propose that his body was ceremoniously placed on elevated rock , some five meters -lrb- about 16 feet -rrb- away from his eventual discovery site . " we concluded that he died in april , and in april the pass was probably full of snow , " said alessandro vanzetti , an archaeologist at the la sapienza university of rome and one of the study 's authors .
" he could n't have died on the spot , furthermore , he did n't die on this stone , as had been reported . "
botanical evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers have not reached consensus on the circumstances of oetzi 's death the team analyzed pollen ingested by oetzi before his death and compared it with pollen found in the ice surrounding him , noting a " mismatch " between his death in april - which the team suspected occurred at a lower altitude - and his possible burial in august or september .
researchers concluded that the iceman died in a different location , and that his body was recovered .
" we think he was kept in some kind of cellar , " vanzetti told deutsche welle .
citing regional historical knowledge , the study noted that in oetzi 's day , the dead were customarily placed in farmsteads called " masi " before the winter snow and ice melted .
" it was used by people in tyrol during the cold seasons , " he said .
" when one was dead , it was impossible to bury immediately , because the ground was frozen . "
" he was a very important person , so people decided to bury him on the pass , " vanzetti added .
luca bondioli , co-author of the paper and an anthropologist with at the national museum of prehistory and ethnology in italy , described oetzi as " an individual of the elite . "
" the fact that we have a new interpretation of the discovery is important , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the study noted that previous oetzi research was based on the initial interpretation of the iceman find and his belongings as " frozen in time and place . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say the iceman died from an arrow wound to the shoulder distribution data but the team 's findings suggested that the iceman 's personal effects were carefully placed near his body during a burial ceremony , not simply scattered around him as he lay dying .
" there is a strong indication that the distribution can be explained by gravity and movement in the ice , " vanzetti said .
the archaeologist and his colleagues proposed that oetzi and his grave goods were placed on an area of raised natural stone .
later on , according to the study , " cyclical thawing and freezing " caused the corpse and the burial items to shift .
the distribution was likely variable : lighter objects , such as hair and oetzi 's quiver , did not move in the same way as more weighty items , such as fur , leather and the body itself .
lingering questions yet not all researchers in the field are prepared to accept the burial theory .
albert zink , who was involved in efforts to map oetzi 's dna and serves as head of the institute for mummies and the iceman , said the team 's conclusion was " not very convincing . "
" there there are several things which i think are clearly in contrast to a burial , " he told deutsche welle , citing the unusual placement of the bow , which had been stood upright , as well as the random distribution of oetzi 's belongings .
moreover , the iceman was found with his right arm in a vertical position that zink said would have been corrected before a burial . nevertheless , the new theory speaks to certain missing links in the iceman story - including why oetzi was found with unfinished weaponry .
it could also explain why personal effects were discovered near his body , considering the likelihood that his attackers would confiscate the belongings of a felled opponent .

when the corpse of a 5,000-year-old human was uncovered nearly 20 years ago , archaeologists assumed the iceman 's death was anything but ceremonious .
researchers now think oetzi may have received a proper alpine burial . a study released on thursday suggests that oetzi , a human specimen found in the alps of south tyrol nearly two decades ago , was not " frozen in time and place " following his death five millennia ago .
a team of italian and american researchers now believe the iceman actually received a proper burial ceremony atop a mountain pass , months after his death .
oetzi was initially discovered in 1991 at the tisenjoch alpine pass along the border between austria and italy .
researchers theorized that the iceman died of a battle-related arrow wound to the shoulder .
it followed that oetzi 's personal belongings were frozen with him after his death in the upper reaches of the alps .
yet according to a new study published today in the journal antiquity , those conclusions were not based on detailed mapping of the grave site . a team of archaeologists , anthropologists and geo-specialists used spatial analysis to pinpoint the distribution of the man 's belongings and the corpse itself - leading them to propose that his body was ceremoniously placed on elevated rock , some five meters -lrb- about 16 feet -rrb- away from his eventual discovery site . " we concluded that he died in april , and in april the pass was probably full of snow , " said alessandro vanzetti , an archaeologist at the la sapienza university of rome and one of the study 's authors .
" he could n't have died on the spot , furthermore , he did n't die on this stone , as had been reported . "
botanical evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers have not reached consensus on the circumstances of oetzi 's death the team analyzed pollen ingested by oetzi before his death and compared it with pollen found in the ice surrounding him , noting a " mismatch " between his death in april - which the team suspected occurred at a lower altitude - and his possible burial in august or september .
researchers concluded that the iceman died in a different location , and that his body was recovered .
" we think he was kept in some kind of cellar , " vanzetti told deutsche welle .
citing regional historical knowledge , the study noted that in oetzi 's day , the dead were customarily placed in farmsteads called " masi " before the winter snow and ice melted .
" it was used by people in tyrol during the cold seasons , " he said .
" when one was dead , it was impossible to bury immediately , because the ground was frozen . "
" he was a very important person , so people decided to bury him on the pass , " vanzetti added .
luca bondioli , co-author of the paper and an anthropologist with at the national museum of prehistory and ethnology in italy , described oetzi as " an individual of the elite . "
" the fact that we have a new interpretation of the discovery is important , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .

the distribution was likely variable : lighter objects , such as hair and oetzi 's quiver , did not move in the same way as more weighty items , such as fur , leather and the body itself .
lingering questions yet not all researchers in the field are prepared to accept the burial theory .
albert zink , who was involved in efforts to map oetzi 's dna and serves as head of the institute for mummies and the iceman , said the team 's conclusion was " not very convincing . "
" there there are several things which i think are clearly in contrast to a burial , " he told deutsche welle , citing the unusual placement of the bow , which had been stood upright , as well as the random distribution of oetzi 's belongings .
moreover , the iceman was found with his right arm in a vertical position that zink said would have been corrected before a burial . nevertheless , the new theory speaks to certain missing links in the iceman story - including why oetzi was found with unfinished weaponry .
it could also explain why personal effects were discovered near his body , considering the likelihood that his attackers would confiscate the belongings of a felled opponent . " ultimately , " the study read , " the impressive array of other objects is better explained as grave furnishings than as mountain equipment .

he said serbia , however , would have to " come to terms " with the loss of kosovo as a province . german foreign minister guido westerwelle urged serbia on thursday to drop its challenges to kosovo 's independence and instead focus its energy on joining the european union .
" in our view , one can only be a member of the european union if one aims for cooperation and is prepared to resolve neighborly difficulties cooperatively , " he told reporters in belgrade .
westerwelle used his first visit to serbia to meet with prime minister mirko cvetkovic , president boris tadic and opposition leaders . he expressed his disagreement with a recent resolution against the secession of kosovo presented by the country to the united nations general assembly .
" the independence of kosovo is a reality , " westerwelle said in a speech at the university of belgrade .
" reconciliation is only possible when one grasps the reality . "
germany has joined 68 other countries in recognizing kosovo 's independence , but serbia adamantly opposes it .
in july , the international court of justice found kosovo 's secession was in line with international law . serbia rejected the ruling and instead is pressing the un to restart talks on the state 's status .
a european resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence has been a highly controversial subject westerwelle said the eu would be willing to broker direct talks between serbia and kosovo to resolve the dispute and questioned serbia 's choice to take the issue to the un instead .
" when someone in europe wants to solve something including conflicts -lsb- … -rsb- the road should first lead to brussels , not to new york , " he said .
on to bosnia , kosovo later thursday , westerwelle is to visit the bosnian capital , sarajevo , where proposed political reforms have long been stalled . parliamentary and presidential elections are scheduled for october .
western powers hope the results will shift the politics away from ethnic divisions and toward a more unified country .
but with two rival autonomous regions , the mainly muslim and croat federation of bosnia and herzegovina and serb-majority republika srpska , bosnia and herzegovina is the most politically unstable of the former yugoslav republics .
westerwelle began his tour in croatia on wednesday , where he provided an optimistic outlook for the country 's prospects of joining the eu .
he continues to kosovo on friday , where he is to visit the 1,400-strong german contingent of kfor , nato 's peacekeeping force in kosovo .

gm has given the green light for opel to export beyond its core european market . us carmaker gm has decided to allow opel to sell its cars in china , a move expected to lead to even greater competition among its brands in the huge chinese market .

opel tested the waters in china last year , selling around 4,000 cars , according to kroemer .

together with chevy and buick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has become the world 's largest market for new car sales kroemer declined to say which models opel plans to sell in china .
currently , gm markets its cadillac , chevrolet and buick brands in the country , in addition to vehicles manufactured by wuling , a chinese carmaker in which the us auto giant has a 30 percent stake .
until now , vehicles made by opel were only sold outside europe under gm 's buick nameplate .
in addition to china , opel will begin selling vehicles in australia and later in several other markets in the asia-pacific and south american regions , according to kroemer .
" this is great news for opel and i believe the company has good opportunities in the country , " said christoph stuermer , an auto analyst with ihs global insight in frankfurt .
export first , assemble locally later stuermer expects opel will initially export cars to china until it establishes a market position in the country .
but eventually , he said , the company will need to assemble cars locally to avoid import taxes , which can increase the price of vehicles by as much as 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm adds opel to its line of brands in china opel will compete with germany 's other big carmakers , bmw , daimler and volkswagen , which have been operating in china for some time .
china has become the world 's biggest auto market based on the number of new vehicles sold .
automakers around the world are looking to the country to drive revenue amid weak global demand .
but growth has dropped since last year when the government boosted demand with tax cuts and subsidies .
in recent months , chinese auto sales have declined steadily , falling from 19.4 percent in june to 17.2 percent in july , according to the china automotive technology and research center .

audiences are mainly germans who enjoy the challenge . the english theatre berlin is the german capital 's only exclusively english-language theater .
oddly enough , the theater 's founder and artistic director , is german . guenther grosser - not from berlin , but from bavaria - studied acting in new york in the late 1980s .
with the fall of the berlin wall , he saw a chance to establish an english-language theater in the german capital . " when the wall came down we all realized -lsb- that -rsb- this is really becoming an international capital , and there are so many people moving to berlin from all over the world , " said grosser .
" so i think the english-language theater is a must in this town . " celebrating two decades this year , the english theatre berlin plays a strong , if modest role on the city 's vast theater scene .
since german reunification , berlin has become one of europe 's hippest meccas for artistic creativity and , according to grosser , this development has had a direct and dramatic affect on his theater . " -lsb- many -rsb- more young theater-makers are in berlin now than ever before , " he said .
" it is much easier for us now to choose from a large crowd of actors - and we 're talking about professional native-speaking english language actors living in town . " having a bigger pool of actors means a greater diversity of ideas , approaches and aesthetics . love is universal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the theater 's founder guenther grosser was inspired by his time in new york in this summer 's production of lovepuke , a play about the trials and tribulations of love , sex and communication in modern relationships , amy hye plays the role of the femme fatale , louise .
originally from new zealand , hye recently moved to berlin after spending six years in madrid . she 's one of berlin 's many new arrivals , attracted by the city 's creative mystique and promise of cheap living . " in madrid , we were working really fast-paced comedy shows , one-hour shows back-to-back , " she said .

gm has given the green light for opel to export beyond its core european market . us carmaker gm has decided to allow opel to sell its cars in china , a move expected to lead to even greater competition among its brands in the huge chinese market .
" we will market opel as a european designed car in the premium segment , " company spokesman andreas kroemer told deutsche welle .
" there are a growing number of chinese who like european cars and have the money to afford them . "
opel tested the waters in china last year , selling around 4,000 cars , according to kroemer .
in the first half of 2010 , china passed the united states as gm 's biggest national market .
together with chevy and buick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has become the world 's largest market for new car sales kroemer declined to say which models opel plans to sell in china .
currently , gm markets its cadillac , chevrolet and buick brands in the country , in addition to vehicles manufactured by wuling , a chinese carmaker in which the us auto giant has a 30 percent stake .
until now , vehicles made by opel were only sold outside europe under gm 's buick nameplate .
in addition to china , opel will begin selling vehicles in australia and later in several other markets in the asia-pacific and south american regions , according to kroemer .
" this is great news for opel and i believe the company has good opportunities in the country , " said christoph stuermer , an auto analyst with ihs global insight in frankfurt .
export first , assemble locally later stuermer expects opel will initially export cars to china until it establishes a market position in the country .
but eventually , he said , the company will need to assemble cars locally to avoid import taxes , which can increase the price of vehicles by as much as 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm adds opel to its line of brands in china opel will compete with germany 's other big carmakers , bmw , daimler and volkswagen , which have been operating in china for some time .
china has become the world 's biggest auto market based on the number of new vehicles sold .
automakers around the world are looking to the country to drive revenue amid weak global demand .
but growth has dropped since last year when the government boosted demand with tax cuts and subsidies .
in recent months , chinese auto sales have declined steadily , falling from 19.4 percent in june to 17.2 percent in july , according to the china automotive technology and research center .

this week , journalists flocked around " the hoff " when , at a berlin press conference , he announced he would be giving major concerts in germany beginning in february 2011 .
his daughters , taylor ann and hayley amber , aka pop duo " bella vida , " are to accompany him on tour .
hasselhoff had already laid the groundwork for his musical comeback when he appeared on " musikantenstadl " - a popular german-swiss-austrian folk music production - this past spring .
this month , he 's traveling around germany promoting the upcoming tour .
discovering during a radio interview in july with german broadcaster swr1 that his german roots are not near kassel in the heart of the country , as he had thought , but in bremen further north , he endeared audiences in germany by claiming the news was " the best present " he 'd ever received .
the broadcaster had commissioned a german researcher to look into the american celebrity 's ancestry .
according to news agency afp , the singer had orginally intended to buy property in hasselhof , a town similarly written to the star 's last name and located near kassel .
making a splash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasselhoff -lrb- center back -rrb- was the hunk in the popular " baywatch " tv show during the berlin press conference on wednesday , however , " knight rider " and " baywatch " hunk hasselhoff revealed some of his darker side when he spoke openly about elements in his recent autobiography , " making waves . "
he said dealing with his alcoholism was a " daily struggle , " and was frank when he admitted that writing the autobiography was " like therapy . "
hasselhoff had reaped scorn when he appeared on mtv 's european music awards in berlin last year and slurred the words of his laudation .
an internet video also showed him trying to munch a hamburger while more than a little under the influence , news magazine stern noted .
the 58-year-old made a splash over 20 years ago in germany , recording an english-language cover version of the 1970 's german hit " auf der strasse nach sueden , " calling it " looking for freedom . "
it scaled the german charts quickly , just as a new tide of revolution began rolling through eastern europe , culminating in the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 .
hasselhoff helped east and west germans celebrate together on new year 's eve that year for the first time in decades when he sang his " looking for freedom " hit at the brandenburg gate .

oddly enough , the theater 's founder and artistic director , is german . guenther grosser - not from berlin , but from bavaria - studied acting in new york in the late 1980s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 26.08.2010 iceman likely laid to rest , study suggests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was oetzi given a burial ceremony ?
when the corpse of a 5,000-year-old human was uncovered nearly 20 years ago , archaeologists assumed the iceman 's death was anything but ceremonious .
researchers now think oetzi may have received a proper alpine burial . a study released on thursday suggests that oetzi , a human specimen found in the alps of south tyrol nearly two decades ago , was not " frozen in time and place " following his death five millennia ago .
a team of italian and american researchers now believe the iceman actually received a proper burial ceremony atop a mountain pass , months after his death .
oetzi was initially discovered in 1991 at the tisenjoch alpine pass along the border between austria and italy .
researchers theorized that the iceman died of a battle-related arrow wound to the shoulder .
it followed that oetzi 's personal belongings were frozen with him after his death in the upper reaches of the alps .
yet according to a new study published today in the journal antiquity , those conclusions were not based on detailed mapping of the grave site . a team of archaeologists , anthropologists and geo-specialists used spatial analysis to pinpoint the distribution of the man 's belongings and the corpse itself - leading them to propose that his body was ceremoniously placed on elevated rock , some five meters -lrb- about 16 feet -rrb- away from his eventual discovery site . " we concluded that he died in april , and in april the pass was probably full of snow , " said alessandro vanzetti , an archaeologist at the la sapienza university of rome and one of the study 's authors .
" he could n't have died on the spot , furthermore , he did n't die on this stone , as had been reported . "
botanical evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers have not reached consensus on the circumstances of oetzi 's death the team analyzed pollen ingested by oetzi before his death and compared it with pollen found in the ice surrounding him , noting a " mismatch " between his death in april - which the team suspected occurred at a lower altitude - and his possible burial in august or september .
researchers concluded that the iceman died in a different location , and that his body was recovered .
" we think he was kept in some kind of cellar , " vanzetti told deutsche welle .
citing regional historical knowledge , the study noted that in oetzi 's day , the dead were customarily placed in farmsteads called " masi " before the winter snow and ice melted .
" it was used by people in tyrol during the cold seasons , " he said .
" when one was dead , it was impossible to bury immediately , because the ground was frozen . "
" he was a very important person , so people decided to bury him on the pass , " vanzetti added .
luca bondioli , co-author of the paper and an anthropologist with at the national museum of prehistory and ethnology in italy , described oetzi as " an individual of the elite . "
" the fact that we have a new interpretation of the discovery is important , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the study noted that previous oetzi research was based on the initial interpretation of the iceman find and his belongings as " frozen in time and place . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say the iceman died from an arrow wound to the shoulder distribution data but the team 's findings suggested that the iceman 's personal effects were carefully placed near his body during a burial ceremony , not simply scattered around him as he lay dying .
" there is a strong indication that the distribution can be explained by gravity and movement in the ice , " vanzetti said .
the archaeologist and his colleagues proposed that oetzi and his grave goods were placed on an area of raised natural stone .
later on , according to the study , " cyclical thawing and freezing " caused the corpse and the burial items to shift .
the distribution was likely variable : lighter objects , such as hair and oetzi 's quiver , did not move in the same way as more weighty items , such as fur , leather and the body itself .
lingering questions yet not all researchers in the field are prepared to accept the burial theory .
albert zink , who was involved in efforts to map oetzi 's dna and serves as head of the institute for mummies and the iceman , said the team 's conclusion was " not very convincing . "
" there there are several things which i think are clearly in contrast to a burial , " he told deutsche welle , citing the unusual placement of the bow , which had been stood upright , as well as the random distribution of oetzi 's belongings .
moreover , the iceman was found with his right arm in a vertical position that zink said would have been corrected before a burial . nevertheless , the new theory speaks to certain missing links in the iceman story - including why oetzi was found with unfinished weaponry .
it could also explain why personal effects were discovered near his body , considering the likelihood that his attackers would confiscate the belongings of a felled opponent .

when the corpse of a 5,000-year-old human was uncovered nearly 20 years ago , archaeologists assumed the iceman 's death was anything but ceremonious .
researchers now think oetzi may have received a proper alpine burial . a study released on thursday suggests that oetzi , a human specimen found in the alps of south tyrol nearly two decades ago , was not " frozen in time and place " following his death five millennia ago .
a team of italian and american researchers now believe the iceman actually received a proper burial ceremony atop a mountain pass , months after his death .
oetzi was initially discovered in 1991 at the tisenjoch alpine pass along the border between austria and italy .
researchers theorized that the iceman died of a battle-related arrow wound to the shoulder .
it followed that oetzi 's personal belongings were frozen with him after his death in the upper reaches of the alps .
yet according to a new study published today in the journal antiquity , those conclusions were not based on detailed mapping of the grave site . a team of archaeologists , anthropologists and geo-specialists used spatial analysis to pinpoint the distribution of the man 's belongings and the corpse itself - leading them to propose that his body was ceremoniously placed on elevated rock , some five meters -lrb- about 16 feet -rrb- away from his eventual discovery site . " we concluded that he died in april , and in april the pass was probably full of snow , " said alessandro vanzetti , an archaeologist at the la sapienza university of rome and one of the study 's authors .
" he could n't have died on the spot , furthermore , he did n't die on this stone , as had been reported . "
botanical evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers have not reached consensus on the circumstances of oetzi 's death the team analyzed pollen ingested by oetzi before his death and compared it with pollen found in the ice surrounding him , noting a " mismatch " between his death in april - which the team suspected occurred at a lower altitude - and his possible burial in august or september .
researchers concluded that the iceman died in a different location , and that his body was recovered .
" we think he was kept in some kind of cellar , " vanzetti told deutsche welle .
citing regional historical knowledge , the study noted that in oetzi 's day , the dead were customarily placed in farmsteads called " masi " before the winter snow and ice melted .
" it was used by people in tyrol during the cold seasons , " he said .
" when one was dead , it was impossible to bury immediately , because the ground was frozen . "
" he was a very important person , so people decided to bury him on the pass , " vanzetti added .
luca bondioli , co-author of the paper and an anthropologist with at the national museum of prehistory and ethnology in italy , described oetzi as " an individual of the elite . "
" the fact that we have a new interpretation of the discovery is important , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the study noted that previous oetzi research was based on the initial interpretation of the iceman find and his belongings as " frozen in time and place . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say the iceman died from an arrow wound to the shoulder distribution data but the team 's findings suggested that the iceman 's personal effects were carefully placed near his body during a burial ceremony , not simply scattered around him as he lay dying .
" there is a strong indication that the distribution can be explained by gravity and movement in the ice , " vanzetti said .
the archaeologist and his colleagues proposed that oetzi and his grave goods were placed on an area of raised natural stone .
later on , according to the study , " cyclical thawing and freezing " caused the corpse and the burial items to shift .
the distribution was likely variable : lighter objects , such as hair and oetzi 's quiver , did not move in the same way as more weighty items , such as fur , leather and the body itself .
lingering questions yet not all researchers in the field are prepared to accept the burial theory .
albert zink , who was involved in efforts to map oetzi 's dna and serves as head of the institute for mummies and the iceman , said the team 's conclusion was " not very convincing . "
" there there are several things which i think are clearly in contrast to a burial , " he told deutsche welle , citing the unusual placement of the bow , which had been stood upright , as well as the random distribution of oetzi 's belongings .
moreover , the iceman was found with his right arm in a vertical position that zink said would have been corrected before a burial . nevertheless , the new theory speaks to certain missing links in the iceman story - including why oetzi was found with unfinished weaponry .
it could also explain why personal effects were discovered near his body , considering the likelihood that his attackers would confiscate the belongings of a felled opponent . " ultimately , " the study read , " the impressive array of other objects is better explained as grave furnishings than as mountain equipment .

but the law cracks down on those who risk infecting others . having unprotected sex with a partner who is not aware of his or her partner 's hiv infection , is a criminal offense in germany , but , medically , it is hard to trace the source of an infection .
a ruling in 1988 , which forced those infected with hiv to declare their condition to sexual partners , is the current legal basis for the trial of the former singer of the girl group no angels , nadja benaissa .
" at the moment , the law states that anyone who is infected must insist on using protection or inform his or her partner of the infection , " felix damm , a lawyer specializing in media and copyright law , told deutsche welle .
" if he or she does not do that , they 're committing a crime , " he says .
aggravated assault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infecting someone with hiv during unprotected sex is a crime in germany the offense is classed as grievous bodily harm , or aggravated assault , because " an hiv infection is incurable and , when it leads to aids , is also lethal , " said damm .
it carries a sentence of six months to 10 years .
it is been more than two decades since the first person was convicted based on the 1988 ruling , some of them because they deliberately infected sexual partners , others were convicted because they were simply careless .
in june 2007 , for example , a 38-year-old man from the western city of cologne was sentenced to eight years in prison for deliberately passing on the hi virus to four women .
he even sent them text messages saying " have fun with hiv " .
the latest case was that of a decorator in the northern city of kiel in june 2010 , who was sentenced to five years in jail for infecting two women with hiv during unprotected sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is often hard to determine the source of the infection medical tests tricky it is not always easy , however , to prove who passed on the virus to a person .

" but there 's no absolute proof that would hold up in court .
these so-called phylogenetic tests ca n't ascertain the direction of the infection , " she explained .
proof is even harder to obtain , the more time passes from the time of the infection .
the virus mutates very quickly after the point of infection , making it harder to ascertain if it is related to the virus of the person who passed it on .
as a result , medical tests are not the only evidence used to reach a verdict .

" i think everyone should be responsible and take precautions , whether they have hiv or not " damm told deutsche welle .
" and if we apply that principle of responsibility to our criminal law , then people who have hiv would not necessarily have to declare their infection and would therefore no longer commit an offense , " he said .

but the law cracks down on those who risk infecting others . having unprotected sex with a partner who is not aware of his or her partner 's hiv infection , is a criminal offense in germany , but , medically , it is hard to trace the source of an infection .
a ruling in 1988 , which forced those infected with hiv to declare their condition to sexual partners , is the current legal basis for the trial of the former singer of the girl group no angels , nadja benaissa .
" at the moment , the law states that anyone who is infected must insist on using protection or inform his or her partner of the infection , " felix damm , a lawyer specializing in media and copyright law , told deutsche welle .
" if he or she does not do that , they 're committing a crime , " he says .
aggravated assault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infecting someone with hiv during unprotected sex is a crime in germany the offense is classed as grievous bodily harm , or aggravated assault , because " an hiv infection is incurable and , when it leads to aids , is also lethal , " said damm .
it carries a sentence of six months to 10 years .
it is been more than two decades since the first person was convicted based on the 1988 ruling , some of them because they deliberately infected sexual partners , others were convicted because they were simply careless .
in june 2007 , for example , a 38-year-old man from the western city of cologne was sentenced to eight years in prison for deliberately passing on the hi virus to four women .
he even sent them text messages saying " have fun with hiv " .
the latest case was that of a decorator in the northern city of kiel in june 2010 , who was sentenced to five years in jail for infecting two women with hiv during unprotected sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is often hard to determine the source of the infection medical tests tricky it is not always easy , however , to prove who passed on the virus to a person .
" you can do certain tests to find out if two viruses from two individual people are closely related , " claudia kuecherer from the robert-koch institute told deutsche welle .
" but there 's no absolute proof that would hold up in court .
these so-called phylogenetic tests ca n't ascertain the direction of the infection , " she explained .
proof is even harder to obtain , the more time passes from the time of the infection .
the virus mutates very quickly after the point of infection , making it harder to ascertain if it is related to the virus of the person who passed it on .
as a result , medical tests are not the only evidence used to reach a verdict .
taking responsibility over two decades have passed since the 1988 ruling and some believe it is time for a review of the law used in cases like that of benaissa , based on the fact that , these days , people are much more aware of hiv and should therefore , be in a position to act responsibly .
" i think everyone should be responsible and take precautions , whether they have hiv or not " damm told deutsche welle .
" and if we apply that principle of responsibility to our criminal law , then people who have hiv would not necessarily have to declare their infection and would therefore no longer commit an offense , " he said .

gm has given the green light for opel to export beyond its core european market . us carmaker gm has decided to allow opel to sell its cars in china , a move expected to lead to even greater competition among its brands in the huge chinese market .
" we will market opel as a european designed car in the premium segment , " company spokesman andreas kroemer told deutsche welle .
" there are a growing number of chinese who like european cars and have the money to afford them . "
opel tested the waters in china last year , selling around 4,000 cars , according to kroemer .
in the first half of 2010 , china passed the united states as gm 's biggest national market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 26.08.2010 german representatives face difficult routes through champions league großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern , bremen and schalke prepare to tackle europe 's elite three of the bundesliga 's top clubs are looking to make a big impression in the champions league this season .
in may , bayern munich came closer than any other german club since 2002 to winning the title . bayern - losing finalists against inter milan in may - are among the top seeds and were drawn thursday against as roma , fc basel and cfr cluj in group e of this season 's champions league competition .
the german champions qualified automatically after securing the bundesliga title and therefore avoided the likes of italian giants inter and ac milan , english premiership big-boys manchester united , chelsea and arsenal , spanish champions barcelona and perennial qualifiers lyon from france 's ligue 1 .
clubs from the same country can not not be drawn against each other in the group stage and for tv purposes are kept on opposite sides of the draw as far as possible , so bayern have also avoided playing one of their bundesliga rivals - at least for now .
bayern look to hit the ground running bayern have been slowly building a head of steam in this competition over the past few seasons and since louis van gaal took charge they 've been picking up speed .
from being a team seemingly predestined to get knocked out in the quarterfinals , bayern have quietly developed into a club ready to challenge for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are hoping for happier end to the 2011 competition however , they faltered badly in the early stages of the competition last season , almost crashing out at the group stage with only a heroic performance against juventus preventing them from slipping into the europa league .
but with every passing round , the bavarian giants had an unbeatable air about them .
they marched through against teams like manchester united and lyon with a strange certainty that they would reach the final and had many convinced that they could win it .
unfortunately , it was not to be .
this season , a strong showing against another italian team will be needed .
as roma ran inter milan close to the serie a title last season and will prove obstinate opposition for bayern , especially at the stadio olimpico .
the german champions should have the measure of the italians at home but bayern 's visit to rome could prove tricky .
there should n't be any problem for the germans against fc basel so qualification should be assured , regardless of which way the results go against roma and cluj . if bayern can avoid the pitfalls which almost cost them the chance of making the knockout phase last time and find their european groove earlier this season , then they 'll be a strong bet to repeat their run to the previous final and who knows - perhaps even win it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have yet to fulfill their champions league potential bremen hope to recapture barnstorming form werder bremen , recently qualified at the expense of sampdoria , return to the champions league after a couple of seasons away from europe ’ s premier club competition .
the impressive and dramatic performances by thomas schaaf 's side against their italian opposition in the qualifying round certainly suggests that bremen will be an entertaining addition to the group stages , but how will they fare against teams like reigning champions inter milan , dutch champions fc twente and tottenham hotspurs ?
bremen have never really worried the latter stages of the champions league despite consistently reaching the knockout rounds during their strong , mid-noughties period of bundesliga ascendance .
however , they ’ ve been off the boil for the latter part of the decade and have not managed to regain the consistency which saw them continually challenging for the bundesliga title and qualifying for the champions league .
it remains to be seen how inter milan play under new coach rafa benitez , but however the former liverpool coach chooses to line the european champions up , it 's still effectively the same team that won the trophy last season .
bremen will be in for a fight both at home and away .
they may fancy their chances against new boys tottenham hotspurs but the english premiership side looked far from over-awed in qualifying , so werder will have to draw on their experience to snuff out spurs ' enthusiasm over two games .
fc twente shocked the eredivisie last season under current wolfsburg coach steve mcclaren , so who 's to say they wo n't spring a surprise in the champions league ?
they 're unlikely to win it but they could cause bremen problems .
at best , werder could get through in second but it looks a tough group for the north germans .
schalke faces tough group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope magath and raul can plot a successful course schalke , the third team in the bundesliga trio , have a tricky group consisting of lyon , benfica and happoel tel aviv .
but while schalke teams in the past have been finding their way through european competition with little knowledgeable guidance , they have a hard-headed coach with experience of the business end of the european cup in felix magath .
a winner and runner-up with hamburg as a player , magath coached bayern in three champions league campaigns , reaching the quarterfinals in 2004/05 and the first knockout round the following year .
he also took bayern to the knockout round in the 2006/07 competition but was fired for poor bundesliga form before their quarterfinal defeat to ac milan .
magath also has the most prolific goal scorer in champions league history on his books in the form of raul .
the former real madrid talisman and captain has three champions league winner ’ s medals to his name as well as an unprecedented 66 strikes in the competition .
as a result schalke will be going into this season ’ s champions league with an experienced leader off the pitch and an experienced one on it .
lyon have been here so many times before that they treat the champions league as if it was an extension of their domestic competition .
but , as bayern found out last season , this sometimes works against them .
lyon may not be equipped to deal with both this season , and schalke will hope to get a victory against them either home or away .
benfica could be the wild card in the group .
the portuguese are renowned for swift counterattacking play and their style may be a little cavalier for the germans .
these games could be very hard for schalke .
but the germans should get the points they need to at least challenge for the second qualifying spot against hapoel tel aviv .

this week , journalists flocked around " the hoff " when , at a berlin press conference , he announced he would be giving major concerts in germany beginning in february 2011 .
his daughters , taylor ann and hayley amber , aka pop duo " bella vida , " are to accompany him on tour .
hasselhoff had already laid the groundwork for his musical comeback when he appeared on " musikantenstadl " - a popular german-swiss-austrian folk music production - this past spring .
this month , he 's traveling around germany promoting the upcoming tour .
discovering during a radio interview in july with german broadcaster swr1 that his german roots are not near kassel in the heart of the country , as he had thought , but in bremen further north , he endeared audiences in germany by claiming the news was " the best present " he 'd ever received .
the broadcaster had commissioned a german researcher to look into the american celebrity 's ancestry .
according to news agency afp , the singer had orginally intended to buy property in hasselhof , a town similarly written to the star 's last name and located near kassel .
making a splash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasselhoff -lrb- center back -rrb- was the hunk in the popular " baywatch " tv show during the berlin press conference on wednesday , however , " knight rider " and " baywatch " hunk hasselhoff revealed some of his darker side when he spoke openly about elements in his recent autobiography , " making waves . "
he said dealing with his alcoholism was a " daily struggle , " and was frank when he admitted that writing the autobiography was " like therapy . "
hasselhoff had reaped scorn when he appeared on mtv 's european music awards in berlin last year and slurred the words of his laudation .
an internet video also showed him trying to munch a hamburger while more than a little under the influence , news magazine stern noted .
the 58-year-old made a splash over 20 years ago in germany , recording an english-language cover version of the 1970 's german hit " auf der strasse nach sueden , " calling it " looking for freedom . "
it scaled the german charts quickly , just as a new tide of revolution began rolling through eastern europe , culminating in the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 .
hasselhoff helped east and west germans celebrate together on new year 's eve that year for the first time in decades when he sang his " looking for freedom " hit at the brandenburg gate .

the 28-year-old benaissa is a member of the popular girl band no angels . she discovered she was hiv positive in 1999 when she was three months pregnant .
she was arrested in april 2009 for having unprotected sex with three men in 2004 and 2006 and failing to inform them of her hiv status .
to do so can be classified as aggravated assault under german law .
both the state prosecutor peter liesenfeld and her defense had asked the courts for the suspended sentence in the trial , which ended on wednesday .
liesenfeld cited her confession and her expression of remorse as reasons for lighter sentence .
" i made a huge mistake , " benaissa said in an emotional apology during the closing arguments .
" i am sorry from the bottom of my heart , " she said . " i would love to turn back the clock , but i ca n't . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after discovering her hiv status , benaissa -lrb- right -rrb- found success with the girl band no angels almost certainly infected the man but the 34-year-old man she infected with hiv gave an angry testimony during the trial , saying she had caused " a lot of suffering in this world . "
because she and the man both have a strain of the virus that is relatively rare in germany , medical experts had determined the man had almost certainly been infected by benaissa .
she was also convicted of attempted aggravated assault for having unprotected sex with another man who did not contract the virus .
she said she was afraid that her career would be negatively impacted if it became public that she is hiv positive .
a return to the stage ?
instead of jail time , the pop star is expected to complete 300 hours of community service and attend regular counseling sessions .
no angels , which first formed in 2000 and got back together in 2007 after a brief break , are expected to restart their tour .
that tour was interrupted last year when benaissa was arrested just before performing in frankfurt .

in may , bayern munich came closer than any other german club since 2002 to winning the title . bayern - losing finalists against inter milan in may - are among the top seeds and were drawn thursday against as roma , fc basel and cfr cluj in group e of this season 's champions league competition .
the german champions qualified automatically after securing the bundesliga title and therefore avoided the likes of italian giants inter and ac milan , english premiership big-boys manchester united , chelsea and arsenal , spanish champions barcelona and perennial qualifiers lyon from france 's ligue 1 .
clubs from the same country can not not be drawn against each other in the group stage and for tv purposes are kept on opposite sides of the draw as far as possible , so bayern have also avoided playing one of their bundesliga rivals - at least for now .
bayern look to hit the ground running bayern have been slowly building a head of steam in this competition over the past few seasons and since louis van gaal took charge they 've been picking up speed .
from being a team seemingly predestined to get knocked out in the quarterfinals , bayern have quietly developed into a club ready to challenge for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are hoping for happier end to the 2011 competition however , they faltered badly in the early stages of the competition last season , almost crashing out at the group stage with only a heroic performance against juventus preventing them from slipping into the europa league .
but with every passing round , the bavarian giants had an unbeatable air about them .
they marched through against teams like manchester united and lyon with a strange certainty that they would reach the final and had many convinced that they could win it .
unfortunately , it was not to be .
this season , a strong showing against another italian team will be needed .
as roma ran inter milan close to the serie a title last season and will prove obstinate opposition for bayern , especially at the stadio olimpico .
the german champions should have the measure of the italians at home but bayern 's visit to rome could prove tricky .
there should n't be any problem for the germans against fc basel so qualification should be assured , regardless of which way the results go against roma and cluj . if bayern can avoid the pitfalls which almost cost them the chance of making the knockout phase last time and find their european groove earlier this season , then they 'll be a strong bet to repeat their run to the previous final and who knows - perhaps even win it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have yet to fulfill their champions league potential bremen hope to recapture barnstorming form werder bremen , recently qualified at the expense of sampdoria , return to the champions league after a couple of seasons away from europe ’ s premier club competition .
the impressive and dramatic performances by thomas schaaf 's side against their italian opposition in the qualifying round certainly suggests that bremen will be an entertaining addition to the group stages , but how will they fare against teams like reigning champions inter milan , dutch champions fc twente and tottenham hotspurs ?
bremen have never really worried the latter stages of the champions league despite consistently reaching the knockout rounds during their strong , mid-noughties period of bundesliga ascendance .
however , they ’ ve been off the boil for the latter part of the decade and have not managed to regain the consistency which saw them continually challenging for the bundesliga title and qualifying for the champions league .
it remains to be seen how inter milan play under new coach rafa benitez , but however the former liverpool coach chooses to line the european champions up , it 's still effectively the same team that won the trophy last season .
bremen will be in for a fight both at home and away .
they may fancy their chances against new boys tottenham hotspurs but the english premiership side looked far from over-awed in qualifying , so werder will have to draw on their experience to snuff out spurs ' enthusiasm over two games .
fc twente shocked the eredivisie last season under current wolfsburg coach steve mcclaren , so who 's to say they wo n't spring a surprise in the champions league ?
they 're unlikely to win it but they could cause bremen problems .
at best , werder could get through in second but it looks a tough group for the north germans .
schalke faces tough group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope magath and raul can plot a successful course schalke , the third team in the bundesliga trio , have a tricky group consisting of lyon , benfica and happoel tel aviv .
but while schalke teams in the past have been finding their way through european competition with little knowledgeable guidance , they have a hard-headed coach with experience of the business end of the european cup in felix magath .
a winner and runner-up with hamburg as a player , magath coached bayern in three champions league campaigns , reaching the quarterfinals in 2004/05 and the first knockout round the following year .
he also took bayern to the knockout round in the 2006/07 competition but was fired for poor bundesliga form before their quarterfinal defeat to ac milan .
magath also has the most prolific goal scorer in champions league history on his books in the form of raul .
the former real madrid talisman and captain has three champions league winner ’ s medals to his name as well as an unprecedented 66 strikes in the competition .
as a result schalke will be going into this season ’ s champions league with an experienced leader off the pitch and an experienced one on it .
lyon have been here so many times before that they treat the champions league as if it was an extension of their domestic competition .
but , as bayern found out last season , this sometimes works against them .
lyon may not be equipped to deal with both this season , and schalke will hope to get a victory against them either home or away .
benfica could be the wild card in the group .
the portuguese are renowned for swift counterattacking play and their style may be a little cavalier for the germans .
these games could be very hard for schalke .
but the germans should get the points they need to at least challenge for the second qualifying spot against hapoel tel aviv .

a winner and runner-up with hamburg as a player , magath coached bayern in three champions league campaigns , reaching the quarterfinals in 2004/05 and the first knockout round the following year .
he also took bayern to the knockout round in the 2006/07 competition but was fired for poor bundesliga form before their quarterfinal defeat to ac milan .
magath also has the most prolific goal scorer in champions league history on his books in the form of raul .
the former real madrid talisman and captain has three champions league winner ’ s medals to his name as well as an unprecedented 66 strikes in the competition .
as a result schalke will be going into this season ’ s champions league with an experienced leader off the pitch and an experienced one on it .
lyon have been here so many times before that they treat the champions league as if it was an extension of their domestic competition .
but , as bayern found out last season , this sometimes works against them .
lyon may not be equipped to deal with both this season , and schalke will hope to get a victory against them either home or away .
benfica could be the wild card in the group .
the portuguese are renowned for swift counterattacking play and their style may be a little cavalier for the germans .
these games could be very hard for schalke .
but the germans should get the points they need to at least challenge for the second qualifying spot against hapoel tel aviv .

the german champions qualified automatically after securing the bundesliga title and therefore avoided the likes of italian giants inter and ac milan , english premiership big-boys manchester united , chelsea and arsenal , spanish champions barcelona and perennial qualifiers lyon from france 's ligue 1 .
clubs from the same country can not not be drawn against each other in the group stage and for tv purposes are kept on opposite sides of the draw as far as possible , so bayern have also avoided playing one of their bundesliga rivals - at least for now .
bayern look to hit the ground running bayern have been slowly building a head of steam in this competition over the past few seasons and since louis van gaal took charge they 've been picking up speed .

the impressive and dramatic performances by thomas schaaf 's side against their italian opposition in the qualifying round certainly suggests that bremen will be an entertaining addition to the group stages , but how will they fare against teams like reigning champions inter milan , dutch champions fc twente and tottenham hotspurs ?
bremen have never really worried the latter stages of the champions league despite consistently reaching the knockout rounds during their strong , mid-noughties period of bundesliga ascendance .
however , they ’ ve been off the boil for the latter part of the decade and have not managed to regain the consistency which saw them continually challenging for the bundesliga title and qualifying for the champions league .

bremen will be in for a fight both at home and away .
they may fancy their chances against new boys tottenham hotspurs but the english premiership side looked far from over-awed in qualifying , so werder will have to draw on their experience to snuff out spurs ' enthusiasm over two games .
fc twente shocked the eredivisie last season under current wolfsburg coach steve mcclaren , so who 's to say they wo n't spring a surprise in the champions league ?

gm has given the green light for opel to export beyond its core european market . us carmaker gm has decided to allow opel to sell its cars in china , a move expected to lead to even greater competition among its brands in the huge chinese market .
" we will market opel as a european designed car in the premium segment , " company spokesman andreas kroemer told deutsche welle .
" there are a growing number of chinese who like european cars and have the money to afford them . "
opel tested the waters in china last year , selling around 4,000 cars , according to kroemer .
in the first half of 2010 , china passed the united states as gm 's biggest national market .
together with chevy and buick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has become the world 's largest market for new car sales kroemer declined to say which models opel plans to sell in china .
currently , gm markets its cadillac , chevrolet and buick brands in the country , in addition to vehicles manufactured by wuling , a chinese carmaker in which the us auto giant has a 30 percent stake .
until now , vehicles made by opel were only sold outside europe under gm 's buick nameplate .
in addition to china , opel will begin selling vehicles in australia and later in several other markets in the asia-pacific and south american regions , according to kroemer .
" this is great news for opel and i believe the company has good opportunities in the country , " said christoph stuermer , an auto analyst with ihs global insight in frankfurt .
export first , assemble locally later stuermer expects opel will initially export cars to china until it establishes a market position in the country .
but eventually , he said , the company will need to assemble cars locally to avoid import taxes , which can increase the price of vehicles by as much as 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm adds opel to its line of brands in china opel will compete with germany 's other big carmakers , bmw , daimler and volkswagen , which have been operating in china for some time .
china has become the world 's biggest auto market based on the number of new vehicles sold .
automakers around the world are looking to the country to drive revenue amid weak global demand .
but growth has dropped since last year when the government boosted demand with tax cuts and subsidies .
in recent months , chinese auto sales have declined steadily , falling from 19.4 percent in june to 17.2 percent in july , according to the china automotive technology and research center .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have yet to fulfill their champions league potential bremen hope to recapture barnstorming form werder bremen , recently qualified at the expense of sampdoria , return to the champions league after a couple of seasons away from europe ’ s premier club competition .
the impressive and dramatic performances by thomas schaaf 's side against their italian opposition in the qualifying round certainly suggests that bremen will be an entertaining addition to the group stages , but how will they fare against teams like reigning champions inter milan , dutch champions fc twente and tottenham hotspurs ?
bremen have never really worried the latter stages of the champions league despite consistently reaching the knockout rounds during their strong , mid-noughties period of bundesliga ascendance .
however , they ’ ve been off the boil for the latter part of the decade and have not managed to regain the consistency which saw them continually challenging for the bundesliga title and qualifying for the champions league .
it remains to be seen how inter milan play under new coach rafa benitez , but however the former liverpool coach chooses to line the european champions up , it 's still effectively the same team that won the trophy last season .
bremen will be in for a fight both at home and away .
they may fancy their chances against new boys tottenham hotspurs but the english premiership side looked far from over-awed in qualifying , so werder will have to draw on their experience to snuff out spurs ' enthusiasm over two games .
fc twente shocked the eredivisie last season under current wolfsburg coach steve mcclaren , so who 's to say they wo n't spring a surprise in the champions league ?
they 're unlikely to win it but they could cause bremen problems .
at best , werder could get through in second but it looks a tough group for the north germans .
schalke faces tough group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope magath and raul can plot a successful course schalke , the third team in the bundesliga trio , have a tricky group consisting of lyon , benfica and happoel tel aviv .
but while schalke teams in the past have been finding their way through european competition with little knowledgeable guidance , they have a hard-headed coach with experience of the business end of the european cup in felix magath .
a winner and runner-up with hamburg as a player , magath coached bayern in three champions league campaigns , reaching the quarterfinals in 2004/05 and the first knockout round the following year .
he also took bayern to the knockout round in the 2006/07 competition but was fired for poor bundesliga form before their quarterfinal defeat to ac milan .
magath also has the most prolific goal scorer in champions league history on his books in the form of raul .
the former real madrid talisman and captain has three champions league winner ’ s medals to his name as well as an unprecedented 66 strikes in the competition .
as a result schalke will be going into this season ’ s champions league with an experienced leader off the pitch and an experienced one on it .
lyon have been here so many times before that they treat the champions league as if it was an extension of their domestic competition .
but , as bayern found out last season , this sometimes works against them .
lyon may not be equipped to deal with both this season , and schalke will hope to get a victory against them either home or away .
benfica could be the wild card in the group .
the portuguese are renowned for swift counterattacking play and their style may be a little cavalier for the germans .
these games could be very hard for schalke .
but the germans should get the points they need to at least challenge for the second qualifying spot against hapoel tel aviv .

the 28-year-old benaissa is a member of the popular girl band no angels . she discovered she was hiv positive in 1999 when she was three months pregnant .
she was arrested in april 2009 for having unprotected sex with three men in 2004 and 2006 and failing to inform them of her hiv status .
to do so can be classified as aggravated assault under german law .
both the state prosecutor peter liesenfeld and her defense had asked the courts for the suspended sentence in the trial , which ended on wednesday .
liesenfeld cited her confession and her expression of remorse as reasons for lighter sentence .
" i made a huge mistake , " benaissa said in an emotional apology during the closing arguments .
" i am sorry from the bottom of my heart , " she said . " i would love to turn back the clock , but i ca n't . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after discovering her hiv status , benaissa -lrb- right -rrb- found success with the girl band no angels almost certainly infected the man but the 34-year-old man she infected with hiv gave an angry testimony during the trial , saying she had caused " a lot of suffering in this world . "
because she and the man both have a strain of the virus that is relatively rare in germany , medical experts had determined the man had almost certainly been infected by benaissa .
she was also convicted of attempted aggravated assault for having unprotected sex with another man who did not contract the virus .
she said she was afraid that her career would be negatively impacted if it became public that she is hiv positive .
a return to the stage ?
instead of jail time , the pop star is expected to complete 300 hours of community service and attend regular counseling sessions .
no angels , which first formed in 2000 and got back together in 2007 after a brief break , are expected to restart their tour .
that tour was interrupted last year when benaissa was arrested just before performing in frankfurt .

gm has given the green light for opel to export beyond its core european market . us carmaker gm has decided to allow opel to sell its cars in china , a move expected to lead to even greater competition among its brands in the huge chinese market .
" we will market opel as a european designed car in the premium segment , " company spokesman andreas kroemer told deutsche welle .
" there are a growing number of chinese who like european cars and have the money to afford them . "
opel tested the waters in china last year , selling around 4,000 cars , according to kroemer .
in the first half of 2010 , china passed the united states as gm 's biggest national market .
together with chevy and buick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has become the world 's largest market for new car sales kroemer declined to say which models opel plans to sell in china .
currently , gm markets its cadillac , chevrolet and buick brands in the country , in addition to vehicles manufactured by wuling , a chinese carmaker in which the us auto giant has a 30 percent stake .
until now , vehicles made by opel were only sold outside europe under gm 's buick nameplate .
in addition to china , opel will begin selling vehicles in australia and later in several other markets in the asia-pacific and south american regions , according to kroemer .
" this is great news for opel and i believe the company has good opportunities in the country , " said christoph stuermer , an auto analyst with ihs global insight in frankfurt .
export first , assemble locally later stuermer expects opel will initially export cars to china until it establishes a market position in the country .
but eventually , he said , the company will need to assemble cars locally to avoid import taxes , which can increase the price of vehicles by as much as 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm adds opel to its line of brands in china opel will compete with germany 's other big carmakers , bmw , daimler and volkswagen , which have been operating in china for some time .
china has become the world 's biggest auto market based on the number of new vehicles sold .
automakers around the world are looking to the country to drive revenue amid weak global demand .
but growth has dropped since last year when the government boosted demand with tax cuts and subsidies .
in recent months , chinese auto sales have declined steadily , falling from 19.4 percent in june to 17.2 percent in july , according to the china automotive technology and research center .

the coral triangle , which stretches across the seas of malaysia , indonesia , papua new guinea , the philippines , the solomon islands and timor-leste is particularly at risk . tiomen island , the perhentian islands and pulao payar off the malaysian coast have all been affected by the bleaching of the corals .
once extremely popular sites for divers , they have now been closed off indefinitely to give the corals space and time to recover . rising sea temperatures is one of the causes behind the bleaching of the corals .
when the corals die , only their chalkstone structure remains . coral reefs susceptible to bleaching coral reefs are expected to become even more susceptible to bleaching in the next 30 years . scientists and environmentalists fear that the coral triangle could disappear within a century .
" if we travel down that road in which we do n't take action against climate change to the level that we should , we see a world in which 50 years from now in which coral reefs are a remnant of what they are today , in fact they may be actually functionally extinct , " says ove hoegh-guldberg from the university of queensland .

moreover , the coral reefs are the habitat for millions of fish and other species providing livelihood to millions of residents along the shores of the coral triangle . ove hoegh-guldberg says the death of the coral reefs could be catastrophic , " by the end of the century under the worst case scenario we could see as much as 90 percent of those food resources as having eroded .
you start to see that you 're now destabilizing human communities through the fact that there 's just not enough food .

gm has given the green light for opel to export beyond its core european market . us carmaker gm has decided to allow opel to sell its cars in china , a move expected to lead to even greater competition among its brands in the huge chinese market .
" we will market opel as a european designed car in the premium segment , " company spokesman andreas kroemer told deutsche welle .
" there are a growing number of chinese who like european cars and have the money to afford them . "
opel tested the waters in china last year , selling around 4,000 cars , according to kroemer .
in the first half of 2010 , china passed the united states as gm 's biggest national market .
together with chevy and buick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has become the world 's largest market for new car sales kroemer declined to say which models opel plans to sell in china .
currently , gm markets its cadillac , chevrolet and buick brands in the country , in addition to vehicles manufactured by wuling , a chinese carmaker in which the us auto giant has a 30 percent stake .
until now , vehicles made by opel were only sold outside europe under gm 's buick nameplate .
in addition to china , opel will begin selling vehicles in australia and later in several other markets in the asia-pacific and south american regions , according to kroemer .
" this is great news for opel and i believe the company has good opportunities in the country , " said christoph stuermer , an auto analyst with ihs global insight in frankfurt .
export first , assemble locally later stuermer expects opel will initially export cars to china until it establishes a market position in the country .
but eventually , he said , the company will need to assemble cars locally to avoid import taxes , which can increase the price of vehicles by as much as 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm adds opel to its line of brands in china opel will compete with germany 's other big carmakers , bmw , daimler and volkswagen , which have been operating in china for some time .
china has become the world 's biggest auto market based on the number of new vehicles sold .
automakers around the world are looking to the country to drive revenue amid weak global demand .
but growth has dropped since last year when the government boosted demand with tax cuts and subsidies .
in recent months , chinese auto sales have declined steadily , falling from 19.4 percent in june to 17.2 percent in july , according to the china automotive technology and research center .

the 28-year-old benaissa is a member of the popular girl band no angels . she discovered she was hiv positive in 1999 when she was three months pregnant .
she was arrested in april 2009 for having unprotected sex with three men in 2004 and 2006 and failing to inform them of her hiv status .
to do so can be classified as aggravated assault under german law .
both the state prosecutor peter liesenfeld and her defense had asked the courts for the suspended sentence in the trial , which ended on wednesday .
liesenfeld cited her confession and her expression of remorse as reasons for lighter sentence .
" i made a huge mistake , " benaissa said in an emotional apology during the closing arguments .
" i am sorry from the bottom of my heart , " she said . " i would love to turn back the clock , but i ca n't . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after discovering her hiv status , benaissa -lrb- right -rrb- found success with the girl band no angels almost certainly infected the man but the 34-year-old man she infected with hiv gave an angry testimony during the trial , saying she had caused " a lot of suffering in this world . "
because she and the man both have a strain of the virus that is relatively rare in germany , medical experts had determined the man had almost certainly been infected by benaissa .
she was also convicted of attempted aggravated assault for having unprotected sex with another man who did not contract the virus .
she said she was afraid that her career would be negatively impacted if it became public that she is hiv positive .
a return to the stage ?
instead of jail time , the pop star is expected to complete 300 hours of community service and attend regular counseling sessions .
no angels , which first formed in 2000 and got back together in 2007 after a brief break , are expected to restart their tour .
that tour was interrupted last year when benaissa was arrested just before performing in frankfurt .

but the law cracks down on those who risk infecting others . having unprotected sex with a partner who is not aware of his or her partner 's hiv infection , is a criminal offense in germany , but , medically , it is hard to trace the source of an infection .
a ruling in 1988 , which forced those infected with hiv to declare their condition to sexual partners , is the current legal basis for the trial of the former singer of the girl group no angels , nadja benaissa .
" at the moment , the law states that anyone who is infected must insist on using protection or inform his or her partner of the infection , " felix damm , a lawyer specializing in media and copyright law , told deutsche welle .
" if he or she does not do that , they 're committing a crime , " he says .
aggravated assault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infecting someone with hiv during unprotected sex is a crime in germany the offense is classed as grievous bodily harm , or aggravated assault , because " an hiv infection is incurable and , when it leads to aids , is also lethal , " said damm .
it carries a sentence of six months to 10 years .
it is been more than two decades since the first person was convicted based on the 1988 ruling , some of them because they deliberately infected sexual partners , others were convicted because they were simply careless .
in june 2007 , for example , a 38-year-old man from the western city of cologne was sentenced to eight years in prison for deliberately passing on the hi virus to four women .

" i think everyone should be responsible and take precautions , whether they have hiv or not " damm told deutsche welle .

but the law cracks down on those who risk infecting others . having unprotected sex with a partner who is not aware of his or her partner 's hiv infection , is a criminal offense in germany , but , medically , it is hard to trace the source of an infection .
a ruling in 1988 , which forced those infected with hiv to declare their condition to sexual partners , is the current legal basis for the trial of the former singer of the girl group no angels , nadja benaissa .
" at the moment , the law states that anyone who is infected must insist on using protection or inform his or her partner of the infection , " felix damm , a lawyer specializing in media and copyright law , told deutsche welle .
" if he or she does not do that , they 're committing a crime , " he says .
aggravated assault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infecting someone with hiv during unprotected sex is a crime in germany the offense is classed as grievous bodily harm , or aggravated assault , because " an hiv infection is incurable and , when it leads to aids , is also lethal , " said damm .
it carries a sentence of six months to 10 years .
it is been more than two decades since the first person was convicted based on the 1988 ruling , some of them because they deliberately infected sexual partners , others were convicted because they were simply careless .
in june 2007 , for example , a 38-year-old man from the western city of cologne was sentenced to eight years in prison for deliberately passing on the hi virus to four women .
he even sent them text messages saying " have fun with hiv " .
the latest case was that of a decorator in the northern city of kiel in june 2010 , who was sentenced to five years in jail for infecting two women with hiv during unprotected sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is often hard to determine the source of the infection medical tests tricky it is not always easy , however , to prove who passed on the virus to a person .
" you can do certain tests to find out if two viruses from two individual people are closely related , " claudia kuecherer from the robert-koch institute told deutsche welle .
" but there 's no absolute proof that would hold up in court .
these so-called phylogenetic tests ca n't ascertain the direction of the infection , " she explained .
proof is even harder to obtain , the more time passes from the time of the infection .
the virus mutates very quickly after the point of infection , making it harder to ascertain if it is related to the virus of the person who passed it on .
as a result , medical tests are not the only evidence used to reach a verdict .
taking responsibility over two decades have passed since the 1988 ruling and some believe it is time for a review of the law used in cases like that of benaissa , based on the fact that , these days , people are much more aware of hiv and should therefore , be in a position to act responsibly .
" i think everyone should be responsible and take precautions , whether they have hiv or not " damm told deutsche welle .
" and if we apply that principle of responsibility to our criminal law , then people who have hiv would not necessarily have to declare their infection and would therefore no longer commit an offense , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 26.08.2010 iceman likely laid to rest , study suggests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was oetzi given a burial ceremony ?
when the corpse of a 5,000-year-old human was uncovered nearly 20 years ago , archaeologists assumed the iceman 's death was anything but ceremonious .
researchers now think oetzi may have received a proper alpine burial . a study released on thursday suggests that oetzi , a human specimen found in the alps of south tyrol nearly two decades ago , was not " frozen in time and place " following his death five millennia ago .
a team of italian and american researchers now believe the iceman actually received a proper burial ceremony atop a mountain pass , months after his death .
oetzi was initially discovered in 1991 at the tisenjoch alpine pass along the border between austria and italy .
researchers theorized that the iceman died of a battle-related arrow wound to the shoulder .
it followed that oetzi 's personal belongings were frozen with him after his death in the upper reaches of the alps .
yet according to a new study published today in the journal antiquity , those conclusions were not based on detailed mapping of the grave site . a team of archaeologists , anthropologists and geo-specialists used spatial analysis to pinpoint the distribution of the man 's belongings and the corpse itself - leading them to propose that his body was ceremoniously placed on elevated rock , some five meters -lrb- about 16 feet -rrb- away from his eventual discovery site . " we concluded that he died in april , and in april the pass was probably full of snow , " said alessandro vanzetti , an archaeologist at the la sapienza university of rome and one of the study 's authors .
" he could n't have died on the spot , furthermore , he did n't die on this stone , as had been reported . "
botanical evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers have not reached consensus on the circumstances of oetzi 's death the team analyzed pollen ingested by oetzi before his death and compared it with pollen found in the ice surrounding him , noting a " mismatch " between his death in april - which the team suspected occurred at a lower altitude - and his possible burial in august or september .
researchers concluded that the iceman died in a different location , and that his body was recovered .
" we think he was kept in some kind of cellar , " vanzetti told deutsche welle .
citing regional historical knowledge , the study noted that in oetzi 's day , the dead were customarily placed in farmsteads called " masi " before the winter snow and ice melted .
" it was used by people in tyrol during the cold seasons , " he said .
" when one was dead , it was impossible to bury immediately , because the ground was frozen . "
" he was a very important person , so people decided to bury him on the pass , " vanzetti added .
luca bondioli , co-author of the paper and an anthropologist with at the national museum of prehistory and ethnology in italy , described oetzi as " an individual of the elite . "
" the fact that we have a new interpretation of the discovery is important , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the study noted that previous oetzi research was based on the initial interpretation of the iceman find and his belongings as " frozen in time and place . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say the iceman died from an arrow wound to the shoulder distribution data but the team 's findings suggested that the iceman 's personal effects were carefully placed near his body during a burial ceremony , not simply scattered around him as he lay dying .
" there is a strong indication that the distribution can be explained by gravity and movement in the ice , " vanzetti said .
the archaeologist and his colleagues proposed that oetzi and his grave goods were placed on an area of raised natural stone .
later on , according to the study , " cyclical thawing and freezing " caused the corpse and the burial items to shift .
the distribution was likely variable : lighter objects , such as hair and oetzi 's quiver , did not move in the same way as more weighty items , such as fur , leather and the body itself .
lingering questions yet not all researchers in the field are prepared to accept the burial theory .
albert zink , who was involved in efforts to map oetzi 's dna and serves as head of the institute for mummies and the iceman , said the team 's conclusion was " not very convincing . "
" there there are several things which i think are clearly in contrast to a burial , " he told deutsche welle , citing the unusual placement of the bow , which had been stood upright , as well as the random distribution of oetzi 's belongings .
moreover , the iceman was found with his right arm in a vertical position that zink said would have been corrected before a burial . nevertheless , the new theory speaks to certain missing links in the iceman story - including why oetzi was found with unfinished weaponry .
it could also explain why personal effects were discovered near his body , considering the likelihood that his attackers would confiscate the belongings of a felled opponent .

the 28-year-old benaissa is a member of the popular girl band no angels . she discovered she was hiv positive in 1999 when she was three months pregnant .
she was arrested in april 2009 for having unprotected sex with three men in 2004 and 2006 and failing to inform them of her hiv status .
to do so can be classified as aggravated assault under german law .
both the state prosecutor peter liesenfeld and her defense had asked the courts for the suspended sentence in the trial , which ended on wednesday .

"
because she and the man both have a strain of the virus that is relatively rare in germany , medical experts had determined the man had almost certainly been infected by benaissa .
she was also convicted of attempted aggravated assault for having unprotected sex with another man who did not contract the virus .
she said she was afraid that her career would be negatively impacted if it became public that she is hiv positive .
a return to the stage ?
instead of jail time , the pop star is expected to complete 300 hours of community service and attend regular counseling sessions .
no angels , which first formed in 2000 and got back together in 2007 after a brief break , are expected to restart their tour .
that tour was interrupted last year when benaissa was arrested just before performing in frankfurt .

when the corpse of a 5,000-year-old human was uncovered nearly 20 years ago , archaeologists assumed the iceman 's death was anything but ceremonious .
researchers now think oetzi may have received a proper alpine burial . a study released on thursday suggests that oetzi , a human specimen found in the alps of south tyrol nearly two decades ago , was not " frozen in time and place " following his death five millennia ago .
a team of italian and american researchers now believe the iceman actually received a proper burial ceremony atop a mountain pass , months after his death .
oetzi was initially discovered in 1991 at the tisenjoch alpine pass along the border between austria and italy .
researchers theorized that the iceman died of a battle-related arrow wound to the shoulder .
it followed that oetzi 's personal belongings were frozen with him after his death in the upper reaches of the alps .
yet according to a new study published today in the journal antiquity , those conclusions were not based on detailed mapping of the grave site . a team of archaeologists , anthropologists and geo-specialists used spatial analysis to pinpoint the distribution of the man 's belongings and the corpse itself - leading them to propose that his body was ceremoniously placed on elevated rock , some five meters -lrb- about 16 feet -rrb- away from his eventual discovery site . " we concluded that he died in april , and in april the pass was probably full of snow , " said alessandro vanzetti , an archaeologist at the la sapienza university of rome and one of the study 's authors .
" he could n't have died on the spot , furthermore , he did n't die on this stone , as had been reported . "
botanical evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers have not reached consensus on the circumstances of oetzi 's death the team analyzed pollen ingested by oetzi before his death and compared it with pollen found in the ice surrounding him , noting a " mismatch " between his death in april - which the team suspected occurred at a lower altitude - and his possible burial in august or september .
researchers concluded that the iceman died in a different location , and that his body was recovered .
" we think he was kept in some kind of cellar , " vanzetti told deutsche welle .
citing regional historical knowledge , the study noted that in oetzi 's day , the dead were customarily placed in farmsteads called " masi " before the winter snow and ice melted .
" it was used by people in tyrol during the cold seasons , " he said .
" when one was dead , it was impossible to bury immediately , because the ground was frozen . "
" he was a very important person , so people decided to bury him on the pass , " vanzetti added .
luca bondioli , co-author of the paper and an anthropologist with at the national museum of prehistory and ethnology in italy , described oetzi as " an individual of the elite . "
" the fact that we have a new interpretation of the discovery is important , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the study noted that previous oetzi research was based on the initial interpretation of the iceman find and his belongings as " frozen in time and place . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say the iceman died from an arrow wound to the shoulder distribution data but the team 's findings suggested that the iceman 's personal effects were carefully placed near his body during a burial ceremony , not simply scattered around him as he lay dying .
" there is a strong indication that the distribution can be explained by gravity and movement in the ice , " vanzetti said .
the archaeologist and his colleagues proposed that oetzi and his grave goods were placed on an area of raised natural stone .
later on , according to the study , " cyclical thawing and freezing " caused the corpse and the burial items to shift .
the distribution was likely variable : lighter objects , such as hair and oetzi 's quiver , did not move in the same way as more weighty items , such as fur , leather and the body itself .
lingering questions yet not all researchers in the field are prepared to accept the burial theory .
albert zink , who was involved in efforts to map oetzi 's dna and serves as head of the institute for mummies and the iceman , said the team 's conclusion was " not very convincing . "
" there there are several things which i think are clearly in contrast to a burial , " he told deutsche welle , citing the unusual placement of the bow , which had been stood upright , as well as the random distribution of oetzi 's belongings .
moreover , the iceman was found with his right arm in a vertical position that zink said would have been corrected before a burial . nevertheless , the new theory speaks to certain missing links in the iceman story - including why oetzi was found with unfinished weaponry .
it could also explain why personal effects were discovered near his body , considering the likelihood that his attackers would confiscate the belongings of a felled opponent . " ultimately , " the study read , " the impressive array of other objects is better explained as grave furnishings than as mountain equipment .

audiences are mainly germans who enjoy the challenge . the english theatre berlin is the german capital 's only exclusively english-language theater .
oddly enough , the theater 's founder and artistic director , is german . guenther grosser - not from berlin , but from bavaria - studied acting in new york in the late 1980s .
with the fall of the berlin wall , he saw a chance to establish an english-language theater in the german capital . " when the wall came down we all realized -lsb- that -rsb- this is really becoming an international capital , and there are so many people moving to berlin from all over the world , " said grosser .
" so i think the english-language theater is a must in this town . " celebrating two decades this year , the english theatre berlin plays a strong , if modest role on the city 's vast theater scene .
since german reunification , berlin has become one of europe 's hippest meccas for artistic creativity and , according to grosser , this development has had a direct and dramatic affect on his theater . " -lsb- many -rsb- more young theater-makers are in berlin now than ever before , " he said .
" it is much easier for us now to choose from a large crowd of actors - and we 're talking about professional native-speaking english language actors living in town . " having a bigger pool of actors means a greater diversity of ideas , approaches and aesthetics . love is universal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the theater 's founder guenther grosser was inspired by his time in new york in this summer 's production of lovepuke , a play about the trials and tribulations of love , sex and communication in modern relationships , amy hye plays the role of the femme fatale , louise .
originally from new zealand , hye recently moved to berlin after spending six years in madrid . she 's one of berlin 's many new arrivals , attracted by the city 's creative mystique and promise of cheap living . " in madrid , we were working really fast-paced comedy shows , one-hour shows back-to-back , " she said .
" the level of english was n't so good - whereas here , i think you can perform more in a traditional theater sense , because the level of english is better . " lovepuke is directed by fingal pollack , a 28-year-old aspiring director from new zealand who came to berlin two years ago for a four-day visit - and never left .
what keeps her here -lrb- besides her boyfriend -rrb- is the city 's fertile creative soil and the opportunities at the english theatre berlin . " this is the second big play i 've directed in berlin , so it 's a beginning for me , " explained pollack .
" there 's so much opportunity , and it 's easy to do your thing here .
there 's space and there 's time to be able to find out what you really want to do , and what you 're good at , as well . " for love of theater to finance her love for directing serious plays , pollack does what she can to stay afloat , working in children 's theater , teaching english and taking on translation projects .
while there 's still a lot of support for young theater-makers in new zealand , fingal prefers the artistic possibilities that berlin 's eclectic english-language theater scene has to offer . " new zealand has a very good theater scene , but because berlin is such a mixing pot of different cultures , i think it is a far richer choice , " said pollack , adding that she had 50 strong actors audition for lovepuke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lovepuke looks at the challenges of modern relationships while there is a good supply of english-speaking actors in the german capital , the audiences remain largely german .
at a recent performance of lovepuke , some 70 percent of the spectators were german - theater buffs who come for the love of art , and the challenge of consuming it in a foreign language . not yet in the big leagues the english theatre berlin may be a well-established institution , but in the fringe theater scene .
crossing over into mainstream does n't seem feasible . " i find there is not a stepping stone system in place between fringe theater and mainstream theater , " said pollack .
" i do n't know how i would get into mainstream theater in berlin , but i know in new zealand : the big people come and see the little shows . " old traditions like the strict separation of fringe and mainstream theater die hard in germany , even in a city as progressive as berlin .
however , with the city evolving into an evermore culturally-cutting edge metropolis , the english theatre berlin could one day grow to such an extent that it becomes mainstream itself . author : leah mcdonnell / kjb editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the extremely good news on the economic development and continued positive reports on the labour market have led to robust consumer sentiment in august , " the gfk report said .

the increase was largely due to germany 's higher-than-expected growth in gross domestic product during the second quarter , the gfk said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 26.08.2010 german representatives face difficult routes through champions league großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern , bremen and schalke prepare to tackle europe 's elite three of the bundesliga 's top clubs are looking to make a big impression in the champions league this season .
in may , bayern munich came closer than any other german club since 2002 to winning the title . bayern - losing finalists against inter milan in may - are among the top seeds and were drawn thursday against as roma , fc basel and cfr cluj in group e of this season 's champions league competition .
the german champions qualified automatically after securing the bundesliga title and therefore avoided the likes of italian giants inter and ac milan , english premiership big-boys manchester united , chelsea and arsenal , spanish champions barcelona and perennial qualifiers lyon from france 's ligue 1 .
clubs from the same country can not not be drawn against each other in the group stage and for tv purposes are kept on opposite sides of the draw as far as possible , so bayern have also avoided playing one of their bundesliga rivals - at least for now .
bayern look to hit the ground running bayern have been slowly building a head of steam in this competition over the past few seasons and since louis van gaal took charge they 've been picking up speed .
from being a team seemingly predestined to get knocked out in the quarterfinals , bayern have quietly developed into a club ready to challenge for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are hoping for happier end to the 2011 competition however , they faltered badly in the early stages of the competition last season , almost crashing out at the group stage with only a heroic performance against juventus preventing them from slipping into the europa league .
but with every passing round , the bavarian giants had an unbeatable air about them .
they marched through against teams like manchester united and lyon with a strange certainty that they would reach the final and had many convinced that they could win it .
unfortunately , it was not to be .
this season , a strong showing against another italian team will be needed .
as roma ran inter milan close to the serie a title last season and will prove obstinate opposition for bayern , especially at the stadio olimpico .
the german champions should have the measure of the italians at home but bayern 's visit to rome could prove tricky .
there should n't be any problem for the germans against fc basel so qualification should be assured , regardless of which way the results go against roma and cluj . if bayern can avoid the pitfalls which almost cost them the chance of making the knockout phase last time and find their european groove earlier this season , then they 'll be a strong bet to repeat their run to the previous final and who knows - perhaps even win it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have yet to fulfill their champions league potential bremen hope to recapture barnstorming form werder bremen , recently qualified at the expense of sampdoria , return to the champions league after a couple of seasons away from europe ’ s premier club competition .
the impressive and dramatic performances by thomas schaaf 's side against their italian opposition in the qualifying round certainly suggests that bremen will be an entertaining addition to the group stages , but how will they fare against teams like reigning champions inter milan , dutch champions fc twente and tottenham hotspurs ?
bremen have never really worried the latter stages of the champions league despite consistently reaching the knockout rounds during their strong , mid-noughties period of bundesliga ascendance .
however , they ’ ve been off the boil for the latter part of the decade and have not managed to regain the consistency which saw them continually challenging for the bundesliga title and qualifying for the champions league .
it remains to be seen how inter milan play under new coach rafa benitez , but however the former liverpool coach chooses to line the european champions up , it 's still effectively the same team that won the trophy last season .
bremen will be in for a fight both at home and away .
they may fancy their chances against new boys tottenham hotspurs but the english premiership side looked far from over-awed in qualifying , so werder will have to draw on their experience to snuff out spurs ' enthusiasm over two games .
fc twente shocked the eredivisie last season under current wolfsburg coach steve mcclaren , so who 's to say they wo n't spring a surprise in the champions league ?
they 're unlikely to win it but they could cause bremen problems .
at best , werder could get through in second but it looks a tough group for the north germans .
schalke faces tough group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope magath and raul can plot a successful course schalke , the third team in the bundesliga trio , have a tricky group consisting of lyon , benfica and happoel tel aviv .
but while schalke teams in the past have been finding their way through european competition with little knowledgeable guidance , they have a hard-headed coach with experience of the business end of the european cup in felix magath .
a winner and runner-up with hamburg as a player , magath coached bayern in three champions league campaigns , reaching the quarterfinals in 2004/05 and the first knockout round the following year .
he also took bayern to the knockout round in the 2006/07 competition but was fired for poor bundesliga form before their quarterfinal defeat to ac milan .
magath also has the most prolific goal scorer in champions league history on his books in the form of raul .
the former real madrid talisman and captain has three champions league winner ’ s medals to his name as well as an unprecedented 66 strikes in the competition .
as a result schalke will be going into this season ’ s champions league with an experienced leader off the pitch and an experienced one on it .
lyon have been here so many times before that they treat the champions league as if it was an extension of their domestic competition .
but , as bayern found out last season , this sometimes works against them .
lyon may not be equipped to deal with both this season , and schalke will hope to get a victory against them either home or away .
benfica could be the wild card in the group .
the portuguese are renowned for swift counterattacking play and their style may be a little cavalier for the germans .
these games could be very hard for schalke .
but the germans should get the points they need to at least challenge for the second qualifying spot against hapoel tel aviv .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 26.08.2010 prolonging nuclear power may stymie investment into renewables großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants were turned off for most of 2009 a new report has outlined why ending the use of nuclear energy matters for the development of renewable energy infrastructure .
its sponsors say the nuclear power fight is post-war germany 's largest-ever economic dispute . in the midst of an ongoing debate over whether to extend the lifespan of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , a new report has revealed that the continued availability of nuclear power would likely cause a decrease in investment into renewable energies .
increases in wind and solar energy capacities will eventually lead to nuclear power plants being used less , the report states .
the reason : energy from renewable sources enjoys legal priority over nuclear and coal power .
it is fed into the grid before electricity from non-renewable sources .
as the capacity of electricity from wind or solar sources increases , conventional electricity sources will only be needed to fill in gaps when there is a lack of wind or sun .
but it takes about 50 hours to restart a nuclear power plant that has been completely shut down , meaning it would be necessary to keep the plant running at 50 or 60 percent capacity .
gas powered turbines , however , can be turned on within 20 minutes and can also be run on biogas .
other possibilities to bridge fluctuations in renewable electricity output include the decentralized approach of using micro-power stations or accessing the batteries of electric cars .
companies likely to fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conventional power might only be needed when the wind is n't blowing germany 's four largest energy companies - e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw - will do everything in their power to avoid losing billions on their investments into nuclear power , the report assumes .
supposing the lifespans of the power plant are increased by 28 years , energy companies will have to come to terms with turning them off some 15,800 times between 2020 and the date when the last plant is shut down .
that would cost them between 21 and 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 26.7 billion to $ 101.7 billion -rrb- , unless they successfully lobby to overturn the priority that electricity from renewable sources enjoys and pushed for the construction of those sources to be capped .
gero lucking , of the renewable energy company lichtblick , which sponsored the study , described the dilemma as the " largest post-war economic dispute " in germany .
olav hohmeyer , professor of economics and energy and environmental management at the university of flensburg , authored the study .
according to hohmeyer , electricity needs can entirely be met through renewable energy sources by 2050 .
nuclear power plant lifespans will not need to be extended , nor will there be an electricity deficit to be covered by new coal-fired power plants .
" nuclear power plants are not flexible enough to safely react to changing weather conditions and compensate for fluctuations in wind and sunshine , " hohmeyer said .
hohmeyer 's report states the last nuclear power plant can be removed from the grid in 2023 and the last coal-fired power plant in 2046 .
extending the lifespans of nuclear power plants by 40 years in germany - as has been proposed by the government - would damage vital investment interests and set back the switch to renewable energy by decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased renewable energy could curb the need for nuclear energy monopoly-like structures florian noto of the german nature conservancy represents a group of 21 environmental organizations banded together against nuclear energy .
he said an already-permitted nuclear power plant can generate inexpensive electricity for energy companies , when nuclear waste , risk-based costs and insurance are not taken into account .
" a newly-constructed eco-power plant ca n't necessarily keep up , " he told deutsche welle .
" if the old nuclear power plants just keep running , then progress wo n't be made and little will be invested -lsb- … -rsb- it would actually lead to an investment bottleneck . "
noto also pointed out that four of the 17 nuclear power plants in germany were out of commission for more than 10 months during 2009 , and that at times as many as eight of them were out of commission .
a more diverse and decentralized energy market could lead to lower electricity prices for consumers , according to noto .
" the fact is these companies are actually too dominant , and an economic counterweight needs to be created .
if more new energy companies join this market - if the market is expanded - then that will lead to these monopolistic structures going away , " he said .
electricity from renewable sources will become less expensive in comparison to conventionally generated electricity as prices of raw materials rise , the report states .
by 2050 its additional monthly price compared to conventionally generated electricity could be between just three and 17 euros for an average household using 3,000 kilowatt hours .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.08.2010 dw experts try their luck again with forecasts for bundesliga round 2 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a trip to the repair shop , the dw crystal ball returns this season , deutsche welle 's sports team are laying it on the line and predicting the results of all the bundesliga matches .
after a less than successful start , see what we predict for the second round . it 's round 2 of the 2010/11 bundesliga season and the dw experts are hoping to do a little better than last week when only one game was predicted correctly .
the crystal ball was obviously on the fritz -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- . the opening weekend of the season is always a lottery for forecasters because there is very little of the season 's form book to refer to so with a little more to go on , we hope to have more success with the next round of games . friday , august 27 kaiserslautern – bayern munich bayern looked boringly comfortable for long stretches against wolfsburg in their opening day win but finished the match with the margin a lot closer than it should have been .
kaiserslautern had a somewhat easier game against cologne and performed well , scoring three goals away from home .
bayern showed class and strength in front of their own supporters but these qualities will be tested on the road .
i can see the champions experiencing a slight , early blip in kaiserslautern . prediction : 2-2 saturday , august 28 schalke – hanover schalke blinked first in their match in hamburg last week and as a result lost to one of the teams which could rival them in the race for european places this season .
it 's early yet and the defeat wo n't end schalke 's challenge , but coach felix magath will be upset to have conceded points to one of the top teams already .
expect the royal blues to respond to magath 's wrath by soundly beating hanover in gelsenkirchen with raul marking his bundesliga home debut with at least one goal . prediction : schalke 3-1 bremen – cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen are back to winning ways .
bad news for cologne few would have expected bremen to be on the end of the kind of score line they normally inflict on the opposition .
losing 4-1 to hoffenheim was the worst possible start for thomas schaaf 's team .
luckily they had a confidence-restoring win in europe during the week to get their heads straight again and with qualification for the champions league group stages assured , werder can focus on climbing back up the bundesliga table .
they will begin their climb with victory over cologne who already look like relegation fodder after capitulating at home to kaiserslautern . prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg – mainz steve mcclaren 's wolves looked disjointed against bayern , but did manage 20 minutes of supreme offensive fotball - enough to give the champions a scare .
however , they looked far from cohesive at the back and even against mainz in their first home game of the season , wolfsburg may still not find the right gear .
mainz produced a good display to heap early woe on stuttgart , a team which finished strongly last season .
i think they 'll worry wolfsburg and grab a goal but the wolves will snatch a draw . prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg hit-man ruud hopes to be on target again reports that ruud van nistlerooy 's legs have gone appear to have been wildly exaggerated .
the dutch striker looked all the better for missing out on world cup action this summer , and as a result hamburg should get at least a good half-season out him before the inevitable wear and tear takes its toll .
frankfurt were unlucky to lose 2-1 to hanover last week and i can see them having a harder time against hsv , especially if ruud is still in the same mood as he was against schalke .
hamburg did n't travel well last season , dropping crucial points away from home , but still i think they 'll edge this one . prediction : hamburg 1-0 nuremberg – freiburg freiburg are going to struggle this season as their opening day defeat to st. pauli indicated . losing 3-1 at home to a newly-promoted side does not bode well for a team which has a long-standing relationship with the lower reaches of the bundesliga .
games like the one coming up against nuremberg need to be won if this is not to be a long fight against relegation for freiburg but i do n't see them getting the full quota of points this week .
the best freiburg can hope for is a draw - but i think they 'll get it . prediction : 1-1 st. pauli – hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will give st. pauli more problems than freiburg st. pauli will be flying after their victory over freiburg but they are in danger of crashing to earth against hoffenheim .
they may have their special supporters behind them on saturday but the gulf in class is likely to be too big for pauli .
one forgets that hoffenheim were once the village team made good , such is their standing in the top division now .
st. pauli might appear to be lambs to the slaughter in the wake of hoffenheim 's giving bremen a hiding , but i think the men from the rhine-neckar will have a harder job in hamburg .
that 's not to say they wo n't still win , though . prediction : hoffenheim 2-0 leverkusen - moenchengladbach bayer leverkusen have started in much the same way as they began last season - and by beating dortmund 2-0 away from home , michael ballack and co. have laid down a marker .
dortmund were tough to beat last year and can be expected to be difficult opponents this season , a fact that adds even more gloss to leverkusen 's win .
ballack 's boys will be too much for gladbach who just scraped a draw with nuremberg last week . prediction : leverkusen 3-1 sunday , august 29 stuttgart – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart boss christian gross hopes for something to clap both teams expected more from their opening games in which both were defeated , and both will be eager to put those false starts behind them .
however , stuttgart and dortmund both saw europa league action on thursday and could be running on fumes as they seek full fitness in the early season . whatever happens , these two sides will give whatever they 've got .
i see dortmund edging stuttgart through sheer power . prediction : dortmund 2-1 last week 's result : 5 points bayern – wolfsburg 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:1 , one point -rrb- hoffenheim – bremen 4:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:2 , one point -rrb- moenchengladbach – nuremberg 1:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , no points -rrb- cologne – kaiserslautern 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- freiburg – st. pauli 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- hanover – frankfurt 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , no points -rrb- hamburg – schalke 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , three points -rrb- mainz – stuttgart 2:0 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , no points -rrb- dortmund – leverkusen 0:2 -lrb- dw prediction 2:2 , no points -rrb- three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 26.08.2010 german representatives face difficult routes through champions league großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern , bremen and schalke prepare to tackle europe 's elite three of the bundesliga 's top clubs are looking to make a big impression in the champions league this season .
in may , bayern munich came closer than any other german club since 2002 to winning the title . bayern - losing finalists against inter milan in may - are among the top seeds and were drawn thursday against as roma , fc basel and cfr cluj in group e of this season 's champions league competition .
the german champions qualified automatically after securing the bundesliga title and therefore avoided the likes of italian giants inter and ac milan , english premiership big-boys manchester united , chelsea and arsenal , spanish champions barcelona and perennial qualifiers lyon from france 's ligue 1 .
clubs from the same country can not not be drawn against each other in the group stage and for tv purposes are kept on opposite sides of the draw as far as possible , so bayern have also avoided playing one of their bundesliga rivals - at least for now .
bayern look to hit the ground running bayern have been slowly building a head of steam in this competition over the past few seasons and since louis van gaal took charge they 've been picking up speed .
from being a team seemingly predestined to get knocked out in the quarterfinals , bayern have quietly developed into a club ready to challenge for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are hoping for happier end to the 2011 competition however , they faltered badly in the early stages of the competition last season , almost crashing out at the group stage with only a heroic performance against juventus preventing them from slipping into the europa league .
but with every passing round , the bavarian giants had an unbeatable air about them .
they marched through against teams like manchester united and lyon with a strange certainty that they would reach the final and had many convinced that they could win it .
unfortunately , it was not to be .
this season , a strong showing against another italian team will be needed .
as roma ran inter milan close to the serie a title last season and will prove obstinate opposition for bayern , especially at the stadio olimpico .
the german champions should have the measure of the italians at home but bayern 's visit to rome could prove tricky .
there should n't be any problem for the germans against fc basel so qualification should be assured , regardless of which way the results go against roma and cluj . if bayern can avoid the pitfalls which almost cost them the chance of making the knockout phase last time and find their european groove earlier this season , then they 'll be a strong bet to repeat their run to the previous final and who knows - perhaps even win it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have yet to fulfill their champions league potential bremen hope to recapture barnstorming form werder bremen , recently qualified at the expense of sampdoria , return to the champions league after a couple of seasons away from europe ’ s premier club competition .
the impressive and dramatic performances by thomas schaaf 's side against their italian opposition in the qualifying round certainly suggests that bremen will be an entertaining addition to the group stages , but how will they fare against teams like reigning champions inter milan , dutch champions fc twente and tottenham hotspurs ?
bremen have never really worried the latter stages of the champions league despite consistently reaching the knockout rounds during their strong , mid-noughties period of bundesliga ascendance .
however , they ’ ve been off the boil for the latter part of the decade and have not managed to regain the consistency which saw them continually challenging for the bundesliga title and qualifying for the champions league .
it remains to be seen how inter milan play under new coach rafa benitez , but however the former liverpool coach chooses to line the european champions up , it 's still effectively the same team that won the trophy last season .
bremen will be in for a fight both at home and away .
they may fancy their chances against new boys tottenham hotspurs but the english premiership side looked far from over-awed in qualifying , so werder will have to draw on their experience to snuff out spurs ' enthusiasm over two games .
fc twente shocked the eredivisie last season under current wolfsburg coach steve mcclaren , so who 's to say they wo n't spring a surprise in the champions league ?
they 're unlikely to win it but they could cause bremen problems .
at best , werder could get through in second but it looks a tough group for the north germans .
schalke faces tough group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope magath and raul can plot a successful course schalke , the third team in the bundesliga trio , have a tricky group consisting of lyon , benfica and happoel tel aviv .
but while schalke teams in the past have been finding their way through european competition with little knowledgeable guidance , they have a hard-headed coach with experience of the business end of the european cup in felix magath .
a winner and runner-up with hamburg as a player , magath coached bayern in three champions league campaigns , reaching the quarterfinals in 2004/05 and the first knockout round the following year .
he also took bayern to the knockout round in the 2006/07 competition but was fired for poor bundesliga form before their quarterfinal defeat to ac milan .
magath also has the most prolific goal scorer in champions league history on his books in the form of raul .
the former real madrid talisman and captain has three champions league winner ’ s medals to his name as well as an unprecedented 66 strikes in the competition .
as a result schalke will be going into this season ’ s champions league with an experienced leader off the pitch and an experienced one on it .
lyon have been here so many times before that they treat the champions league as if it was an extension of their domestic competition .
but , as bayern found out last season , this sometimes works against them .
lyon may not be equipped to deal with both this season , and schalke will hope to get a victory against them either home or away .
benfica could be the wild card in the group .
the portuguese are renowned for swift counterattacking play and their style may be a little cavalier for the germans .
these games could be very hard for schalke .
but the germans should get the points they need to at least challenge for the second qualifying spot against hapoel tel aviv .

on thursday several demonstrators climbed onto a roof , temporarily stopping the demolition . police in stuttgart say that work to raze part of the city 's old aboveground train station was stopped for several hours on thursday when seven people occupied part of the building 's roof .
the protestors were then removed and arrested by special police forces .
other demonstrators blocked train platforms , causing a high-speed tgv train to paris to be delayed by about an hour .
construction workers began the demolition of the north wing of the stuttgart train station under police protection on wednesday , as thousands continued to demonstrate against the renovation project .
activists claimed 12,000 people had participated in the protests , while police put the number at 6,000 .
up to 50,000 demonstrators are anticipated on friday .

the police president in stuttgart , siegfried stumpf , said wednesday 's protests had " lost their peaceful character . "
" this has moved way beyond understandable protests and civil disobedience , " he said , saying firefighters and rescue workers had been harassed and that groups blockading streets had thrown bottles .
a spokesman for the park protectors group , which opposes the project , denied any violence and said that " the politicians , through the police , are trying to criminalize us . "
the " stuttgart 21 " construction project is to link the city with one of europe 's longest high-speed rail lines by converting it from a terminus , which forces trains to pull in and out , to an underground through-station that trains can pass through .
supporters say the project will cut down travel times , create jobs and attract investors , but opponents say its estimated cost of seven billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- is too high .
environmentalists say the current plan is not necessary and that its effect on rail traffic would be limited .

gm has given the green light for opel to export beyond its core european market . us carmaker gm has decided to allow opel to sell its cars in china , a move expected to lead to even greater competition among its brands in the huge chinese market .
" we will market opel as a european designed car in the premium segment , " company spokesman andreas kroemer told deutsche welle .
" there are a growing number of chinese who like european cars and have the money to afford them . "
opel tested the waters in china last year , selling around 4,000 cars , according to kroemer .
in the first half of 2010 , china passed the united states as gm 's biggest national market .
together with chevy and buick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has become the world 's largest market for new car sales kroemer declined to say which models opel plans to sell in china .
currently , gm markets its cadillac , chevrolet and buick brands in the country , in addition to vehicles manufactured by wuling , a chinese carmaker in which the us auto giant has a 30 percent stake .
until now , vehicles made by opel were only sold outside europe under gm 's buick nameplate .
in addition to china , opel will begin selling vehicles in australia and later in several other markets in the asia-pacific and south american regions , according to kroemer .
" this is great news for opel and i believe the company has good opportunities in the country , " said christoph stuermer , an auto analyst with ihs global insight in frankfurt .
export first , assemble locally later stuermer expects opel will initially export cars to china until it establishes a market position in the country .
but eventually , he said , the company will need to assemble cars locally to avoid import taxes , which can increase the price of vehicles by as much as 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm adds opel to its line of brands in china opel will compete with germany 's other big carmakers , bmw , daimler and volkswagen , which have been operating in china for some time .
china has become the world 's biggest auto market based on the number of new vehicles sold .
automakers around the world are looking to the country to drive revenue amid weak global demand .
but growth has dropped since last year when the government boosted demand with tax cuts and subsidies .
in recent months , chinese auto sales have declined steadily , falling from 19.4 percent in june to 17.2 percent in july , according to the china automotive technology and research center .

when the corpse of a 5,000-year-old human was uncovered nearly 20 years ago , archaeologists assumed the iceman 's death was anything but ceremonious .
researchers now think oetzi may have received a proper alpine burial . a study released on thursday suggests that oetzi , a human specimen found in the alps of south tyrol nearly two decades ago , was not " frozen in time and place " following his death five millennia ago .
a team of italian and american researchers now believe the iceman actually received a proper burial ceremony atop a mountain pass , months after his death .
oetzi was initially discovered in 1991 at the tisenjoch alpine pass along the border between austria and italy .
researchers theorized that the iceman died of a battle-related arrow wound to the shoulder .
it followed that oetzi 's personal belongings were frozen with him after his death in the upper reaches of the alps .
yet according to a new study published today in the journal antiquity , those conclusions were not based on detailed mapping of the grave site . a team of archaeologists , anthropologists and geo-specialists used spatial analysis to pinpoint the distribution of the man 's belongings and the corpse itself - leading them to propose that his body was ceremoniously placed on elevated rock , some five meters -lrb- about 16 feet -rrb- away from his eventual discovery site . " we concluded that he died in april , and in april the pass was probably full of snow , " said alessandro vanzetti , an archaeologist at the la sapienza university of rome and one of the study 's authors .
" he could n't have died on the spot , furthermore , he did n't die on this stone , as had been reported . "
botanical evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers have not reached consensus on the circumstances of oetzi 's death the team analyzed pollen ingested by oetzi before his death and compared it with pollen found in the ice surrounding him , noting a " mismatch " between his death in april - which the team suspected occurred at a lower altitude - and his possible burial in august or september .
researchers concluded that the iceman died in a different location , and that his body was recovered .
" we think he was kept in some kind of cellar , " vanzetti told deutsche welle .
citing regional historical knowledge , the study noted that in oetzi 's day , the dead were customarily placed in farmsteads called " masi " before the winter snow and ice melted .
" it was used by people in tyrol during the cold seasons , " he said .
" when one was dead , it was impossible to bury immediately , because the ground was frozen . "
" he was a very important person , so people decided to bury him on the pass , " vanzetti added .
luca bondioli , co-author of the paper and an anthropologist with at the national museum of prehistory and ethnology in italy , described oetzi as " an individual of the elite . "
" the fact that we have a new interpretation of the discovery is important , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the study noted that previous oetzi research was based on the initial interpretation of the iceman find and his belongings as " frozen in time and place . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say the iceman died from an arrow wound to the shoulder distribution data but the team 's findings suggested that the iceman 's personal effects were carefully placed near his body during a burial ceremony , not simply scattered around him as he lay dying .
" there is a strong indication that the distribution can be explained by gravity and movement in the ice , " vanzetti said .
the archaeologist and his colleagues proposed that oetzi and his grave goods were placed on an area of raised natural stone .
later on , according to the study , " cyclical thawing and freezing " caused the corpse and the burial items to shift .
the distribution was likely variable : lighter objects , such as hair and oetzi 's quiver , did not move in the same way as more weighty items , such as fur , leather and the body itself .
lingering questions yet not all researchers in the field are prepared to accept the burial theory .
albert zink , who was involved in efforts to map oetzi 's dna and serves as head of the institute for mummies and the iceman , said the team 's conclusion was " not very convincing . "
" there there are several things which i think are clearly in contrast to a burial , " he told deutsche welle , citing the unusual placement of the bow , which had been stood upright , as well as the random distribution of oetzi 's belongings .
moreover , the iceman was found with his right arm in a vertical position that zink said would have been corrected before a burial . nevertheless , the new theory speaks to certain missing links in the iceman story - including why oetzi was found with unfinished weaponry .
it could also explain why personal effects were discovered near his body , considering the likelihood that his attackers would confiscate the belongings of a felled opponent . " ultimately , " the study read , " the impressive array of other objects is better explained as grave furnishings than as mountain equipment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 26.08.2010 prolonging nuclear power may stymie investment into renewables großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants were turned off for most of 2009 a new report has outlined why ending the use of nuclear energy matters for the development of renewable energy infrastructure .
its sponsors say the nuclear power fight is post-war germany 's largest-ever economic dispute . in the midst of an ongoing debate over whether to extend the lifespan of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , a new report has revealed that the continued availability of nuclear power would likely cause a decrease in investment into renewable energies .
increases in wind and solar energy capacities will eventually lead to nuclear power plants being used less , the report states .
the reason : energy from renewable sources enjoys legal priority over nuclear and coal power .
it is fed into the grid before electricity from non-renewable sources .
as the capacity of electricity from wind or solar sources increases , conventional electricity sources will only be needed to fill in gaps when there is a lack of wind or sun .
but it takes about 50 hours to restart a nuclear power plant that has been completely shut down , meaning it would be necessary to keep the plant running at 50 or 60 percent capacity .
gas powered turbines , however , can be turned on within 20 minutes and can also be run on biogas .
other possibilities to bridge fluctuations in renewable electricity output include the decentralized approach of using micro-power stations or accessing the batteries of electric cars .
companies likely to fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conventional power might only be needed when the wind is n't blowing germany 's four largest energy companies - e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw - will do everything in their power to avoid losing billions on their investments into nuclear power , the report assumes .
supposing the lifespans of the power plant are increased by 28 years , energy companies will have to come to terms with turning them off some 15,800 times between 2020 and the date when the last plant is shut down .
that would cost them between 21 and 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 26.7 billion to $ 101.7 billion -rrb- , unless they successfully lobby to overturn the priority that electricity from renewable sources enjoys and pushed for the construction of those sources to be capped .
gero lucking , of the renewable energy company lichtblick , which sponsored the study , described the dilemma as the " largest post-war economic dispute " in germany .
olav hohmeyer , professor of economics and energy and environmental management at the university of flensburg , authored the study .
according to hohmeyer , electricity needs can entirely be met through renewable energy sources by 2050 .
nuclear power plant lifespans will not need to be extended , nor will there be an electricity deficit to be covered by new coal-fired power plants .
" nuclear power plants are not flexible enough to safely react to changing weather conditions and compensate for fluctuations in wind and sunshine , " hohmeyer said .
hohmeyer 's report states the last nuclear power plant can be removed from the grid in 2023 and the last coal-fired power plant in 2046 .
extending the lifespans of nuclear power plants by 40 years in germany - as has been proposed by the government - would damage vital investment interests and set back the switch to renewable energy by decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased renewable energy could curb the need for nuclear energy monopoly-like structures florian noto of the german nature conservancy represents a group of 21 environmental organizations banded together against nuclear energy .
he said an already-permitted nuclear power plant can generate inexpensive electricity for energy companies , when nuclear waste , risk-based costs and insurance are not taken into account .
" a newly-constructed eco-power plant ca n't necessarily keep up , " he told deutsche welle .
" if the old nuclear power plants just keep running , then progress wo n't be made and little will be invested -lsb- … -rsb- it would actually lead to an investment bottleneck . "
noto also pointed out that four of the 17 nuclear power plants in germany were out of commission for more than 10 months during 2009 , and that at times as many as eight of them were out of commission .
a more diverse and decentralized energy market could lead to lower electricity prices for consumers , according to noto .
" the fact is these companies are actually too dominant , and an economic counterweight needs to be created .
if more new energy companies join this market - if the market is expanded - then that will lead to these monopolistic structures going away , " he said .
electricity from renewable sources will become less expensive in comparison to conventionally generated electricity as prices of raw materials rise , the report states .
by 2050 its additional monthly price compared to conventionally generated electricity could be between just three and 17 euros for an average household using 3,000 kilowatt hours .

when the corpse of a 5,000-year-old human was uncovered nearly 20 years ago , archaeologists assumed the iceman 's death was anything but ceremonious .
researchers now think oetzi may have received a proper alpine burial . a study released on thursday suggests that oetzi , a human specimen found in the alps of south tyrol nearly two decades ago , was not " frozen in time and place " following his death five millennia ago .
a team of italian and american researchers now believe the iceman actually received a proper burial ceremony atop a mountain pass , months after his death .
oetzi was initially discovered in 1991 at the tisenjoch alpine pass along the border between austria and italy .
researchers theorized that the iceman died of a battle-related arrow wound to the shoulder .
it followed that oetzi 's personal belongings were frozen with him after his death in the upper reaches of the alps .
yet according to a new study published today in the journal antiquity , those conclusions were not based on detailed mapping of the grave site . a team of archaeologists , anthropologists and geo-specialists used spatial analysis to pinpoint the distribution of the man 's belongings and the corpse itself - leading them to propose that his body was ceremoniously placed on elevated rock , some five meters -lrb- about 16 feet -rrb- away from his eventual discovery site . " we concluded that he died in april , and in april the pass was probably full of snow , " said alessandro vanzetti , an archaeologist at the la sapienza university of rome and one of the study 's authors .
" he could n't have died on the spot , furthermore , he did n't die on this stone , as had been reported . "
botanical evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers have not reached consensus on the circumstances of oetzi 's death the team analyzed pollen ingested by oetzi before his death and compared it with pollen found in the ice surrounding him , noting a " mismatch " between his death in april - which the team suspected occurred at a lower altitude - and his possible burial in august or september .
researchers concluded that the iceman died in a different location , and that his body was recovered .
" we think he was kept in some kind of cellar , " vanzetti told deutsche welle .
citing regional historical knowledge , the study noted that in oetzi 's day , the dead were customarily placed in farmsteads called " masi " before the winter snow and ice melted .
" it was used by people in tyrol during the cold seasons , " he said .
" when one was dead , it was impossible to bury immediately , because the ground was frozen . "
" he was a very important person , so people decided to bury him on the pass , " vanzetti added .
luca bondioli , co-author of the paper and an anthropologist with at the national museum of prehistory and ethnology in italy , described oetzi as " an individual of the elite . "
" the fact that we have a new interpretation of the discovery is important , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the study noted that previous oetzi research was based on the initial interpretation of the iceman find and his belongings as " frozen in time and place . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say the iceman died from an arrow wound to the shoulder distribution data but the team 's findings suggested that the iceman 's personal effects were carefully placed near his body during a burial ceremony , not simply scattered around him as he lay dying .
" there is a strong indication that the distribution can be explained by gravity and movement in the ice , " vanzetti said .
the archaeologist and his colleagues proposed that oetzi and his grave goods were placed on an area of raised natural stone .
later on , according to the study , " cyclical thawing and freezing " caused the corpse and the burial items to shift .
the distribution was likely variable : lighter objects , such as hair and oetzi 's quiver , did not move in the same way as more weighty items , such as fur , leather and the body itself .
lingering questions yet not all researchers in the field are prepared to accept the burial theory .
albert zink , who was involved in efforts to map oetzi 's dna and serves as head of the institute for mummies and the iceman , said the team 's conclusion was " not very convincing . "
" there there are several things which i think are clearly in contrast to a burial , " he told deutsche welle , citing the unusual placement of the bow , which had been stood upright , as well as the random distribution of oetzi 's belongings .
moreover , the iceman was found with his right arm in a vertical position that zink said would have been corrected before a burial . nevertheless , the new theory speaks to certain missing links in the iceman story - including why oetzi was found with unfinished weaponry .
it could also explain why personal effects were discovered near his body , considering the likelihood that his attackers would confiscate the belongings of a felled opponent . " ultimately , " the study read , " the impressive array of other objects is better explained as grave furnishings than as mountain equipment .

audiences are mainly germans who enjoy the challenge . the english theatre berlin is the german capital 's only exclusively english-language theater .
oddly enough , the theater 's founder and artistic director , is german . guenther grosser - not from berlin , but from bavaria - studied acting in new york in the late 1980s .
with the fall of the berlin wall , he saw a chance to establish an english-language theater in the german capital . " when the wall came down we all realized -lsb- that -rsb- this is really becoming an international capital , and there are so many people moving to berlin from all over the world , " said grosser .
" so i think the english-language theater is a must in this town . " celebrating two decades this year , the english theatre berlin plays a strong , if modest role on the city 's vast theater scene .
since german reunification , berlin has become one of europe 's hippest meccas for artistic creativity and , according to grosser , this development has had a direct and dramatic affect on his theater . " -lsb- many -rsb- more young theater-makers are in berlin now than ever before , " he said .
" it is much easier for us now to choose from a large crowd of actors - and we 're talking about professional native-speaking english language actors living in town . " having a bigger pool of actors means a greater diversity of ideas , approaches and aesthetics . love is universal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the theater 's founder guenther grosser was inspired by his time in new york in this summer 's production of lovepuke , a play about the trials and tribulations of love , sex and communication in modern relationships , amy hye plays the role of the femme fatale , louise .
originally from new zealand , hye recently moved to berlin after spending six years in madrid . she 's one of berlin 's many new arrivals , attracted by the city 's creative mystique and promise of cheap living . " in madrid , we were working really fast-paced comedy shows , one-hour shows back-to-back , " she said .
" the level of english was n't so good - whereas here , i think you can perform more in a traditional theater sense , because the level of english is better . " lovepuke is directed by fingal pollack , a 28-year-old aspiring director from new zealand who came to berlin two years ago for a four-day visit - and never left .
what keeps her here -lrb- besides her boyfriend -rrb- is the city 's fertile creative soil and the opportunities at the english theatre berlin . " this is the second big play i 've directed in berlin , so it 's a beginning for me , " explained pollack .
" there 's so much opportunity , and it 's easy to do your thing here .
there 's space and there 's time to be able to find out what you really want to do , and what you 're good at , as well . " for love of theater to finance her love for directing serious plays , pollack does what she can to stay afloat , working in children 's theater , teaching english and taking on translation projects .
while there 's still a lot of support for young theater-makers in new zealand , fingal prefers the artistic possibilities that berlin 's eclectic english-language theater scene has to offer . " new zealand has a very good theater scene , but because berlin is such a mixing pot of different cultures , i think it is a far richer choice , " said pollack , adding that she had 50 strong actors audition for lovepuke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lovepuke looks at the challenges of modern relationships while there is a good supply of english-speaking actors in the german capital , the audiences remain largely german .
at a recent performance of lovepuke , some 70 percent of the spectators were german - theater buffs who come for the love of art , and the challenge of consuming it in a foreign language . not yet in the big leagues the english theatre berlin may be a well-established institution , but in the fringe theater scene .
crossing over into mainstream does n't seem feasible . " i find there is not a stepping stone system in place between fringe theater and mainstream theater , " said pollack .
" i do n't know how i would get into mainstream theater in berlin , but i know in new zealand : the big people come and see the little shows . " old traditions like the strict separation of fringe and mainstream theater die hard in germany , even in a city as progressive as berlin .
however , with the city evolving into an evermore culturally-cutting edge metropolis , the english theatre berlin could one day grow to such an extent that it becomes mainstream itself . author : leah mcdonnell / kjb editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 26.08.2010 prolonging nuclear power may stymie investment into renewables großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants were turned off for most of 2009 a new report has outlined why ending the use of nuclear energy matters for the development of renewable energy infrastructure .
its sponsors say the nuclear power fight is post-war germany 's largest-ever economic dispute . in the midst of an ongoing debate over whether to extend the lifespan of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , a new report has revealed that the continued availability of nuclear power would likely cause a decrease in investment into renewable energies .
increases in wind and solar energy capacities will eventually lead to nuclear power plants being used less , the report states .
the reason : energy from renewable sources enjoys legal priority over nuclear and coal power .
it is fed into the grid before electricity from non-renewable sources .
as the capacity of electricity from wind or solar sources increases , conventional electricity sources will only be needed to fill in gaps when there is a lack of wind or sun .
but it takes about 50 hours to restart a nuclear power plant that has been completely shut down , meaning it would be necessary to keep the plant running at 50 or 60 percent capacity .
gas powered turbines , however , can be turned on within 20 minutes and can also be run on biogas .
other possibilities to bridge fluctuations in renewable electricity output include the decentralized approach of using micro-power stations or accessing the batteries of electric cars .
companies likely to fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conventional power might only be needed when the wind is n't blowing germany 's four largest energy companies - e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw - will do everything in their power to avoid losing billions on their investments into nuclear power , the report assumes .
supposing the lifespans of the power plant are increased by 28 years , energy companies will have to come to terms with turning them off some 15,800 times between 2020 and the date when the last plant is shut down .
that would cost them between 21 and 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 26.7 billion to $ 101.7 billion -rrb- , unless they successfully lobby to overturn the priority that electricity from renewable sources enjoys and pushed for the construction of those sources to be capped .
gero lucking , of the renewable energy company lichtblick , which sponsored the study , described the dilemma as the " largest post-war economic dispute " in germany .
olav hohmeyer , professor of economics and energy and environmental management at the university of flensburg , authored the study .
according to hohmeyer , electricity needs can entirely be met through renewable energy sources by 2050 .
nuclear power plant lifespans will not need to be extended , nor will there be an electricity deficit to be covered by new coal-fired power plants .
" nuclear power plants are not flexible enough to safely react to changing weather conditions and compensate for fluctuations in wind and sunshine , " hohmeyer said .
hohmeyer 's report states the last nuclear power plant can be removed from the grid in 2023 and the last coal-fired power plant in 2046 .
extending the lifespans of nuclear power plants by 40 years in germany - as has been proposed by the government - would damage vital investment interests and set back the switch to renewable energy by decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased renewable energy could curb the need for nuclear energy monopoly-like structures florian noto of the german nature conservancy represents a group of 21 environmental organizations banded together against nuclear energy .
he said an already-permitted nuclear power plant can generate inexpensive electricity for energy companies , when nuclear waste , risk-based costs and insurance are not taken into account .
" a newly-constructed eco-power plant ca n't necessarily keep up , " he told deutsche welle .
" if the old nuclear power plants just keep running , then progress wo n't be made and little will be invested -lsb- … -rsb- it would actually lead to an investment bottleneck . "
noto also pointed out that four of the 17 nuclear power plants in germany were out of commission for more than 10 months during 2009 , and that at times as many as eight of them were out of commission .
a more diverse and decentralized energy market could lead to lower electricity prices for consumers , according to noto .
" the fact is these companies are actually too dominant , and an economic counterweight needs to be created .
if more new energy companies join this market - if the market is expanded - then that will lead to these monopolistic structures going away , " he said .
electricity from renewable sources will become less expensive in comparison to conventionally generated electricity as prices of raw materials rise , the report states .
by 2050 its additional monthly price compared to conventionally generated electricity could be between just three and 17 euros for an average household using 3,000 kilowatt hours .

" so i think the english-language theater is a must in this town . " celebrating two decades this year , the english theatre berlin plays a strong , if modest role on the city 's vast theater scene .
since german reunification , berlin has become one of europe 's hippest meccas for artistic creativity and , according to grosser , this development has had a direct and dramatic affect on his theater . " -lsb- many -rsb- more young theater-makers are in berlin now than ever before , " he said .
" it is much easier for us now to choose from a large crowd of actors - and we 're talking about professional native-speaking english language actors living in town . " having a bigger pool of actors means a greater diversity of ideas , approaches and aesthetics . love is universal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the theater 's founder guenther grosser was inspired by his time in new york in this summer 's production of lovepuke , a play about the trials and tribulations of love , sex and communication in modern relationships , amy hye plays the role of the femme fatale , louise .
originally from new zealand , hye recently moved to berlin after spending six years in madrid . she 's one of berlin 's many new arrivals , attracted by the city 's creative mystique and promise of cheap living . " in madrid , we were working really fast-paced comedy shows , one-hour shows back-to-back , " she said .
" the level of english was n't so good - whereas here , i think you can perform more in a traditional theater sense , because the level of english is better . " lovepuke is directed by fingal pollack , a 28-year-old aspiring director from new zealand who came to berlin two years ago for a four-day visit - and never left .
what keeps her here -lrb- besides her boyfriend -rrb- is the city 's fertile creative soil and the opportunities at the english theatre berlin . " this is the second big play i 've directed in berlin , so it 's a beginning for me , " explained pollack .
" there 's so much opportunity , and it 's easy to do your thing here .
there 's space and there 's time to be able to find out what you really want to do , and what you 're good at , as well . " for love of theater to finance her love for directing serious plays , pollack does what she can to stay afloat , working in children 's theater , teaching english and taking on translation projects .
while there 's still a lot of support for young theater-makers in new zealand , fingal prefers the artistic possibilities that berlin 's eclectic english-language theater scene has to offer . " new zealand has a very good theater scene , but because berlin is such a mixing pot of different cultures , i think it is a far richer choice , " said pollack , adding that she had 50 strong actors audition for lovepuke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lovepuke looks at the challenges of modern relationships while there is a good supply of english-speaking actors in the german capital , the audiences remain largely german .
at a recent performance of lovepuke , some 70 percent of the spectators were german - theater buffs who come for the love of art , and the challenge of consuming it in a foreign language . not yet in the big leagues the english theatre berlin may be a well-established institution , but in the fringe theater scene .
crossing over into mainstream does n't seem feasible . " i find there is not a stepping stone system in place between fringe theater and mainstream theater , " said pollack .
" i do n't know how i would get into mainstream theater in berlin , but i know in new zealand : the big people come and see the little shows . " old traditions like the strict separation of fringe and mainstream theater die hard in germany , even in a city as progressive as berlin .
however , with the city evolving into an evermore culturally-cutting edge metropolis , the english theatre berlin could one day grow to such an extent that it becomes mainstream itself . author : leah mcdonnell / kjb editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.08.2010 dw experts try their luck again with forecasts for bundesliga round 2 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a trip to the repair shop , the dw crystal ball returns this season , deutsche welle 's sports team are laying it on the line and predicting the results of all the bundesliga matches .
after a less than successful start , see what we predict for the second round . it 's round 2 of the 2010/11 bundesliga season and the dw experts are hoping to do a little better than last week when only one game was predicted correctly .
the crystal ball was obviously on the fritz -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- . the opening weekend of the season is always a lottery for forecasters because there is very little of the season 's form book to refer to so with a little more to go on , we hope to have more success with the next round of games . friday , august 27 kaiserslautern – bayern munich bayern looked boringly comfortable for long stretches against wolfsburg in their opening day win but finished the match with the margin a lot closer than it should have been .
kaiserslautern had a somewhat easier game against cologne and performed well , scoring three goals away from home .
bayern showed class and strength in front of their own supporters but these qualities will be tested on the road .
i can see the champions experiencing a slight , early blip in kaiserslautern . prediction : 2-2 saturday , august 28 schalke – hanover schalke blinked first in their match in hamburg last week and as a result lost to one of the teams which could rival them in the race for european places this season .
it 's early yet and the defeat wo n't end schalke 's challenge , but coach felix magath will be upset to have conceded points to one of the top teams already .
expect the royal blues to respond to magath 's wrath by soundly beating hanover in gelsenkirchen with raul marking his bundesliga home debut with at least one goal . prediction : schalke 3-1 bremen – cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen are back to winning ways .
bad news for cologne few would have expected bremen to be on the end of the kind of score line they normally inflict on the opposition .
losing 4-1 to hoffenheim was the worst possible start for thomas schaaf 's team .
luckily they had a confidence-restoring win in europe during the week to get their heads straight again and with qualification for the champions league group stages assured , werder can focus on climbing back up the bundesliga table .
they will begin their climb with victory over cologne who already look like relegation fodder after capitulating at home to kaiserslautern . prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg – mainz steve mcclaren 's wolves looked disjointed against bayern , but did manage 20 minutes of supreme offensive fotball - enough to give the champions a scare .
however , they looked far from cohesive at the back and even against mainz in their first home game of the season , wolfsburg may still not find the right gear .
mainz produced a good display to heap early woe on stuttgart , a team which finished strongly last season .
i think they 'll worry wolfsburg and grab a goal but the wolves will snatch a draw . prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg hit-man ruud hopes to be on target again reports that ruud van nistlerooy 's legs have gone appear to have been wildly exaggerated .
the dutch striker looked all the better for missing out on world cup action this summer , and as a result hamburg should get at least a good half-season out him before the inevitable wear and tear takes its toll .
frankfurt were unlucky to lose 2-1 to hanover last week and i can see them having a harder time against hsv , especially if ruud is still in the same mood as he was against schalke .
hamburg did n't travel well last season , dropping crucial points away from home , but still i think they 'll edge this one . prediction : hamburg 1-0 nuremberg – freiburg freiburg are going to struggle this season as their opening day defeat to st. pauli indicated . losing 3-1 at home to a newly-promoted side does not bode well for a team which has a long-standing relationship with the lower reaches of the bundesliga .
games like the one coming up against nuremberg need to be won if this is not to be a long fight against relegation for freiburg but i do n't see them getting the full quota of points this week .
the best freiburg can hope for is a draw - but i think they 'll get it . prediction : 1-1 st. pauli – hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will give st. pauli more problems than freiburg st. pauli will be flying after their victory over freiburg but they are in danger of crashing to earth against hoffenheim .
they may have their special supporters behind them on saturday but the gulf in class is likely to be too big for pauli .
one forgets that hoffenheim were once the village team made good , such is their standing in the top division now .
st. pauli might appear to be lambs to the slaughter in the wake of hoffenheim 's giving bremen a hiding , but i think the men from the rhine-neckar will have a harder job in hamburg .
that 's not to say they wo n't still win , though . prediction : hoffenheim 2-0 leverkusen - moenchengladbach bayer leverkusen have started in much the same way as they began last season - and by beating dortmund 2-0 away from home , michael ballack and co. have laid down a marker .
dortmund were tough to beat last year and can be expected to be difficult opponents this season , a fact that adds even more gloss to leverkusen 's win .
ballack 's boys will be too much for gladbach who just scraped a draw with nuremberg last week . prediction : leverkusen 3-1 sunday , august 29 stuttgart – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart boss christian gross hopes for something to clap both teams expected more from their opening games in which both were defeated , and both will be eager to put those false starts behind them .
however , stuttgart and dortmund both saw europa league action on thursday and could be running on fumes as they seek full fitness in the early season . whatever happens , these two sides will give whatever they 've got .
i see dortmund edging stuttgart through sheer power . prediction : dortmund 2-1 last week 's result : 5 points bayern – wolfsburg 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:1 , one point -rrb- hoffenheim – bremen 4:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:2 , one point -rrb- moenchengladbach – nuremberg 1:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , no points -rrb- cologne – kaiserslautern 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- freiburg – st. pauli 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- hanover – frankfurt 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , no points -rrb- hamburg – schalke 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , three points -rrb- mainz – stuttgart 2:0 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , no points -rrb- dortmund – leverkusen 0:2 -lrb- dw prediction 2:2 , no points -rrb- three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in may , bayern munich came closer than any other german club since 2002 to winning the title . bayern - losing finalists against inter milan in may - are among the top seeds and were drawn thursday against as roma , fc basel and cfr cluj in group e of this season 's champions league competition .
the german champions qualified automatically after securing the bundesliga title and therefore avoided the likes of italian giants inter and ac milan , english premiership big-boys manchester united , chelsea and arsenal , spanish champions barcelona and perennial qualifiers lyon from france 's ligue 1 .
clubs from the same country can not not be drawn against each other in the group stage and for tv purposes are kept on opposite sides of the draw as far as possible , so bayern have also avoided playing one of their bundesliga rivals - at least for now .
bayern look to hit the ground running bayern have been slowly building a head of steam in this competition over the past few seasons and since louis van gaal took charge they 've been picking up speed .
from being a team seemingly predestined to get knocked out in the quarterfinals , bayern have quietly developed into a club ready to challenge for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are hoping for happier end to the 2011 competition however , they faltered badly in the early stages of the competition last season , almost crashing out at the group stage with only a heroic performance against juventus preventing them from slipping into the europa league .
but with every passing round , the bavarian giants had an unbeatable air about them .
they marched through against teams like manchester united and lyon with a strange certainty that they would reach the final and had many convinced that they could win it .
unfortunately , it was not to be .
this season , a strong showing against another italian team will be needed .
as roma ran inter milan close to the serie a title last season and will prove obstinate opposition for bayern , especially at the stadio olimpico .
the german champions should have the measure of the italians at home but bayern 's visit to rome could prove tricky .
there should n't be any problem for the germans against fc basel so qualification should be assured , regardless of which way the results go against roma and cluj . if bayern can avoid the pitfalls which almost cost them the chance of making the knockout phase last time and find their european groove earlier this season , then they 'll be a strong bet to repeat their run to the previous final and who knows - perhaps even win it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have yet to fulfill their champions league potential bremen hope to recapture barnstorming form werder bremen , recently qualified at the expense of sampdoria , return to the champions league after a couple of seasons away from europe ’ s premier club competition .
the impressive and dramatic performances by thomas schaaf 's side against their italian opposition in the qualifying round certainly suggests that bremen will be an entertaining addition to the group stages , but how will they fare against teams like reigning champions inter milan , dutch champions fc twente and tottenham hotspurs ?
bremen have never really worried the latter stages of the champions league despite consistently reaching the knockout rounds during their strong , mid-noughties period of bundesliga ascendance .
however , they ’ ve been off the boil for the latter part of the decade and have not managed to regain the consistency which saw them continually challenging for the bundesliga title and qualifying for the champions league .
it remains to be seen how inter milan play under new coach rafa benitez , but however the former liverpool coach chooses to line the european champions up , it 's still effectively the same team that won the trophy last season .
bremen will be in for a fight both at home and away .
they may fancy their chances against new boys tottenham hotspurs but the english premiership side looked far from over-awed in qualifying , so werder will have to draw on their experience to snuff out spurs ' enthusiasm over two games .
fc twente shocked the eredivisie last season under current wolfsburg coach steve mcclaren , so who 's to say they wo n't spring a surprise in the champions league ?
they 're unlikely to win it but they could cause bremen problems .
at best , werder could get through in second but it looks a tough group for the north germans .
schalke faces tough group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope magath and raul can plot a successful course schalke , the third team in the bundesliga trio , have a tricky group consisting of lyon , benfica and happoel tel aviv .
but while schalke teams in the past have been finding their way through european competition with little knowledgeable guidance , they have a hard-headed coach with experience of the business end of the european cup in felix magath .
a winner and runner-up with hamburg as a player , magath coached bayern in three champions league campaigns , reaching the quarterfinals in 2004/05 and the first knockout round the following year .
he also took bayern to the knockout round in the 2006/07 competition but was fired for poor bundesliga form before their quarterfinal defeat to ac milan .
magath also has the most prolific goal scorer in champions league history on his books in the form of raul .
the former real madrid talisman and captain has three champions league winner ’ s medals to his name as well as an unprecedented 66 strikes in the competition .
as a result schalke will be going into this season ’ s champions league with an experienced leader off the pitch and an experienced one on it .
lyon have been here so many times before that they treat the champions league as if it was an extension of their domestic competition .
but , as bayern found out last season , this sometimes works against them .
lyon may not be equipped to deal with both this season , and schalke will hope to get a victory against them either home or away .
benfica could be the wild card in the group .
the portuguese are renowned for swift counterattacking play and their style may be a little cavalier for the germans .
these games could be very hard for schalke .
but the germans should get the points they need to at least challenge for the second qualifying spot against hapoel tel aviv .

in may , bayern munich came closer than any other german club since 2002 to winning the title . bayern - losing finalists against inter milan in may - are among the top seeds and were drawn thursday against as roma , fc basel and cfr cluj in group e of this season 's champions league competition .
the german champions qualified automatically after securing the bundesliga title and therefore avoided the likes of italian giants inter and ac milan , english premiership big-boys manchester united , chelsea and arsenal , spanish champions barcelona and perennial qualifiers lyon from france 's ligue 1 .
clubs from the same country can not not be drawn against each other in the group stage and for tv purposes are kept on opposite sides of the draw as far as possible , so bayern have also avoided playing one of their bundesliga rivals - at least for now .
bayern look to hit the ground running bayern have been slowly building a head of steam in this competition over the past few seasons and since louis van gaal took charge they 've been picking up speed .
from being a team seemingly predestined to get knocked out in the quarterfinals , bayern have quietly developed into a club ready to challenge for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are hoping for happier end to the 2011 competition however , they faltered badly in the early stages of the competition last season , almost crashing out at the group stage with only a heroic performance against juventus preventing them from slipping into the europa league .
but with every passing round , the bavarian giants had an unbeatable air about them .
they marched through against teams like manchester united and lyon with a strange certainty that they would reach the final and had many convinced that they could win it .
unfortunately , it was not to be .
this season , a strong showing against another italian team will be needed .
as roma ran inter milan close to the serie a title last season and will prove obstinate opposition for bayern , especially at the stadio olimpico .
the german champions should have the measure of the italians at home but bayern 's visit to rome could prove tricky .
there should n't be any problem for the germans against fc basel so qualification should be assured , regardless of which way the results go against roma and cluj . if bayern can avoid the pitfalls which almost cost them the chance of making the knockout phase last time and find their european groove earlier this season , then they 'll be a strong bet to repeat their run to the previous final and who knows - perhaps even win it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have yet to fulfill their champions league potential bremen hope to recapture barnstorming form werder bremen , recently qualified at the expense of sampdoria , return to the champions league after a couple of seasons away from europe ’ s premier club competition .
the impressive and dramatic performances by thomas schaaf 's side against their italian opposition in the qualifying round certainly suggests that bremen will be an entertaining addition to the group stages , but how will they fare against teams like reigning champions inter milan , dutch champions fc twente and tottenham hotspurs ?
bremen have never really worried the latter stages of the champions league despite consistently reaching the knockout rounds during their strong , mid-noughties period of bundesliga ascendance .
however , they ’ ve been off the boil for the latter part of the decade and have not managed to regain the consistency which saw them continually challenging for the bundesliga title and qualifying for the champions league .
it remains to be seen how inter milan play under new coach rafa benitez , but however the former liverpool coach chooses to line the european champions up , it 's still effectively the same team that won the trophy last season .
bremen will be in for a fight both at home and away .
they may fancy their chances against new boys tottenham hotspurs but the english premiership side looked far from over-awed in qualifying , so werder will have to draw on their experience to snuff out spurs ' enthusiasm over two games .
fc twente shocked the eredivisie last season under current wolfsburg coach steve mcclaren , so who 's to say they wo n't spring a surprise in the champions league ?
they 're unlikely to win it but they could cause bremen problems .
at best , werder could get through in second but it looks a tough group for the north germans .
schalke faces tough group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope magath and raul can plot a successful course schalke , the third team in the bundesliga trio , have a tricky group consisting of lyon , benfica and happoel tel aviv .
but while schalke teams in the past have been finding their way through european competition with little knowledgeable guidance , they have a hard-headed coach with experience of the business end of the european cup in felix magath .
a winner and runner-up with hamburg as a player , magath coached bayern in three champions league campaigns , reaching the quarterfinals in 2004/05 and the first knockout round the following year .
he also took bayern to the knockout round in the 2006/07 competition but was fired for poor bundesliga form before their quarterfinal defeat to ac milan .
magath also has the most prolific goal scorer in champions league history on his books in the form of raul .
the former real madrid talisman and captain has three champions league winner ’ s medals to his name as well as an unprecedented 66 strikes in the competition .
as a result schalke will be going into this season ’ s champions league with an experienced leader off the pitch and an experienced one on it .
lyon have been here so many times before that they treat the champions league as if it was an extension of their domestic competition .
but , as bayern found out last season , this sometimes works against them .
lyon may not be equipped to deal with both this season , and schalke will hope to get a victory against them either home or away .
benfica could be the wild card in the group .
the portuguese are renowned for swift counterattacking play and their style may be a little cavalier for the germans .
these games could be very hard for schalke .
but the germans should get the points they need to at least challenge for the second qualifying spot against hapoel tel aviv .

the 28-year-old benaissa is a member of the popular girl band no angels . she discovered she was hiv positive in 1999 when she was three months pregnant .
she was arrested in april 2009 for having unprotected sex with three men in 2004 and 2006 and failing to inform them of her hiv status .
to do so can be classified as aggravated assault under german law .
both the state prosecutor peter liesenfeld and her defense had asked the courts for the suspended sentence in the trial , which ended on wednesday .
liesenfeld cited her confession and her expression of remorse as reasons for lighter sentence .
" i made a huge mistake , " benaissa said in an emotional apology during the closing arguments .
" i am sorry from the bottom of my heart , " she said . " i would love to turn back the clock , but i ca n't . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after discovering her hiv status , benaissa -lrb- right -rrb- found success with the girl band no angels almost certainly infected the man but the 34-year-old man she infected with hiv gave an angry testimony during the trial , saying she had caused " a lot of suffering in this world . "
because she and the man both have a strain of the virus that is relatively rare in germany , medical experts had determined the man had almost certainly been infected by benaissa .
she was also convicted of attempted aggravated assault for having unprotected sex with another man who did not contract the virus .
she said she was afraid that her career would be negatively impacted if it became public that she is hiv positive .
a return to the stage ?
instead of jail time , the pop star is expected to complete 300 hours of community service and attend regular counseling sessions .
no angels , which first formed in 2000 and got back together in 2007 after a brief break , are expected to restart their tour .
that tour was interrupted last year when benaissa was arrested just before performing in frankfurt .

the 28-year-old benaissa is a member of the popular girl band no angels . she discovered she was hiv positive in 1999 when she was three months pregnant .
she was arrested in april 2009 for having unprotected sex with three men in 2004 and 2006 and failing to inform them of her hiv status .

both the state prosecutor peter liesenfeld and her defense had asked the courts for the suspended sentence in the trial , which ended on wednesday .
liesenfeld cited her confession and her expression of remorse as reasons for lighter sentence .

she said she was afraid that her career would be negatively impacted if it became public that she is hiv positive .

instead of jail time , the pop star is expected to complete 300 hours of community service and attend regular counseling sessions .
no angels , which first formed in 2000 and got back together in 2007 after a brief break , are expected to restart their tour .

the 28-year-old benaissa is a member of the popular girl band no angels . she discovered she was hiv positive in 1999 when she was three months pregnant .
she was arrested in april 2009 for having unprotected sex with three men in 2004 and 2006 and failing to inform them of her hiv status .
to do so can be classified as aggravated assault under german law .
both the state prosecutor peter liesenfeld and her defense had asked the courts for the suspended sentence in the trial , which ended on wednesday .
liesenfeld cited her confession and her expression of remorse as reasons for lighter sentence .
" i made a huge mistake , " benaissa said in an emotional apology during the closing arguments .
" i am sorry from the bottom of my heart , " she said . " i would love to turn back the clock , but i ca n't . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after discovering her hiv status , benaissa -lrb- right -rrb- found success with the girl band no angels almost certainly infected the man but the 34-year-old man she infected with hiv gave an angry testimony during the trial , saying she had caused " a lot of suffering in this world . "
because she and the man both have a strain of the virus that is relatively rare in germany , medical experts had determined the man had almost certainly been infected by benaissa .
she was also convicted of attempted aggravated assault for having unprotected sex with another man who did not contract the virus .
she said she was afraid that her career would be negatively impacted if it became public that she is hiv positive .
a return to the stage ?
instead of jail time , the pop star is expected to complete 300 hours of community service and attend regular counseling sessions .
no angels , which first formed in 2000 and got back together in 2007 after a brief break , are expected to restart their tour .
that tour was interrupted last year when benaissa was arrested just before performing in frankfurt .

its sponsors say the nuclear power fight is post-war germany 's largest-ever economic dispute . in the midst of an ongoing debate over whether to extend the lifespan of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , a new report has revealed that the continued availability of nuclear power would likely cause a decrease in investment into renewable energies .
increases in wind and solar energy capacities will eventually lead to nuclear power plants being used less , the report states .
the reason : energy from renewable sources enjoys legal priority over nuclear and coal power .
it is fed into the grid before electricity from non-renewable sources .
as the capacity of electricity from wind or solar sources increases , conventional electricity sources will only be needed to fill in gaps when there is a lack of wind or sun .
but it takes about 50 hours to restart a nuclear power plant that has been completely shut down , meaning it would be necessary to keep the plant running at 50 or 60 percent capacity .
gas powered turbines , however , can be turned on within 20 minutes and can also be run on biogas .
other possibilities to bridge fluctuations in renewable electricity output include the decentralized approach of using micro-power stations or accessing the batteries of electric cars .
companies likely to fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conventional power might only be needed when the wind is n't blowing germany 's four largest energy companies - e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw - will do everything in their power to avoid losing billions on their investments into nuclear power , the report assumes .
supposing the lifespans of the power plant are increased by 28 years , energy companies will have to come to terms with turning them off some 15,800 times between 2020 and the date when the last plant is shut down .
that would cost them between 21 and 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 26.7 billion to $ 101.7 billion -rrb- , unless they successfully lobby to overturn the priority that electricity from renewable sources enjoys and pushed for the construction of those sources to be capped .
gero lucking , of the renewable energy company lichtblick , which sponsored the study , described the dilemma as the " largest post-war economic dispute " in germany .
olav hohmeyer , professor of economics and energy and environmental management at the university of flensburg , authored the study .
according to hohmeyer , electricity needs can entirely be met through renewable energy sources by 2050 .
nuclear power plant lifespans will not need to be extended , nor will there be an electricity deficit to be covered by new coal-fired power plants .
" nuclear power plants are not flexible enough to safely react to changing weather conditions and compensate for fluctuations in wind and sunshine , " hohmeyer said .
hohmeyer 's report states the last nuclear power plant can be removed from the grid in 2023 and the last coal-fired power plant in 2046 .
extending the lifespans of nuclear power plants by 40 years in germany - as has been proposed by the government - would damage vital investment interests and set back the switch to renewable energy by decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased renewable energy could curb the need for nuclear energy monopoly-like structures florian noto of the german nature conservancy represents a group of 21 environmental organizations banded together against nuclear energy .
he said an already-permitted nuclear power plant can generate inexpensive electricity for energy companies , when nuclear waste , risk-based costs and insurance are not taken into account .
" a newly-constructed eco-power plant ca n't necessarily keep up , " he told deutsche welle .
" if the old nuclear power plants just keep running , then progress wo n't be made and little will be invested -lsb- … -rsb- it would actually lead to an investment bottleneck . "
noto also pointed out that four of the 17 nuclear power plants in germany were out of commission for more than 10 months during 2009 , and that at times as many as eight of them were out of commission .
a more diverse and decentralized energy market could lead to lower electricity prices for consumers , according to noto .
" the fact is these companies are actually too dominant , and an economic counterweight needs to be created .
if more new energy companies join this market - if the market is expanded - then that will lead to these monopolistic structures going away , " he said .
electricity from renewable sources will become less expensive in comparison to conventionally generated electricity as prices of raw materials rise , the report states .
by 2050 its additional monthly price compared to conventionally generated electricity could be between just three and 17 euros for an average household using 3,000 kilowatt hours .

nuclear power plant lifespans will not need to be extended , nor will there be an electricity deficit to be covered by new coal-fired power plants .
" nuclear power plants are not flexible enough to safely react to changing weather conditions and compensate for fluctuations in wind and sunshine , " hohmeyer said .
hohmeyer 's report states the last nuclear power plant can be removed from the grid in 2023 and the last coal-fired power plant in 2046 .
extending the lifespans of nuclear power plants by 40 years in germany - as has been proposed by the government - would damage vital investment interests and set back the switch to renewable energy by decades .

he said an already-permitted nuclear power plant can generate inexpensive electricity for energy companies , when nuclear waste , risk-based costs and insurance are not taken into account .

" if the old nuclear power plants just keep running , then progress wo n't be made and little will be invested -lsb- … -rsb- it would actually lead to an investment bottleneck . "
noto also pointed out that four of the 17 nuclear power plants in germany were out of commission for more than 10 months during 2009 , and that at times as many as eight of them were out of commission .
a more diverse and decentralized energy market could lead to lower electricity prices for consumers , according to noto .
" the fact is these companies are actually too dominant , and an economic counterweight needs to be created .
if more new energy companies join this market - if the market is expanded - then that will lead to these monopolistic structures going away , " he said .
electricity from renewable sources will become less expensive in comparison to conventionally generated electricity as prices of raw materials rise , the report states .
by 2050 its additional monthly price compared to conventionally generated electricity could be between just three and 17 euros for an average household using 3,000 kilowatt hours .

its sponsors say the nuclear power fight is post-war germany 's largest-ever economic dispute . in the midst of an ongoing debate over whether to extend the lifespan of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , a new report has revealed that the continued availability of nuclear power would likely cause a decrease in investment into renewable energies .
increases in wind and solar energy capacities will eventually lead to nuclear power plants being used less , the report states .
the reason : energy from renewable sources enjoys legal priority over nuclear and coal power .
it is fed into the grid before electricity from non-renewable sources .
as the capacity of electricity from wind or solar sources increases , conventional electricity sources will only be needed to fill in gaps when there is a lack of wind or sun .
but it takes about 50 hours to restart a nuclear power plant that has been completely shut down , meaning it would be necessary to keep the plant running at 50 or 60 percent capacity .
gas powered turbines , however , can be turned on within 20 minutes and can also be run on biogas .
other possibilities to bridge fluctuations in renewable electricity output include the decentralized approach of using micro-power stations or accessing the batteries of electric cars .

supposing the lifespans of the power plant are increased by 28 years , energy companies will have to come to terms with turning them off some 15,800 times between 2020 and the date when the last plant is shut down .
that would cost them between 21 and 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 26.7 billion to $ 101.7 billion -rrb- , unless they successfully lobby to overturn the priority that electricity from renewable sources enjoys and pushed for the construction of those sources to be capped .

its sponsors say the nuclear power fight is post-war germany 's largest-ever economic dispute . in the midst of an ongoing debate over whether to extend the lifespan of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , a new report has revealed that the continued availability of nuclear power would likely cause a decrease in investment into renewable energies .
increases in wind and solar energy capacities will eventually lead to nuclear power plants being used less , the report states .
the reason : energy from renewable sources enjoys legal priority over nuclear and coal power .
it is fed into the grid before electricity from non-renewable sources .
as the capacity of electricity from wind or solar sources increases , conventional electricity sources will only be needed to fill in gaps when there is a lack of wind or sun .
but it takes about 50 hours to restart a nuclear power plant that has been completely shut down , meaning it would be necessary to keep the plant running at 50 or 60 percent capacity .
gas powered turbines , however , can be turned on within 20 minutes and can also be run on biogas .
other possibilities to bridge fluctuations in renewable electricity output include the decentralized approach of using micro-power stations or accessing the batteries of electric cars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 26.08.2010 iceman likely laid to rest , study suggests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was oetzi given a burial ceremony ?
when the corpse of a 5,000-year-old human was uncovered nearly 20 years ago , archaeologists assumed the iceman 's death was anything but ceremonious .
researchers now think oetzi may have received a proper alpine burial . a study released on thursday suggests that oetzi , a human specimen found in the alps of south tyrol nearly two decades ago , was not " frozen in time and place " following his death five millennia ago .
a team of italian and american researchers now believe the iceman actually received a proper burial ceremony atop a mountain pass , months after his death .
oetzi was initially discovered in 1991 at the tisenjoch alpine pass along the border between austria and italy .
researchers theorized that the iceman died of a battle-related arrow wound to the shoulder .
it followed that oetzi 's personal belongings were frozen with him after his death in the upper reaches of the alps .
yet according to a new study published today in the journal antiquity , those conclusions were not based on detailed mapping of the grave site . a team of archaeologists , anthropologists and geo-specialists used spatial analysis to pinpoint the distribution of the man 's belongings and the corpse itself - leading them to propose that his body was ceremoniously placed on elevated rock , some five meters -lrb- about 16 feet -rrb- away from his eventual discovery site . " we concluded that he died in april , and in april the pass was probably full of snow , " said alessandro vanzetti , an archaeologist at the la sapienza university of rome and one of the study 's authors .
" he could n't have died on the spot , furthermore , he did n't die on this stone , as had been reported . "
botanical evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers have not reached consensus on the circumstances of oetzi 's death the team analyzed pollen ingested by oetzi before his death and compared it with pollen found in the ice surrounding him , noting a " mismatch " between his death in april - which the team suspected occurred at a lower altitude - and his possible burial in august or september .
researchers concluded that the iceman died in a different location , and that his body was recovered .
" we think he was kept in some kind of cellar , " vanzetti told deutsche welle .
citing regional historical knowledge , the study noted that in oetzi 's day , the dead were customarily placed in farmsteads called " masi " before the winter snow and ice melted .
" it was used by people in tyrol during the cold seasons , " he said .
" when one was dead , it was impossible to bury immediately , because the ground was frozen . "
" he was a very important person , so people decided to bury him on the pass , " vanzetti added .
luca bondioli , co-author of the paper and an anthropologist with at the national museum of prehistory and ethnology in italy , described oetzi as " an individual of the elite . "
" the fact that we have a new interpretation of the discovery is important , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the study noted that previous oetzi research was based on the initial interpretation of the iceman find and his belongings as " frozen in time and place . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say the iceman died from an arrow wound to the shoulder distribution data but the team 's findings suggested that the iceman 's personal effects were carefully placed near his body during a burial ceremony , not simply scattered around him as he lay dying .
" there is a strong indication that the distribution can be explained by gravity and movement in the ice , " vanzetti said .
the archaeologist and his colleagues proposed that oetzi and his grave goods were placed on an area of raised natural stone .
later on , according to the study , " cyclical thawing and freezing " caused the corpse and the burial items to shift .
the distribution was likely variable : lighter objects , such as hair and oetzi 's quiver , did not move in the same way as more weighty items , such as fur , leather and the body itself .
lingering questions yet not all researchers in the field are prepared to accept the burial theory .
albert zink , who was involved in efforts to map oetzi 's dna and serves as head of the institute for mummies and the iceman , said the team 's conclusion was " not very convincing . "
" there there are several things which i think are clearly in contrast to a burial , " he told deutsche welle , citing the unusual placement of the bow , which had been stood upright , as well as the random distribution of oetzi 's belongings .
moreover , the iceman was found with his right arm in a vertical position that zink said would have been corrected before a burial . nevertheless , the new theory speaks to certain missing links in the iceman story - including why oetzi was found with unfinished weaponry .
it could also explain why personal effects were discovered near his body , considering the likelihood that his attackers would confiscate the belongings of a felled opponent . " ultimately , " the study read , " the impressive array of other objects is better explained as grave furnishings than as mountain equipment .

after a less than successful start , see what we predict for the second round . it 's round 2 of the 2010/11 bundesliga season and the dw experts are hoping to do a little better than last week when only one game was predicted correctly .
the crystal ball was obviously on the fritz -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- . the opening weekend of the season is always a lottery for forecasters because there is very little of the season 's form book to refer to so with a little more to go on , we hope to have more success with the next round of games . friday , august 27 kaiserslautern – bayern munich bayern looked boringly comfortable for long stretches against wolfsburg in their opening day win but finished the match with the margin a lot closer than it should have been .
kaiserslautern had a somewhat easier game against cologne and performed well , scoring three goals away from home .
bayern showed class and strength in front of their own supporters but these qualities will be tested on the road .
i can see the champions experiencing a slight , early blip in kaiserslautern . prediction : 2-2 saturday , august 28 schalke – hanover schalke blinked first in their match in hamburg last week and as a result lost to one of the teams which could rival them in the race for european places this season .
it 's early yet and the defeat wo n't end schalke 's challenge , but coach felix magath will be upset to have conceded points to one of the top teams already .
expect the royal blues to respond to magath 's wrath by soundly beating hanover in gelsenkirchen with raul marking his bundesliga home debut with at least one goal . prediction : schalke 3-1 bremen – cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen are back to winning ways .
bad news for cologne few would have expected bremen to be on the end of the kind of score line they normally inflict on the opposition .
losing 4-1 to hoffenheim was the worst possible start for thomas schaaf 's team .
luckily they had a confidence-restoring win in europe during the week to get their heads straight again and with qualification for the champions league group stages assured , werder can focus on climbing back up the bundesliga table .
they will begin their climb with victory over cologne who already look like relegation fodder after capitulating at home to kaiserslautern . prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg – mainz steve mcclaren 's wolves looked disjointed against bayern , but did manage 20 minutes of supreme offensive fotball - enough to give the champions a scare .
however , they looked far from cohesive at the back and even against mainz in their first home game of the season , wolfsburg may still not find the right gear .
mainz produced a good display to heap early woe on stuttgart , a team which finished strongly last season .
i think they 'll worry wolfsburg and grab a goal but the wolves will snatch a draw . prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg hit-man ruud hopes to be on target again reports that ruud van nistlerooy 's legs have gone appear to have been wildly exaggerated .
the dutch striker looked all the better for missing out on world cup action this summer , and as a result hamburg should get at least a good half-season out him before the inevitable wear and tear takes its toll .
frankfurt were unlucky to lose 2-1 to hanover last week and i can see them having a harder time against hsv , especially if ruud is still in the same mood as he was against schalke .
hamburg did n't travel well last season , dropping crucial points away from home , but still i think they 'll edge this one . prediction : hamburg 1-0 nuremberg – freiburg freiburg are going to struggle this season as their opening day defeat to st. pauli indicated . losing 3-1 at home to a newly-promoted side does not bode well for a team which has a long-standing relationship with the lower reaches of the bundesliga .
games like the one coming up against nuremberg need to be won if this is not to be a long fight against relegation for freiburg but i do n't see them getting the full quota of points this week .
the best freiburg can hope for is a draw - but i think they 'll get it . prediction : 1-1 st. pauli – hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will give st. pauli more problems than freiburg st. pauli will be flying after their victory over freiburg but they are in danger of crashing to earth against hoffenheim .
they may have their special supporters behind them on saturday but the gulf in class is likely to be too big for pauli .
one forgets that hoffenheim were once the village team made good , such is their standing in the top division now .
st. pauli might appear to be lambs to the slaughter in the wake of hoffenheim 's giving bremen a hiding , but i think the men from the rhine-neckar will have a harder job in hamburg .
that 's not to say they wo n't still win , though . prediction : hoffenheim 2-0 leverkusen - moenchengladbach bayer leverkusen have started in much the same way as they began last season - and by beating dortmund 2-0 away from home , michael ballack and co. have laid down a marker .
dortmund were tough to beat last year and can be expected to be difficult opponents this season , a fact that adds even more gloss to leverkusen 's win .
ballack 's boys will be too much for gladbach who just scraped a draw with nuremberg last week . prediction : leverkusen 3-1 sunday , august 29 stuttgart – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart boss christian gross hopes for something to clap both teams expected more from their opening games in which both were defeated , and both will be eager to put those false starts behind them .
however , stuttgart and dortmund both saw europa league action on thursday and could be running on fumes as they seek full fitness in the early season . whatever happens , these two sides will give whatever they 've got .
i see dortmund edging stuttgart through sheer power . prediction : dortmund 2-1 last week 's result : 5 points bayern – wolfsburg 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:1 , one point -rrb- hoffenheim – bremen 4:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:2 , one point -rrb- moenchengladbach – nuremberg 1:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , no points -rrb- cologne – kaiserslautern 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- freiburg – st. pauli 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- hanover – frankfurt 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , no points -rrb- hamburg – schalke 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , three points -rrb- mainz – stuttgart 2:0 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , no points -rrb- dortmund – leverkusen 0:2 -lrb- dw prediction 2:2 , no points -rrb- three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de hamburg 's winning start gives under-fire coach breathing space hamburg 's armin veh still belongs to the small circle of elite bundesliga coaches with a job at a top team and is battling to stay there .
but as deutsche welle found out , there are certain questions he hates answering .
-lrb- 23.08.2010 -rrb- leverkusen and mainz get off to winning start bayer leverkusen got their bundesliga season off to a good start with a 2-0 win at borussia dortmund on sunday .
mainz had an impressive 2-0 win against rivals stuttgart , with both goals scored by new signings .

when the corpse of a 5,000-year-old human was uncovered nearly 20 years ago , archaeologists assumed the iceman 's death was anything but ceremonious .
researchers now think oetzi may have received a proper alpine burial . a study released on thursday suggests that oetzi , a human specimen found in the alps of south tyrol nearly two decades ago , was not " frozen in time and place " following his death five millennia ago .
a team of italian and american researchers now believe the iceman actually received a proper burial ceremony atop a mountain pass , months after his death .
oetzi was initially discovered in 1991 at the tisenjoch alpine pass along the border between austria and italy .
researchers theorized that the iceman died of a battle-related arrow wound to the shoulder .
it followed that oetzi 's personal belongings were frozen with him after his death in the upper reaches of the alps .
yet according to a new study published today in the journal antiquity , those conclusions were not based on detailed mapping of the grave site . a team of archaeologists , anthropologists and geo-specialists used spatial analysis to pinpoint the distribution of the man 's belongings and the corpse itself - leading them to propose that his body was ceremoniously placed on elevated rock , some five meters -lrb- about 16 feet -rrb- away from his eventual discovery site . " we concluded that he died in april , and in april the pass was probably full of snow , " said alessandro vanzetti , an archaeologist at the la sapienza university of rome and one of the study 's authors .
" he could n't have died on the spot , furthermore , he did n't die on this stone , as had been reported . "
botanical evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers have not reached consensus on the circumstances of oetzi 's death the team analyzed pollen ingested by oetzi before his death and compared it with pollen found in the ice surrounding him , noting a " mismatch " between his death in april - which the team suspected occurred at a lower altitude - and his possible burial in august or september .
researchers concluded that the iceman died in a different location , and that his body was recovered .
" we think he was kept in some kind of cellar , " vanzetti told deutsche welle .
citing regional historical knowledge , the study noted that in oetzi 's day , the dead were customarily placed in farmsteads called " masi " before the winter snow and ice melted .
" it was used by people in tyrol during the cold seasons , " he said .
" when one was dead , it was impossible to bury immediately , because the ground was frozen . "
" he was a very important person , so people decided to bury him on the pass , " vanzetti added .
luca bondioli , co-author of the paper and an anthropologist with at the national museum of prehistory and ethnology in italy , described oetzi as " an individual of the elite . "
" the fact that we have a new interpretation of the discovery is important , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the study noted that previous oetzi research was based on the initial interpretation of the iceman find and his belongings as " frozen in time and place . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say the iceman died from an arrow wound to the shoulder distribution data but the team 's findings suggested that the iceman 's personal effects were carefully placed near his body during a burial ceremony , not simply scattered around him as he lay dying .
" there is a strong indication that the distribution can be explained by gravity and movement in the ice , " vanzetti said .
the archaeologist and his colleagues proposed that oetzi and his grave goods were placed on an area of raised natural stone .
later on , according to the study , " cyclical thawing and freezing " caused the corpse and the burial items to shift .
the distribution was likely variable : lighter objects , such as hair and oetzi 's quiver , did not move in the same way as more weighty items , such as fur , leather and the body itself .
lingering questions yet not all researchers in the field are prepared to accept the burial theory .
albert zink , who was involved in efforts to map oetzi 's dna and serves as head of the institute for mummies and the iceman , said the team 's conclusion was " not very convincing . "
" there there are several things which i think are clearly in contrast to a burial , " he told deutsche welle , citing the unusual placement of the bow , which had been stood upright , as well as the random distribution of oetzi 's belongings .
moreover , the iceman was found with his right arm in a vertical position that zink said would have been corrected before a burial . nevertheless , the new theory speaks to certain missing links in the iceman story - including why oetzi was found with unfinished weaponry .
it could also explain why personal effects were discovered near his body , considering the likelihood that his attackers would confiscate the belongings of a felled opponent .

when the corpse of a 5,000-year-old human was uncovered nearly 20 years ago , archaeologists assumed the iceman 's death was anything but ceremonious .
researchers now think oetzi may have received a proper alpine burial . a study released on thursday suggests that oetzi , a human specimen found in the alps of south tyrol nearly two decades ago , was not " frozen in time and place " following his death five millennia ago .
a team of italian and american researchers now believe the iceman actually received a proper burial ceremony atop a mountain pass , months after his death .
oetzi was initially discovered in 1991 at the tisenjoch alpine pass along the border between austria and italy .
researchers theorized that the iceman died of a battle-related arrow wound to the shoulder .
it followed that oetzi 's personal belongings were frozen with him after his death in the upper reaches of the alps .
yet according to a new study published today in the journal antiquity , those conclusions were not based on detailed mapping of the grave site . a team of archaeologists , anthropologists and geo-specialists used spatial analysis to pinpoint the distribution of the man 's belongings and the corpse itself - leading them to propose that his body was ceremoniously placed on elevated rock , some five meters -lrb- about 16 feet -rrb- away from his eventual discovery site . " we concluded that he died in april , and in april the pass was probably full of snow , " said alessandro vanzetti , an archaeologist at the la sapienza university of rome and one of the study 's authors .
" he could n't have died on the spot , furthermore , he did n't die on this stone , as had been reported . "
botanical evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers have not reached consensus on the circumstances of oetzi 's death the team analyzed pollen ingested by oetzi before his death and compared it with pollen found in the ice surrounding him , noting a " mismatch " between his death in april - which the team suspected occurred at a lower altitude - and his possible burial in august or september .
researchers concluded that the iceman died in a different location , and that his body was recovered .
" we think he was kept in some kind of cellar , " vanzetti told deutsche welle .
citing regional historical knowledge , the study noted that in oetzi 's day , the dead were customarily placed in farmsteads called " masi " before the winter snow and ice melted .
" it was used by people in tyrol during the cold seasons , " he said .
" when one was dead , it was impossible to bury immediately , because the ground was frozen . "
" he was a very important person , so people decided to bury him on the pass , " vanzetti added .
luca bondioli , co-author of the paper and an anthropologist with at the national museum of prehistory and ethnology in italy , described oetzi as " an individual of the elite . "
" the fact that we have a new interpretation of the discovery is important , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the study noted that previous oetzi research was based on the initial interpretation of the iceman find and his belongings as " frozen in time and place . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say the iceman died from an arrow wound to the shoulder distribution data but the team 's findings suggested that the iceman 's personal effects were carefully placed near his body during a burial ceremony , not simply scattered around him as he lay dying .
" there is a strong indication that the distribution can be explained by gravity and movement in the ice , " vanzetti said .
the archaeologist and his colleagues proposed that oetzi and his grave goods were placed on an area of raised natural stone .
later on , according to the study , " cyclical thawing and freezing " caused the corpse and the burial items to shift .
the distribution was likely variable : lighter objects , such as hair and oetzi 's quiver , did not move in the same way as more weighty items , such as fur , leather and the body itself .
lingering questions yet not all researchers in the field are prepared to accept the burial theory .
albert zink , who was involved in efforts to map oetzi 's dna and serves as head of the institute for mummies and the iceman , said the team 's conclusion was " not very convincing . "
" there there are several things which i think are clearly in contrast to a burial , " he told deutsche welle , citing the unusual placement of the bow , which had been stood upright , as well as the random distribution of oetzi 's belongings .
moreover , the iceman was found with his right arm in a vertical position that zink said would have been corrected before a burial . nevertheless , the new theory speaks to certain missing links in the iceman story - including why oetzi was found with unfinished weaponry .
it could also explain why personal effects were discovered near his body , considering the likelihood that his attackers would confiscate the belongings of a felled opponent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 26.08.2010 concerns raised over security of new german id cards großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new id cards include a chip containing encrypted data from november 2010 anyone needing a new id card in germany will be able to get a feature-rich enhanced card , which stores a host of data .
but experts are not impressed by the security features on the new id cards . the german government is introducing new id cards from november .
the new cards , the size of a standard credit card , will have additional functions alongside the standard personal information .
an embedded chip will contain a digital photo and encrypted personal data .
this new feature will allow card-holders to make online transactions with state authorities .
german interior minister thomas de maiziere is confident that the new cards will be more secure than older versions : " with these new id cards , we 'll have the highest-ever level of security for all legally binding online activities , " de maiziere said .
danger from hackers but experts have raised doubts about this assertion .
some are worried that the new cards are not secure enough , and that widespread identity misuse may be just around the corner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos computer club tested out the new cards it specialists from the chaos computer club , a german-based hackers ' organization , have scrutinized the new cards on behalf of german public broadcaster ard .
they found that the card readers being issued by the government to enable users to make online transactions were not as secure as they should be .
hackers from the " chaos computer club " claim that simple spying malware could put sensitive data slip into the wrong hands , because the card readers require external keyboards .
if hackers get past the computer 's firewall , they can see everything the user is typing , including , potentially , the pin-code for their id card .
once they have a pin-code , hackers could access all sorts of other personal information stored on the cards .
consumer protection activist michael bobrowski is concerned about such identity theft .
" id card owners stand to incur huge losses , " he said .
" and they 'd have to prove to the bank or other institutions that a given transaction was not initiated by them .
for ordinary pc users , this will hardly be feasible . "
the scheme is proving costly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere is confident about the security of the cards the opposition free democrats ' legal affairs spokesman , christian ahrendt , is also worried about identity theft .
he believes that the chips in the new id cards are a waste of taxpayers ' money .
" this was our main point of criticism when id cards equipped with chips were first debated and later decided on in the previous grand coalition government of christian and social democrats , " ahrendt said .
" there 's simply no need for the state to sponsor private institutions ' efforts to make on-line services more secure . "
interior minister de maiziere , of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats has not said whether the state would finance safer , more expensive card readers . the basic readers have already cost the government 24 million euros -lrb- $ 30.5 million -rrb- .

but experts are not impressed by the security features on the new id cards . the german government is introducing new id cards from november .
the new cards , the size of a standard credit card , will have additional functions alongside the standard personal information .
an embedded chip will contain a digital photo and encrypted personal data .
this new feature will allow card-holders to make online transactions with state authorities .
german interior minister thomas de maiziere is confident that the new cards will be more secure than older versions : " with these new id cards , we 'll have the highest-ever level of security for all legally binding online activities , " de maiziere said .
danger from hackers but experts have raised doubts about this assertion .
some are worried that the new cards are not secure enough , and that widespread identity misuse may be just around the corner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos computer club tested out the new cards it specialists from the chaos computer club , a german-based hackers ' organization , have scrutinized the new cards on behalf of german public broadcaster ard .
they found that the card readers being issued by the government to enable users to make online transactions were not as secure as they should be .
hackers from the " chaos computer club " claim that simple spying malware could put sensitive data slip into the wrong hands , because the card readers require external keyboards .
if hackers get past the computer 's firewall , they can see everything the user is typing , including , potentially , the pin-code for their id card .
once they have a pin-code , hackers could access all sorts of other personal information stored on the cards .
consumer protection activist michael bobrowski is concerned about such identity theft .
" id card owners stand to incur huge losses , " he said .
" and they 'd have to prove to the bank or other institutions that a given transaction was not initiated by them .
for ordinary pc users , this will hardly be feasible . "
the scheme is proving costly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere is confident about the security of the cards the opposition free democrats ' legal affairs spokesman , christian ahrendt , is also worried about identity theft .
he believes that the chips in the new id cards are a waste of taxpayers ' money .
" this was our main point of criticism when id cards equipped with chips were first debated and later decided on in the previous grand coalition government of christian and social democrats , " ahrendt said .
" there 's simply no need for the state to sponsor private institutions ' efforts to make on-line services more secure . "
interior minister de maiziere , of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats has not said whether the state would finance safer , more expensive card readers . the basic readers have already cost the government 24 million euros -lrb- $ 30.5 million -rrb- .

on thursday several demonstrators climbed onto a roof , temporarily stopping the demolition . police in stuttgart say that work to raze part of the city 's old aboveground train station was stopped for several hours on thursday when seven people occupied part of the building 's roof .
the protestors were then removed and arrested by special police forces .
other demonstrators blocked train platforms , causing a high-speed tgv train to paris to be delayed by about an hour .
construction workers began the demolition of the north wing of the stuttgart train station under police protection on wednesday , as thousands continued to demonstrate against the renovation project .
activists claimed 12,000 people had participated in the protests , while police put the number at 6,000 .
up to 50,000 demonstrators are anticipated on friday .
growing tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tension between protestors and police is growing demonstrations against the project have been going on for weeks , and their growing boldness has raised tensions .
the police president in stuttgart , siegfried stumpf , said wednesday 's protests had " lost their peaceful character . "
" this has moved way beyond understandable protests and civil disobedience , " he said , saying firefighters and rescue workers had been harassed and that groups blockading streets had thrown bottles .
a spokesman for the park protectors group , which opposes the project , denied any violence and said that " the politicians , through the police , are trying to criminalize us . "
the " stuttgart 21 " construction project is to link the city with one of europe 's longest high-speed rail lines by converting it from a terminus , which forces trains to pull in and out , to an underground through-station that trains can pass through .
supporters say the project will cut down travel times , create jobs and attract investors , but opponents say its estimated cost of seven billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- is too high .
environmentalists say the current plan is not necessary and that its effect on rail traffic would be limited .

gm has given the green light for opel to export beyond its core european market . us carmaker gm has decided to allow opel to sell its cars in china , a move expected to lead to even greater competition among its brands in the huge chinese market .
" we will market opel as a european designed car in the premium segment , " company spokesman andreas kroemer told deutsche welle .
" there are a growing number of chinese who like european cars and have the money to afford them . "
opel tested the waters in china last year , selling around 4,000 cars , according to kroemer .
in the first half of 2010 , china passed the united states as gm 's biggest national market .
together with chevy and buick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has become the world 's largest market for new car sales kroemer declined to say which models opel plans to sell in china .
currently , gm markets its cadillac , chevrolet and buick brands in the country , in addition to vehicles manufactured by wuling , a chinese carmaker in which the us auto giant has a 30 percent stake .
until now , vehicles made by opel were only sold outside europe under gm 's buick nameplate .
in addition to china , opel will begin selling vehicles in australia and later in several other markets in the asia-pacific and south american regions , according to kroemer .
" this is great news for opel and i believe the company has good opportunities in the country , " said christoph stuermer , an auto analyst with ihs global insight in frankfurt .
export first , assemble locally later stuermer expects opel will initially export cars to china until it establishes a market position in the country .
but eventually , he said , the company will need to assemble cars locally to avoid import taxes , which can increase the price of vehicles by as much as 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm adds opel to its line of brands in china opel will compete with germany 's other big carmakers , bmw , daimler and volkswagen , which have been operating in china for some time .
china has become the world 's biggest auto market based on the number of new vehicles sold .
automakers around the world are looking to the country to drive revenue amid weak global demand .
but growth has dropped since last year when the government boosted demand with tax cuts and subsidies .
in recent months , chinese auto sales have declined steadily , falling from 19.4 percent in june to 17.2 percent in july , according to the china automotive technology and research center .

the rise is largely due to germany 's strong economic performance . germany 's surprisingly good economic performance has made consumers more optimistic about the economy and their personal income , according to a report released on thursday .
the nuremburg-based market research institute gfk bases its monthly forward-looking consumer sentiment index on a survey of about 2,000 german households .
the overall index for september was 4.1 points - the highest in 14 months .
that figure is up from a revised august index of 4 points .
" the extremely good news on the economic development and continued positive reports on the labour market have led to robust consumer sentiment in august , " the gfk report said .
" there are currently good indications that consumer sentiment in germany is experiencing a sustained upward trend . "
the increase was largely due to germany 's higher-than-expected growth in gross domestic product during the second quarter , the gfk said .
the 2.2-percent jump in output was the largest quarterly increase since german reunification in 1990 .
germany 's central bank expects an overall growth of three percent by the end of 2010 .

the rise is largely due to germany 's strong economic performance . germany 's surprisingly good economic performance has made consumers more optimistic about the economy and their personal income , according to a report released on thursday .
the nuremburg-based market research institute gfk bases its monthly forward-looking consumer sentiment index on a survey of about 2,000 german households .
the overall index for september was 4.1 points - the highest in 14 months .
that figure is up from a revised august index of 4 points .
" the extremely good news on the economic development and continued positive reports on the labour market have led to robust consumer sentiment in august , " the gfk report said .
" there are currently good indications that consumer sentiment in germany is experiencing a sustained upward trend . "
the increase was largely due to germany 's higher-than-expected growth in gross domestic product during the second quarter , the gfk said .
the 2.2-percent jump in output was the largest quarterly increase since german reunification in 1990 .
germany 's central bank expects an overall growth of three percent by the end of 2010 .

gm has given the green light for opel to export beyond its core european market . us carmaker gm has decided to allow opel to sell its cars in china , a move expected to lead to even greater competition among its brands in the huge chinese market .
" we will market opel as a european designed car in the premium segment , " company spokesman andreas kroemer told deutsche welle .
" there are a growing number of chinese who like european cars and have the money to afford them . "
opel tested the waters in china last year , selling around 4,000 cars , according to kroemer .
in the first half of 2010 , china passed the united states as gm 's biggest national market .
together with chevy and buick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has become the world 's largest market for new car sales kroemer declined to say which models opel plans to sell in china .
currently , gm markets its cadillac , chevrolet and buick brands in the country , in addition to vehicles manufactured by wuling , a chinese carmaker in which the us auto giant has a 30 percent stake .
until now , vehicles made by opel were only sold outside europe under gm 's buick nameplate .
in addition to china , opel will begin selling vehicles in australia and later in several other markets in the asia-pacific and south american regions , according to kroemer .
" this is great news for opel and i believe the company has good opportunities in the country , " said christoph stuermer , an auto analyst with ihs global insight in frankfurt .
export first , assemble locally later stuermer expects opel will initially export cars to china until it establishes a market position in the country .
but eventually , he said , the company will need to assemble cars locally to avoid import taxes , which can increase the price of vehicles by as much as 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm adds opel to its line of brands in china opel will compete with germany 's other big carmakers , bmw , daimler and volkswagen , which have been operating in china for some time .
china has become the world 's biggest auto market based on the number of new vehicles sold .
automakers around the world are looking to the country to drive revenue amid weak global demand .
but growth has dropped since last year when the government boosted demand with tax cuts and subsidies .
in recent months , chinese auto sales have declined steadily , falling from 19.4 percent in june to 17.2 percent in july , according to the china automotive technology and research center .

in may , bayern munich came closer than any other german club since 2002 to winning the title . bayern - losing finalists against inter milan in may - are among the top seeds and were drawn thursday against as roma , fc basel and cfr cluj in group e of this season 's champions league competition .
the german champions qualified automatically after securing the bundesliga title and therefore avoided the likes of italian giants inter and ac milan , english premiership big-boys manchester united , chelsea and arsenal , spanish champions barcelona and perennial qualifiers lyon from france 's ligue 1 .
clubs from the same country can not not be drawn against each other in the group stage and for tv purposes are kept on opposite sides of the draw as far as possible , so bayern have also avoided playing one of their bundesliga rivals - at least for now .
bayern look to hit the ground running bayern have been slowly building a head of steam in this competition over the past few seasons and since louis van gaal took charge they 've been picking up speed .
from being a team seemingly predestined to get knocked out in the quarterfinals , bayern have quietly developed into a club ready to challenge for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are hoping for happier end to the 2011 competition however , they faltered badly in the early stages of the competition last season , almost crashing out at the group stage with only a heroic performance against juventus preventing them from slipping into the europa league .
but with every passing round , the bavarian giants had an unbeatable air about them .
they marched through against teams like manchester united and lyon with a strange certainty that they would reach the final and had many convinced that they could win it .
unfortunately , it was not to be .
this season , a strong showing against another italian team will be needed .
as roma ran inter milan close to the serie a title last season and will prove obstinate opposition for bayern , especially at the stadio olimpico .
the german champions should have the measure of the italians at home but bayern 's visit to rome could prove tricky .
there should n't be any problem for the germans against fc basel so qualification should be assured , regardless of which way the results go against roma and cluj . if bayern can avoid the pitfalls which almost cost them the chance of making the knockout phase last time and find their european groove earlier this season , then they 'll be a strong bet to repeat their run to the previous final and who knows - perhaps even win it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have yet to fulfill their champions league potential bremen hope to recapture barnstorming form werder bremen , recently qualified at the expense of sampdoria , return to the champions league after a couple of seasons away from europe ’ s premier club competition .
the impressive and dramatic performances by thomas schaaf 's side against their italian opposition in the qualifying round certainly suggests that bremen will be an entertaining addition to the group stages , but how will they fare against teams like reigning champions inter milan , dutch champions fc twente and tottenham hotspurs ?
bremen have never really worried the latter stages of the champions league despite consistently reaching the knockout rounds during their strong , mid-noughties period of bundesliga ascendance .
however , they ’ ve been off the boil for the latter part of the decade and have not managed to regain the consistency which saw them continually challenging for the bundesliga title and qualifying for the champions league .
it remains to be seen how inter milan play under new coach rafa benitez , but however the former liverpool coach chooses to line the european champions up , it 's still effectively the same team that won the trophy last season .
bremen will be in for a fight both at home and away .
they may fancy their chances against new boys tottenham hotspurs but the english premiership side looked far from over-awed in qualifying , so werder will have to draw on their experience to snuff out spurs ' enthusiasm over two games .
fc twente shocked the eredivisie last season under current wolfsburg coach steve mcclaren , so who 's to say they wo n't spring a surprise in the champions league ?
they 're unlikely to win it but they could cause bremen problems .
at best , werder could get through in second but it looks a tough group for the north germans .
schalke faces tough group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope magath and raul can plot a successful course schalke , the third team in the bundesliga trio , have a tricky group consisting of lyon , benfica and happoel tel aviv .
but while schalke teams in the past have been finding their way through european competition with little knowledgeable guidance , they have a hard-headed coach with experience of the business end of the european cup in felix magath .
a winner and runner-up with hamburg as a player , magath coached bayern in three champions league campaigns , reaching the quarterfinals in 2004/05 and the first knockout round the following year .
he also took bayern to the knockout round in the 2006/07 competition but was fired for poor bundesliga form before their quarterfinal defeat to ac milan .
magath also has the most prolific goal scorer in champions league history on his books in the form of raul .
the former real madrid talisman and captain has three champions league winner ’ s medals to his name as well as an unprecedented 66 strikes in the competition .
as a result schalke will be going into this season ’ s champions league with an experienced leader off the pitch and an experienced one on it .
lyon have been here so many times before that they treat the champions league as if it was an extension of their domestic competition .
but , as bayern found out last season , this sometimes works against them .
lyon may not be equipped to deal with both this season , and schalke will hope to get a victory against them either home or away .
benfica could be the wild card in the group .
the portuguese are renowned for swift counterattacking play and their style may be a little cavalier for the germans .
these games could be very hard for schalke .
but the germans should get the points they need to at least challenge for the second qualifying spot against hapoel tel aviv .

the former real madrid talisman and captain has three champions league winner ’ s medals to his name as well as an unprecedented 66 strikes in the competition .
as a result schalke will be going into this season ’ s champions league with an experienced leader off the pitch and an experienced one on it .
lyon have been here so many times before that they treat the champions league as if it was an extension of their domestic competition .
but , as bayern found out last season , this sometimes works against them .
lyon may not be equipped to deal with both this season , and schalke will hope to get a victory against them either home or away .
benfica could be the wild card in the group .
the portuguese are renowned for swift counterattacking play and their style may be a little cavalier for the germans .
these games could be very hard for schalke .
but the germans should get the points they need to at least challenge for the second qualifying spot against hapoel tel aviv .

in may , bayern munich came closer than any other german club since 2002 to winning the title . bayern - losing finalists against inter milan in may - are among the top seeds and were drawn thursday against as roma , fc basel and cfr cluj in group e of this season 's champions league competition .
the german champions qualified automatically after securing the bundesliga title and therefore avoided the likes of italian giants inter and ac milan , english premiership big-boys manchester united , chelsea and arsenal , spanish champions barcelona and perennial qualifiers lyon from france 's ligue 1 .
clubs from the same country can not not be drawn against each other in the group stage and for tv purposes are kept on opposite sides of the draw as far as possible , so bayern have also avoided playing one of their bundesliga rivals - at least for now .
bayern look to hit the ground running bayern have been slowly building a head of steam in this competition over the past few seasons and since louis van gaal took charge they 've been picking up speed .
from being a team seemingly predestined to get knocked out in the quarterfinals , bayern have quietly developed into a club ready to challenge for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are hoping for happier end to the 2011 competition however , they faltered badly in the early stages of the competition last season , almost crashing out at the group stage with only a heroic performance against juventus preventing them from slipping into the europa league .
but with every passing round , the bavarian giants had an unbeatable air about them .
they marched through against teams like manchester united and lyon with a strange certainty that they would reach the final and had many convinced that they could win it .
unfortunately , it was not to be .
this season , a strong showing against another italian team will be needed .
as roma ran inter milan close to the serie a title last season and will prove obstinate opposition for bayern , especially at the stadio olimpico .
the german champions should have the measure of the italians at home but bayern 's visit to rome could prove tricky .
there should n't be any problem for the germans against fc basel so qualification should be assured , regardless of which way the results go against roma and cluj . if bayern can avoid the pitfalls which almost cost them the chance of making the knockout phase last time and find their european groove earlier this season , then they 'll be a strong bet to repeat their run to the previous final and who knows - perhaps even win it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have yet to fulfill their champions league potential bremen hope to recapture barnstorming form werder bremen , recently qualified at the expense of sampdoria , return to the champions league after a couple of seasons away from europe ’ s premier club competition .
the impressive and dramatic performances by thomas schaaf 's side against their italian opposition in the qualifying round certainly suggests that bremen will be an entertaining addition to the group stages , but how will they fare against teams like reigning champions inter milan , dutch champions fc twente and tottenham hotspurs ?
bremen have never really worried the latter stages of the champions league despite consistently reaching the knockout rounds during their strong , mid-noughties period of bundesliga ascendance .
however , they ’ ve been off the boil for the latter part of the decade and have not managed to regain the consistency which saw them continually challenging for the bundesliga title and qualifying for the champions league .
it remains to be seen how inter milan play under new coach rafa benitez , but however the former liverpool coach chooses to line the european champions up , it 's still effectively the same team that won the trophy last season .
bremen will be in for a fight both at home and away .
they may fancy their chances against new boys tottenham hotspurs but the english premiership side looked far from over-awed in qualifying , so werder will have to draw on their experience to snuff out spurs ' enthusiasm over two games .
fc twente shocked the eredivisie last season under current wolfsburg coach steve mcclaren , so who 's to say they wo n't spring a surprise in the champions league ?
they 're unlikely to win it but they could cause bremen problems .
at best , werder could get through in second but it looks a tough group for the north germans .
schalke faces tough group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope magath and raul can plot a successful course schalke , the third team in the bundesliga trio , have a tricky group consisting of lyon , benfica and happoel tel aviv .
but while schalke teams in the past have been finding their way through european competition with little knowledgeable guidance , they have a hard-headed coach with experience of the business end of the european cup in felix magath .
a winner and runner-up with hamburg as a player , magath coached bayern in three champions league campaigns , reaching the quarterfinals in 2004/05 and the first knockout round the following year .
he also took bayern to the knockout round in the 2006/07 competition but was fired for poor bundesliga form before their quarterfinal defeat to ac milan .
magath also has the most prolific goal scorer in champions league history on his books in the form of raul .
the former real madrid talisman and captain has three champions league winner ’ s medals to his name as well as an unprecedented 66 strikes in the competition .

he said serbia , however , would have to " come to terms " with the loss of kosovo as a province . german foreign minister guido westerwelle urged serbia on thursday to drop its challenges to kosovo 's independence and instead focus its energy on joining the european union .
" in our view , one can only be a member of the european union if one aims for cooperation and is prepared to resolve neighborly difficulties cooperatively , " he told reporters in belgrade .
westerwelle used his first visit to serbia to meet with prime minister mirko cvetkovic , president boris tadic and opposition leaders . he expressed his disagreement with a recent resolution against the secession of kosovo presented by the country to the united nations general assembly .
" the independence of kosovo is a reality , " westerwelle said in a speech at the university of belgrade .
" reconciliation is only possible when one grasps the reality . "
germany has joined 68 other countries in recognizing kosovo 's independence , but serbia adamantly opposes it .

western powers hope the results will shift the politics away from ethnic divisions and toward a more unified country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.08.2010 dw experts try their luck again with forecasts for bundesliga round 2 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a trip to the repair shop , the dw crystal ball returns this season , deutsche welle 's sports team are laying it on the line and predicting the results of all the bundesliga matches .
after a less than successful start , see what we predict for the second round . it 's round 2 of the 2010/11 bundesliga season and the dw experts are hoping to do a little better than last week when only one game was predicted correctly .
the crystal ball was obviously on the fritz -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- . the opening weekend of the season is always a lottery for forecasters because there is very little of the season 's form book to refer to so with a little more to go on , we hope to have more success with the next round of games . friday , august 27 kaiserslautern – bayern munich bayern looked boringly comfortable for long stretches against wolfsburg in their opening day win but finished the match with the margin a lot closer than it should have been .
kaiserslautern had a somewhat easier game against cologne and performed well , scoring three goals away from home .
bayern showed class and strength in front of their own supporters but these qualities will be tested on the road .
i can see the champions experiencing a slight , early blip in kaiserslautern . prediction : 2-2 saturday , august 28 schalke – hanover schalke blinked first in their match in hamburg last week and as a result lost to one of the teams which could rival them in the race for european places this season .
it 's early yet and the defeat wo n't end schalke 's challenge , but coach felix magath will be upset to have conceded points to one of the top teams already .
expect the royal blues to respond to magath 's wrath by soundly beating hanover in gelsenkirchen with raul marking his bundesliga home debut with at least one goal . prediction : schalke 3-1 bremen – cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen are back to winning ways .
bad news for cologne few would have expected bremen to be on the end of the kind of score line they normally inflict on the opposition .
losing 4-1 to hoffenheim was the worst possible start for thomas schaaf 's team .
luckily they had a confidence-restoring win in europe during the week to get their heads straight again and with qualification for the champions league group stages assured , werder can focus on climbing back up the bundesliga table .
they will begin their climb with victory over cologne who already look like relegation fodder after capitulating at home to kaiserslautern . prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg – mainz steve mcclaren 's wolves looked disjointed against bayern , but did manage 20 minutes of supreme offensive fotball - enough to give the champions a scare .
however , they looked far from cohesive at the back and even against mainz in their first home game of the season , wolfsburg may still not find the right gear .
mainz produced a good display to heap early woe on stuttgart , a team which finished strongly last season .
i think they 'll worry wolfsburg and grab a goal but the wolves will snatch a draw . prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg hit-man ruud hopes to be on target again reports that ruud van nistlerooy 's legs have gone appear to have been wildly exaggerated .
the dutch striker looked all the better for missing out on world cup action this summer , and as a result hamburg should get at least a good half-season out him before the inevitable wear and tear takes its toll .
frankfurt were unlucky to lose 2-1 to hanover last week and i can see them having a harder time against hsv , especially if ruud is still in the same mood as he was against schalke .
hamburg did n't travel well last season , dropping crucial points away from home , but still i think they 'll edge this one . prediction : hamburg 1-0 nuremberg – freiburg freiburg are going to struggle this season as their opening day defeat to st. pauli indicated . losing 3-1 at home to a newly-promoted side does not bode well for a team which has a long-standing relationship with the lower reaches of the bundesliga .
games like the one coming up against nuremberg need to be won if this is not to be a long fight against relegation for freiburg but i do n't see them getting the full quota of points this week .
the best freiburg can hope for is a draw - but i think they 'll get it . prediction : 1-1 st. pauli – hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will give st. pauli more problems than freiburg st. pauli will be flying after their victory over freiburg but they are in danger of crashing to earth against hoffenheim .
they may have their special supporters behind them on saturday but the gulf in class is likely to be too big for pauli .
one forgets that hoffenheim were once the village team made good , such is their standing in the top division now .
st. pauli might appear to be lambs to the slaughter in the wake of hoffenheim 's giving bremen a hiding , but i think the men from the rhine-neckar will have a harder job in hamburg .
that 's not to say they wo n't still win , though . prediction : hoffenheim 2-0 leverkusen - moenchengladbach bayer leverkusen have started in much the same way as they began last season - and by beating dortmund 2-0 away from home , michael ballack and co. have laid down a marker .
dortmund were tough to beat last year and can be expected to be difficult opponents this season , a fact that adds even more gloss to leverkusen 's win .

after a less than successful start , see what we predict for the second round . it 's round 2 of the 2010/11 bundesliga season and the dw experts are hoping to do a little better than last week when only one game was predicted correctly .
the crystal ball was obviously on the fritz -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- . the opening weekend of the season is always a lottery for forecasters because there is very little of the season 's form book to refer to so with a little more to go on , we hope to have more success with the next round of games . friday , august 27 kaiserslautern – bayern munich bayern looked boringly comfortable for long stretches against wolfsburg in their opening day win but finished the match with the margin a lot closer than it should have been .
kaiserslautern had a somewhat easier game against cologne and performed well , scoring three goals away from home .
bayern showed class and strength in front of their own supporters but these qualities will be tested on the road .
i can see the champions experiencing a slight , early blip in kaiserslautern . prediction : 2-2 saturday , august 28 schalke – hanover schalke blinked first in their match in hamburg last week and as a result lost to one of the teams which could rival them in the race for european places this season .
it 's early yet and the defeat wo n't end schalke 's challenge , but coach felix magath will be upset to have conceded points to one of the top teams already .
expect the royal blues to respond to magath 's wrath by soundly beating hanover in gelsenkirchen with raul marking his bundesliga home debut with at least one goal . prediction : schalke 3-1 bremen – cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen are back to winning ways .
bad news for cologne few would have expected bremen to be on the end of the kind of score line they normally inflict on the opposition .
losing 4-1 to hoffenheim was the worst possible start for thomas schaaf 's team .
luckily they had a confidence-restoring win in europe during the week to get their heads straight again and with qualification for the champions league group stages assured , werder can focus on climbing back up the bundesliga table .
they will begin their climb with victory over cologne who already look like relegation fodder after capitulating at home to kaiserslautern . prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg – mainz steve mcclaren 's wolves looked disjointed against bayern , but did manage 20 minutes of supreme offensive fotball - enough to give the champions a scare .
however , they looked far from cohesive at the back and even against mainz in their first home game of the season , wolfsburg may still not find the right gear .
mainz produced a good display to heap early woe on stuttgart , a team which finished strongly last season .
i think they 'll worry wolfsburg and grab a goal but the wolves will snatch a draw . prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg hit-man ruud hopes to be on target again reports that ruud van nistlerooy 's legs have gone appear to have been wildly exaggerated .
the dutch striker looked all the better for missing out on world cup action this summer , and as a result hamburg should get at least a good half-season out him before the inevitable wear and tear takes its toll .
frankfurt were unlucky to lose 2-1 to hanover last week and i can see them having a harder time against hsv , especially if ruud is still in the same mood as he was against schalke .
hamburg did n't travel well last season , dropping crucial points away from home , but still i think they 'll edge this one . prediction : hamburg 1-0 nuremberg – freiburg freiburg are going to struggle this season as their opening day defeat to st. pauli indicated . losing 3-1 at home to a newly-promoted side does not bode well for a team which has a long-standing relationship with the lower reaches of the bundesliga .
games like the one coming up against nuremberg need to be won if this is not to be a long fight against relegation for freiburg but i do n't see them getting the full quota of points this week .
the best freiburg can hope for is a draw - but i think they 'll get it . prediction : 1-1 st. pauli – hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will give st. pauli more problems than freiburg st. pauli will be flying after their victory over freiburg but they are in danger of crashing to earth against hoffenheim .
they may have their special supporters behind them on saturday but the gulf in class is likely to be too big for pauli .
one forgets that hoffenheim were once the village team made good , such is their standing in the top division now .
st. pauli might appear to be lambs to the slaughter in the wake of hoffenheim 's giving bremen a hiding , but i think the men from the rhine-neckar will have a harder job in hamburg .
that 's not to say they wo n't still win , though . prediction : hoffenheim 2-0 leverkusen - moenchengladbach bayer leverkusen have started in much the same way as they began last season - and by beating dortmund 2-0 away from home , michael ballack and co. have laid down a marker .
dortmund were tough to beat last year and can be expected to be difficult opponents this season , a fact that adds even more gloss to leverkusen 's win .
ballack 's boys will be too much for gladbach who just scraped a draw with nuremberg last week . prediction : leverkusen 3-1 sunday , august 29 stuttgart – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart boss christian gross hopes for something to clap both teams expected more from their opening games in which both were defeated , and both will be eager to put those false starts behind them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 26.08.2010 no angels hiv trial shows difficulty of proving guilt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benaissa was diagnosed with hiv when she was pregnant the trial of the former singer of the girl group no angels demonstrates how hard it is to prove if someone definitely infected another person with hiv .
but the law cracks down on those who risk infecting others . having unprotected sex with a partner who is not aware of his or her partner 's hiv infection , is a criminal offense in germany , but , medically , it is hard to trace the source of an infection .
a ruling in 1988 , which forced those infected with hiv to declare their condition to sexual partners , is the current legal basis for the trial of the former singer of the girl group no angels , nadja benaissa .
" at the moment , the law states that anyone who is infected must insist on using protection or inform his or her partner of the infection , " felix damm , a lawyer specializing in media and copyright law , told deutsche welle .
" if he or she does not do that , they 're committing a crime , " he says .
aggravated assault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infecting someone with hiv during unprotected sex is a crime in germany the offense is classed as grievous bodily harm , or aggravated assault , because " an hiv infection is incurable and , when it leads to aids , is also lethal , " said damm .
it carries a sentence of six months to 10 years .
it is been more than two decades since the first person was convicted based on the 1988 ruling , some of them because they deliberately infected sexual partners , others were convicted because they were simply careless .
in june 2007 , for example , a 38-year-old man from the western city of cologne was sentenced to eight years in prison for deliberately passing on the hi virus to four women .
he even sent them text messages saying " have fun with hiv " .
the latest case was that of a decorator in the northern city of kiel in june 2010 , who was sentenced to five years in jail for infecting two women with hiv during unprotected sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is often hard to determine the source of the infection medical tests tricky it is not always easy , however , to prove who passed on the virus to a person .
" you can do certain tests to find out if two viruses from two individual people are closely related , " claudia kuecherer from the robert-koch institute told deutsche welle .
" but there 's no absolute proof that would hold up in court .
these so-called phylogenetic tests ca n't ascertain the direction of the infection , " she explained .
proof is even harder to obtain , the more time passes from the time of the infection .
the virus mutates very quickly after the point of infection , making it harder to ascertain if it is related to the virus of the person who passed it on .
as a result , medical tests are not the only evidence used to reach a verdict .
taking responsibility over two decades have passed since the 1988 ruling and some believe it is time for a review of the law used in cases like that of benaissa , based on the fact that , these days , people are much more aware of hiv and should therefore , be in a position to act responsibly .
" i think everyone should be responsible and take precautions , whether they have hiv or not " damm told deutsche welle .
" and if we apply that principle of responsibility to our criminal law , then people who have hiv would not necessarily have to declare their infection and would therefore no longer commit an offense , " he said .

but the law cracks down on those who risk infecting others . having unprotected sex with a partner who is not aware of his or her partner 's hiv infection , is a criminal offense in germany , but , medically , it is hard to trace the source of an infection .
a ruling in 1988 , which forced those infected with hiv to declare their condition to sexual partners , is the current legal basis for the trial of the former singer of the girl group no angels , nadja benaissa .
" at the moment , the law states that anyone who is infected must insist on using protection or inform his or her partner of the infection , " felix damm , a lawyer specializing in media and copyright law , told deutsche welle .
" if he or she does not do that , they 're committing a crime , " he says .
aggravated assault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infecting someone with hiv during unprotected sex is a crime in germany the offense is classed as grievous bodily harm , or aggravated assault , because " an hiv infection is incurable and , when it leads to aids , is also lethal , " said damm .
it carries a sentence of six months to 10 years .
it is been more than two decades since the first person was convicted based on the 1988 ruling , some of them because they deliberately infected sexual partners , others were convicted because they were simply careless .
in june 2007 , for example , a 38-year-old man from the western city of cologne was sentenced to eight years in prison for deliberately passing on the hi virus to four women .
he even sent them text messages saying " have fun with hiv " .
the latest case was that of a decorator in the northern city of kiel in june 2010 , who was sentenced to five years in jail for infecting two women with hiv during unprotected sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is often hard to determine the source of the infection medical tests tricky it is not always easy , however , to prove who passed on the virus to a person .
" you can do certain tests to find out if two viruses from two individual people are closely related , " claudia kuecherer from the robert-koch institute told deutsche welle .
" but there 's no absolute proof that would hold up in court .
these so-called phylogenetic tests ca n't ascertain the direction of the infection , " she explained .
proof is even harder to obtain , the more time passes from the time of the infection .
the virus mutates very quickly after the point of infection , making it harder to ascertain if it is related to the virus of the person who passed it on .
as a result , medical tests are not the only evidence used to reach a verdict .
taking responsibility over two decades have passed since the 1988 ruling and some believe it is time for a review of the law used in cases like that of benaissa , based on the fact that , these days , people are much more aware of hiv and should therefore , be in a position to act responsibly .
" i think everyone should be responsible and take precautions , whether they have hiv or not " damm told deutsche welle .
" and if we apply that principle of responsibility to our criminal law , then people who have hiv would not necessarily have to declare their infection and would therefore no longer commit an offense , " he said .

he said serbia , however , would have to " come to terms " with the loss of kosovo as a province . german foreign minister guido westerwelle urged serbia on thursday to drop its challenges to kosovo 's independence and instead focus its energy on joining the european union .
" in our view , one can only be a member of the european union if one aims for cooperation and is prepared to resolve neighborly difficulties cooperatively , " he told reporters in belgrade .
westerwelle used his first visit to serbia to meet with prime minister mirko cvetkovic , president boris tadic and opposition leaders . he expressed his disagreement with a recent resolution against the secession of kosovo presented by the country to the united nations general assembly .
" the independence of kosovo is a reality , " westerwelle said in a speech at the university of belgrade .
" reconciliation is only possible when one grasps the reality . "
germany has joined 68 other countries in recognizing kosovo 's independence , but serbia adamantly opposes it .
in july , the international court of justice found kosovo 's secession was in line with international law . serbia rejected the ruling and instead is pressing the un to restart talks on the state 's status .
a european resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence has been a highly controversial subject westerwelle said the eu would be willing to broker direct talks between serbia and kosovo to resolve the dispute and questioned serbia 's choice to take the issue to the un instead .
" when someone in europe wants to solve something including conflicts -lsb- … -rsb- the road should first lead to brussels , not to new york , " he said .
on to bosnia , kosovo later thursday , westerwelle is to visit the bosnian capital , sarajevo , where proposed political reforms have long been stalled . parliamentary and presidential elections are scheduled for october .
western powers hope the results will shift the politics away from ethnic divisions and toward a more unified country .
but with two rival autonomous regions , the mainly muslim and croat federation of bosnia and herzegovina and serb-majority republika srpska , bosnia and herzegovina is the most politically unstable of the former yugoslav republics .
westerwelle began his tour in croatia on wednesday , where he provided an optimistic outlook for the country 's prospects of joining the eu .
he continues to kosovo on friday , where he is to visit the 1,400-strong german contingent of kfor , nato 's peacekeeping force in kosovo .

the 28-year-old benaissa is a member of the popular girl band no angels . she discovered she was hiv positive in 1999 when she was three months pregnant .
she was arrested in april 2009 for having unprotected sex with three men in 2004 and 2006 and failing to inform them of her hiv status .
to do so can be classified as aggravated assault under german law .
both the state prosecutor peter liesenfeld and her defense had asked the courts for the suspended sentence in the trial , which ended on wednesday .
liesenfeld cited her confession and her expression of remorse as reasons for lighter sentence .
" i made a huge mistake , " benaissa said in an emotional apology during the closing arguments .
" i am sorry from the bottom of my heart , " she said . " i would love to turn back the clock , but i ca n't . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.08.2010 dw experts try their luck again with forecasts for bundesliga round 2 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a trip to the repair shop , the dw crystal ball returns this season , deutsche welle 's sports team are laying it on the line and predicting the results of all the bundesliga matches .
after a less than successful start , see what we predict for the second round . it 's round 2 of the 2010/11 bundesliga season and the dw experts are hoping to do a little better than last week when only one game was predicted correctly .
the crystal ball was obviously on the fritz -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- . the opening weekend of the season is always a lottery for forecasters because there is very little of the season 's form book to refer to so with a little more to go on , we hope to have more success with the next round of games . friday , august 27 kaiserslautern – bayern munich bayern looked boringly comfortable for long stretches against wolfsburg in their opening day win but finished the match with the margin a lot closer than it should have been .
kaiserslautern had a somewhat easier game against cologne and performed well , scoring three goals away from home .
bayern showed class and strength in front of their own supporters but these qualities will be tested on the road .
i can see the champions experiencing a slight , early blip in kaiserslautern . prediction : 2-2 saturday , august 28 schalke – hanover schalke blinked first in their match in hamburg last week and as a result lost to one of the teams which could rival them in the race for european places this season .
it 's early yet and the defeat wo n't end schalke 's challenge , but coach felix magath will be upset to have conceded points to one of the top teams already .
expect the royal blues to respond to magath 's wrath by soundly beating hanover in gelsenkirchen with raul marking his bundesliga home debut with at least one goal . prediction : schalke 3-1 bremen – cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen are back to winning ways .
bad news for cologne few would have expected bremen to be on the end of the kind of score line they normally inflict on the opposition .
losing 4-1 to hoffenheim was the worst possible start for thomas schaaf 's team .
luckily they had a confidence-restoring win in europe during the week to get their heads straight again and with qualification for the champions league group stages assured , werder can focus on climbing back up the bundesliga table .
they will begin their climb with victory over cologne who already look like relegation fodder after capitulating at home to kaiserslautern . prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg – mainz steve mcclaren 's wolves looked disjointed against bayern , but did manage 20 minutes of supreme offensive fotball - enough to give the champions a scare .
however , they looked far from cohesive at the back and even against mainz in their first home game of the season , wolfsburg may still not find the right gear .
mainz produced a good display to heap early woe on stuttgart , a team which finished strongly last season .
i think they 'll worry wolfsburg and grab a goal but the wolves will snatch a draw . prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg hit-man ruud hopes to be on target again reports that ruud van nistlerooy 's legs have gone appear to have been wildly exaggerated .
the dutch striker looked all the better for missing out on world cup action this summer , and as a result hamburg should get at least a good half-season out him before the inevitable wear and tear takes its toll .
frankfurt were unlucky to lose 2-1 to hanover last week and i can see them having a harder time against hsv , especially if ruud is still in the same mood as he was against schalke .
hamburg did n't travel well last season , dropping crucial points away from home , but still i think they 'll edge this one . prediction : hamburg 1-0 nuremberg – freiburg freiburg are going to struggle this season as their opening day defeat to st. pauli indicated . losing 3-1 at home to a newly-promoted side does not bode well for a team which has a long-standing relationship with the lower reaches of the bundesliga .
games like the one coming up against nuremberg need to be won if this is not to be a long fight against relegation for freiburg but i do n't see them getting the full quota of points this week .
the best freiburg can hope for is a draw - but i think they 'll get it . prediction : 1-1 st. pauli – hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will give st. pauli more problems than freiburg st. pauli will be flying after their victory over freiburg but they are in danger of crashing to earth against hoffenheim .
they may have their special supporters behind them on saturday but the gulf in class is likely to be too big for pauli .
one forgets that hoffenheim were once the village team made good , such is their standing in the top division now .
st. pauli might appear to be lambs to the slaughter in the wake of hoffenheim 's giving bremen a hiding , but i think the men from the rhine-neckar will have a harder job in hamburg .
that 's not to say they wo n't still win , though . prediction : hoffenheim 2-0 leverkusen - moenchengladbach bayer leverkusen have started in much the same way as they began last season - and by beating dortmund 2-0 away from home , michael ballack and co. have laid down a marker .
dortmund were tough to beat last year and can be expected to be difficult opponents this season , a fact that adds even more gloss to leverkusen 's win .
ballack 's boys will be too much for gladbach who just scraped a draw with nuremberg last week . prediction : leverkusen 3-1 sunday , august 29 stuttgart – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart boss christian gross hopes for something to clap both teams expected more from their opening games in which both were defeated , and both will be eager to put those false starts behind them .
however , stuttgart and dortmund both saw europa league action on thursday and could be running on fumes as they seek full fitness in the early season . whatever happens , these two sides will give whatever they 've got .
i see dortmund edging stuttgart through sheer power . prediction : dortmund 2-1 last week 's result : 5 points bayern – wolfsburg 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:1 , one point -rrb- hoffenheim – bremen 4:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:2 , one point -rrb- moenchengladbach – nuremberg 1:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , no points -rrb- cologne – kaiserslautern 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- freiburg – st. pauli 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- hanover – frankfurt 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , no points -rrb- hamburg – schalke 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , three points -rrb- mainz – stuttgart 2:0 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , no points -rrb- dortmund – leverkusen 0:2 -lrb- dw prediction 2:2 , no points -rrb- three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a less than successful start , see what we predict for the second round . it 's round 2 of the 2010/11 bundesliga season and the dw experts are hoping to do a little better than last week when only one game was predicted correctly .
the crystal ball was obviously on the fritz -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- . the opening weekend of the season is always a lottery for forecasters because there is very little of the season 's form book to refer to so with a little more to go on , we hope to have more success with the next round of games . friday , august 27 kaiserslautern – bayern munich bayern looked boringly comfortable for long stretches against wolfsburg in their opening day win but finished the match with the margin a lot closer than it should have been .
kaiserslautern had a somewhat easier game against cologne and performed well , scoring three goals away from home .
bayern showed class and strength in front of their own supporters but these qualities will be tested on the road .
i can see the champions experiencing a slight , early blip in kaiserslautern . prediction : 2-2 saturday , august 28 schalke – hanover schalke blinked first in their match in hamburg last week and as a result lost to one of the teams which could rival them in the race for european places this season .
it 's early yet and the defeat wo n't end schalke 's challenge , but coach felix magath will be upset to have conceded points to one of the top teams already .
expect the royal blues to respond to magath 's wrath by soundly beating hanover in gelsenkirchen with raul marking his bundesliga home debut with at least one goal . prediction : schalke 3-1 bremen – cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen are back to winning ways .
bad news for cologne few would have expected bremen to be on the end of the kind of score line they normally inflict on the opposition .
losing 4-1 to hoffenheim was the worst possible start for thomas schaaf 's team .
luckily they had a confidence-restoring win in europe during the week to get their heads straight again and with qualification for the champions league group stages assured , werder can focus on climbing back up the bundesliga table .
they will begin their climb with victory over cologne who already look like relegation fodder after capitulating at home to kaiserslautern . prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg – mainz steve mcclaren 's wolves looked disjointed against bayern , but did manage 20 minutes of supreme offensive fotball - enough to give the champions a scare .
however , they looked far from cohesive at the back and even against mainz in their first home game of the season , wolfsburg may still not find the right gear .
mainz produced a good display to heap early woe on stuttgart , a team which finished strongly last season .
i think they 'll worry wolfsburg and grab a goal but the wolves will snatch a draw . prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg hit-man ruud hopes to be on target again reports that ruud van nistlerooy 's legs have gone appear to have been wildly exaggerated .
the dutch striker looked all the better for missing out on world cup action this summer , and as a result hamburg should get at least a good half-season out him before the inevitable wear and tear takes its toll .
frankfurt were unlucky to lose 2-1 to hanover last week and i can see them having a harder time against hsv , especially if ruud is still in the same mood as he was against schalke .
hamburg did n't travel well last season , dropping crucial points away from home , but still i think they 'll edge this one . prediction : hamburg 1-0 nuremberg – freiburg freiburg are going to struggle this season as their opening day defeat to st. pauli indicated . losing 3-1 at home to a newly-promoted side does not bode well for a team which has a long-standing relationship with the lower reaches of the bundesliga .
games like the one coming up against nuremberg need to be won if this is not to be a long fight against relegation for freiburg but i do n't see them getting the full quota of points this week .
the best freiburg can hope for is a draw - but i think they 'll get it . prediction : 1-1 st. pauli – hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will give st. pauli more problems than freiburg st. pauli will be flying after their victory over freiburg but they are in danger of crashing to earth against hoffenheim .
they may have their special supporters behind them on saturday but the gulf in class is likely to be too big for pauli .
one forgets that hoffenheim were once the village team made good , such is their standing in the top division now .
st. pauli might appear to be lambs to the slaughter in the wake of hoffenheim 's giving bremen a hiding , but i think the men from the rhine-neckar will have a harder job in hamburg .
that 's not to say they wo n't still win , though . prediction : hoffenheim 2-0 leverkusen - moenchengladbach bayer leverkusen have started in much the same way as they began last season - and by beating dortmund 2-0 away from home , michael ballack and co. have laid down a marker .

he said serbia , however , would have to " come to terms " with the loss of kosovo as a province . german foreign minister guido westerwelle urged serbia on thursday to drop its challenges to kosovo 's independence and instead focus its energy on joining the european union .
" in our view , one can only be a member of the european union if one aims for cooperation and is prepared to resolve neighborly difficulties cooperatively , " he told reporters in belgrade .
westerwelle used his first visit to serbia to meet with prime minister mirko cvetkovic , president boris tadic and opposition leaders . he expressed his disagreement with a recent resolution against the secession of kosovo presented by the country to the united nations general assembly .
" the independence of kosovo is a reality , " westerwelle said in a speech at the university of belgrade .
" reconciliation is only possible when one grasps the reality . "
germany has joined 68 other countries in recognizing kosovo 's independence , but serbia adamantly opposes it .
in july , the international court of justice found kosovo 's secession was in line with international law . serbia rejected the ruling and instead is pressing the un to restart talks on the state 's status .
a european resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence has been a highly controversial subject westerwelle said the eu would be willing to broker direct talks between serbia and kosovo to resolve the dispute and questioned serbia 's choice to take the issue to the un instead .
" when someone in europe wants to solve something including conflicts -lsb- … -rsb- the road should first lead to brussels , not to new york , " he said .
on to bosnia , kosovo later thursday , westerwelle is to visit the bosnian capital , sarajevo , where proposed political reforms have long been stalled . parliamentary and presidential elections are scheduled for october .
western powers hope the results will shift the politics away from ethnic divisions and toward a more unified country .
but with two rival autonomous regions , the mainly muslim and croat federation of bosnia and herzegovina and serb-majority republika srpska , bosnia and herzegovina is the most politically unstable of the former yugoslav republics .
westerwelle began his tour in croatia on wednesday , where he provided an optimistic outlook for the country 's prospects of joining the eu .
he continues to kosovo on friday , where he is to visit the 1,400-strong german contingent of kfor , nato 's peacekeeping force in kosovo .

in may , bayern munich came closer than any other german club since 2002 to winning the title . bayern - losing finalists against inter milan in may - are among the top seeds and were drawn thursday against as roma , fc basel and cfr cluj in group e of this season 's champions league competition .
the german champions qualified automatically after securing the bundesliga title and therefore avoided the likes of italian giants inter and ac milan , english premiership big-boys manchester united , chelsea and arsenal , spanish champions barcelona and perennial qualifiers lyon from france 's ligue 1 .
clubs from the same country can not not be drawn against each other in the group stage and for tv purposes are kept on opposite sides of the draw as far as possible , so bayern have also avoided playing one of their bundesliga rivals - at least for now .
bayern look to hit the ground running bayern have been slowly building a head of steam in this competition over the past few seasons and since louis van gaal took charge they 've been picking up speed .
from being a team seemingly predestined to get knocked out in the quarterfinals , bayern have quietly developed into a club ready to challenge for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are hoping for happier end to the 2011 competition however , they faltered badly in the early stages of the competition last season , almost crashing out at the group stage with only a heroic performance against juventus preventing them from slipping into the europa league .
but with every passing round , the bavarian giants had an unbeatable air about them .
they marched through against teams like manchester united and lyon with a strange certainty that they would reach the final and had many convinced that they could win it .
unfortunately , it was not to be .
this season , a strong showing against another italian team will be needed .
as roma ran inter milan close to the serie a title last season and will prove obstinate opposition for bayern , especially at the stadio olimpico .
the german champions should have the measure of the italians at home but bayern 's visit to rome could prove tricky .
there should n't be any problem for the germans against fc basel so qualification should be assured , regardless of which way the results go against roma and cluj . if bayern can avoid the pitfalls which almost cost them the chance of making the knockout phase last time and find their european groove earlier this season , then they 'll be a strong bet to repeat their run to the previous final and who knows - perhaps even win it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have yet to fulfill their champions league potential bremen hope to recapture barnstorming form werder bremen , recently qualified at the expense of sampdoria , return to the champions league after a couple of seasons away from europe ’ s premier club competition .
the impressive and dramatic performances by thomas schaaf 's side against their italian opposition in the qualifying round certainly suggests that bremen will be an entertaining addition to the group stages , but how will they fare against teams like reigning champions inter milan , dutch champions fc twente and tottenham hotspurs ?
bremen have never really worried the latter stages of the champions league despite consistently reaching the knockout rounds during their strong , mid-noughties period of bundesliga ascendance .
however , they ’ ve been off the boil for the latter part of the decade and have not managed to regain the consistency which saw them continually challenging for the bundesliga title and qualifying for the champions league .
it remains to be seen how inter milan play under new coach rafa benitez , but however the former liverpool coach chooses to line the european champions up , it 's still effectively the same team that won the trophy last season .
bremen will be in for a fight both at home and away .
they may fancy their chances against new boys tottenham hotspurs but the english premiership side looked far from over-awed in qualifying , so werder will have to draw on their experience to snuff out spurs ' enthusiasm over two games .
fc twente shocked the eredivisie last season under current wolfsburg coach steve mcclaren , so who 's to say they wo n't spring a surprise in the champions league ?
they 're unlikely to win it but they could cause bremen problems .
at best , werder could get through in second but it looks a tough group for the north germans .
schalke faces tough group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope magath and raul can plot a successful course schalke , the third team in the bundesliga trio , have a tricky group consisting of lyon , benfica and happoel tel aviv .
but while schalke teams in the past have been finding their way through european competition with little knowledgeable guidance , they have a hard-headed coach with experience of the business end of the european cup in felix magath .
a winner and runner-up with hamburg as a player , magath coached bayern in three champions league campaigns , reaching the quarterfinals in 2004/05 and the first knockout round the following year .
he also took bayern to the knockout round in the 2006/07 competition but was fired for poor bundesliga form before their quarterfinal defeat to ac milan .
magath also has the most prolific goal scorer in champions league history on his books in the form of raul .
the former real madrid talisman and captain has three champions league winner ’ s medals to his name as well as an unprecedented 66 strikes in the competition .
as a result schalke will be going into this season ’ s champions league with an experienced leader off the pitch and an experienced one on it .
lyon have been here so many times before that they treat the champions league as if it was an extension of their domestic competition .
but , as bayern found out last season , this sometimes works against them .
lyon may not be equipped to deal with both this season , and schalke will hope to get a victory against them either home or away .
benfica could be the wild card in the group .
the portuguese are renowned for swift counterattacking play and their style may be a little cavalier for the germans .
these games could be very hard for schalke .
but the germans should get the points they need to at least challenge for the second qualifying spot against hapoel tel aviv .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have yet to fulfill their champions league potential bremen hope to recapture barnstorming form werder bremen , recently qualified at the expense of sampdoria , return to the champions league after a couple of seasons away from europe ’ s premier club competition .
the impressive and dramatic performances by thomas schaaf 's side against their italian opposition in the qualifying round certainly suggests that bremen will be an entertaining addition to the group stages , but how will they fare against teams like reigning champions inter milan , dutch champions fc twente and tottenham hotspurs ?
bremen have never really worried the latter stages of the champions league despite consistently reaching the knockout rounds during their strong , mid-noughties period of bundesliga ascendance .
however , they ’ ve been off the boil for the latter part of the decade and have not managed to regain the consistency which saw them continually challenging for the bundesliga title and qualifying for the champions league .
it remains to be seen how inter milan play under new coach rafa benitez , but however the former liverpool coach chooses to line the european champions up , it 's still effectively the same team that won the trophy last season .
bremen will be in for a fight both at home and away .
they may fancy their chances against new boys tottenham hotspurs but the english premiership side looked far from over-awed in qualifying , so werder will have to draw on their experience to snuff out spurs ' enthusiasm over two games .
fc twente shocked the eredivisie last season under current wolfsburg coach steve mcclaren , so who 's to say they wo n't spring a surprise in the champions league ?
they 're unlikely to win it but they could cause bremen problems .
at best , werder could get through in second but it looks a tough group for the north germans .
schalke faces tough group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope magath and raul can plot a successful course schalke , the third team in the bundesliga trio , have a tricky group consisting of lyon , benfica and happoel tel aviv .
but while schalke teams in the past have been finding their way through european competition with little knowledgeable guidance , they have a hard-headed coach with experience of the business end of the european cup in felix magath .
a winner and runner-up with hamburg as a player , magath coached bayern in three champions league campaigns , reaching the quarterfinals in 2004/05 and the first knockout round the following year .
he also took bayern to the knockout round in the 2006/07 competition but was fired for poor bundesliga form before their quarterfinal defeat to ac milan .
magath also has the most prolific goal scorer in champions league history on his books in the form of raul .
the former real madrid talisman and captain has three champions league winner ’ s medals to his name as well as an unprecedented 66 strikes in the competition .
as a result schalke will be going into this season ’ s champions league with an experienced leader off the pitch and an experienced one on it .
lyon have been here so many times before that they treat the champions league as if it was an extension of their domestic competition .
but , as bayern found out last season , this sometimes works against them .
lyon may not be equipped to deal with both this season , and schalke will hope to get a victory against them either home or away .
benfica could be the wild card in the group .
the portuguese are renowned for swift counterattacking play and their style may be a little cavalier for the germans .
these games could be very hard for schalke .
but the germans should get the points they need to at least challenge for the second qualifying spot against hapoel tel aviv .

in may , bayern munich came closer than any other german club since 2002 to winning the title . bayern - losing finalists against inter milan in may - are among the top seeds and were drawn thursday against as roma , fc basel and cfr cluj in group e of this season 's champions league competition .
the german champions qualified automatically after securing the bundesliga title and therefore avoided the likes of italian giants inter and ac milan , english premiership big-boys manchester united , chelsea and arsenal , spanish champions barcelona and perennial qualifiers lyon from france 's ligue 1 .
clubs from the same country can not not be drawn against each other in the group stage and for tv purposes are kept on opposite sides of the draw as far as possible , so bayern have also avoided playing one of their bundesliga rivals - at least for now .
bayern look to hit the ground running bayern have been slowly building a head of steam in this competition over the past few seasons and since louis van gaal took charge they 've been picking up speed .
from being a team seemingly predestined to get knocked out in the quarterfinals , bayern have quietly developed into a club ready to challenge for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are hoping for happier end to the 2011 competition however , they faltered badly in the early stages of the competition last season , almost crashing out at the group stage with only a heroic performance against juventus preventing them from slipping into the europa league .
but with every passing round , the bavarian giants had an unbeatable air about them .
they marched through against teams like manchester united and lyon with a strange certainty that they would reach the final and had many convinced that they could win it .
unfortunately , it was not to be .
this season , a strong showing against another italian team will be needed .
as roma ran inter milan close to the serie a title last season and will prove obstinate opposition for bayern , especially at the stadio olimpico .
the german champions should have the measure of the italians at home but bayern 's visit to rome could prove tricky .
there should n't be any problem for the germans against fc basel so qualification should be assured , regardless of which way the results go against roma and cluj . if bayern can avoid the pitfalls which almost cost them the chance of making the knockout phase last time and find their european groove earlier this season , then they 'll be a strong bet to repeat their run to the previous final and who knows - perhaps even win it ?

gm has given the green light for opel to export beyond its core european market . us carmaker gm has decided to allow opel to sell its cars in china , a move expected to lead to even greater competition among its brands in the huge chinese market .
" we will market opel as a european designed car in the premium segment , " company spokesman andreas kroemer told deutsche welle .
" there are a growing number of chinese who like european cars and have the money to afford them . "

the rise is largely due to germany 's strong economic performance . germany 's surprisingly good economic performance has made consumers more optimistic about the economy and their personal income , according to a report released on thursday .
the nuremburg-based market research institute gfk bases its monthly forward-looking consumer sentiment index on a survey of about 2,000 german households .
the overall index for september was 4.1 points - the highest in 14 months .
that figure is up from a revised august index of 4 points .
" the extremely good news on the economic development and continued positive reports on the labour market have led to robust consumer sentiment in august , " the gfk report said .
" there are currently good indications that consumer sentiment in germany is experiencing a sustained upward trend . "
the increase was largely due to germany 's higher-than-expected growth in gross domestic product during the second quarter , the gfk said .
the 2.2-percent jump in output was the largest quarterly increase since german reunification in 1990 .
germany 's central bank expects an overall growth of three percent by the end of 2010 .

the coral triangle , which stretches across the seas of malaysia , indonesia , papua new guinea , the philippines , the solomon islands and timor-leste is particularly at risk . tiomen island , the perhentian islands and pulao payar off the malaysian coast have all been affected by the bleaching of the corals .
once extremely popular sites for divers , they have now been closed off indefinitely to give the corals space and time to recover . rising sea temperatures is one of the causes behind the bleaching of the corals .
when the corals die , only their chalkstone structure remains . coral reefs susceptible to bleaching coral reefs are expected to become even more susceptible to bleaching in the next 30 years . scientists and environmentalists fear that the coral triangle could disappear within a century .
" if we travel down that road in which we do n't take action against climate change to the level that we should , we see a world in which 50 years from now in which coral reefs are a remnant of what they are today , in fact they may be actually functionally extinct , " says ove hoegh-guldberg from the university of queensland .

moreover , the coral reefs are the habitat for millions of fish and other species providing livelihood to millions of residents along the shores of the coral triangle . ove hoegh-guldberg says the death of the coral reefs could be catastrophic , " by the end of the century under the worst case scenario we could see as much as 90 percent of those food resources as having eroded .
you start to see that you 're now destabilizing human communities through the fact that there 's just not enough food .

the protestors were then removed and arrested by special police forces .
other demonstrators blocked train platforms , causing a high-speed tgv train to paris to be delayed by about an hour .

the " stuttgart 21 " construction project is to link the city with one of europe 's longest high-speed rail lines by converting it from a terminus , which forces trains to pull in and out , to an underground through-station that trains can pass through .

environmentalists say the current plan is not necessary and that its effect on rail traffic would be limited .

on thursday several demonstrators climbed onto a roof , temporarily stopping the demolition . police in stuttgart say that work to raze part of the city 's old aboveground train station was stopped for several hours on thursday when seven people occupied part of the building 's roof .
the protestors were then removed and arrested by special police forces .
other demonstrators blocked train platforms , causing a high-speed tgv train to paris to be delayed by about an hour .
construction workers began the demolition of the north wing of the stuttgart train station under police protection on wednesday , as thousands continued to demonstrate against the renovation project .
activists claimed 12,000 people had participated in the protests , while police put the number at 6,000 .
up to 50,000 demonstrators are anticipated on friday .
growing tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tension between protestors and police is growing demonstrations against the project have been going on for weeks , and their growing boldness has raised tensions .
the police president in stuttgart , siegfried stumpf , said wednesday 's protests had " lost their peaceful character . "
" this has moved way beyond understandable protests and civil disobedience , " he said , saying firefighters and rescue workers had been harassed and that groups blockading streets had thrown bottles .
a spokesman for the park protectors group , which opposes the project , denied any violence and said that " the politicians , through the police , are trying to criminalize us . "
the " stuttgart 21 " construction project is to link the city with one of europe 's longest high-speed rail lines by converting it from a terminus , which forces trains to pull in and out , to an underground through-station that trains can pass through .
supporters say the project will cut down travel times , create jobs and attract investors , but opponents say its estimated cost of seven billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- is too high .
environmentalists say the current plan is not necessary and that its effect on rail traffic would be limited .

its sponsors say the nuclear power fight is post-war germany 's largest-ever economic dispute . in the midst of an ongoing debate over whether to extend the lifespan of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , a new report has revealed that the continued availability of nuclear power would likely cause a decrease in investment into renewable energies .
increases in wind and solar energy capacities will eventually lead to nuclear power plants being used less , the report states .
the reason : energy from renewable sources enjoys legal priority over nuclear and coal power .
it is fed into the grid before electricity from non-renewable sources .
as the capacity of electricity from wind or solar sources increases , conventional electricity sources will only be needed to fill in gaps when there is a lack of wind or sun .
but it takes about 50 hours to restart a nuclear power plant that has been completely shut down , meaning it would be necessary to keep the plant running at 50 or 60 percent capacity .
gas powered turbines , however , can be turned on within 20 minutes and can also be run on biogas .
other possibilities to bridge fluctuations in renewable electricity output include the decentralized approach of using micro-power stations or accessing the batteries of electric cars .
companies likely to fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conventional power might only be needed when the wind is n't blowing germany 's four largest energy companies - e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw - will do everything in their power to avoid losing billions on their investments into nuclear power , the report assumes .
supposing the lifespans of the power plant are increased by 28 years , energy companies will have to come to terms with turning them off some 15,800 times between 2020 and the date when the last plant is shut down .
that would cost them between 21 and 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 26.7 billion to $ 101.7 billion -rrb- , unless they successfully lobby to overturn the priority that electricity from renewable sources enjoys and pushed for the construction of those sources to be capped .
gero lucking , of the renewable energy company lichtblick , which sponsored the study , described the dilemma as the " largest post-war economic dispute " in germany .
olav hohmeyer , professor of economics and energy and environmental management at the university of flensburg , authored the study .
according to hohmeyer , electricity needs can entirely be met through renewable energy sources by 2050 .
nuclear power plant lifespans will not need to be extended , nor will there be an electricity deficit to be covered by new coal-fired power plants .
" nuclear power plants are not flexible enough to safely react to changing weather conditions and compensate for fluctuations in wind and sunshine , " hohmeyer said .
hohmeyer 's report states the last nuclear power plant can be removed from the grid in 2023 and the last coal-fired power plant in 2046 .
extending the lifespans of nuclear power plants by 40 years in germany - as has been proposed by the government - would damage vital investment interests and set back the switch to renewable energy by decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased renewable energy could curb the need for nuclear energy monopoly-like structures florian noto of the german nature conservancy represents a group of 21 environmental organizations banded together against nuclear energy .
he said an already-permitted nuclear power plant can generate inexpensive electricity for energy companies , when nuclear waste , risk-based costs and insurance are not taken into account .
" a newly-constructed eco-power plant ca n't necessarily keep up , " he told deutsche welle .
" if the old nuclear power plants just keep running , then progress wo n't be made and little will be invested -lsb- … -rsb- it would actually lead to an investment bottleneck . "
noto also pointed out that four of the 17 nuclear power plants in germany were out of commission for more than 10 months during 2009 , and that at times as many as eight of them were out of commission .
a more diverse and decentralized energy market could lead to lower electricity prices for consumers , according to noto .
" the fact is these companies are actually too dominant , and an economic counterweight needs to be created .
if more new energy companies join this market - if the market is expanded - then that will lead to these monopolistic structures going away , " he said .
electricity from renewable sources will become less expensive in comparison to conventionally generated electricity as prices of raw materials rise , the report states .
by 2050 its additional monthly price compared to conventionally generated electricity could be between just three and 17 euros for an average household using 3,000 kilowatt hours .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 26.08.2010 concerns raised over security of new german id cards großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new id cards include a chip containing encrypted data from november 2010 anyone needing a new id card in germany will be able to get a feature-rich enhanced card , which stores a host of data .
but experts are not impressed by the security features on the new id cards . the german government is introducing new id cards from november .
the new cards , the size of a standard credit card , will have additional functions alongside the standard personal information .
an embedded chip will contain a digital photo and encrypted personal data .
this new feature will allow card-holders to make online transactions with state authorities .
german interior minister thomas de maiziere is confident that the new cards will be more secure than older versions : " with these new id cards , we 'll have the highest-ever level of security for all legally binding online activities , " de maiziere said .
danger from hackers but experts have raised doubts about this assertion .
some are worried that the new cards are not secure enough , and that widespread identity misuse may be just around the corner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos computer club tested out the new cards it specialists from the chaos computer club , a german-based hackers ' organization , have scrutinized the new cards on behalf of german public broadcaster ard .
they found that the card readers being issued by the government to enable users to make online transactions were not as secure as they should be .
hackers from the " chaos computer club " claim that simple spying malware could put sensitive data slip into the wrong hands , because the card readers require external keyboards .
if hackers get past the computer 's firewall , they can see everything the user is typing , including , potentially , the pin-code for their id card .
once they have a pin-code , hackers could access all sorts of other personal information stored on the cards .
consumer protection activist michael bobrowski is concerned about such identity theft .
" id card owners stand to incur huge losses , " he said .
" and they 'd have to prove to the bank or other institutions that a given transaction was not initiated by them .
for ordinary pc users , this will hardly be feasible . "
the scheme is proving costly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere is confident about the security of the cards the opposition free democrats ' legal affairs spokesman , christian ahrendt , is also worried about identity theft .
he believes that the chips in the new id cards are a waste of taxpayers ' money .
" this was our main point of criticism when id cards equipped with chips were first debated and later decided on in the previous grand coalition government of christian and social democrats , " ahrendt said .

its sponsors say the nuclear power fight is post-war germany 's largest-ever economic dispute . in the midst of an ongoing debate over whether to extend the lifespan of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , a new report has revealed that the continued availability of nuclear power would likely cause a decrease in investment into renewable energies .
increases in wind and solar energy capacities will eventually lead to nuclear power plants being used less , the report states .
the reason : energy from renewable sources enjoys legal priority over nuclear and coal power .
it is fed into the grid before electricity from non-renewable sources .
as the capacity of electricity from wind or solar sources increases , conventional electricity sources will only be needed to fill in gaps when there is a lack of wind or sun .
but it takes about 50 hours to restart a nuclear power plant that has been completely shut down , meaning it would be necessary to keep the plant running at 50 or 60 percent capacity .
gas powered turbines , however , can be turned on within 20 minutes and can also be run on biogas .
other possibilities to bridge fluctuations in renewable electricity output include the decentralized approach of using micro-power stations or accessing the batteries of electric cars .
companies likely to fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conventional power might only be needed when the wind is n't blowing germany 's four largest energy companies - e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw - will do everything in their power to avoid losing billions on their investments into nuclear power , the report assumes .
supposing the lifespans of the power plant are increased by 28 years , energy companies will have to come to terms with turning them off some 15,800 times between 2020 and the date when the last plant is shut down .
that would cost them between 21 and 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 26.7 billion to $ 101.7 billion -rrb- , unless they successfully lobby to overturn the priority that electricity from renewable sources enjoys and pushed for the construction of those sources to be capped .
gero lucking , of the renewable energy company lichtblick , which sponsored the study , described the dilemma as the " largest post-war economic dispute " in germany .
olav hohmeyer , professor of economics and energy and environmental management at the university of flensburg , authored the study .
according to hohmeyer , electricity needs can entirely be met through renewable energy sources by 2050 .
nuclear power plant lifespans will not need to be extended , nor will there be an electricity deficit to be covered by new coal-fired power plants .
" nuclear power plants are not flexible enough to safely react to changing weather conditions and compensate for fluctuations in wind and sunshine , " hohmeyer said .
hohmeyer 's report states the last nuclear power plant can be removed from the grid in 2023 and the last coal-fired power plant in 2046 .
extending the lifespans of nuclear power plants by 40 years in germany - as has been proposed by the government - would damage vital investment interests and set back the switch to renewable energy by decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased renewable energy could curb the need for nuclear energy monopoly-like structures florian noto of the german nature conservancy represents a group of 21 environmental organizations banded together against nuclear energy .
he said an already-permitted nuclear power plant can generate inexpensive electricity for energy companies , when nuclear waste , risk-based costs and insurance are not taken into account .
" a newly-constructed eco-power plant ca n't necessarily keep up , " he told deutsche welle .
" if the old nuclear power plants just keep running , then progress wo n't be made and little will be invested -lsb- … -rsb- it would actually lead to an investment bottleneck . "
noto also pointed out that four of the 17 nuclear power plants in germany were out of commission for more than 10 months during 2009 , and that at times as many as eight of them were out of commission .
a more diverse and decentralized energy market could lead to lower electricity prices for consumers , according to noto .
" the fact is these companies are actually too dominant , and an economic counterweight needs to be created .
if more new energy companies join this market - if the market is expanded - then that will lead to these monopolistic structures going away , " he said .
electricity from renewable sources will become less expensive in comparison to conventionally generated electricity as prices of raw materials rise , the report states .
by 2050 its additional monthly price compared to conventionally generated electricity could be between just three and 17 euros for an average household using 3,000 kilowatt hours .

" in our view , one can only be a member of the european union if one aims for cooperation and is prepared to resolve neighborly difficulties cooperatively , " he told reporters in belgrade .
westerwelle used his first visit to serbia to meet with prime minister mirko cvetkovic , president boris tadic and opposition leaders . he expressed his disagreement with a recent resolution against the secession of kosovo presented by the country to the united nations general assembly .
" the independence of kosovo is a reality , " westerwelle said in a speech at the university of belgrade .
" reconciliation is only possible when one grasps the reality . "
germany has joined 68 other countries in recognizing kosovo 's independence , but serbia adamantly opposes it .
in july , the international court of justice found kosovo 's secession was in line with international law . serbia rejected the ruling and instead is pressing the un to restart talks on the state 's status .
a european resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence has been a highly controversial subject westerwelle said the eu would be willing to broker direct talks between serbia and kosovo to resolve the dispute and questioned serbia 's choice to take the issue to the un instead .

western powers hope the results will shift the politics away from ethnic divisions and toward a more unified country .
but with two rival autonomous regions , the mainly muslim and croat federation of bosnia and herzegovina and serb-majority republika srpska , bosnia and herzegovina is the most politically unstable of the former yugoslav republics .
westerwelle began his tour in croatia on wednesday , where he provided an optimistic outlook for the country 's prospects of joining the eu .
he continues to kosovo on friday , where he is to visit the 1,400-strong german contingent of kfor , nato 's peacekeeping force in kosovo .

when the corpse of a 5,000-year-old human was uncovered nearly 20 years ago , archaeologists assumed the iceman 's death was anything but ceremonious .
researchers now think oetzi may have received a proper alpine burial . a study released on thursday suggests that oetzi , a human specimen found in the alps of south tyrol nearly two decades ago , was not " frozen in time and place " following his death five millennia ago .
a team of italian and american researchers now believe the iceman actually received a proper burial ceremony atop a mountain pass , months after his death .
oetzi was initially discovered in 1991 at the tisenjoch alpine pass along the border between austria and italy .
researchers theorized that the iceman died of a battle-related arrow wound to the shoulder .
it followed that oetzi 's personal belongings were frozen with him after his death in the upper reaches of the alps .
yet according to a new study published today in the journal antiquity , those conclusions were not based on detailed mapping of the grave site . a team of archaeologists , anthropologists and geo-specialists used spatial analysis to pinpoint the distribution of the man 's belongings and the corpse itself - leading them to propose that his body was ceremoniously placed on elevated rock , some five meters -lrb- about 16 feet -rrb- away from his eventual discovery site . " we concluded that he died in april , and in april the pass was probably full of snow , " said alessandro vanzetti , an archaeologist at the la sapienza university of rome and one of the study 's authors .
" he could n't have died on the spot , furthermore , he did n't die on this stone , as had been reported . "
botanical evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers have not reached consensus on the circumstances of oetzi 's death the team analyzed pollen ingested by oetzi before his death and compared it with pollen found in the ice surrounding him , noting a " mismatch " between his death in april - which the team suspected occurred at a lower altitude - and his possible burial in august or september .
researchers concluded that the iceman died in a different location , and that his body was recovered .
" we think he was kept in some kind of cellar , " vanzetti told deutsche welle .
citing regional historical knowledge , the study noted that in oetzi 's day , the dead were customarily placed in farmsteads called " masi " before the winter snow and ice melted .
" it was used by people in tyrol during the cold seasons , " he said .
" when one was dead , it was impossible to bury immediately , because the ground was frozen . "
" he was a very important person , so people decided to bury him on the pass , " vanzetti added .
luca bondioli , co-author of the paper and an anthropologist with at the national museum of prehistory and ethnology in italy , described oetzi as " an individual of the elite . "
" the fact that we have a new interpretation of the discovery is important , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the study noted that previous oetzi research was based on the initial interpretation of the iceman find and his belongings as " frozen in time and place . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say the iceman died from an arrow wound to the shoulder distribution data but the team 's findings suggested that the iceman 's personal effects were carefully placed near his body during a burial ceremony , not simply scattered around him as he lay dying .
" there is a strong indication that the distribution can be explained by gravity and movement in the ice , " vanzetti said .
the archaeologist and his colleagues proposed that oetzi and his grave goods were placed on an area of raised natural stone .
later on , according to the study , " cyclical thawing and freezing " caused the corpse and the burial items to shift .
the distribution was likely variable : lighter objects , such as hair and oetzi 's quiver , did not move in the same way as more weighty items , such as fur , leather and the body itself .
lingering questions yet not all researchers in the field are prepared to accept the burial theory .
albert zink , who was involved in efforts to map oetzi 's dna and serves as head of the institute for mummies and the iceman , said the team 's conclusion was " not very convincing . "
" there there are several things which i think are clearly in contrast to a burial , " he told deutsche welle , citing the unusual placement of the bow , which had been stood upright , as well as the random distribution of oetzi 's belongings .
moreover , the iceman was found with his right arm in a vertical position that zink said would have been corrected before a burial . nevertheless , the new theory speaks to certain missing links in the iceman story - including why oetzi was found with unfinished weaponry .
it could also explain why personal effects were discovered near his body , considering the likelihood that his attackers would confiscate the belongings of a felled opponent .

when the corpse of a 5,000-year-old human was uncovered nearly 20 years ago , archaeologists assumed the iceman 's death was anything but ceremonious .
researchers now think oetzi may have received a proper alpine burial . a study released on thursday suggests that oetzi , a human specimen found in the alps of south tyrol nearly two decades ago , was not " frozen in time and place " following his death five millennia ago .
a team of italian and american researchers now believe the iceman actually received a proper burial ceremony atop a mountain pass , months after his death .
oetzi was initially discovered in 1991 at the tisenjoch alpine pass along the border between austria and italy .
researchers theorized that the iceman died of a battle-related arrow wound to the shoulder .
it followed that oetzi 's personal belongings were frozen with him after his death in the upper reaches of the alps .
yet according to a new study published today in the journal antiquity , those conclusions were not based on detailed mapping of the grave site . a team of archaeologists , anthropologists and geo-specialists used spatial analysis to pinpoint the distribution of the man 's belongings and the corpse itself - leading them to propose that his body was ceremoniously placed on elevated rock , some five meters -lrb- about 16 feet -rrb- away from his eventual discovery site . " we concluded that he died in april , and in april the pass was probably full of snow , " said alessandro vanzetti , an archaeologist at the la sapienza university of rome and one of the study 's authors .
" he could n't have died on the spot , furthermore , he did n't die on this stone , as had been reported . "
botanical evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers have not reached consensus on the circumstances of oetzi 's death the team analyzed pollen ingested by oetzi before his death and compared it with pollen found in the ice surrounding him , noting a " mismatch " between his death in april - which the team suspected occurred at a lower altitude - and his possible burial in august or september .
researchers concluded that the iceman died in a different location , and that his body was recovered .
" we think he was kept in some kind of cellar , " vanzetti told deutsche welle .
citing regional historical knowledge , the study noted that in oetzi 's day , the dead were customarily placed in farmsteads called " masi " before the winter snow and ice melted .
" it was used by people in tyrol during the cold seasons , " he said .
" when one was dead , it was impossible to bury immediately , because the ground was frozen . "
" he was a very important person , so people decided to bury him on the pass , " vanzetti added .
luca bondioli , co-author of the paper and an anthropologist with at the national museum of prehistory and ethnology in italy , described oetzi as " an individual of the elite . "
" the fact that we have a new interpretation of the discovery is important , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the study noted that previous oetzi research was based on the initial interpretation of the iceman find and his belongings as " frozen in time and place . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say the iceman died from an arrow wound to the shoulder distribution data but the team 's findings suggested that the iceman 's personal effects were carefully placed near his body during a burial ceremony , not simply scattered around him as he lay dying .
" there is a strong indication that the distribution can be explained by gravity and movement in the ice , " vanzetti said .
the archaeologist and his colleagues proposed that oetzi and his grave goods were placed on an area of raised natural stone .
later on , according to the study , " cyclical thawing and freezing " caused the corpse and the burial items to shift .
the distribution was likely variable : lighter objects , such as hair and oetzi 's quiver , did not move in the same way as more weighty items , such as fur , leather and the body itself .
lingering questions yet not all researchers in the field are prepared to accept the burial theory .
albert zink , who was involved in efforts to map oetzi 's dna and serves as head of the institute for mummies and the iceman , said the team 's conclusion was " not very convincing . "
" there there are several things which i think are clearly in contrast to a burial , " he told deutsche welle , citing the unusual placement of the bow , which had been stood upright , as well as the random distribution of oetzi 's belongings .

but the law cracks down on those who risk infecting others . having unprotected sex with a partner who is not aware of his or her partner 's hiv infection , is a criminal offense in germany , but , medically , it is hard to trace the source of an infection .
a ruling in 1988 , which forced those infected with hiv to declare their condition to sexual partners , is the current legal basis for the trial of the former singer of the girl group no angels , nadja benaissa .
" at the moment , the law states that anyone who is infected must insist on using protection or inform his or her partner of the infection , " felix damm , a lawyer specializing in media and copyright law , told deutsche welle .
" if he or she does not do that , they 're committing a crime , " he says .
aggravated assault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infecting someone with hiv during unprotected sex is a crime in germany the offense is classed as grievous bodily harm , or aggravated assault , because " an hiv infection is incurable and , when it leads to aids , is also lethal , " said damm .
it carries a sentence of six months to 10 years .
it is been more than two decades since the first person was convicted based on the 1988 ruling , some of them because they deliberately infected sexual partners , others were convicted because they were simply careless .
in june 2007 , for example , a 38-year-old man from the western city of cologne was sentenced to eight years in prison for deliberately passing on the hi virus to four women .
he even sent them text messages saying " have fun with hiv " .

" you can do certain tests to find out if two viruses from two individual people are closely related , " claudia kuecherer from the robert-koch institute told deutsche welle .
" but there 's no absolute proof that would hold up in court .
these so-called phylogenetic tests ca n't ascertain the direction of the infection , " she explained .
proof is even harder to obtain , the more time passes from the time of the infection .

as a result , medical tests are not the only evidence used to reach a verdict .

" i think everyone should be responsible and take precautions , whether they have hiv or not " damm told deutsche welle .
" and if we apply that principle of responsibility to our criminal law , then people who have hiv would not necessarily have to declare their infection and would therefore no longer commit an offense , " he said .

but the law cracks down on those who risk infecting others . having unprotected sex with a partner who is not aware of his or her partner 's hiv infection , is a criminal offense in germany , but , medically , it is hard to trace the source of an infection .
a ruling in 1988 , which forced those infected with hiv to declare their condition to sexual partners , is the current legal basis for the trial of the former singer of the girl group no angels , nadja benaissa .
" at the moment , the law states that anyone who is infected must insist on using protection or inform his or her partner of the infection , " felix damm , a lawyer specializing in media and copyright law , told deutsche welle .

it carries a sentence of six months to 10 years .
it is been more than two decades since the first person was convicted based on the 1988 ruling , some of them because they deliberately infected sexual partners , others were convicted because they were simply careless .
in june 2007 , for example , a 38-year-old man from the western city of cologne was sentenced to eight years in prison for deliberately passing on the hi virus to four women .
he even sent them text messages saying " have fun with hiv " .
the latest case was that of a decorator in the northern city of kiel in june 2010 , who was sentenced to five years in jail for infecting two women with hiv during unprotected sex .

" you can do certain tests to find out if two viruses from two individual people are closely related , " claudia kuecherer from the robert-koch institute told deutsche welle .
" but there 's no absolute proof that would hold up in court .
these so-called phylogenetic tests ca n't ascertain the direction of the infection , " she explained .
proof is even harder to obtain , the more time passes from the time of the infection .
the virus mutates very quickly after the point of infection , making it harder to ascertain if it is related to the virus of the person who passed it on .
as a result , medical tests are not the only evidence used to reach a verdict .
taking responsibility over two decades have passed since the 1988 ruling and some believe it is time for a review of the law used in cases like that of benaissa , based on the fact that , these days , people are much more aware of hiv and should therefore , be in a position to act responsibly .
" i think everyone should be responsible and take precautions , whether they have hiv or not " damm told deutsche welle .
" and if we apply that principle of responsibility to our criminal law , then people who have hiv would not necessarily have to declare their infection and would therefore no longer commit an offense , " he said .

audiences are mainly germans who enjoy the challenge . the english theatre berlin is the german capital 's only exclusively english-language theater .
oddly enough , the theater 's founder and artistic director , is german . guenther grosser - not from berlin , but from bavaria - studied acting in new york in the late 1980s .
with the fall of the berlin wall , he saw a chance to establish an english-language theater in the german capital . " when the wall came down we all realized -lsb- that -rsb- this is really becoming an international capital , and there are so many people moving to berlin from all over the world , " said grosser .
" so i think the english-language theater is a must in this town . " celebrating two decades this year , the english theatre berlin plays a strong , if modest role on the city 's vast theater scene .
since german reunification , berlin has become one of europe 's hippest meccas for artistic creativity and , according to grosser , this development has had a direct and dramatic affect on his theater . " -lsb- many -rsb- more young theater-makers are in berlin now than ever before , " he said .
" it is much easier for us now to choose from a large crowd of actors - and we 're talking about professional native-speaking english language actors living in town . " having a bigger pool of actors means a greater diversity of ideas , approaches and aesthetics . love is universal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the theater 's founder guenther grosser was inspired by his time in new york in this summer 's production of lovepuke , a play about the trials and tribulations of love , sex and communication in modern relationships , amy hye plays the role of the femme fatale , louise .
originally from new zealand , hye recently moved to berlin after spending six years in madrid . she 's one of berlin 's many new arrivals , attracted by the city 's creative mystique and promise of cheap living . " in madrid , we were working really fast-paced comedy shows , one-hour shows back-to-back , " she said .
" the level of english was n't so good - whereas here , i think you can perform more in a traditional theater sense , because the level of english is better . " lovepuke is directed by fingal pollack , a 28-year-old aspiring director from new zealand who came to berlin two years ago for a four-day visit - and never left .
what keeps her here -lrb- besides her boyfriend -rrb- is the city 's fertile creative soil and the opportunities at the english theatre berlin . " this is the second big play i 've directed in berlin , so it 's a beginning for me , " explained pollack .
" there 's so much opportunity , and it 's easy to do your thing here .
there 's space and there 's time to be able to find out what you really want to do , and what you 're good at , as well . " for love of theater to finance her love for directing serious plays , pollack does what she can to stay afloat , working in children 's theater , teaching english and taking on translation projects .
while there 's still a lot of support for young theater-makers in new zealand , fingal prefers the artistic possibilities that berlin 's eclectic english-language theater scene has to offer . " new zealand has a very good theater scene , but because berlin is such a mixing pot of different cultures , i think it is a far richer choice , " said pollack , adding that she had 50 strong actors audition for lovepuke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lovepuke looks at the challenges of modern relationships while there is a good supply of english-speaking actors in the german capital , the audiences remain largely german .
at a recent performance of lovepuke , some 70 percent of the spectators were german - theater buffs who come for the love of art , and the challenge of consuming it in a foreign language . not yet in the big leagues the english theatre berlin may be a well-established institution , but in the fringe theater scene .
crossing over into mainstream does n't seem feasible . " i find there is not a stepping stone system in place between fringe theater and mainstream theater , " said pollack .
" i do n't know how i would get into mainstream theater in berlin , but i know in new zealand : the big people come and see the little shows . " old traditions like the strict separation of fringe and mainstream theater die hard in germany , even in a city as progressive as berlin .

its sponsors say the nuclear power fight is post-war germany 's largest-ever economic dispute . in the midst of an ongoing debate over whether to extend the lifespan of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , a new report has revealed that the continued availability of nuclear power would likely cause a decrease in investment into renewable energies .
increases in wind and solar energy capacities will eventually lead to nuclear power plants being used less , the report states .
the reason : energy from renewable sources enjoys legal priority over nuclear and coal power .
it is fed into the grid before electricity from non-renewable sources .
as the capacity of electricity from wind or solar sources increases , conventional electricity sources will only be needed to fill in gaps when there is a lack of wind or sun .
but it takes about 50 hours to restart a nuclear power plant that has been completely shut down , meaning it would be necessary to keep the plant running at 50 or 60 percent capacity .
gas powered turbines , however , can be turned on within 20 minutes and can also be run on biogas .
other possibilities to bridge fluctuations in renewable electricity output include the decentralized approach of using micro-power stations or accessing the batteries of electric cars .
companies likely to fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conventional power might only be needed when the wind is n't blowing germany 's four largest energy companies - e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw - will do everything in their power to avoid losing billions on their investments into nuclear power , the report assumes .
supposing the lifespans of the power plant are increased by 28 years , energy companies will have to come to terms with turning them off some 15,800 times between 2020 and the date when the last plant is shut down .
that would cost them between 21 and 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 26.7 billion to $ 101.7 billion -rrb- , unless they successfully lobby to overturn the priority that electricity from renewable sources enjoys and pushed for the construction of those sources to be capped .
gero lucking , of the renewable energy company lichtblick , which sponsored the study , described the dilemma as the " largest post-war economic dispute " in germany .
olav hohmeyer , professor of economics and energy and environmental management at the university of flensburg , authored the study .
according to hohmeyer , electricity needs can entirely be met through renewable energy sources by 2050 .
nuclear power plant lifespans will not need to be extended , nor will there be an electricity deficit to be covered by new coal-fired power plants .
" nuclear power plants are not flexible enough to safely react to changing weather conditions and compensate for fluctuations in wind and sunshine , " hohmeyer said .
hohmeyer 's report states the last nuclear power plant can be removed from the grid in 2023 and the last coal-fired power plant in 2046 .
extending the lifespans of nuclear power plants by 40 years in germany - as has been proposed by the government - would damage vital investment interests and set back the switch to renewable energy by decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased renewable energy could curb the need for nuclear energy monopoly-like structures florian noto of the german nature conservancy represents a group of 21 environmental organizations banded together against nuclear energy .
he said an already-permitted nuclear power plant can generate inexpensive electricity for energy companies , when nuclear waste , risk-based costs and insurance are not taken into account .
" a newly-constructed eco-power plant ca n't necessarily keep up , " he told deutsche welle .
" if the old nuclear power plants just keep running , then progress wo n't be made and little will be invested -lsb- … -rsb- it would actually lead to an investment bottleneck . "
noto also pointed out that four of the 17 nuclear power plants in germany were out of commission for more than 10 months during 2009 , and that at times as many as eight of them were out of commission .
a more diverse and decentralized energy market could lead to lower electricity prices for consumers , according to noto .
" the fact is these companies are actually too dominant , and an economic counterweight needs to be created .
if more new energy companies join this market - if the market is expanded - then that will lead to these monopolistic structures going away , " he said .
electricity from renewable sources will become less expensive in comparison to conventionally generated electricity as prices of raw materials rise , the report states .
by 2050 its additional monthly price compared to conventionally generated electricity could be between just three and 17 euros for an average household using 3,000 kilowatt hours .

its sponsors say the nuclear power fight is post-war germany 's largest-ever economic dispute . in the midst of an ongoing debate over whether to extend the lifespan of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , a new report has revealed that the continued availability of nuclear power would likely cause a decrease in investment into renewable energies .
increases in wind and solar energy capacities will eventually lead to nuclear power plants being used less , the report states .
the reason : energy from renewable sources enjoys legal priority over nuclear and coal power .
it is fed into the grid before electricity from non-renewable sources .
as the capacity of electricity from wind or solar sources increases , conventional electricity sources will only be needed to fill in gaps when there is a lack of wind or sun .
but it takes about 50 hours to restart a nuclear power plant that has been completely shut down , meaning it would be necessary to keep the plant running at 50 or 60 percent capacity .
gas powered turbines , however , can be turned on within 20 minutes and can also be run on biogas .
other possibilities to bridge fluctuations in renewable electricity output include the decentralized approach of using micro-power stations or accessing the batteries of electric cars .
companies likely to fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conventional power might only be needed when the wind is n't blowing germany 's four largest energy companies - e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw - will do everything in their power to avoid losing billions on their investments into nuclear power , the report assumes .
supposing the lifespans of the power plant are increased by 28 years , energy companies will have to come to terms with turning them off some 15,800 times between 2020 and the date when the last plant is shut down .
that would cost them between 21 and 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 26.7 billion to $ 101.7 billion -rrb- , unless they successfully lobby to overturn the priority that electricity from renewable sources enjoys and pushed for the construction of those sources to be capped .
gero lucking , of the renewable energy company lichtblick , which sponsored the study , described the dilemma as the " largest post-war economic dispute " in germany .
olav hohmeyer , professor of economics and energy and environmental management at the university of flensburg , authored the study .
according to hohmeyer , electricity needs can entirely be met through renewable energy sources by 2050 .
nuclear power plant lifespans will not need to be extended , nor will there be an electricity deficit to be covered by new coal-fired power plants .
" nuclear power plants are not flexible enough to safely react to changing weather conditions and compensate for fluctuations in wind and sunshine , " hohmeyer said .
hohmeyer 's report states the last nuclear power plant can be removed from the grid in 2023 and the last coal-fired power plant in 2046 .
extending the lifespans of nuclear power plants by 40 years in germany - as has been proposed by the government - would damage vital investment interests and set back the switch to renewable energy by decades .

on thursday several demonstrators climbed onto a roof , temporarily stopping the demolition . police in stuttgart say that work to raze part of the city 's old aboveground train station was stopped for several hours on thursday when seven people occupied part of the building 's roof .
the protestors were then removed and arrested by special police forces .
other demonstrators blocked train platforms , causing a high-speed tgv train to paris to be delayed by about an hour .
construction workers began the demolition of the north wing of the stuttgart train station under police protection on wednesday , as thousands continued to demonstrate against the renovation project .
activists claimed 12,000 people had participated in the protests , while police put the number at 6,000 .

" this has moved way beyond understandable protests and civil disobedience , " he said , saying firefighters and rescue workers had been harassed and that groups blockading streets had thrown bottles .
a spokesman for the park protectors group , which opposes the project , denied any violence and said that " the politicians , through the police , are trying to criminalize us . "
the " stuttgart 21 " construction project is to link the city with one of europe 's longest high-speed rail lines by converting it from a terminus , which forces trains to pull in and out , to an underground through-station that trains can pass through .
supporters say the project will cut down travel times , create jobs and attract investors , but opponents say its estimated cost of seven billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- is too high .
environmentalists say the current plan is not necessary and that its effect on rail traffic would be limited .

the rise is largely due to germany 's strong economic performance . germany 's surprisingly good economic performance has made consumers more optimistic about the economy and their personal income , according to a report released on thursday .
the nuremburg-based market research institute gfk bases its monthly forward-looking consumer sentiment index on a survey of about 2,000 german households .
the overall index for september was 4.1 points - the highest in 14 months .
that figure is up from a revised august index of 4 points .
" the extremely good news on the economic development and continued positive reports on the labour market have led to robust consumer sentiment in august , " the gfk report said .
" there are currently good indications that consumer sentiment in germany is experiencing a sustained upward trend . "
the increase was largely due to germany 's higher-than-expected growth in gross domestic product during the second quarter , the gfk said .
the 2.2-percent jump in output was the largest quarterly increase since german reunification in 1990 .
germany 's central bank expects an overall growth of three percent by the end of 2010 .

he said serbia , however , would have to " come to terms " with the loss of kosovo as a province . german foreign minister guido westerwelle urged serbia on thursday to drop its challenges to kosovo 's independence and instead focus its energy on joining the european union .
" in our view , one can only be a member of the european union if one aims for cooperation and is prepared to resolve neighborly difficulties cooperatively , " he told reporters in belgrade .
westerwelle used his first visit to serbia to meet with prime minister mirko cvetkovic , president boris tadic and opposition leaders . he expressed his disagreement with a recent resolution against the secession of kosovo presented by the country to the united nations general assembly .
" the independence of kosovo is a reality , " westerwelle said in a speech at the university of belgrade .
" reconciliation is only possible when one grasps the reality . "
germany has joined 68 other countries in recognizing kosovo 's independence , but serbia adamantly opposes it .
in july , the international court of justice found kosovo 's secession was in line with international law . serbia rejected the ruling and instead is pressing the un to restart talks on the state 's status .
a european resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence has been a highly controversial subject westerwelle said the eu would be willing to broker direct talks between serbia and kosovo to resolve the dispute and questioned serbia 's choice to take the issue to the un instead .
" when someone in europe wants to solve something including conflicts -lsb- … -rsb- the road should first lead to brussels , not to new york , " he said .
on to bosnia , kosovo later thursday , westerwelle is to visit the bosnian capital , sarajevo , where proposed political reforms have long been stalled . parliamentary and presidential elections are scheduled for october .
western powers hope the results will shift the politics away from ethnic divisions and toward a more unified country .
but with two rival autonomous regions , the mainly muslim and croat federation of bosnia and herzegovina and serb-majority republika srpska , bosnia and herzegovina is the most politically unstable of the former yugoslav republics .
westerwelle began his tour in croatia on wednesday , where he provided an optimistic outlook for the country 's prospects of joining the eu .
he continues to kosovo on friday , where he is to visit the 1,400-strong german contingent of kfor , nato 's peacekeeping force in kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.08.2010 dw experts try their luck again with forecasts for bundesliga round 2 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a trip to the repair shop , the dw crystal ball returns this season , deutsche welle 's sports team are laying it on the line and predicting the results of all the bundesliga matches .
after a less than successful start , see what we predict for the second round . it 's round 2 of the 2010/11 bundesliga season and the dw experts are hoping to do a little better than last week when only one game was predicted correctly .
the crystal ball was obviously on the fritz -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- . the opening weekend of the season is always a lottery for forecasters because there is very little of the season 's form book to refer to so with a little more to go on , we hope to have more success with the next round of games . friday , august 27 kaiserslautern – bayern munich bayern looked boringly comfortable for long stretches against wolfsburg in their opening day win but finished the match with the margin a lot closer than it should have been .
kaiserslautern had a somewhat easier game against cologne and performed well , scoring three goals away from home .
bayern showed class and strength in front of their own supporters but these qualities will be tested on the road .
i can see the champions experiencing a slight , early blip in kaiserslautern . prediction : 2-2 saturday , august 28 schalke – hanover schalke blinked first in their match in hamburg last week and as a result lost to one of the teams which could rival them in the race for european places this season .
it 's early yet and the defeat wo n't end schalke 's challenge , but coach felix magath will be upset to have conceded points to one of the top teams already .
expect the royal blues to respond to magath 's wrath by soundly beating hanover in gelsenkirchen with raul marking his bundesliga home debut with at least one goal . prediction : schalke 3-1 bremen – cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen are back to winning ways .
bad news for cologne few would have expected bremen to be on the end of the kind of score line they normally inflict on the opposition .
losing 4-1 to hoffenheim was the worst possible start for thomas schaaf 's team .
luckily they had a confidence-restoring win in europe during the week to get their heads straight again and with qualification for the champions league group stages assured , werder can focus on climbing back up the bundesliga table .
they will begin their climb with victory over cologne who already look like relegation fodder after capitulating at home to kaiserslautern . prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg – mainz steve mcclaren 's wolves looked disjointed against bayern , but did manage 20 minutes of supreme offensive fotball - enough to give the champions a scare .
however , they looked far from cohesive at the back and even against mainz in their first home game of the season , wolfsburg may still not find the right gear .
mainz produced a good display to heap early woe on stuttgart , a team which finished strongly last season .
i think they 'll worry wolfsburg and grab a goal but the wolves will snatch a draw . prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg hit-man ruud hopes to be on target again reports that ruud van nistlerooy 's legs have gone appear to have been wildly exaggerated .
the dutch striker looked all the better for missing out on world cup action this summer , and as a result hamburg should get at least a good half-season out him before the inevitable wear and tear takes its toll .
frankfurt were unlucky to lose 2-1 to hanover last week and i can see them having a harder time against hsv , especially if ruud is still in the same mood as he was against schalke .
hamburg did n't travel well last season , dropping crucial points away from home , but still i think they 'll edge this one . prediction : hamburg 1-0 nuremberg – freiburg freiburg are going to struggle this season as their opening day defeat to st. pauli indicated . losing 3-1 at home to a newly-promoted side does not bode well for a team which has a long-standing relationship with the lower reaches of the bundesliga .
games like the one coming up against nuremberg need to be won if this is not to be a long fight against relegation for freiburg but i do n't see them getting the full quota of points this week .
the best freiburg can hope for is a draw - but i think they 'll get it . prediction : 1-1 st. pauli – hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will give st. pauli more problems than freiburg st. pauli will be flying after their victory over freiburg but they are in danger of crashing to earth against hoffenheim .
they may have their special supporters behind them on saturday but the gulf in class is likely to be too big for pauli .
one forgets that hoffenheim were once the village team made good , such is their standing in the top division now .
st. pauli might appear to be lambs to the slaughter in the wake of hoffenheim 's giving bremen a hiding , but i think the men from the rhine-neckar will have a harder job in hamburg .
that 's not to say they wo n't still win , though . prediction : hoffenheim 2-0 leverkusen - moenchengladbach bayer leverkusen have started in much the same way as they began last season - and by beating dortmund 2-0 away from home , michael ballack and co. have laid down a marker .
dortmund were tough to beat last year and can be expected to be difficult opponents this season , a fact that adds even more gloss to leverkusen 's win .
ballack 's boys will be too much for gladbach who just scraped a draw with nuremberg last week . prediction : leverkusen 3-1 sunday , august 29 stuttgart – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart boss christian gross hopes for something to clap both teams expected more from their opening games in which both were defeated , and both will be eager to put those false starts behind them .
however , stuttgart and dortmund both saw europa league action on thursday and could be running on fumes as they seek full fitness in the early season . whatever happens , these two sides will give whatever they 've got .
i see dortmund edging stuttgart through sheer power . prediction : dortmund 2-1 last week 's result : 5 points bayern – wolfsburg 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:1 , one point -rrb- hoffenheim – bremen 4:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:2 , one point -rrb- moenchengladbach – nuremberg 1:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , no points -rrb- cologne – kaiserslautern 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- freiburg – st. pauli 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- hanover – frankfurt 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , no points -rrb- hamburg – schalke 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , three points -rrb- mainz – stuttgart 2:0 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , no points -rrb- dortmund – leverkusen 0:2 -lrb- dw prediction 2:2 , no points -rrb- three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

frankfurt were unlucky to lose 2-1 to hanover last week and i can see them having a harder time against hsv , especially if ruud is still in the same mood as he was against schalke .
hamburg did n't travel well last season , dropping crucial points away from home , but still i think they 'll edge this one . prediction : hamburg 1-0 nuremberg – freiburg freiburg are going to struggle this season as their opening day defeat to st. pauli indicated . losing 3-1 at home to a newly-promoted side does not bode well for a team which has a long-standing relationship with the lower reaches of the bundesliga .
games like the one coming up against nuremberg need to be won if this is not to be a long fight against relegation for freiburg but i do n't see them getting the full quota of points this week .
the best freiburg can hope for is a draw - but i think they 'll get it . prediction : 1-1 st. pauli – hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will give st. pauli more problems than freiburg st. pauli will be flying after their victory over freiburg but they are in danger of crashing to earth against hoffenheim .
they may have their special supporters behind them on saturday but the gulf in class is likely to be too big for pauli .
one forgets that hoffenheim were once the village team made good , such is their standing in the top division now .
st. pauli might appear to be lambs to the slaughter in the wake of hoffenheim 's giving bremen a hiding , but i think the men from the rhine-neckar will have a harder job in hamburg .
that 's not to say they wo n't still win , though . prediction : hoffenheim 2-0 leverkusen - moenchengladbach bayer leverkusen have started in much the same way as they began last season - and by beating dortmund 2-0 away from home , michael ballack and co. have laid down a marker .
dortmund were tough to beat last year and can be expected to be difficult opponents this season , a fact that adds even more gloss to leverkusen 's win .
ballack 's boys will be too much for gladbach who just scraped a draw with nuremberg last week . prediction : leverkusen 3-1 sunday , august 29 stuttgart – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart boss christian gross hopes for something to clap both teams expected more from their opening games in which both were defeated , and both will be eager to put those false starts behind them .
however , stuttgart and dortmund both saw europa league action on thursday and could be running on fumes as they seek full fitness in the early season . whatever happens , these two sides will give whatever they 've got .
i see dortmund edging stuttgart through sheer power . prediction : dortmund 2-1 last week 's result : 5 points bayern – wolfsburg 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:1 , one point -rrb- hoffenheim – bremen 4:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:2 , one point -rrb- moenchengladbach – nuremberg 1:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , no points -rrb- cologne – kaiserslautern 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- freiburg – st. pauli 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- hanover – frankfurt 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , no points -rrb- hamburg – schalke 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , three points -rrb- mainz – stuttgart 2:0 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , no points -rrb- dortmund – leverkusen 0:2 -lrb- dw prediction 2:2 , no points -rrb- three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the law cracks down on those who risk infecting others . having unprotected sex with a partner who is not aware of his or her partner 's hiv infection , is a criminal offense in germany , but , medically , it is hard to trace the source of an infection .
a ruling in 1988 , which forced those infected with hiv to declare their condition to sexual partners , is the current legal basis for the trial of the former singer of the girl group no angels , nadja benaissa .
" at the moment , the law states that anyone who is infected must insist on using protection or inform his or her partner of the infection , " felix damm , a lawyer specializing in media and copyright law , told deutsche welle .
" if he or she does not do that , they 're committing a crime , " he says .
aggravated assault bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infecting someone with hiv during unprotected sex is a crime in germany the offense is classed as grievous bodily harm , or aggravated assault , because " an hiv infection is incurable and , when it leads to aids , is also lethal , " said damm .
it carries a sentence of six months to 10 years .
it is been more than two decades since the first person was convicted based on the 1988 ruling , some of them because they deliberately infected sexual partners , others were convicted because they were simply careless .
in june 2007 , for example , a 38-year-old man from the western city of cologne was sentenced to eight years in prison for deliberately passing on the hi virus to four women .
he even sent them text messages saying " have fun with hiv " .
the latest case was that of a decorator in the northern city of kiel in june 2010 , who was sentenced to five years in jail for infecting two women with hiv during unprotected sex .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is often hard to determine the source of the infection medical tests tricky it is not always easy , however , to prove who passed on the virus to a person .
" you can do certain tests to find out if two viruses from two individual people are closely related , " claudia kuecherer from the robert-koch institute told deutsche welle .
" but there 's no absolute proof that would hold up in court .
these so-called phylogenetic tests ca n't ascertain the direction of the infection , " she explained .
proof is even harder to obtain , the more time passes from the time of the infection .
the virus mutates very quickly after the point of infection , making it harder to ascertain if it is related to the virus of the person who passed it on .
as a result , medical tests are not the only evidence used to reach a verdict .
taking responsibility over two decades have passed since the 1988 ruling and some believe it is time for a review of the law used in cases like that of benaissa , based on the fact that , these days , people are much more aware of hiv and should therefore , be in a position to act responsibly .
" i think everyone should be responsible and take precautions , whether they have hiv or not " damm told deutsche welle .
" and if we apply that principle of responsibility to our criminal law , then people who have hiv would not necessarily have to declare their infection and would therefore no longer commit an offense , " he said .

the 28-year-old benaissa is a member of the popular girl band no angels . she discovered she was hiv positive in 1999 when she was three months pregnant .
she was arrested in april 2009 for having unprotected sex with three men in 2004 and 2006 and failing to inform them of her hiv status .
to do so can be classified as aggravated assault under german law .
both the state prosecutor peter liesenfeld and her defense had asked the courts for the suspended sentence in the trial , which ended on wednesday .
liesenfeld cited her confession and her expression of remorse as reasons for lighter sentence .
" i made a huge mistake , " benaissa said in an emotional apology during the closing arguments .
" i am sorry from the bottom of my heart , " she said . " i would love to turn back the clock , but i ca n't . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after discovering her hiv status , benaissa -lrb- right -rrb- found success with the girl band no angels almost certainly infected the man but the 34-year-old man she infected with hiv gave an angry testimony during the trial , saying she had caused " a lot of suffering in this world . "
because she and the man both have a strain of the virus that is relatively rare in germany , medical experts had determined the man had almost certainly been infected by benaissa .
she was also convicted of attempted aggravated assault for having unprotected sex with another man who did not contract the virus .
she said she was afraid that her career would be negatively impacted if it became public that she is hiv positive .
a return to the stage ?
instead of jail time , the pop star is expected to complete 300 hours of community service and attend regular counseling sessions .
no angels , which first formed in 2000 and got back together in 2007 after a brief break , are expected to restart their tour .
that tour was interrupted last year when benaissa was arrested just before performing in frankfurt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 26.08.2010 german representatives face difficult routes through champions league großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern , bremen and schalke prepare to tackle europe 's elite three of the bundesliga 's top clubs are looking to make a big impression in the champions league this season .
in may , bayern munich came closer than any other german club since 2002 to winning the title . bayern - losing finalists against inter milan in may - are among the top seeds and were drawn thursday against as roma , fc basel and cfr cluj in group e of this season 's champions league competition .
the german champions qualified automatically after securing the bundesliga title and therefore avoided the likes of italian giants inter and ac milan , english premiership big-boys manchester united , chelsea and arsenal , spanish champions barcelona and perennial qualifiers lyon from france 's ligue 1 .
clubs from the same country can not not be drawn against each other in the group stage and for tv purposes are kept on opposite sides of the draw as far as possible , so bayern have also avoided playing one of their bundesliga rivals - at least for now .
bayern look to hit the ground running bayern have been slowly building a head of steam in this competition over the past few seasons and since louis van gaal took charge they 've been picking up speed .
from being a team seemingly predestined to get knocked out in the quarterfinals , bayern have quietly developed into a club ready to challenge for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are hoping for happier end to the 2011 competition however , they faltered badly in the early stages of the competition last season , almost crashing out at the group stage with only a heroic performance against juventus preventing them from slipping into the europa league .
but with every passing round , the bavarian giants had an unbeatable air about them .
they marched through against teams like manchester united and lyon with a strange certainty that they would reach the final and had many convinced that they could win it .
unfortunately , it was not to be .
this season , a strong showing against another italian team will be needed .
as roma ran inter milan close to the serie a title last season and will prove obstinate opposition for bayern , especially at the stadio olimpico .
the german champions should have the measure of the italians at home but bayern 's visit to rome could prove tricky .
there should n't be any problem for the germans against fc basel so qualification should be assured , regardless of which way the results go against roma and cluj . if bayern can avoid the pitfalls which almost cost them the chance of making the knockout phase last time and find their european groove earlier this season , then they 'll be a strong bet to repeat their run to the previous final and who knows - perhaps even win it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have yet to fulfill their champions league potential bremen hope to recapture barnstorming form werder bremen , recently qualified at the expense of sampdoria , return to the champions league after a couple of seasons away from europe ’ s premier club competition .
the impressive and dramatic performances by thomas schaaf 's side against their italian opposition in the qualifying round certainly suggests that bremen will be an entertaining addition to the group stages , but how will they fare against teams like reigning champions inter milan , dutch champions fc twente and tottenham hotspurs ?
bremen have never really worried the latter stages of the champions league despite consistently reaching the knockout rounds during their strong , mid-noughties period of bundesliga ascendance .
however , they ’ ve been off the boil for the latter part of the decade and have not managed to regain the consistency which saw them continually challenging for the bundesliga title and qualifying for the champions league .
it remains to be seen how inter milan play under new coach rafa benitez , but however the former liverpool coach chooses to line the european champions up , it 's still effectively the same team that won the trophy last season .
bremen will be in for a fight both at home and away .
they may fancy their chances against new boys tottenham hotspurs but the english premiership side looked far from over-awed in qualifying , so werder will have to draw on their experience to snuff out spurs ' enthusiasm over two games .
fc twente shocked the eredivisie last season under current wolfsburg coach steve mcclaren , so who 's to say they wo n't spring a surprise in the champions league ?
they 're unlikely to win it but they could cause bremen problems .
at best , werder could get through in second but it looks a tough group for the north germans .
schalke faces tough group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope magath and raul can plot a successful course schalke , the third team in the bundesliga trio , have a tricky group consisting of lyon , benfica and happoel tel aviv .
but while schalke teams in the past have been finding their way through european competition with little knowledgeable guidance , they have a hard-headed coach with experience of the business end of the european cup in felix magath .
a winner and runner-up with hamburg as a player , magath coached bayern in three champions league campaigns , reaching the quarterfinals in 2004/05 and the first knockout round the following year .
he also took bayern to the knockout round in the 2006/07 competition but was fired for poor bundesliga form before their quarterfinal defeat to ac milan .
magath also has the most prolific goal scorer in champions league history on his books in the form of raul .
the former real madrid talisman and captain has three champions league winner ’ s medals to his name as well as an unprecedented 66 strikes in the competition .
as a result schalke will be going into this season ’ s champions league with an experienced leader off the pitch and an experienced one on it .
lyon have been here so many times before that they treat the champions league as if it was an extension of their domestic competition .
but , as bayern found out last season , this sometimes works against them .
lyon may not be equipped to deal with both this season , and schalke will hope to get a victory against them either home or away .
benfica could be the wild card in the group .
the portuguese are renowned for swift counterattacking play and their style may be a little cavalier for the germans .
these games could be very hard for schalke .
but the germans should get the points they need to at least challenge for the second qualifying spot against hapoel tel aviv .

in may , bayern munich came closer than any other german club since 2002 to winning the title . bayern - losing finalists against inter milan in may - are among the top seeds and were drawn thursday against as roma , fc basel and cfr cluj in group e of this season 's champions league competition .
the german champions qualified automatically after securing the bundesliga title and therefore avoided the likes of italian giants inter and ac milan , english premiership big-boys manchester united , chelsea and arsenal , spanish champions barcelona and perennial qualifiers lyon from france 's ligue 1 .
clubs from the same country can not not be drawn against each other in the group stage and for tv purposes are kept on opposite sides of the draw as far as possible , so bayern have also avoided playing one of their bundesliga rivals - at least for now .
bayern look to hit the ground running bayern have been slowly building a head of steam in this competition over the past few seasons and since louis van gaal took charge they 've been picking up speed .
from being a team seemingly predestined to get knocked out in the quarterfinals , bayern have quietly developed into a club ready to challenge for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are hoping for happier end to the 2011 competition however , they faltered badly in the early stages of the competition last season , almost crashing out at the group stage with only a heroic performance against juventus preventing them from slipping into the europa league .

these games could be very hard for schalke .
but the germans should get the points they need to at least challenge for the second qualifying spot against hapoel tel aviv .

in may , bayern munich came closer than any other german club since 2002 to winning the title . bayern - losing finalists against inter milan in may - are among the top seeds and were drawn thursday against as roma , fc basel and cfr cluj in group e of this season 's champions league competition .
the german champions qualified automatically after securing the bundesliga title and therefore avoided the likes of italian giants inter and ac milan , english premiership big-boys manchester united , chelsea and arsenal , spanish champions barcelona and perennial qualifiers lyon from france 's ligue 1 .
clubs from the same country can not not be drawn against each other in the group stage and for tv purposes are kept on opposite sides of the draw as far as possible , so bayern have also avoided playing one of their bundesliga rivals - at least for now .
bayern look to hit the ground running bayern have been slowly building a head of steam in this competition over the past few seasons and since louis van gaal took charge they 've been picking up speed .
from being a team seemingly predestined to get knocked out in the quarterfinals , bayern have quietly developed into a club ready to challenge for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are hoping for happier end to the 2011 competition however , they faltered badly in the early stages of the competition last season , almost crashing out at the group stage with only a heroic performance against juventus preventing them from slipping into the europa league .
but with every passing round , the bavarian giants had an unbeatable air about them .
they marched through against teams like manchester united and lyon with a strange certainty that they would reach the final and had many convinced that they could win it .
unfortunately , it was not to be .
this season , a strong showing against another italian team will be needed .
as roma ran inter milan close to the serie a title last season and will prove obstinate opposition for bayern , especially at the stadio olimpico .
the german champions should have the measure of the italians at home but bayern 's visit to rome could prove tricky .
there should n't be any problem for the germans against fc basel so qualification should be assured , regardless of which way the results go against roma and cluj . if bayern can avoid the pitfalls which almost cost them the chance of making the knockout phase last time and find their european groove earlier this season , then they 'll be a strong bet to repeat their run to the previous final and who knows - perhaps even win it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have yet to fulfill their champions league potential bremen hope to recapture barnstorming form werder bremen , recently qualified at the expense of sampdoria , return to the champions league after a couple of seasons away from europe ’ s premier club competition .
the impressive and dramatic performances by thomas schaaf 's side against their italian opposition in the qualifying round certainly suggests that bremen will be an entertaining addition to the group stages , but how will they fare against teams like reigning champions inter milan , dutch champions fc twente and tottenham hotspurs ?
bremen have never really worried the latter stages of the champions league despite consistently reaching the knockout rounds during their strong , mid-noughties period of bundesliga ascendance .
however , they ’ ve been off the boil for the latter part of the decade and have not managed to regain the consistency which saw them continually challenging for the bundesliga title and qualifying for the champions league .
it remains to be seen how inter milan play under new coach rafa benitez , but however the former liverpool coach chooses to line the european champions up , it 's still effectively the same team that won the trophy last season .
bremen will be in for a fight both at home and away .
they may fancy their chances against new boys tottenham hotspurs but the english premiership side looked far from over-awed in qualifying , so werder will have to draw on their experience to snuff out spurs ' enthusiasm over two games .
fc twente shocked the eredivisie last season under current wolfsburg coach steve mcclaren , so who 's to say they wo n't spring a surprise in the champions league ?
they 're unlikely to win it but they could cause bremen problems .
at best , werder could get through in second but it looks a tough group for the north germans .
schalke faces tough group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke hope magath and raul can plot a successful course schalke , the third team in the bundesliga trio , have a tricky group consisting of lyon , benfica and happoel tel aviv .
but while schalke teams in the past have been finding their way through european competition with little knowledgeable guidance , they have a hard-headed coach with experience of the business end of the european cup in felix magath .
a winner and runner-up with hamburg as a player , magath coached bayern in three champions league campaigns , reaching the quarterfinals in 2004/05 and the first knockout round the following year .
he also took bayern to the knockout round in the 2006/07 competition but was fired for poor bundesliga form before their quarterfinal defeat to ac milan .
magath also has the most prolific goal scorer in champions league history on his books in the form of raul .
the former real madrid talisman and captain has three champions league winner ’ s medals to his name as well as an unprecedented 66 strikes in the competition .
as a result schalke will be going into this season ’ s champions league with an experienced leader off the pitch and an experienced one on it .
lyon have been here so many times before that they treat the champions league as if it was an extension of their domestic competition .
but , as bayern found out last season , this sometimes works against them .
lyon may not be equipped to deal with both this season , and schalke will hope to get a victory against them either home or away .
benfica could be the wild card in the group .
the portuguese are renowned for swift counterattacking play and their style may be a little cavalier for the germans .
these games could be very hard for schalke .
but the germans should get the points they need to at least challenge for the second qualifying spot against hapoel tel aviv .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 26.08.2010 iceman likely laid to rest , study suggests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was oetzi given a burial ceremony ?
when the corpse of a 5,000-year-old human was uncovered nearly 20 years ago , archaeologists assumed the iceman 's death was anything but ceremonious .
researchers now think oetzi may have received a proper alpine burial . a study released on thursday suggests that oetzi , a human specimen found in the alps of south tyrol nearly two decades ago , was not " frozen in time and place " following his death five millennia ago .
a team of italian and american researchers now believe the iceman actually received a proper burial ceremony atop a mountain pass , months after his death .
oetzi was initially discovered in 1991 at the tisenjoch alpine pass along the border between austria and italy .
researchers theorized that the iceman died of a battle-related arrow wound to the shoulder .
it followed that oetzi 's personal belongings were frozen with him after his death in the upper reaches of the alps .
yet according to a new study published today in the journal antiquity , those conclusions were not based on detailed mapping of the grave site . a team of archaeologists , anthropologists and geo-specialists used spatial analysis to pinpoint the distribution of the man 's belongings and the corpse itself - leading them to propose that his body was ceremoniously placed on elevated rock , some five meters -lrb- about 16 feet -rrb- away from his eventual discovery site . " we concluded that he died in april , and in april the pass was probably full of snow , " said alessandro vanzetti , an archaeologist at the la sapienza university of rome and one of the study 's authors .
" he could n't have died on the spot , furthermore , he did n't die on this stone , as had been reported . "
botanical evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers have not reached consensus on the circumstances of oetzi 's death the team analyzed pollen ingested by oetzi before his death and compared it with pollen found in the ice surrounding him , noting a " mismatch " between his death in april - which the team suspected occurred at a lower altitude - and his possible burial in august or september .
researchers concluded that the iceman died in a different location , and that his body was recovered .
" we think he was kept in some kind of cellar , " vanzetti told deutsche welle .
citing regional historical knowledge , the study noted that in oetzi 's day , the dead were customarily placed in farmsteads called " masi " before the winter snow and ice melted .
" it was used by people in tyrol during the cold seasons , " he said .
" when one was dead , it was impossible to bury immediately , because the ground was frozen . "
" he was a very important person , so people decided to bury him on the pass , " vanzetti added .
luca bondioli , co-author of the paper and an anthropologist with at the national museum of prehistory and ethnology in italy , described oetzi as " an individual of the elite . "
" the fact that we have a new interpretation of the discovery is important , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the study noted that previous oetzi research was based on the initial interpretation of the iceman find and his belongings as " frozen in time and place . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say the iceman died from an arrow wound to the shoulder distribution data but the team 's findings suggested that the iceman 's personal effects were carefully placed near his body during a burial ceremony , not simply scattered around him as he lay dying .
" there is a strong indication that the distribution can be explained by gravity and movement in the ice , " vanzetti said .
the archaeologist and his colleagues proposed that oetzi and his grave goods were placed on an area of raised natural stone .
later on , according to the study , " cyclical thawing and freezing " caused the corpse and the burial items to shift .
the distribution was likely variable : lighter objects , such as hair and oetzi 's quiver , did not move in the same way as more weighty items , such as fur , leather and the body itself .
lingering questions yet not all researchers in the field are prepared to accept the burial theory .

when the corpse of a 5,000-year-old human was uncovered nearly 20 years ago , archaeologists assumed the iceman 's death was anything but ceremonious .
researchers now think oetzi may have received a proper alpine burial . a study released on thursday suggests that oetzi , a human specimen found in the alps of south tyrol nearly two decades ago , was not " frozen in time and place " following his death five millennia ago .
a team of italian and american researchers now believe the iceman actually received a proper burial ceremony atop a mountain pass , months after his death .
oetzi was initially discovered in 1991 at the tisenjoch alpine pass along the border between austria and italy .
researchers theorized that the iceman died of a battle-related arrow wound to the shoulder .
it followed that oetzi 's personal belongings were frozen with him after his death in the upper reaches of the alps .
yet according to a new study published today in the journal antiquity , those conclusions were not based on detailed mapping of the grave site . a team of archaeologists , anthropologists and geo-specialists used spatial analysis to pinpoint the distribution of the man 's belongings and the corpse itself - leading them to propose that his body was ceremoniously placed on elevated rock , some five meters -lrb- about 16 feet -rrb- away from his eventual discovery site . " we concluded that he died in april , and in april the pass was probably full of snow , " said alessandro vanzetti , an archaeologist at the la sapienza university of rome and one of the study 's authors .
" he could n't have died on the spot , furthermore , he did n't die on this stone , as had been reported . "
botanical evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers have not reached consensus on the circumstances of oetzi 's death the team analyzed pollen ingested by oetzi before his death and compared it with pollen found in the ice surrounding him , noting a " mismatch " between his death in april - which the team suspected occurred at a lower altitude - and his possible burial in august or september .
researchers concluded that the iceman died in a different location , and that his body was recovered .
" we think he was kept in some kind of cellar , " vanzetti told deutsche welle .
citing regional historical knowledge , the study noted that in oetzi 's day , the dead were customarily placed in farmsteads called " masi " before the winter snow and ice melted .
" it was used by people in tyrol during the cold seasons , " he said .
" when one was dead , it was impossible to bury immediately , because the ground was frozen . "
" he was a very important person , so people decided to bury him on the pass , " vanzetti added .
luca bondioli , co-author of the paper and an anthropologist with at the national museum of prehistory and ethnology in italy , described oetzi as " an individual of the elite . "
" the fact that we have a new interpretation of the discovery is important , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the study noted that previous oetzi research was based on the initial interpretation of the iceman find and his belongings as " frozen in time and place . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say the iceman died from an arrow wound to the shoulder distribution data but the team 's findings suggested that the iceman 's personal effects were carefully placed near his body during a burial ceremony , not simply scattered around him as he lay dying .
" there is a strong indication that the distribution can be explained by gravity and movement in the ice , " vanzetti said .
the archaeologist and his colleagues proposed that oetzi and his grave goods were placed on an area of raised natural stone .
later on , according to the study , " cyclical thawing and freezing " caused the corpse and the burial items to shift .
the distribution was likely variable : lighter objects , such as hair and oetzi 's quiver , did not move in the same way as more weighty items , such as fur , leather and the body itself .

its sponsors say the nuclear power fight is post-war germany 's largest-ever economic dispute . in the midst of an ongoing debate over whether to extend the lifespan of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , a new report has revealed that the continued availability of nuclear power would likely cause a decrease in investment into renewable energies .
increases in wind and solar energy capacities will eventually lead to nuclear power plants being used less , the report states .
the reason : energy from renewable sources enjoys legal priority over nuclear and coal power .
it is fed into the grid before electricity from non-renewable sources .
as the capacity of electricity from wind or solar sources increases , conventional electricity sources will only be needed to fill in gaps when there is a lack of wind or sun .
but it takes about 50 hours to restart a nuclear power plant that has been completely shut down , meaning it would be necessary to keep the plant running at 50 or 60 percent capacity .
gas powered turbines , however , can be turned on within 20 minutes and can also be run on biogas .
other possibilities to bridge fluctuations in renewable electricity output include the decentralized approach of using micro-power stations or accessing the batteries of electric cars .
companies likely to fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conventional power might only be needed when the wind is n't blowing germany 's four largest energy companies - e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw - will do everything in their power to avoid losing billions on their investments into nuclear power , the report assumes .
supposing the lifespans of the power plant are increased by 28 years , energy companies will have to come to terms with turning them off some 15,800 times between 2020 and the date when the last plant is shut down .
that would cost them between 21 and 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 26.7 billion to $ 101.7 billion -rrb- , unless they successfully lobby to overturn the priority that electricity from renewable sources enjoys and pushed for the construction of those sources to be capped .
gero lucking , of the renewable energy company lichtblick , which sponsored the study , described the dilemma as the " largest post-war economic dispute " in germany .
olav hohmeyer , professor of economics and energy and environmental management at the university of flensburg , authored the study .
according to hohmeyer , electricity needs can entirely be met through renewable energy sources by 2050 .
nuclear power plant lifespans will not need to be extended , nor will there be an electricity deficit to be covered by new coal-fired power plants .
" nuclear power plants are not flexible enough to safely react to changing weather conditions and compensate for fluctuations in wind and sunshine , " hohmeyer said .
hohmeyer 's report states the last nuclear power plant can be removed from the grid in 2023 and the last coal-fired power plant in 2046 .
extending the lifespans of nuclear power plants by 40 years in germany - as has been proposed by the government - would damage vital investment interests and set back the switch to renewable energy by decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased renewable energy could curb the need for nuclear energy monopoly-like structures florian noto of the german nature conservancy represents a group of 21 environmental organizations banded together against nuclear energy .
he said an already-permitted nuclear power plant can generate inexpensive electricity for energy companies , when nuclear waste , risk-based costs and insurance are not taken into account .
" a newly-constructed eco-power plant ca n't necessarily keep up , " he told deutsche welle .
" if the old nuclear power plants just keep running , then progress wo n't be made and little will be invested -lsb- … -rsb- it would actually lead to an investment bottleneck . "
noto also pointed out that four of the 17 nuclear power plants in germany were out of commission for more than 10 months during 2009 , and that at times as many as eight of them were out of commission .
a more diverse and decentralized energy market could lead to lower electricity prices for consumers , according to noto .
" the fact is these companies are actually too dominant , and an economic counterweight needs to be created .
if more new energy companies join this market - if the market is expanded - then that will lead to these monopolistic structures going away , " he said .
electricity from renewable sources will become less expensive in comparison to conventionally generated electricity as prices of raw materials rise , the report states .
by 2050 its additional monthly price compared to conventionally generated electricity could be between just three and 17 euros for an average household using 3,000 kilowatt hours .

noto also pointed out that four of the 17 nuclear power plants in germany were out of commission for more than 10 months during 2009 , and that at times as many as eight of them were out of commission .
a more diverse and decentralized energy market could lead to lower electricity prices for consumers , according to noto .
" the fact is these companies are actually too dominant , and an economic counterweight needs to be created .
if more new energy companies join this market - if the market is expanded - then that will lead to these monopolistic structures going away , " he said .
electricity from renewable sources will become less expensive in comparison to conventionally generated electricity as prices of raw materials rise , the report states .
by 2050 its additional monthly price compared to conventionally generated electricity could be between just three and 17 euros for an average household using 3,000 kilowatt hours .

its sponsors say the nuclear power fight is post-war germany 's largest-ever economic dispute . in the midst of an ongoing debate over whether to extend the lifespan of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , a new report has revealed that the continued availability of nuclear power would likely cause a decrease in investment into renewable energies .
increases in wind and solar energy capacities will eventually lead to nuclear power plants being used less , the report states .
the reason : energy from renewable sources enjoys legal priority over nuclear and coal power .
it is fed into the grid before electricity from non-renewable sources .
as the capacity of electricity from wind or solar sources increases , conventional electricity sources will only be needed to fill in gaps when there is a lack of wind or sun .
but it takes about 50 hours to restart a nuclear power plant that has been completely shut down , meaning it would be necessary to keep the plant running at 50 or 60 percent capacity .
gas powered turbines , however , can be turned on within 20 minutes and can also be run on biogas .
other possibilities to bridge fluctuations in renewable electricity output include the decentralized approach of using micro-power stations or accessing the batteries of electric cars .

supposing the lifespans of the power plant are increased by 28 years , energy companies will have to come to terms with turning them off some 15,800 times between 2020 and the date when the last plant is shut down .
that would cost them between 21 and 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 26.7 billion to $ 101.7 billion -rrb- , unless they successfully lobby to overturn the priority that electricity from renewable sources enjoys and pushed for the construction of those sources to be capped .
gero lucking , of the renewable energy company lichtblick , which sponsored the study , described the dilemma as the " largest post-war economic dispute " in germany .
olav hohmeyer , professor of economics and energy and environmental management at the university of flensburg , authored the study .
according to hohmeyer , electricity needs can entirely be met through renewable energy sources by 2050 .
nuclear power plant lifespans will not need to be extended , nor will there be an electricity deficit to be covered by new coal-fired power plants .
" nuclear power plants are not flexible enough to safely react to changing weather conditions and compensate for fluctuations in wind and sunshine , " hohmeyer said .
hohmeyer 's report states the last nuclear power plant can be removed from the grid in 2023 and the last coal-fired power plant in 2046 .

he said serbia , however , would have to " come to terms " with the loss of kosovo as a province . german foreign minister guido westerwelle urged serbia on thursday to drop its challenges to kosovo 's independence and instead focus its energy on joining the european union .
" in our view , one can only be a member of the european union if one aims for cooperation and is prepared to resolve neighborly difficulties cooperatively , " he told reporters in belgrade .
westerwelle used his first visit to serbia to meet with prime minister mirko cvetkovic , president boris tadic and opposition leaders . he expressed his disagreement with a recent resolution against the secession of kosovo presented by the country to the united nations general assembly .
" the independence of kosovo is a reality , " westerwelle said in a speech at the university of belgrade .
" reconciliation is only possible when one grasps the reality . "
germany has joined 68 other countries in recognizing kosovo 's independence , but serbia adamantly opposes it .
in july , the international court of justice found kosovo 's secession was in line with international law . serbia rejected the ruling and instead is pressing the un to restart talks on the state 's status .
a european resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence has been a highly controversial subject westerwelle said the eu would be willing to broker direct talks between serbia and kosovo to resolve the dispute and questioned serbia 's choice to take the issue to the un instead .
" when someone in europe wants to solve something including conflicts -lsb- … -rsb- the road should first lead to brussels , not to new york , " he said .
on to bosnia , kosovo later thursday , westerwelle is to visit the bosnian capital , sarajevo , where proposed political reforms have long been stalled . parliamentary and presidential elections are scheduled for october .
western powers hope the results will shift the politics away from ethnic divisions and toward a more unified country .
but with two rival autonomous regions , the mainly muslim and croat federation of bosnia and herzegovina and serb-majority republika srpska , bosnia and herzegovina is the most politically unstable of the former yugoslav republics .
westerwelle began his tour in croatia on wednesday , where he provided an optimistic outlook for the country 's prospects of joining the eu .
he continues to kosovo on friday , where he is to visit the 1,400-strong german contingent of kfor , nato 's peacekeeping force in kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.08.2010 dw experts try their luck again with forecasts for bundesliga round 2 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a trip to the repair shop , the dw crystal ball returns this season , deutsche welle 's sports team are laying it on the line and predicting the results of all the bundesliga matches .
after a less than successful start , see what we predict for the second round . it 's round 2 of the 2010/11 bundesliga season and the dw experts are hoping to do a little better than last week when only one game was predicted correctly .
the crystal ball was obviously on the fritz -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- . the opening weekend of the season is always a lottery for forecasters because there is very little of the season 's form book to refer to so with a little more to go on , we hope to have more success with the next round of games . friday , august 27 kaiserslautern – bayern munich bayern looked boringly comfortable for long stretches against wolfsburg in their opening day win but finished the match with the margin a lot closer than it should have been .
kaiserslautern had a somewhat easier game against cologne and performed well , scoring three goals away from home .
bayern showed class and strength in front of their own supporters but these qualities will be tested on the road .
i can see the champions experiencing a slight , early blip in kaiserslautern . prediction : 2-2 saturday , august 28 schalke – hanover schalke blinked first in their match in hamburg last week and as a result lost to one of the teams which could rival them in the race for european places this season .
it 's early yet and the defeat wo n't end schalke 's challenge , but coach felix magath will be upset to have conceded points to one of the top teams already .
expect the royal blues to respond to magath 's wrath by soundly beating hanover in gelsenkirchen with raul marking his bundesliga home debut with at least one goal . prediction : schalke 3-1 bremen – cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen are back to winning ways .
bad news for cologne few would have expected bremen to be on the end of the kind of score line they normally inflict on the opposition .
losing 4-1 to hoffenheim was the worst possible start for thomas schaaf 's team .
luckily they had a confidence-restoring win in europe during the week to get their heads straight again and with qualification for the champions league group stages assured , werder can focus on climbing back up the bundesliga table .
they will begin their climb with victory over cologne who already look like relegation fodder after capitulating at home to kaiserslautern . prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg – mainz steve mcclaren 's wolves looked disjointed against bayern , but did manage 20 minutes of supreme offensive fotball - enough to give the champions a scare .
however , they looked far from cohesive at the back and even against mainz in their first home game of the season , wolfsburg may still not find the right gear .
mainz produced a good display to heap early woe on stuttgart , a team which finished strongly last season .
i think they 'll worry wolfsburg and grab a goal but the wolves will snatch a draw . prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg hit-man ruud hopes to be on target again reports that ruud van nistlerooy 's legs have gone appear to have been wildly exaggerated .
the dutch striker looked all the better for missing out on world cup action this summer , and as a result hamburg should get at least a good half-season out him before the inevitable wear and tear takes its toll .
frankfurt were unlucky to lose 2-1 to hanover last week and i can see them having a harder time against hsv , especially if ruud is still in the same mood as he was against schalke .
hamburg did n't travel well last season , dropping crucial points away from home , but still i think they 'll edge this one . prediction : hamburg 1-0 nuremberg – freiburg freiburg are going to struggle this season as their opening day defeat to st. pauli indicated . losing 3-1 at home to a newly-promoted side does not bode well for a team which has a long-standing relationship with the lower reaches of the bundesliga .
games like the one coming up against nuremberg need to be won if this is not to be a long fight against relegation for freiburg but i do n't see them getting the full quota of points this week .
the best freiburg can hope for is a draw - but i think they 'll get it . prediction : 1-1 st. pauli – hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will give st. pauli more problems than freiburg st. pauli will be flying after their victory over freiburg but they are in danger of crashing to earth against hoffenheim .
they may have their special supporters behind them on saturday but the gulf in class is likely to be too big for pauli .
one forgets that hoffenheim were once the village team made good , such is their standing in the top division now .

after a less than successful start , see what we predict for the second round . it 's round 2 of the 2010/11 bundesliga season and the dw experts are hoping to do a little better than last week when only one game was predicted correctly .
the crystal ball was obviously on the fritz -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- . the opening weekend of the season is always a lottery for forecasters because there is very little of the season 's form book to refer to so with a little more to go on , we hope to have more success with the next round of games . friday , august 27 kaiserslautern – bayern munich bayern looked boringly comfortable for long stretches against wolfsburg in their opening day win but finished the match with the margin a lot closer than it should have been .
kaiserslautern had a somewhat easier game against cologne and performed well , scoring three goals away from home .
bayern showed class and strength in front of their own supporters but these qualities will be tested on the road .
i can see the champions experiencing a slight , early blip in kaiserslautern . prediction : 2-2 saturday , august 28 schalke – hanover schalke blinked first in their match in hamburg last week and as a result lost to one of the teams which could rival them in the race for european places this season .
it 's early yet and the defeat wo n't end schalke 's challenge , but coach felix magath will be upset to have conceded points to one of the top teams already .
expect the royal blues to respond to magath 's wrath by soundly beating hanover in gelsenkirchen with raul marking his bundesliga home debut with at least one goal . prediction : schalke 3-1 bremen – cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen are back to winning ways .
bad news for cologne few would have expected bremen to be on the end of the kind of score line they normally inflict on the opposition .
losing 4-1 to hoffenheim was the worst possible start for thomas schaaf 's team .
luckily they had a confidence-restoring win in europe during the week to get their heads straight again and with qualification for the champions league group stages assured , werder can focus on climbing back up the bundesliga table .
they will begin their climb with victory over cologne who already look like relegation fodder after capitulating at home to kaiserslautern . prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg – mainz steve mcclaren 's wolves looked disjointed against bayern , but did manage 20 minutes of supreme offensive fotball - enough to give the champions a scare .
however , they looked far from cohesive at the back and even against mainz in their first home game of the season , wolfsburg may still not find the right gear .
mainz produced a good display to heap early woe on stuttgart , a team which finished strongly last season .
i think they 'll worry wolfsburg and grab a goal but the wolves will snatch a draw . prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg hit-man ruud hopes to be on target again reports that ruud van nistlerooy 's legs have gone appear to have been wildly exaggerated .
the dutch striker looked all the better for missing out on world cup action this summer , and as a result hamburg should get at least a good half-season out him before the inevitable wear and tear takes its toll .
frankfurt were unlucky to lose 2-1 to hanover last week and i can see them having a harder time against hsv , especially if ruud is still in the same mood as he was against schalke .
hamburg did n't travel well last season , dropping crucial points away from home , but still i think they 'll edge this one . prediction : hamburg 1-0 nuremberg – freiburg freiburg are going to struggle this season as their opening day defeat to st. pauli indicated . losing 3-1 at home to a newly-promoted side does not bode well for a team which has a long-standing relationship with the lower reaches of the bundesliga .
games like the one coming up against nuremberg need to be won if this is not to be a long fight against relegation for freiburg but i do n't see them getting the full quota of points this week .
the best freiburg can hope for is a draw - but i think they 'll get it . prediction : 1-1 st. pauli – hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will give st. pauli more problems than freiburg st. pauli will be flying after their victory over freiburg but they are in danger of crashing to earth against hoffenheim .
they may have their special supporters behind them on saturday but the gulf in class is likely to be too big for pauli .
one forgets that hoffenheim were once the village team made good , such is their standing in the top division now .
st. pauli might appear to be lambs to the slaughter in the wake of hoffenheim 's giving bremen a hiding , but i think the men from the rhine-neckar will have a harder job in hamburg .
that 's not to say they wo n't still win , though . prediction : hoffenheim 2-0 leverkusen - moenchengladbach bayer leverkusen have started in much the same way as they began last season - and by beating dortmund 2-0 away from home , michael ballack and co. have laid down a marker .
dortmund were tough to beat last year and can be expected to be difficult opponents this season , a fact that adds even more gloss to leverkusen 's win .
ballack 's boys will be too much for gladbach who just scraped a draw with nuremberg last week . prediction : leverkusen 3-1 sunday , august 29 stuttgart – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart boss christian gross hopes for something to clap both teams expected more from their opening games in which both were defeated , and both will be eager to put those false starts behind them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.08.2010 dw experts try their luck again with forecasts for bundesliga round 2 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a trip to the repair shop , the dw crystal ball returns this season , deutsche welle 's sports team are laying it on the line and predicting the results of all the bundesliga matches .
after a less than successful start , see what we predict for the second round . it 's round 2 of the 2010/11 bundesliga season and the dw experts are hoping to do a little better than last week when only one game was predicted correctly .
the crystal ball was obviously on the fritz -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- . the opening weekend of the season is always a lottery for forecasters because there is very little of the season 's form book to refer to so with a little more to go on , we hope to have more success with the next round of games . friday , august 27 kaiserslautern – bayern munich bayern looked boringly comfortable for long stretches against wolfsburg in their opening day win but finished the match with the margin a lot closer than it should have been .
kaiserslautern had a somewhat easier game against cologne and performed well , scoring three goals away from home .
bayern showed class and strength in front of their own supporters but these qualities will be tested on the road .
i can see the champions experiencing a slight , early blip in kaiserslautern . prediction : 2-2 saturday , august 28 schalke – hanover schalke blinked first in their match in hamburg last week and as a result lost to one of the teams which could rival them in the race for european places this season .
it 's early yet and the defeat wo n't end schalke 's challenge , but coach felix magath will be upset to have conceded points to one of the top teams already .
expect the royal blues to respond to magath 's wrath by soundly beating hanover in gelsenkirchen with raul marking his bundesliga home debut with at least one goal . prediction : schalke 3-1 bremen – cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen are back to winning ways .
bad news for cologne few would have expected bremen to be on the end of the kind of score line they normally inflict on the opposition .
losing 4-1 to hoffenheim was the worst possible start for thomas schaaf 's team .
luckily they had a confidence-restoring win in europe during the week to get their heads straight again and with qualification for the champions league group stages assured , werder can focus on climbing back up the bundesliga table .
they will begin their climb with victory over cologne who already look like relegation fodder after capitulating at home to kaiserslautern . prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg – mainz steve mcclaren 's wolves looked disjointed against bayern , but did manage 20 minutes of supreme offensive fotball - enough to give the champions a scare .
however , they looked far from cohesive at the back and even against mainz in their first home game of the season , wolfsburg may still not find the right gear .
mainz produced a good display to heap early woe on stuttgart , a team which finished strongly last season .
i think they 'll worry wolfsburg and grab a goal but the wolves will snatch a draw . prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg hit-man ruud hopes to be on target again reports that ruud van nistlerooy 's legs have gone appear to have been wildly exaggerated .
the dutch striker looked all the better for missing out on world cup action this summer , and as a result hamburg should get at least a good half-season out him before the inevitable wear and tear takes its toll .
frankfurt were unlucky to lose 2-1 to hanover last week and i can see them having a harder time against hsv , especially if ruud is still in the same mood as he was against schalke .
hamburg did n't travel well last season , dropping crucial points away from home , but still i think they 'll edge this one . prediction : hamburg 1-0 nuremberg – freiburg freiburg are going to struggle this season as their opening day defeat to st. pauli indicated . losing 3-1 at home to a newly-promoted side does not bode well for a team which has a long-standing relationship with the lower reaches of the bundesliga .
games like the one coming up against nuremberg need to be won if this is not to be a long fight against relegation for freiburg but i do n't see them getting the full quota of points this week .
the best freiburg can hope for is a draw - but i think they 'll get it . prediction : 1-1 st. pauli – hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will give st. pauli more problems than freiburg st. pauli will be flying after their victory over freiburg but they are in danger of crashing to earth against hoffenheim .
they may have their special supporters behind them on saturday but the gulf in class is likely to be too big for pauli .
one forgets that hoffenheim were once the village team made good , such is their standing in the top division now .
st. pauli might appear to be lambs to the slaughter in the wake of hoffenheim 's giving bremen a hiding , but i think the men from the rhine-neckar will have a harder job in hamburg .
that 's not to say they wo n't still win , though . prediction : hoffenheim 2-0 leverkusen - moenchengladbach bayer leverkusen have started in much the same way as they began last season - and by beating dortmund 2-0 away from home , michael ballack and co. have laid down a marker .
dortmund were tough to beat last year and can be expected to be difficult opponents this season , a fact that adds even more gloss to leverkusen 's win .
ballack 's boys will be too much for gladbach who just scraped a draw with nuremberg last week . prediction : leverkusen 3-1 sunday , august 29 stuttgart – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart boss christian gross hopes for something to clap both teams expected more from their opening games in which both were defeated , and both will be eager to put those false starts behind them .
however , stuttgart and dortmund both saw europa league action on thursday and could be running on fumes as they seek full fitness in the early season . whatever happens , these two sides will give whatever they 've got .
i see dortmund edging stuttgart through sheer power . prediction : dortmund 2-1 last week 's result : 5 points bayern – wolfsburg 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:1 , one point -rrb- hoffenheim – bremen 4:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:2 , one point -rrb- moenchengladbach – nuremberg 1:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , no points -rrb- cologne – kaiserslautern 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- freiburg – st. pauli 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- hanover – frankfurt 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , no points -rrb- hamburg – schalke 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , three points -rrb- mainz – stuttgart 2:0 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , no points -rrb- dortmund – leverkusen 0:2 -lrb- dw prediction 2:2 , no points -rrb- three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a less than successful start , see what we predict for the second round . it 's round 2 of the 2010/11 bundesliga season and the dw experts are hoping to do a little better than last week when only one game was predicted correctly .
the crystal ball was obviously on the fritz -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- . the opening weekend of the season is always a lottery for forecasters because there is very little of the season 's form book to refer to so with a little more to go on , we hope to have more success with the next round of games . friday , august 27 kaiserslautern – bayern munich bayern looked boringly comfortable for long stretches against wolfsburg in their opening day win but finished the match with the margin a lot closer than it should have been .
kaiserslautern had a somewhat easier game against cologne and performed well , scoring three goals away from home .
bayern showed class and strength in front of their own supporters but these qualities will be tested on the road .
i can see the champions experiencing a slight , early blip in kaiserslautern . prediction : 2-2 saturday , august 28 schalke – hanover schalke blinked first in their match in hamburg last week and as a result lost to one of the teams which could rival them in the race for european places this season .
it 's early yet and the defeat wo n't end schalke 's challenge , but coach felix magath will be upset to have conceded points to one of the top teams already .
expect the royal blues to respond to magath 's wrath by soundly beating hanover in gelsenkirchen with raul marking his bundesliga home debut with at least one goal . prediction : schalke 3-1 bremen – cologne bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen are back to winning ways .
bad news for cologne few would have expected bremen to be on the end of the kind of score line they normally inflict on the opposition .
losing 4-1 to hoffenheim was the worst possible start for thomas schaaf 's team .
luckily they had a confidence-restoring win in europe during the week to get their heads straight again and with qualification for the champions league group stages assured , werder can focus on climbing back up the bundesliga table .
they will begin their climb with victory over cologne who already look like relegation fodder after capitulating at home to kaiserslautern . prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg – mainz steve mcclaren 's wolves looked disjointed against bayern , but did manage 20 minutes of supreme offensive fotball - enough to give the champions a scare .
however , they looked far from cohesive at the back and even against mainz in their first home game of the season , wolfsburg may still not find the right gear .
mainz produced a good display to heap early woe on stuttgart , a team which finished strongly last season .
i think they 'll worry wolfsburg and grab a goal but the wolves will snatch a draw . prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg hit-man ruud hopes to be on target again reports that ruud van nistlerooy 's legs have gone appear to have been wildly exaggerated .
the dutch striker looked all the better for missing out on world cup action this summer , and as a result hamburg should get at least a good half-season out him before the inevitable wear and tear takes its toll .
frankfurt were unlucky to lose 2-1 to hanover last week and i can see them having a harder time against hsv , especially if ruud is still in the same mood as he was against schalke .
hamburg did n't travel well last season , dropping crucial points away from home , but still i think they 'll edge this one . prediction : hamburg 1-0 nuremberg – freiburg freiburg are going to struggle this season as their opening day defeat to st. pauli indicated . losing 3-1 at home to a newly-promoted side does not bode well for a team which has a long-standing relationship with the lower reaches of the bundesliga .
games like the one coming up against nuremberg need to be won if this is not to be a long fight against relegation for freiburg but i do n't see them getting the full quota of points this week .
the best freiburg can hope for is a draw - but i think they 'll get it . prediction : 1-1 st. pauli – hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim will give st. pauli more problems than freiburg st. pauli will be flying after their victory over freiburg but they are in danger of crashing to earth against hoffenheim .
they may have their special supporters behind them on saturday but the gulf in class is likely to be too big for pauli .
one forgets that hoffenheim were once the village team made good , such is their standing in the top division now .
st. pauli might appear to be lambs to the slaughter in the wake of hoffenheim 's giving bremen a hiding , but i think the men from the rhine-neckar will have a harder job in hamburg .
that 's not to say they wo n't still win , though . prediction : hoffenheim 2-0 leverkusen - moenchengladbach bayer leverkusen have started in much the same way as they began last season - and by beating dortmund 2-0 away from home , michael ballack and co. have laid down a marker .
dortmund were tough to beat last year and can be expected to be difficult opponents this season , a fact that adds even more gloss to leverkusen 's win .
ballack 's boys will be too much for gladbach who just scraped a draw with nuremberg last week . prediction : leverkusen 3-1 sunday , august 29 stuttgart – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart boss christian gross hopes for something to clap both teams expected more from their opening games in which both were defeated , and both will be eager to put those false starts behind them .
however , stuttgart and dortmund both saw europa league action on thursday and could be running on fumes as they seek full fitness in the early season . whatever happens , these two sides will give whatever they 've got .
i see dortmund edging stuttgart through sheer power . prediction : dortmund 2-1 last week 's result : 5 points bayern – wolfsburg 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:1 , one point -rrb- hoffenheim – bremen 4:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:2 , one point -rrb- moenchengladbach – nuremberg 1:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , no points -rrb- cologne – kaiserslautern 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- freiburg – st. pauli 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- hanover – frankfurt 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , no points -rrb- hamburg – schalke 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , three points -rrb- mainz – stuttgart 2:0 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , no points -rrb- dortmund – leverkusen 0:2 -lrb- dw prediction 2:2 , no points -rrb- three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 26.08.2010 microbes aiding gulf oil degradation , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers believe bacteria are digesting oil in the deepwater plume a new study published in the journal science says petroleum-degrading bacteria are consuming oil from the blown-out wellhead in the gulf of mexico . british oil company bp has used dispersants , burns and skimming operations in a bid to clean up the worst oil spill in us history .
now , new research indicates that nature might be lending a hand : according to a study published in the journal science on tuesday , microbes are consuming and breaking down the huge underwater plume of crude in the gulf of mexico . a team led by terry hazen of the lawrence berkeley national laboratory , monitored the oil plume starting in may – and that meant tracking the microbes eating it .
the study involved work at 17 deepwater sites to gather more than 200 samples .
scientists found that microbes were consuming the oil without significantly depleting oxygen levels . more recently , the team failed to detect the underwater plume , indicating that microbes were gobbling it up . us scientists say about 4.9 million barrels of oil have leaked into the gulf since april , more than five times the amount spilled during the exxon valdez disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spill clean-up effort has involved skimming operations and dispersants a scientific snapshot the latest findings seemed to run counter to a study published in the same journal on august 19 , which noted no marked signs of microbial biodegradation .
scientists from the woods hole oceanographic institute examining the plume 's chemical composition noted that dissolved oxygen levels within the plume were close to the levels recorded outside it . chris reddy , a woods hole scientist , said those oxygen levels indicated that if microbes were consuming the oil , they were doing so very slowly . " any self-respecting microbe will want to eat oil – it is like butter , " he said .
" but microbes are a lot like teenagers . they do what they want , when they want , and so it 's difficult often to make predictions about microbial degradation – and in fact , it may vary substantially in the gulf at any one time . " the woods hole scientists confirmed the plume 's existence , measuring more than 1,100 meters below the surface , with crude stretching out over a minimum distance of 35 kilometers from the wellhead . reddy added that the plume did not appear as a chocolate mousse-like concentration . " the water samples , when we ’ re right in the plume , look like spring water – and you certainly didn ’ t see any oil droplets , and you certainly didn ’ t smell it , " he said . " but that doesn ’ t mean that there ’ s no detectable oil . " bildunterschrift : woods hole scientists said the oil plume stretched at least 35 kilometers more work planned scientists from woods hole said their study only amounted to a two-week snapshot of the plume in june . they refused to say what effects it may have on the ecosystem – and reddy said more studies are in the pipeline , including some that focus on whether microbes are consuming the oil . " microbes eat compounds like we eat at a buffet , " he said .
" they like some compounds better than others .
they leave behind a fingerprint of what they chose to eat . ” as the new study indicates , the berkeley scientists succeeded in detecting that fingerprint .
scientists involved in the woods hole study did not register markedly lower levels of oxygen that would suggest the presence of bacteria .
but terry hazen , lead author of the latest report , said he believes the bacteria did n't require large amounts of oxygen to eat the oil in the first place . " these bugs have been adapted to using oil as a carbon source over millions of years because the gulf of mexico receives the equivalent of more than an exxon valdez spill every single year – and it 's been doing that for millions of years from natural seeps , " he said . bildunterschrift : a study confirmed the existence of a plume of oil in the gulf of mexico the spill 's environmental toll hazen said it is difficult to predict how this might affect marine life in the gulf . meanwhile , the oil industry has remained mum on the topic : the american petroleum institute , which represents oil companies in washington , d.c. , said commenting on the oil spill 's possible biological effects would only amount to speculation at this point . sylvia earle , an oceanographer and the former chief scientist for the u.s. national oceanic and atospheric administration , was also reluctant to predict which species might be hurt by the spill .
she said that wildlife populations close to the sites of other major spills have suffered in the past , adding that we may never know just what has been lost . " the deeper you go , the less we know , " earle said . " we do know that there are deep corals , but because all of the gulf has n't been surveyed , we have a spotty record – but we know that they 're there . " " where we 've looked , we 've found them , " she added .
" some of these are thousands of years old . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the long-term environmental impact of the spill is still unclear a wake-up call the oceanographer worries that the oil and the chemicals added to break-up the oil will push a weakened ecosystem to the brink . the gulf of mexico already suffers from dead zones – areas where oxygen levels are so low that aquatic life ca n't survive there .
earle hopes the bp oil spill will serve as a wake-up call , alerting the public to the need to save the seas . " the ocean is the cornerstone of our life-support system , " she said . " it drives the chemistry of the planet .
it shapes the way the world works – from the temperature , to oxygen in the atmosphere , to the carbon cycle , the nitrogen cycle . " " modify the ocean , and you 've modified everything , " earle said . regardless of whether the bp oil spill majorly modifies marine life , many are calling for continued monitoring .
they believe problems , just like the oil plume , could be lurking just under the surface . author : laura iiyama -lrb- arp -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de mud continues to hold oil under blown-out well , bp says bp said it reached a " milestone " in keeping more oil from gushing into the gulf of mexico .
the spill is now the largest in history , but experts are expected to show that its impact will be less than some feared .
-lrb- 04.08.2010 -rrb- paying for their messes : the record for oil companies is n't stellar people affected by the exxon valdez oil-spill disaster had to wait two decades before being compensated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 26.08.2010 expats bring english theater to cosmopolitan berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amy nye -lrb- left -rrb- plays the femme fatale in the english-language play lovepuke as berlin increasingly becomes an international artistic hub , there are plenty of english-speaking actors and directors to run the thriving english theater scene .
audiences are mainly germans who enjoy the challenge . the english theatre berlin is the german capital 's only exclusively english-language theater .
oddly enough , the theater 's founder and artistic director , is german . guenther grosser - not from berlin , but from bavaria - studied acting in new york in the late 1980s .
with the fall of the berlin wall , he saw a chance to establish an english-language theater in the german capital . " when the wall came down we all realized -lsb- that -rsb- this is really becoming an international capital , and there are so many people moving to berlin from all over the world , " said grosser .
" so i think the english-language theater is a must in this town . " celebrating two decades this year , the english theatre berlin plays a strong , if modest role on the city 's vast theater scene .
since german reunification , berlin has become one of europe 's hippest meccas for artistic creativity and , according to grosser , this development has had a direct and dramatic affect on his theater . " -lsb- many -rsb- more young theater-makers are in berlin now than ever before , " he said .
" it is much easier for us now to choose from a large crowd of actors - and we 're talking about professional native-speaking english language actors living in town . " having a bigger pool of actors means a greater diversity of ideas , approaches and aesthetics . love is universal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the theater 's founder guenther grosser was inspired by his time in new york in this summer 's production of lovepuke , a play about the trials and tribulations of love , sex and communication in modern relationships , amy hye plays the role of the femme fatale , louise .
originally from new zealand , hye recently moved to berlin after spending six years in madrid . she 's one of berlin 's many new arrivals , attracted by the city 's creative mystique and promise of cheap living . " in madrid , we were working really fast-paced comedy shows , one-hour shows back-to-back , " she said .
" the level of english was n't so good - whereas here , i think you can perform more in a traditional theater sense , because the level of english is better . " lovepuke is directed by fingal pollack , a 28-year-old aspiring director from new zealand who came to berlin two years ago for a four-day visit - and never left .
what keeps her here -lrb- besides her boyfriend -rrb- is the city 's fertile creative soil and the opportunities at the english theatre berlin . " this is the second big play i 've directed in berlin , so it 's a beginning for me , " explained pollack .
" there 's so much opportunity , and it 's easy to do your thing here .
there 's space and there 's time to be able to find out what you really want to do , and what you 're good at , as well .

there 's space and there 's time to be able to find out what you really want to do , and what you 're good at , as well . " for love of theater to finance her love for directing serious plays , pollack does what she can to stay afloat , working in children 's theater , teaching english and taking on translation projects .
while there 's still a lot of support for young theater-makers in new zealand , fingal prefers the artistic possibilities that berlin 's eclectic english-language theater scene has to offer . " new zealand has a very good theater scene , but because berlin is such a mixing pot of different cultures , i think it is a far richer choice , " said pollack , adding that she had 50 strong actors audition for lovepuke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lovepuke looks at the challenges of modern relationships while there is a good supply of english-speaking actors in the german capital , the audiences remain largely german .
at a recent performance of lovepuke , some 70 percent of the spectators were german - theater buffs who come for the love of art , and the challenge of consuming it in a foreign language . not yet in the big leagues the english theatre berlin may be a well-established institution , but in the fringe theater scene .
crossing over into mainstream does n't seem feasible . " i find there is not a stepping stone system in place between fringe theater and mainstream theater , " said pollack .
" i do n't know how i would get into mainstream theater in berlin , but i know in new zealand : the big people come and see the little shows . " old traditions like the strict separation of fringe and mainstream theater die hard in germany , even in a city as progressive as berlin .
however , with the city evolving into an evermore culturally-cutting edge metropolis , the english theatre berlin could one day grow to such an extent that it becomes mainstream itself . author : leah mcdonnell / kjb editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 26.08.2010 prolonging nuclear power may stymie investment into renewables großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants were turned off for most of 2009 a new report has outlined why ending the use of nuclear energy matters for the development of renewable energy infrastructure .
its sponsors say the nuclear power fight is post-war germany 's largest-ever economic dispute . in the midst of an ongoing debate over whether to extend the lifespan of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , a new report has revealed that the continued availability of nuclear power would likely cause a decrease in investment into renewable energies .
increases in wind and solar energy capacities will eventually lead to nuclear power plants being used less , the report states .
the reason : energy from renewable sources enjoys legal priority over nuclear and coal power .
it is fed into the grid before electricity from non-renewable sources .
as the capacity of electricity from wind or solar sources increases , conventional electricity sources will only be needed to fill in gaps when there is a lack of wind or sun .
but it takes about 50 hours to restart a nuclear power plant that has been completely shut down , meaning it would be necessary to keep the plant running at 50 or 60 percent capacity .
gas powered turbines , however , can be turned on within 20 minutes and can also be run on biogas .
other possibilities to bridge fluctuations in renewable electricity output include the decentralized approach of using micro-power stations or accessing the batteries of electric cars .
companies likely to fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conventional power might only be needed when the wind is n't blowing germany 's four largest energy companies - e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw - will do everything in their power to avoid losing billions on their investments into nuclear power , the report assumes .
supposing the lifespans of the power plant are increased by 28 years , energy companies will have to come to terms with turning them off some 15,800 times between 2020 and the date when the last plant is shut down .
that would cost them between 21 and 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 26.7 billion to $ 101.7 billion -rrb- , unless they successfully lobby to overturn the priority that electricity from renewable sources enjoys and pushed for the construction of those sources to be capped .
gero lucking , of the renewable energy company lichtblick , which sponsored the study , described the dilemma as the " largest post-war economic dispute " in germany .
olav hohmeyer , professor of economics and energy and environmental management at the university of flensburg , authored the study .
according to hohmeyer , electricity needs can entirely be met through renewable energy sources by 2050 .
nuclear power plant lifespans will not need to be extended , nor will there be an electricity deficit to be covered by new coal-fired power plants .
" nuclear power plants are not flexible enough to safely react to changing weather conditions and compensate for fluctuations in wind and sunshine , " hohmeyer said .
hohmeyer 's report states the last nuclear power plant can be removed from the grid in 2023 and the last coal-fired power plant in 2046 .
extending the lifespans of nuclear power plants by 40 years in germany - as has been proposed by the government - would damage vital investment interests and set back the switch to renewable energy by decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased renewable energy could curb the need for nuclear energy monopoly-like structures florian noto of the german nature conservancy represents a group of 21 environmental organizations banded together against nuclear energy .
he said an already-permitted nuclear power plant can generate inexpensive electricity for energy companies , when nuclear waste , risk-based costs and insurance are not taken into account .
" a newly-constructed eco-power plant ca n't necessarily keep up , " he told deutsche welle .
" if the old nuclear power plants just keep running , then progress wo n't be made and little will be invested -lsb- … -rsb- it would actually lead to an investment bottleneck . "
noto also pointed out that four of the 17 nuclear power plants in germany were out of commission for more than 10 months during 2009 , and that at times as many as eight of them were out of commission .
a more diverse and decentralized energy market could lead to lower electricity prices for consumers , according to noto .
" the fact is these companies are actually too dominant , and an economic counterweight needs to be created .
if more new energy companies join this market - if the market is expanded - then that will lead to these monopolistic structures going away , " he said .
electricity from renewable sources will become less expensive in comparison to conventionally generated electricity as prices of raw materials rise , the report states .
by 2050 its additional monthly price compared to conventionally generated electricity could be between just three and 17 euros for an average household using 3,000 kilowatt hours .

he said serbia , however , would have to " come to terms " with the loss of kosovo as a province . german foreign minister guido westerwelle urged serbia on thursday to drop its challenges to kosovo 's independence and instead focus its energy on joining the european union .
" in our view , one can only be a member of the european union if one aims for cooperation and is prepared to resolve neighborly difficulties cooperatively , " he told reporters in belgrade .
westerwelle used his first visit to serbia to meet with prime minister mirko cvetkovic , president boris tadic and opposition leaders . he expressed his disagreement with a recent resolution against the secession of kosovo presented by the country to the united nations general assembly .
" the independence of kosovo is a reality , " westerwelle said in a speech at the university of belgrade .
" reconciliation is only possible when one grasps the reality . "
germany has joined 68 other countries in recognizing kosovo 's independence , but serbia adamantly opposes it .
in july , the international court of justice found kosovo 's secession was in line with international law . serbia rejected the ruling and instead is pressing the un to restart talks on the state 's status .
a european resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence has been a highly controversial subject westerwelle said the eu would be willing to broker direct talks between serbia and kosovo to resolve the dispute and questioned serbia 's choice to take the issue to the un instead .
" when someone in europe wants to solve something including conflicts -lsb- … -rsb- the road should first lead to brussels , not to new york , " he said .
on to bosnia , kosovo later thursday , westerwelle is to visit the bosnian capital , sarajevo , where proposed political reforms have long been stalled . parliamentary and presidential elections are scheduled for october .
western powers hope the results will shift the politics away from ethnic divisions and toward a more unified country .
but with two rival autonomous regions , the mainly muslim and croat federation of bosnia and herzegovina and serb-majority republika srpska , bosnia and herzegovina is the most politically unstable of the former yugoslav republics .
westerwelle began his tour in croatia on wednesday , where he provided an optimistic outlook for the country 's prospects of joining the eu .
he continues to kosovo on friday , where he is to visit the 1,400-strong german contingent of kfor , nato 's peacekeeping force in kosovo .

electricity from renewable sources will become less expensive in comparison to conventionally generated electricity as prices of raw materials rise , the report states .

its sponsors say the nuclear power fight is post-war germany 's largest-ever economic dispute . in the midst of an ongoing debate over whether to extend the lifespan of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , a new report has revealed that the continued availability of nuclear power would likely cause a decrease in investment into renewable energies .
increases in wind and solar energy capacities will eventually lead to nuclear power plants being used less , the report states .
the reason : energy from renewable sources enjoys legal priority over nuclear and coal power .
it is fed into the grid before electricity from non-renewable sources .
as the capacity of electricity from wind or solar sources increases , conventional electricity sources will only be needed to fill in gaps when there is a lack of wind or sun .
but it takes about 50 hours to restart a nuclear power plant that has been completely shut down , meaning it would be necessary to keep the plant running at 50 or 60 percent capacity .
gas powered turbines , however , can be turned on within 20 minutes and can also be run on biogas .
other possibilities to bridge fluctuations in renewable electricity output include the decentralized approach of using micro-power stations or accessing the batteries of electric cars .

gero lucking , of the renewable energy company lichtblick , which sponsored the study , described the dilemma as the " largest post-war economic dispute " in germany .
olav hohmeyer , professor of economics and energy and environmental management at the university of flensburg , authored the study .
according to hohmeyer , electricity needs can entirely be met through renewable energy sources by 2050 .
nuclear power plant lifespans will not need to be extended , nor will there be an electricity deficit to be covered by new coal-fired power plants .
" nuclear power plants are not flexible enough to safely react to changing weather conditions and compensate for fluctuations in wind and sunshine , " hohmeyer said .
hohmeyer 's report states the last nuclear power plant can be removed from the grid in 2023 and the last coal-fired power plant in 2046 .
extending the lifespans of nuclear power plants by 40 years in germany - as has been proposed by the government - would damage vital investment interests and set back the switch to renewable energy by decades .

extending the lifespans of nuclear power plants by 40 years in germany - as has been proposed by the government - would damage vital investment interests and set back the switch to renewable energy by decades .

he said an already-permitted nuclear power plant can generate inexpensive electricity for energy companies , when nuclear waste , risk-based costs and insurance are not taken into account .
" a newly-constructed eco-power plant ca n't necessarily keep up , " he told deutsche welle .
" if the old nuclear power plants just keep running , then progress wo n't be made and little will be invested -lsb- … -rsb- it would actually lead to an investment bottleneck . "
noto also pointed out that four of the 17 nuclear power plants in germany were out of commission for more than 10 months during 2009 , and that at times as many as eight of them were out of commission .
a more diverse and decentralized energy market could lead to lower electricity prices for consumers , according to noto .
" the fact is these companies are actually too dominant , and an economic counterweight needs to be created .
if more new energy companies join this market - if the market is expanded - then that will lead to these monopolistic structures going away , " he said .
electricity from renewable sources will become less expensive in comparison to conventionally generated electricity as prices of raw materials rise , the report states .
by 2050 its additional monthly price compared to conventionally generated electricity could be between just three and 17 euros for an average household using 3,000 kilowatt hours .

its sponsors say the nuclear power fight is post-war germany 's largest-ever economic dispute . in the midst of an ongoing debate over whether to extend the lifespan of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , a new report has revealed that the continued availability of nuclear power would likely cause a decrease in investment into renewable energies .
increases in wind and solar energy capacities will eventually lead to nuclear power plants being used less , the report states .
the reason : energy from renewable sources enjoys legal priority over nuclear and coal power .
it is fed into the grid before electricity from non-renewable sources .
as the capacity of electricity from wind or solar sources increases , conventional electricity sources will only be needed to fill in gaps when there is a lack of wind or sun .
but it takes about 50 hours to restart a nuclear power plant that has been completely shut down , meaning it would be necessary to keep the plant running at 50 or 60 percent capacity .
gas powered turbines , however , can be turned on within 20 minutes and can also be run on biogas .
other possibilities to bridge fluctuations in renewable electricity output include the decentralized approach of using micro-power stations or accessing the batteries of electric cars .
companies likely to fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conventional power might only be needed when the wind is n't blowing germany 's four largest energy companies - e.on , rwe , vattenfall and enbw - will do everything in their power to avoid losing billions on their investments into nuclear power , the report assumes .
supposing the lifespans of the power plant are increased by 28 years , energy companies will have to come to terms with turning them off some 15,800 times between 2020 and the date when the last plant is shut down .
that would cost them between 21 and 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 26.7 billion to $ 101.7 billion -rrb- , unless they successfully lobby to overturn the priority that electricity from renewable sources enjoys and pushed for the construction of those sources to be capped .
gero lucking , of the renewable energy company lichtblick , which sponsored the study , described the dilemma as the " largest post-war economic dispute " in germany .
olav hohmeyer , professor of economics and energy and environmental management at the university of flensburg , authored the study .
according to hohmeyer , electricity needs can entirely be met through renewable energy sources by 2050 .
nuclear power plant lifespans will not need to be extended , nor will there be an electricity deficit to be covered by new coal-fired power plants .
