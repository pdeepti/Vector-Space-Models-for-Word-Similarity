program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 27.11.2010 polish workers leave ireland as economy wilts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shops catering to poles may find it hard to keep going ireland saw huge immigration levels when the ' celtic tiger ' boom was in full swing .
but as the boom has turned to bust , many of the immigrants who have lost their jobs are choosing to return home . it is difficult to say exactly how many immigrants arrived in ireland as its economy boomed in the middle of this decade , but according to james wickham , a professor of sociology at trinity college in dublin , immigration figures were pretty high .
" the highest figure that i 've heard is 200,000 , which for a country of 4.5 million is , of course , pretty big , " he said .
the numbers spiked as eastern european nations joined the european union in 2004 .
" immigration was absolutely massive shortly before and above all immediately after accession , " wickham said . " essentially what happened was that people from eastern europe - above all poland , but also lithuania and latvia to a lesser extent provided the labor for the famous ' celtic tiger ' boom . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulk of polish immigration occurred around 2004 supermarkets , delis , travel agencies and businesses aimed at polish and eastern europeans have sprung up all over ireland to cater for the immigrants who came seeking their fortune .
at polski sklep , a polish supermarket in central dublin , every customer knows of people who have lost their jobs because of the recession .
malgorzata stankiewicz moved to ireland in early 2007 when the economy was still growing and found a job easily .
in retrospect , she says she might have misjudged the strength of the irish economy .
" i think it was n't as good as i heard about , " she said .
" but it was still good , i had a job , and i did n't have a problem finding it . "
she then lost that job , and has now been unemployed for a year , although she is constantly looking for new work , sending out her résumé every day and honing her skills as much as she can .
she has several friends who were also laid off , and most of them went back to poland to be with their families .
reasons to stay people like malgorzata are not left to fend for themselves though .
as wickham explained , the welfare state in the irish republic has to provide for them if they stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many poles say the working environment is better in ireland " they are european citizens , they have every right to be here .
they have exactly the same rights to social welfare benefits as irish citizens do , " he said .
" at the moment our benefits are very high - they 're very high compared to the uk , for example . "
beyond welfare provision , which is likely to fall during the government 's austerity drive , there are other reasons for immigrants to stay . wickham said his research shows poles and other eastern european arrivals appreciate the way they are treated in the workplace if they can find a job .
" people found that compared to working in poland , irish workplaces were more informal , gave people more initiative .
irish workplaces are seen as more american - people do n't stand on their roles and people reward initiative . "
changing trends agnes kuzinska , who came to ireland in 2006 , admits she was drawn to ireland by the good press it was getting back home .
" i came here because my friends were here and i had a good time , and people were more sympathetic , friendlier , " she said . but she points to a new trend among polish migrants to ireland : the temporary .
in the past it was thought that most polish families who moved to the irish republic would stay .
now , according to agnes , people are willing to move more than once .
" so many people go back to poland .
stay here for a few years , then go back to poland . "

and germany ’ s finance ministry said that chancellor angela merkel had already ruled out the idea of issuing bonds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle and merkel rejected the idea of eurozone bonds but german news weekly focus cited sources claiming that germany might drop its objections to such bonds , if strict conditions for tougher sanctions on countries running up excessive deficits were imposed .
the solution would help troubled eurozone countries , including greece , ireland and portugal , by bringing down their borrowing costs .
but this means germany could risk seeing its credit rating deteriorating , and would face higher interest rates .
merkel wants a permanent mechanism merkel is facing tough questions at home as to whether germany , europe ’ s largest economy , should help european partners like ireland out of financial crisis at the risk of damaging germany ’ s solid financial reputation .
merkel is calling for a permanent mechanism to replace the provisional european stability fund , a pot of money member states can draw on if they get into severe financial difficulties .
the provisional fund runs out in the summer of 2013 .
at an eu summit in december , merkel is hoping to lay the foundation for a permanent system for dealing with such situations .
germany is stressing that private investors should also shoulder responsibility for financial insecurity .
finance ministers converge on brussels eu finance ministers are expected to meet in brussels on sunday to finalize an aid plan for ireland before markets open on monday morning .
ministers will be asked to approve the bailout package , worth around 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 113 billion -rrb- in loans .
germany and france are urging a rapid conclusion to negotiations to put an end to uncertainty .
the eu and international monetary fund rescue plan is intended to stop the irish debt crisis spreading to other countries in the eurozone .
german economy minister rainer bruederle gave his assurance that ireland and greece were the only eurozone countries that needed to draw on emergency financial aid .
he rejected the idea that other countries , specifically spain and portugal , were at risk , saying , " spain and portugal are doing everything in their power to keep their national finances in order . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ministers hope the euro will stabilize after the ireland bailout is there enough money in the current fund ?
some in europe have questioned whether the current mechanism for rescuing debt-ravaged countries in the eurozone is adequate .
according to german news magazine der spiegel , marco buti , director general for economic and financial affairs at the european commission wants the existing 750-billion-euro stability fund to be increased , perhaps by double its current level .
however , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble rejected the idea , saying that the current 750 billion euro fund was adequate .
but some economists are suggesting that there should be no limit on rescue deals for eurozone countries in financial trouble .
michael burda of berlin 's humboldt university told the tagesspiegel newspaper that it was dangerous to name concrete figures .
" the eu should give an unlimited guarantee for the debts of member states … only then will the markets calm down , " the economist said .

the film 's slovakian director , juraj herz , is himself a survivor of the holocaust .
he 's attempted to make a balanced film that is fair to both sides , casting a critical , yet sympathetic eye .
the sudetenland refers the western border regions of then-czechoslovakia that were inhabited mostly by ethnic germans .
a history that spares no one the film opens with a dramatic scene from 1945 : the violent expulsion of the germans by a mob of murderous czechs .
less than a decade before , the title character august habermann , a successful german owner of a lumber mill , married the czech jana .
she 's half-jewish but does n't know it .
habermann sees himself as an apolitical sudeten german .
but just one year later , on september 30 , 1938 the day he and his wife are celebrating their daughter 's baptism , the nazis enter the sudetenland , changing everything .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were many children among the expellees from eastern europe after the war as the war wages on , the once pragmatic habermann finds himself trapped by both sides of the conflict .
he tries again and again to protect his wife and his czech employees and friends .
but the pressure under ss unit leader kurt koslowski and the other nazis only grows .
when habermann 's best friend , the czech jan brezina , is implicated in the murder of two german soldiers , koslowski vows to take revenge and even tries to get habermann to help him .
in the end some czechs ' basest instincts of revenge and resentment take over in a retaliation that spares no one , not even the innocent habermann .
dealing with history the film has its weakness , but what director herz achieves is the depiction of a rarely told story with dramatic images .
with scenes of the bloodthirsty czech mobs and the germans forced to wear the letter " n " to mark themselves as " nemec , " czech for german , he draws parallels with the persecution of the jews under the nazis .
ben becker , who plays koslowski , the film is n't just about identifying fault .
" it 's not necessarily about feeling guilty , " he says .
" it 's about dealing with a part of history . "

the irish government has been slammed at the polls after announcing its proposed austerity plan . following friday 's crushing by-election defeat , ireland 's beleaguered government is bracing itself for major protests on saturday amid a nationwide demonstration against major cutbacks announced earlier this week .
tens of thousands of protesters are expected to join trade unions in demonstrating against the severe austerity package announced on wednesday .
the government plans to cut the minimum wage and eliminate 25,000 public-sector jobs in an effort to bring its deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2014 .
it 's now at 32 percent .
" this is the result of allowing speculators , bankers and developers to run riot , pillaging and ruining our economy , " said jack o 'connor , the head of ireland 's biggest union siptu , calling the proposed budget the " harshest … since the foundation of the state . "
" our national sovereignty is at stake as a result of the government 's policies , " he said .
" the timeframe for the adjustment is too short .
it should be extended to 2017 .
we must not stand idly by while the final nail is driven into the coffin . "
by-election defeat on friday , angry voters made their feelings plain at the polls .
the socialist sinn fein party won the northwestern constituency of donegal , previously a fianna fail stronghold , as prime minister brian cowen 's fianna fail -lrb- ff -rrb- party suffered a resounding defeat , cutting the ff / green coalition 's parliamentary majority to just two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition is pressuring cowen to call an immediate general election opposition parties pressured cowen to call an immediate general election .
labour party leader eamon gilmore said fianna fail " has neither the political mandate nor the moral authority to make the crucial decisions the country now faces . "
" we did n't buy into the austerity .
we 're not for the savage cuts , " said sinn fein leader gerry adams .
he said the goal was to take power in dublin and end austerity measures imposed by the international monetary fund .
cowen has refused to go to the polls until the budget and strict new austerity measures are passed as early as the beginning of december .
that process , however , is unlikely to happen before january .
the passing of the austerity plan and 2011 budget is a crucial condition of a planned 85 billion euro -lrb- $ 113 billion -rrb- bailout from the european union and the imf .
talks on the international aid package , intended to prevent trouble spreading in the eurozone , are expected to wrap up on sunday .

labour party leader eamon gilmore said fianna fail " has neither the political mandate nor the moral authority to make the crucial decisions the country now faces . "
" we did n't buy into the austerity .
we 're not for the savage cuts , " said sinn fein leader gerry adams .
he said the goal was to take power in dublin and end austerity measures imposed by the international monetary fund .
cowen has refused to go to the polls until the budget and strict new austerity measures are passed as early as the beginning of december .
that process , however , is unlikely to happen before january .
the passing of the austerity plan and 2011 budget is a crucial condition of a planned 85 billion euro -lrb- $ 113 billion -rrb- bailout from the european union and the imf .
talks on the international aid package , intended to prevent trouble spreading in the eurozone , are expected to wrap up on sunday .

in saturday 's bundesliga action , bayer leverkusen conceded a goal in stoppage time , drawing 2-2 at hoffenheim .
bayern munich trounced frankfurt with a 4-1 win , but dortmund remain the team to beat . third-placed bayer leverkusen dropped agonizing points in stoppage time , after conceding a late penalty to draw 2-2 in hoffenheim .
meanwhile , two goals from anatoliy tymoschchuck helped bayern munich to a comfortable 4-1 win over eintracht frankfurt in saturday ’ s bundesliga action .
elsewhere schalke failed to live up to their recent form in a crushing 5-0 defeat by kaiserslautern .
by contrast , fourth-placed hanover kept up their momentum with a 3-0 win over freiburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund still dominate the table after their 4-1 win on friday night , mainz had pulled to within four points of dortmund with a convincing 3-0 victory at home over nuremberg to consolidate second place .
but dortmund did not waver on saturday , and restored their seven-point lead at the top of the table in the day 's late kick-off , winning 4-1 against moenchengladbach .
out of touch leverkusen move to 26 points but are now four points behind mainz and eleven adrift of runaway leaders borussia dortmund - the fact that they had a two-goal lead against hoffenheim will not help their mood on saturday night .
sidney sam put leverkusen ahead in the eigth minute , and arturo vidal added another with a penalty two minutes later , but hoffenheim made it 2-1 with a vedad ibisevic header in the 39th minute .
the win looked secure for leverkusen until a penalty awarded for a foul by gonzalo castro on marvin commper in stoppage time .
iceland midfielder gylfi thor sigurdsson converted the kick for hoffenheim .
" when you are leading by two goals you want to win the game , but you have to say objectively that hoffenheim deserved the point , " said leverkusen coach jupp heynckes .
champions still in the running bayern secured a comfortable win over frankfurt to keep their title defense alive .
tymoshchuck opened the scoring for bayern on the half hour , only for league top scorer theofanis gekas to level with a header four minutes later for his twelfth goal in 14 games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's mario gomez ca n't stop scoring thomas mueller scored in the 59th minute after oka nikolov in goal failed to hold a bastian schweinsteiger shot , and mario gomez got bayern ’ s third goal in similar fashion two minutes later .
tymoschchuck completed the scoring with his second two minutes from time .
for gomez , little more than a reserve last season , it was the 15th goal in the last 11 games .
" gomez is very important for us because he is scoring the goals , and that is important for a team , " said coach louis van gaal .
" you can not imagine the team without him now . "
schalke may be in the champions league , but … schalke 's 3-0 midweek win over lyon in the champions league counted for nothing at kaiserslautern where felix magath 's side slumped to a 5-0 defeat .
two corners proved the undoing of schalke in the first half , with srdjan lakic heading kaiserslautern ahead in the eighth minute and martin amedick adding the second in the 39th .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was n't a good night for felix magath lakis scored his second nine minutes after the break before a penalty from ivo ilicevic in the 76th and a header from jan moravek two minutes from time completed the misery for magath 's side .
it was schalke 's heaviest bundesliga defeat since 1992 , when they lost 6-1 against bayer leverkusen .
" we did n't have the attitude , " said magath .
" i am even glad the defeat was so high because it shows clearly what has to be done . "
the day 's other games fourth-placed hanover earned a 3-0 victory over visiting freiburg .
jan schlaudraff struck in the 15th minute and set up didier ya konan for the second in the 73rd before a third in the 89th from mike hanke .
hamburg left stuttgart in trouble near the bottom with a 4-2 victory helped by the early dismissal of stuttgart striker ciprian marica .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 27.11.2010 german police officers face increasing violence on patrol großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around bonn 's main station attracts all kinds recent studies show violence against police officers in germany is on the rise , and their workload has also increased .
our reporter went out with a couple of bonn police officers as they made their rounds . the illuminated sign next to the huge glass door reads " gabi " - a german acronym for a police drop-in center in bonn 's inner city .
with its many corners and stairways , this dismal area in the lower level of the main train station tends to attract a lot of drug addicts . this is where senior police officer wulf klinge and his colleagues are based , along with officers from bonn 's public affairs office .
the officers have been working here since 1992 , but klinge says their work routine has changed over the years .
" people have always been resistant to our work as the police , we 've experienced that over and over , " he told deutsche welle .
" but this open animosity to police forces , especially as a show of strength , this has increased . "
at times , klinge says , it almost seems to be some sort of game for certain groups .
drug addicts are often aggressive towards the police , especially when under the influence .
but klinge finds it more alarming that even kids are now putting up a resistance .
recently , even a nine-year-old with a record fought the police tooth and nail . a well-known scene bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stationed at gabi see a lot of action part of the daily routine at gabi is the foot patrol , a beat usually manned by a team of two officers .
burkhard jung is familiar with the busy scene at the station .
stationed here for 18 years , he knows those who linger in the area very well .
" those two right in front of us , they are part of the clientele , " he said , referring to the members of the drug scene and the homeless who use the area around the station as their meeting place .
jung , as one of the oldest officers at the station , has noticed changes in the daily police routine .
" it 's quite alarming when an opponent uses force against you , even if it 's just because of relatively minor things , " he said .
since the employees at gabi often have to deal with addicts , they help them find treatment facilities in order to curb their drug addiction .
on patrol , jung stops by an association that helps people at risk - drug addicts and also those with social problems .
he says it 's important to keep in touch with the scene , and the officers can address most of the heroin addicts by name .
this often helps to defuse difficult situations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police uniforms no longer guarantee respect ready to strike back jung continues his patrol , moving towards the christmas market in bonn 's inner city .
even right in bonn 's center , dark corners like a backyard can serve as a meeting place for drug addicts .
if words fail and jung is attacked , he has pepper spray at the ready on his belt .
he also wears a bulletproof vest , a walkie-talkie , handcuffs and his service weapon - altogether 10 kilograms -lrb- about 22 pounds -rrb- that he has to carry for up to two hours while on patrol .
these days , the uniform does n't command the respect it once did , according to station chief klinge .
older colleagues have complained that they 're not taken seriously .
" that 's a source for potential frustration within the police force , " he added .
in order to change the situation , klinge says penalties for violence against police officers must be stricter .
but according to him , it 's not enough for just police officers to agitate against the rise of violence .
" it 's a task for society as a whole .
we are simply the lightning rod of this development .
i think the overall development is a broad one , and also a difficult one . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 27.11.2010 polish workers leave ireland as economy wilts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shops catering to poles may find it hard to keep going ireland saw huge immigration levels when the ' celtic tiger ' boom was in full swing .
but as the boom has turned to bust , many of the immigrants who have lost their jobs are choosing to return home . it is difficult to say exactly how many immigrants arrived in ireland as its economy boomed in the middle of this decade , but according to james wickham , a professor of sociology at trinity college in dublin , immigration figures were pretty high .
" the highest figure that i 've heard is 200,000 , which for a country of 4.5 million is , of course , pretty big , " he said .
the numbers spiked as eastern european nations joined the european union in 2004 .
" immigration was absolutely massive shortly before and above all immediately after accession , " wickham said . " essentially what happened was that people from eastern europe - above all poland , but also lithuania and latvia to a lesser extent provided the labor for the famous ' celtic tiger ' boom . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulk of polish immigration occurred around 2004 supermarkets , delis , travel agencies and businesses aimed at polish and eastern europeans have sprung up all over ireland to cater for the immigrants who came seeking their fortune .
at polski sklep , a polish supermarket in central dublin , every customer knows of people who have lost their jobs because of the recession .
malgorzata stankiewicz moved to ireland in early 2007 when the economy was still growing and found a job easily .
in retrospect , she says she might have misjudged the strength of the irish economy .
" i think it was n't as good as i heard about , " she said .
" but it was still good , i had a job , and i did n't have a problem finding it . "
she then lost that job , and has now been unemployed for a year , although she is constantly looking for new work , sending out her résumé every day and honing her skills as much as she can .
she has several friends who were also laid off , and most of them went back to poland to be with their families .
reasons to stay people like malgorzata are not left to fend for themselves though .
as wickham explained , the welfare state in the irish republic has to provide for them if they stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many poles say the working environment is better in ireland " they are european citizens , they have every right to be here .
they have exactly the same rights to social welfare benefits as irish citizens do , " he said .
" at the moment our benefits are very high - they 're very high compared to the uk , for example . "
beyond welfare provision , which is likely to fall during the government 's austerity drive , there are other reasons for immigrants to stay . wickham said his research shows poles and other eastern european arrivals appreciate the way they are treated in the workplace if they can find a job .
" people found that compared to working in poland , irish workplaces were more informal , gave people more initiative .
irish workplaces are seen as more american - people do n't stand on their roles and people reward initiative . "
changing trends agnes kuzinska , who came to ireland in 2006 , admits she was drawn to ireland by the good press it was getting back home .
" i came here because my friends were here and i had a good time , and people were more sympathetic , friendlier , " she said . but she points to a new trend among polish migrants to ireland : the temporary .
in the past it was thought that most polish families who moved to the irish republic would stay .
now , according to agnes , people are willing to move more than once .
" so many people go back to poland .
stay here for a few years , then go back to poland . "

but as the boom has turned to bust , many of the immigrants who have lost their jobs are choosing to return home . it is difficult to say exactly how many immigrants arrived in ireland as its economy boomed in the middle of this decade , but according to james wickham , a professor of sociology at trinity college in dublin , immigration figures were pretty high .
" the highest figure that i 've heard is 200,000 , which for a country of 4.5 million is , of course , pretty big , " he said .
the numbers spiked as eastern european nations joined the european union in 2004 .

and germany ’ s finance ministry said that chancellor angela merkel had already ruled out the idea of issuing bonds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle and merkel rejected the idea of eurozone bonds but german news weekly focus cited sources claiming that germany might drop its objections to such bonds , if strict conditions for tougher sanctions on countries running up excessive deficits were imposed .
the solution would help troubled eurozone countries , including greece , ireland and portugal , by bringing down their borrowing costs .
but this means germany could risk seeing its credit rating deteriorating , and would face higher interest rates .
merkel wants a permanent mechanism merkel is facing tough questions at home as to whether germany , europe ’ s largest economy , should help european partners like ireland out of financial crisis at the risk of damaging germany ’ s solid financial reputation .
merkel is calling for a permanent mechanism to replace the provisional european stability fund , a pot of money member states can draw on if they get into severe financial difficulties .
the provisional fund runs out in the summer of 2013 .
at an eu summit in december , merkel is hoping to lay the foundation for a permanent system for dealing with such situations .
germany is stressing that private investors should also shoulder responsibility for financial insecurity .
finance ministers converge on brussels eu finance ministers are expected to meet in brussels on sunday to finalize an aid plan for ireland before markets open on monday morning .
ministers will be asked to approve the bailout package , worth around 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 113 billion -rrb- in loans .
germany and france are urging a rapid conclusion to negotiations to put an end to uncertainty .
the eu and international monetary fund rescue plan is intended to stop the irish debt crisis spreading to other countries in the eurozone .
german economy minister rainer bruederle gave his assurance that ireland and greece were the only eurozone countries that needed to draw on emergency financial aid .
he rejected the idea that other countries , specifically spain and portugal , were at risk , saying , " spain and portugal are doing everything in their power to keep their national finances in order . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ministers hope the euro will stabilize after the ireland bailout is there enough money in the current fund ?
some in europe have questioned whether the current mechanism for rescuing debt-ravaged countries in the eurozone is adequate .
according to german news magazine der spiegel , marco buti , director general for economic and financial affairs at the european commission wants the existing 750-billion-euro stability fund to be increased , perhaps by double its current level .
however , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble rejected the idea , saying that the current 750 billion euro fund was adequate .
but some economists are suggesting that there should be no limit on rescue deals for eurozone countries in financial trouble .
michael burda of berlin 's humboldt university told the tagesspiegel newspaper that it was dangerous to name concrete figures .
" the eu should give an unlimited guarantee for the debts of member states … only then will the markets calm down , " the economist said .

but as the boom has turned to bust , many of the immigrants who have lost their jobs are choosing to return home . it is difficult to say exactly how many immigrants arrived in ireland as its economy boomed in the middle of this decade , but according to james wickham , a professor of sociology at trinity college in dublin , immigration figures were pretty high .
" the highest figure that i 've heard is 200,000 , which for a country of 4.5 million is , of course , pretty big , " he said .
the numbers spiked as eastern european nations joined the european union in 2004 .
" immigration was absolutely massive shortly before and above all immediately after accession , " wickham said . " essentially what happened was that people from eastern europe - above all poland , but also lithuania and latvia to a lesser extent provided the labor for the famous ' celtic tiger ' boom . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulk of polish immigration occurred around 2004 supermarkets , delis , travel agencies and businesses aimed at polish and eastern europeans have sprung up all over ireland to cater for the immigrants who came seeking their fortune .
at polski sklep , a polish supermarket in central dublin , every customer knows of people who have lost their jobs because of the recession .
malgorzata stankiewicz moved to ireland in early 2007 when the economy was still growing and found a job easily .
in retrospect , she says she might have misjudged the strength of the irish economy .
" i think it was n't as good as i heard about , " she said .
" but it was still good , i had a job , and i did n't have a problem finding it . "
she then lost that job , and has now been unemployed for a year , although she is constantly looking for new work , sending out her résumé every day and honing her skills as much as she can .
she has several friends who were also laid off , and most of them went back to poland to be with their families .
reasons to stay people like malgorzata are not left to fend for themselves though .
as wickham explained , the welfare state in the irish republic has to provide for them if they stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many poles say the working environment is better in ireland " they are european citizens , they have every right to be here .

" at the moment our benefits are very high - they 're very high compared to the uk , for example . "
beyond welfare provision , which is likely to fall during the government 's austerity drive , there are other reasons for immigrants to stay . wickham said his research shows poles and other eastern european arrivals appreciate the way they are treated in the workplace if they can find a job .
" people found that compared to working in poland , irish workplaces were more informal , gave people more initiative .
irish workplaces are seen as more american - people do n't stand on their roles and people reward initiative . "

the irish government has been slammed at the polls after announcing its proposed austerity plan . following friday 's crushing by-election defeat , ireland 's beleaguered government is bracing itself for major protests on saturday amid a nationwide demonstration against major cutbacks announced earlier this week .
tens of thousands of protesters are expected to join trade unions in demonstrating against the severe austerity package announced on wednesday .
the government plans to cut the minimum wage and eliminate 25,000 public-sector jobs in an effort to bring its deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2014 .
it 's now at 32 percent .
" this is the result of allowing speculators , bankers and developers to run riot , pillaging and ruining our economy , " said jack o 'connor , the head of ireland 's biggest union siptu , calling the proposed budget the " harshest … since the foundation of the state . "
" our national sovereignty is at stake as a result of the government 's policies , " he said .
" the timeframe for the adjustment is too short .
it should be extended to 2017 .
we must not stand idly by while the final nail is driven into the coffin . "
by-election defeat on friday , angry voters made their feelings plain at the polls .
the socialist sinn fein party won the northwestern constituency of donegal , previously a fianna fail stronghold , as prime minister brian cowen 's fianna fail -lrb- ff -rrb- party suffered a resounding defeat , cutting the ff / green coalition 's parliamentary majority to just two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition is pressuring cowen to call an immediate general election opposition parties pressured cowen to call an immediate general election .
labour party leader eamon gilmore said fianna fail " has neither the political mandate nor the moral authority to make the crucial decisions the country now faces . "
" we did n't buy into the austerity .
we 're not for the savage cuts , " said sinn fein leader gerry adams .
he said the goal was to take power in dublin and end austerity measures imposed by the international monetary fund .
cowen has refused to go to the polls until the budget and strict new austerity measures are passed as early as the beginning of december .
that process , however , is unlikely to happen before january .
the passing of the austerity plan and 2011 budget is a crucial condition of a planned 85 billion euro -lrb- $ 113 billion -rrb- bailout from the european union and the imf .
talks on the international aid package , intended to prevent trouble spreading in the eurozone , are expected to wrap up on sunday .

but as the boom has turned to bust , many of the immigrants who have lost their jobs are choosing to return home . it is difficult to say exactly how many immigrants arrived in ireland as its economy boomed in the middle of this decade , but according to james wickham , a professor of sociology at trinity college in dublin , immigration figures were pretty high .
" the highest figure that i 've heard is 200,000 , which for a country of 4.5 million is , of course , pretty big , " he said .
the numbers spiked as eastern european nations joined the european union in 2004 .
" immigration was absolutely massive shortly before and above all immediately after accession , " wickham said . " essentially what happened was that people from eastern europe - above all poland , but also lithuania and latvia to a lesser extent provided the labor for the famous ' celtic tiger ' boom . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulk of polish immigration occurred around 2004 supermarkets , delis , travel agencies and businesses aimed at polish and eastern europeans have sprung up all over ireland to cater for the immigrants who came seeking their fortune .
at polski sklep , a polish supermarket in central dublin , every customer knows of people who have lost their jobs because of the recession .
malgorzata stankiewicz moved to ireland in early 2007 when the economy was still growing and found a job easily .
in retrospect , she says she might have misjudged the strength of the irish economy .
" i think it was n't as good as i heard about , " she said .
" but it was still good , i had a job , and i did n't have a problem finding it . "
she then lost that job , and has now been unemployed for a year , although she is constantly looking for new work , sending out her résumé every day and honing her skills as much as she can .
she has several friends who were also laid off , and most of them went back to poland to be with their families .
reasons to stay people like malgorzata are not left to fend for themselves though .
as wickham explained , the welfare state in the irish republic has to provide for them if they stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many poles say the working environment is better in ireland " they are european citizens , they have every right to be here .
they have exactly the same rights to social welfare benefits as irish citizens do , " he said .

unions said the marches were peaceful . tens of thousands of protesters marched through the irish capital dublin to protest against severe austerity measures announced this week .
the government plans to slash the minimum wage and get rid of 25,000 public-sector jobs in an effort to bring its deficit below three percent of gross domestic product by 2014 . the state deficit is currently at a crippling 32 percent .
" we are here to object to the arrogance of the government , " president of the irish congress of trade unions jack o 'connor told the crowd .

the ictu said about 150,000 people joined the protests while police put the figure at 50,000 .
marchers converged on the general post office , a highly symbolic site for critics of the bailout .
it was the site of ireland ’ s declaration of independence in 1916 . as a precondition for a bailout with the european union and the international monetary fund , the dublin government is aiming to save 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- over the next four years , mainly through cutbacks and tax increases .

" we did n't buy into the austerity .
we 're not for the savage cuts , " said sinn fein leader gerry adams .
he said the goal was to take power in dublin and end austerity measures imposed by the international monetary fund .
cowen has refused to go to the polls until the budget and strict new austerity measures are passed as early as the beginning of december .
eu finance ministers are expected to meet in brussels on sunday to discuss the bailout loans , boosting speculation of an announcement of a deal before markets reopen on monday morning .

however , disillusionment with politics and voter apathy is on the increase .
and it 's unclear how much the europe union figures in the country 's future . the main street of the moldovan capital , chisinau , is choked with traffic - luxury cars drive alongside old-fashioned trams and overcrowded taxi buses .
people are on their way home or to the shops or the park with their children , while youngsters sit on benches fixated on their laptops .
the capital shows little sign of the upcoming parliamentary elections .
people are preoccupied with the difficulties of their daily lives , such as prices hikes and low pensions .
" i expect nothing , there 's fraud everywhere anyway , " said one elderly woman on the street .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were protests after elections in 2009 were rigged another woman calls for " higher wages and a better pension , a reasonable existence . "
many people say they just want stability and some economic progress .
the mood fluctuates between resignation and hope .
the political outcome of sunday 's election is hard to predict .
both the opposition communists and the government coalition of four liberal-democratic parties look like potential victors .
support for the communists , led by former president vladimir voronin , is still high , probably in part due to the fact the governing coalition did not fulfill all it promised .
voter fatigue and disgruntlement in a year and a half , voters in moldova have been called to the polls three times .
in april 2009 , a rigged election caused serious turmoil , and the communists had to hand over power to an alliance of four former opposition parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elections are not at the forefront of most people 's minds the country still does n't have a president .
in september a referendum over whether to directly elect a president failed to attract a large enough turnout .
" i think part of the population does not yet understand what an important democratic device elections are , " said eu ambassador dirk schuebel .
" each individual has the opportunity to choose their own candidate , their party and take an active part in the democratic process . "
europe is open and ready for further cooperation with moldova .
however , this small country also needs to reform itself from the inside - by fighting corruption , reforming the judiciary and its bloated public administration .
a reliance on handouts ?
literary scholar christina grossu , who teaches german at the university of chisinau , said a drastic change in mentality in the country would do it good .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear opening moldova 's borders will see people leave the country " most people live with the thought that the state owes them something .
so long as it is expected that someone else will solve their problems , nothing will change , " she said .
as a university lecturer , grossu brings home 200 euros -lrb- $ 266 -rrb- a month - too little to support a family .
like many of her colleagues , she supports herself with part-time work , such as giving language lessons or interpreting .
a school teacher 's wage is even lower .
hospital doctors earn around 250 euros a month in moldova .
the low wages have led to a massive " brain-drain " as the best and brightest young professionals leave to seek opportunities elsewhere in europe .
the trade in counterfeit passports has blossomed ; those who can pay two or three thousand euros can buy their ticket to the west .
hundreds of thousands have already fled illegally to the west - and regularly send money back to their families in moldova .
some say the country has developed an unhealthy dependence on those remittances .
europe : dream or nightmare ?
for young people , the chance to live in western europe is a dream .
nearly all of christina grossu 's students have just one goal - a scholarship or the chance of work in germany .
" for them , germany is the personification of wealth and prosperity .
that you need to work hard does n't cross their minds as they only know germany from television and movies .
for them , it 's a dream . "

he expects that to translate into " a better economy , progress in education and training , cultural momentum and better professional development . "
yet others feel that , as well as opportunities , europe also offers uncertainty about moldova 's future .
another young journalist , natalia , fears that opening up moldova 's borders means even more young people will flee the country .
" if they see how it is in europe , they will go where it 's better .
frankly , i 've toyed with the idea myself , " she said .

" there is still much , much more work to be done , " schuebel said .
" the border-control system , security controls , domestic security , document security such as biometric passports , all are important questions that need to be resolved before we can consider loosening visa restrictions . "
despite the hurdles , for many the vision of joining europe is undiminished .

in saturday 's bundesliga action , bayer leverkusen conceded a goal in stoppage time , drawing 2-2 at hoffenheim .
bayern munich trounced frankfurt with a 4-1 win , but dortmund remain the team to beat . third-placed bayer leverkusen dropped agonizing points in stoppage time , after conceding a late penalty to draw 2-2 in hoffenheim .
meanwhile , two goals from anatoliy tymoschchuck helped bayern munich to a comfortable 4-1 win over eintracht frankfurt in saturday ’ s bundesliga action .
elsewhere schalke failed to live up to their recent form in a crushing 5-0 defeat by kaiserslautern .
by contrast , fourth-placed hanover kept up their momentum with a 3-0 win over freiburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund still dominate the table after their 4-1 win on friday night , mainz had pulled to within four points of dortmund with a convincing 3-0 victory at home over nuremberg to consolidate second place .
but dortmund did not waver on saturday , and restored their seven-point lead at the top of the table in the day 's late kick-off , winning 4-1 against moenchengladbach .
out of touch leverkusen move to 26 points but are now four points behind mainz and eleven adrift of runaway leaders borussia dortmund - the fact that they had a two-goal lead against hoffenheim will not help their mood on saturday night .
sidney sam put leverkusen ahead in the eigth minute , and arturo vidal added another with a penalty two minutes later , but hoffenheim made it 2-1 with a vedad ibisevic header in the 39th minute .
the win looked secure for leverkusen until a penalty awarded for a foul by gonzalo castro on marvin commper in stoppage time .
iceland midfielder gylfi thor sigurdsson converted the kick for hoffenheim .
" when you are leading by two goals you want to win the game , but you have to say objectively that hoffenheim deserved the point , " said leverkusen coach jupp heynckes .
champions still in the running bayern secured a comfortable win over frankfurt to keep their title defense alive .
tymoshchuck opened the scoring for bayern on the half hour , only for league top scorer theofanis gekas to level with a header four minutes later for his twelfth goal in 14 games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's mario gomez ca n't stop scoring thomas mueller scored in the 59th minute after oka nikolov in goal failed to hold a bastian schweinsteiger shot , and mario gomez got bayern ’ s third goal in similar fashion two minutes later .
tymoschchuck completed the scoring with his second two minutes from time .
for gomez , little more than a reserve last season , it was the 15th goal in the last 11 games .
" gomez is very important for us because he is scoring the goals , and that is important for a team , " said coach louis van gaal .
" you can not imagine the team without him now . "
schalke may be in the champions league , but … schalke 's 3-0 midweek win over lyon in the champions league counted for nothing at kaiserslautern where felix magath 's side slumped to a 5-0 defeat .
two corners proved the undoing of schalke in the first half , with srdjan lakic heading kaiserslautern ahead in the eighth minute and martin amedick adding the second in the 39th .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was n't a good night for felix magath lakis scored his second nine minutes after the break before a penalty from ivo ilicevic in the 76th and a header from jan moravek two minutes from time completed the misery for magath 's side .
it was schalke 's heaviest bundesliga defeat since 1992 , when they lost 6-1 against bayer leverkusen .
" we did n't have the attitude , " said magath .
" i am even glad the defeat was so high because it shows clearly what has to be done . "
the day 's other games fourth-placed hanover earned a 3-0 victory over visiting freiburg .
jan schlaudraff struck in the 15th minute and set up didier ya konan for the second in the 73rd before a third in the 89th from mike hanke .
hamburg left stuttgart in trouble near the bottom with a 4-2 victory helped by the early dismissal of stuttgart striker ciprian marica .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund still dominate the table after their 4-1 win on friday night , mainz had pulled to within four points of dortmund with a convincing 3-0 victory at home over nuremberg to consolidate second place .
but dortmund did not waver on saturday , and restored their seven-point lead at the top of the table in the day 's late kick-off , winning 4-1 against moenchengladbach .
out of touch leverkusen move to 26 points but are now four points behind mainz and eleven adrift of runaway leaders borussia dortmund - the fact that they had a two-goal lead against hoffenheim will not help their mood on saturday night .
sidney sam put leverkusen ahead in the eigth minute , and arturo vidal added another with a penalty two minutes later , but hoffenheim made it 2-1 with a vedad ibisevic header in the 39th minute .
the win looked secure for leverkusen until a penalty awarded for a foul by gonzalo castro on marvin commper in stoppage time .
iceland midfielder gylfi thor sigurdsson converted the kick for hoffenheim .
" when you are leading by two goals you want to win the game , but you have to say objectively that hoffenheim deserved the point , " said leverkusen coach jupp heynckes .
champions still in the running bayern secured a comfortable win over frankfurt to keep their title defense alive .
tymoshchuck opened the scoring for bayern on the half hour , only for league top scorer theofanis gekas to level with a header four minutes later for his twelfth goal in 14 games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's mario gomez ca n't stop scoring thomas mueller scored in the 59th minute after oka nikolov in goal failed to hold a bastian schweinsteiger shot , and mario gomez got bayern ’ s third goal in similar fashion two minutes later .
tymoschchuck completed the scoring with his second two minutes from time .
for gomez , little more than a reserve last season , it was the 15th goal in the last 11 games .
" gomez is very important for us because he is scoring the goals , and that is important for a team , " said coach louis van gaal .
" you can not imagine the team without him now . "
schalke may be in the champions league , but … schalke 's 3-0 midweek win over lyon in the champions league counted for nothing at kaiserslautern where felix magath 's side slumped to a 5-0 defeat .
two corners proved the undoing of schalke in the first half , with srdjan lakic heading kaiserslautern ahead in the eighth minute and martin amedick adding the second in the 39th .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was n't a good night for felix magath lakis scored his second nine minutes after the break before a penalty from ivo ilicevic in the 76th and a header from jan moravek two minutes from time completed the misery for magath 's side .
it was schalke 's heaviest bundesliga defeat since 1992 , when they lost 6-1 against bayer leverkusen .
" we did n't have the attitude , " said magath .
" i am even glad the defeat was so high because it shows clearly what has to be done . "
the day 's other games fourth-placed hanover earned a 3-0 victory over visiting freiburg .
jan schlaudraff struck in the 15th minute and set up didier ya konan for the second in the 73rd before a third in the 89th from mike hanke .
hamburg left stuttgart in trouble near the bottom with a 4-2 victory helped by the early dismissal of stuttgart striker ciprian marica .

some in europe have questioned whether the current mechanism for rescuing debt-ravaged countries in the eurozone is adequate .
according to german news magazine der spiegel , marco buti , director general for economic and financial affairs at the european commission wants the existing 750-billion-euro stability fund to be increased , perhaps by double its current level .
however , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble rejected the idea , saying that the current 750 billion euro fund was adequate .
but some economists are suggesting that there should be no limit on rescue deals for eurozone countries in financial trouble .
michael burda of berlin 's humboldt university told the tagesspiegel newspaper that it was dangerous to name concrete figures .
" the eu should give an unlimited guarantee for the debts of member states … only then will the markets calm down , " the economist said .

that history remains a touchy topic . the expulsion and murder of the so-called " sudeten " germans by war-weary czechs after world war ii traumatized the german-czech relationship .
decades later the two countries are both part of the european union and share an open border .
yet the fate of the three million sudeten german expellees has remained a sensitive topic .
" habermann , " a czech-german-austrian film playing in european theaters this fall portrays the suffering of the germans in czechoslovakia after world war ii for the first time .
the film 's slovakian director , juraj herz , is himself a survivor of the holocaust .
he 's attempted to make a balanced film that is fair to both sides , casting a critical , yet sympathetic eye .
the sudetenland refers the western border regions of then-czechoslovakia that were inhabited mostly by ethnic germans .
a history that spares no one the film opens with a dramatic scene from 1945 : the violent expulsion of the germans by a mob of murderous czechs .
less than a decade before , the title character august habermann , a successful german owner of a lumber mill , married the czech jana .
she 's half-jewish but does n't know it .
habermann sees himself as an apolitical sudeten german .
but just one year later , on september 30 , 1938 the day he and his wife are celebrating their daughter 's baptism , the nazis enter the sudetenland , changing everything .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were many children among the expellees from eastern europe after the war as the war wages on , the once pragmatic habermann finds himself trapped by both sides of the conflict .
he tries again and again to protect his wife and his czech employees and friends .
but the pressure under ss unit leader kurt koslowski and the other nazis only grows .
when habermann 's best friend , the czech jan brezina , is implicated in the murder of two german soldiers , koslowski vows to take revenge and even tries to get habermann to help him .
in the end some czechs ' basest instincts of revenge and resentment take over in a retaliation that spares no one , not even the innocent habermann .
dealing with history the film has its weakness , but what director herz achieves is the depiction of a rarely told story with dramatic images .
with scenes of the bloodthirsty czech mobs and the germans forced to wear the letter " n " to mark themselves as " nemec , " czech for german , he draws parallels with the persecution of the jews under the nazis .
ben becker , who plays koslowski , the film is n't just about identifying fault .
" it 's not necessarily about feeling guilty , " he says .
" it 's about dealing with a part of history . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 27.11.2010 polish workers leave ireland as economy wilts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shops catering to poles may find it hard to keep going ireland saw huge immigration levels when the ' celtic tiger ' boom was in full swing .
but as the boom has turned to bust , many of the immigrants who have lost their jobs are choosing to return home . it is difficult to say exactly how many immigrants arrived in ireland as its economy boomed in the middle of this decade , but according to james wickham , a professor of sociology at trinity college in dublin , immigration figures were pretty high .
" the highest figure that i 've heard is 200,000 , which for a country of 4.5 million is , of course , pretty big , " he said .
the numbers spiked as eastern european nations joined the european union in 2004 .
" immigration was absolutely massive shortly before and above all immediately after accession , " wickham said . " essentially what happened was that people from eastern europe - above all poland , but also lithuania and latvia to a lesser extent provided the labor for the famous ' celtic tiger ' boom . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulk of polish immigration occurred around 2004 supermarkets , delis , travel agencies and businesses aimed at polish and eastern europeans have sprung up all over ireland to cater for the immigrants who came seeking their fortune .
at polski sklep , a polish supermarket in central dublin , every customer knows of people who have lost their jobs because of the recession .
malgorzata stankiewicz moved to ireland in early 2007 when the economy was still growing and found a job easily .
in retrospect , she says she might have misjudged the strength of the irish economy .
" i think it was n't as good as i heard about , " she said .
" but it was still good , i had a job , and i did n't have a problem finding it . "
she then lost that job , and has now been unemployed for a year , although she is constantly looking for new work , sending out her résumé every day and honing her skills as much as she can .
she has several friends who were also laid off , and most of them went back to poland to be with their families .
reasons to stay people like malgorzata are not left to fend for themselves though .
as wickham explained , the welfare state in the irish republic has to provide for them if they stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many poles say the working environment is better in ireland " they are european citizens , they have every right to be here .
they have exactly the same rights to social welfare benefits as irish citizens do , " he said .
" at the moment our benefits are very high - they 're very high compared to the uk , for example . "
beyond welfare provision , which is likely to fall during the government 's austerity drive , there are other reasons for immigrants to stay . wickham said his research shows poles and other eastern european arrivals appreciate the way they are treated in the workplace if they can find a job .
" people found that compared to working in poland , irish workplaces were more informal , gave people more initiative .
irish workplaces are seen as more american - people do n't stand on their roles and people reward initiative . "
changing trends agnes kuzinska , who came to ireland in 2006 , admits she was drawn to ireland by the good press it was getting back home .
" i came here because my friends were here and i had a good time , and people were more sympathetic , friendlier , " she said . but she points to a new trend among polish migrants to ireland : the temporary .
in the past it was thought that most polish families who moved to the irish republic would stay .
now , according to agnes , people are willing to move more than once .
" so many people go back to poland .
stay here for a few years , then go back to poland . "

according to german news magazine der spiegel , marco buti , director general for economic and financial affairs at the european commission wants the existing 750-billion-euro stability fund to be increased , perhaps by double its current level .
however , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble rejected the idea , saying that the current 750 billion euro fund was adequate .
but some economists are suggesting that there should be no limit on rescue deals for eurozone countries in financial trouble .
michael burda of berlin 's humboldt university told the tagesspiegel newspaper that it was dangerous to name concrete figures .
" the eu should give an unlimited guarantee for the debts of member states … only then will the markets calm down , " the economist said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 27.11.2010 new film broaches taboo topic of post-war expulsions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film shows depicts dramatic moments in world war ii history the movie " habermann " tells the tragic tale of the germans and czechs living in the sudetenland from the day the nazis marched in until the germans were expelled after world war ii .
that history remains a touchy topic . the expulsion and murder of the so-called " sudeten " germans by war-weary czechs after world war ii traumatized the german-czech relationship .
decades later the two countries are both part of the european union and share an open border .
yet the fate of the three million sudeten german expellees has remained a sensitive topic .
" habermann , " a czech-german-austrian film playing in european theaters this fall portrays the suffering of the germans in czechoslovakia after world war ii for the first time .
the film 's slovakian director , juraj herz , is himself a survivor of the holocaust .
he 's attempted to make a balanced film that is fair to both sides , casting a critical , yet sympathetic eye .
the sudetenland refers the western border regions of then-czechoslovakia that were inhabited mostly by ethnic germans .
a history that spares no one the film opens with a dramatic scene from 1945 : the violent expulsion of the germans by a mob of murderous czechs .
less than a decade before , the title character august habermann , a successful german owner of a lumber mill , married the czech jana .
she 's half-jewish but does n't know it .
habermann sees himself as an apolitical sudeten german .
but just one year later , on september 30 , 1938 the day he and his wife are celebrating their daughter 's baptism , the nazis enter the sudetenland , changing everything .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were many children among the expellees from eastern europe after the war as the war wages on , the once pragmatic habermann finds himself trapped by both sides of the conflict .
he tries again and again to protect his wife and his czech employees and friends .
but the pressure under ss unit leader kurt koslowski and the other nazis only grows .
when habermann 's best friend , the czech jan brezina , is implicated in the murder of two german soldiers , koslowski vows to take revenge and even tries to get habermann to help him .
in the end some czechs ' basest instincts of revenge and resentment take over in a retaliation that spares no one , not even the innocent habermann .
dealing with history the film has its weakness , but what director herz achieves is the depiction of a rarely told story with dramatic images .
with scenes of the bloodthirsty czech mobs and the germans forced to wear the letter " n " to mark themselves as " nemec , " czech for german , he draws parallels with the persecution of the jews under the nazis .
ben becker , who plays koslowski , the film is n't just about identifying fault .
" it 's not necessarily about feeling guilty , " he says .
" it 's about dealing with a part of history . "

and germany ’ s finance ministry said that chancellor angela merkel had already ruled out the idea of issuing bonds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle and merkel rejected the idea of eurozone bonds but german news weekly focus cited sources claiming that germany might drop its objections to such bonds , if strict conditions for tougher sanctions on countries running up excessive deficits were imposed .
the solution would help troubled eurozone countries , including greece , ireland and portugal , by bringing down their borrowing costs .
but this means germany could risk seeing its credit rating deteriorating , and would face higher interest rates .
merkel wants a permanent mechanism merkel is facing tough questions at home as to whether germany , europe ’ s largest economy , should help european partners like ireland out of financial crisis at the risk of damaging germany ’ s solid financial reputation .
merkel is calling for a permanent mechanism to replace the provisional european stability fund , a pot of money member states can draw on if they get into severe financial difficulties .
the provisional fund runs out in the summer of 2013 .
at an eu summit in december , merkel is hoping to lay the foundation for a permanent system for dealing with such situations .
germany is stressing that private investors should also shoulder responsibility for financial insecurity .
finance ministers converge on brussels eu finance ministers are expected to meet in brussels on sunday to finalize an aid plan for ireland before markets open on monday morning .
ministers will be asked to approve the bailout package , worth around 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 113 billion -rrb- in loans .
germany and france are urging a rapid conclusion to negotiations to put an end to uncertainty .
the eu and international monetary fund rescue plan is intended to stop the irish debt crisis spreading to other countries in the eurozone .
german economy minister rainer bruederle gave his assurance that ireland and greece were the only eurozone countries that needed to draw on emergency financial aid .
he rejected the idea that other countries , specifically spain and portugal , were at risk , saying , " spain and portugal are doing everything in their power to keep their national finances in order . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ministers hope the euro will stabilize after the ireland bailout is there enough money in the current fund ?
some in europe have questioned whether the current mechanism for rescuing debt-ravaged countries in the eurozone is adequate .
according to german news magazine der spiegel , marco buti , director general for economic and financial affairs at the european commission wants the existing 750-billion-euro stability fund to be increased , perhaps by double its current level .
however , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble rejected the idea , saying that the current 750 billion euro fund was adequate .
but some economists are suggesting that there should be no limit on rescue deals for eurozone countries in financial trouble .
michael burda of berlin 's humboldt university told the tagesspiegel newspaper that it was dangerous to name concrete figures .
" the eu should give an unlimited guarantee for the debts of member states … only then will the markets calm down , " the economist said .

unions said the marches were peaceful . tens of thousands of protesters marched through the irish capital dublin to protest against severe austerity measures announced this week .
the government plans to slash the minimum wage and get rid of 25,000 public-sector jobs in an effort to bring its deficit below three percent of gross domestic product by 2014 . the state deficit is currently at a crippling 32 percent .
" we are here to object to the arrogance of the government , " president of the irish congress of trade unions jack o 'connor told the crowd .

the ictu said about 150,000 people joined the protests while police put the figure at 50,000 .
marchers converged on the general post office , a highly symbolic site for critics of the bailout .
it was the site of ireland ’ s declaration of independence in 1916 . as a precondition for a bailout with the european union and the international monetary fund , the dublin government is aiming to save 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- over the next four years , mainly through cutbacks and tax increases .
the bailout deal could be worth up to 90 billion euros in loans .

" we did n't buy into the austerity .
we 're not for the savage cuts , " said sinn fein leader gerry adams .
he said the goal was to take power in dublin and end austerity measures imposed by the international monetary fund .
cowen has refused to go to the polls until the budget and strict new austerity measures are passed as early as the beginning of december .
eu finance ministers are expected to meet in brussels on sunday to discuss the bailout loans , boosting speculation of an announcement of a deal before markets reopen on monday morning .

" this is the result of allowing speculators , bankers and developers to run riot , pillaging and ruining our economy , " said jack o 'connor , the head of ireland 's biggest union siptu , calling the proposed budget the " harshest … since the foundation of the state . "
" our national sovereignty is at stake as a result of the government 's policies , " he said .
" the timeframe for the adjustment is too short .
it should be extended to 2017 .
we must not stand idly by while the final nail is driven into the coffin . "
by-election defeat on friday , angry voters made their feelings plain at the polls .
the socialist sinn fein party won the northwestern constituency of donegal , previously a fianna fail stronghold , as prime minister brian cowen 's fianna fail -lrb- ff -rrb- party suffered a resounding defeat , cutting the ff / green coalition 's parliamentary majority to just two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition is pressuring cowen to call an immediate general election opposition parties pressured cowen to call an immediate general election .
labour party leader eamon gilmore said fianna fail " has neither the political mandate nor the moral authority to make the crucial decisions the country now faces . "
" we did n't buy into the austerity .
we 're not for the savage cuts , " said sinn fein leader gerry adams .
he said the goal was to take power in dublin and end austerity measures imposed by the international monetary fund .
cowen has refused to go to the polls until the budget and strict new austerity measures are passed as early as the beginning of december .
that process , however , is unlikely to happen before january .
the passing of the austerity plan and 2011 budget is a crucial condition of a planned 85 billion euro -lrb- $ 113 billion -rrb- bailout from the european union and the imf .
talks on the international aid package , intended to prevent trouble spreading in the eurozone , are expected to wrap up on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 27.11.2010 polish workers leave ireland as economy wilts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shops catering to poles may find it hard to keep going ireland saw huge immigration levels when the ' celtic tiger ' boom was in full swing .
but as the boom has turned to bust , many of the immigrants who have lost their jobs are choosing to return home . it is difficult to say exactly how many immigrants arrived in ireland as its economy boomed in the middle of this decade , but according to james wickham , a professor of sociology at trinity college in dublin , immigration figures were pretty high .
" the highest figure that i 've heard is 200,000 , which for a country of 4.5 million is , of course , pretty big , " he said .
the numbers spiked as eastern european nations joined the european union in 2004 .
" immigration was absolutely massive shortly before and above all immediately after accession , " wickham said . " essentially what happened was that people from eastern europe - above all poland , but also lithuania and latvia to a lesser extent provided the labor for the famous ' celtic tiger ' boom . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulk of polish immigration occurred around 2004 supermarkets , delis , travel agencies and businesses aimed at polish and eastern europeans have sprung up all over ireland to cater for the immigrants who came seeking their fortune .
at polski sklep , a polish supermarket in central dublin , every customer knows of people who have lost their jobs because of the recession .
malgorzata stankiewicz moved to ireland in early 2007 when the economy was still growing and found a job easily .
in retrospect , she says she might have misjudged the strength of the irish economy .
" i think it was n't as good as i heard about , " she said .
" but it was still good , i had a job , and i did n't have a problem finding it . "
she then lost that job , and has now been unemployed for a year , although she is constantly looking for new work , sending out her résumé every day and honing her skills as much as she can .
she has several friends who were also laid off , and most of them went back to poland to be with their families .
reasons to stay people like malgorzata are not left to fend for themselves though .
as wickham explained , the welfare state in the irish republic has to provide for them if they stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many poles say the working environment is better in ireland " they are european citizens , they have every right to be here .
they have exactly the same rights to social welfare benefits as irish citizens do , " he said .
" at the moment our benefits are very high - they 're very high compared to the uk , for example . "
beyond welfare provision , which is likely to fall during the government 's austerity drive , there are other reasons for immigrants to stay . wickham said his research shows poles and other eastern european arrivals appreciate the way they are treated in the workplace if they can find a job .
" people found that compared to working in poland , irish workplaces were more informal , gave people more initiative .
irish workplaces are seen as more american - people do n't stand on their roles and people reward initiative . "
changing trends agnes kuzinska , who came to ireland in 2006 , admits she was drawn to ireland by the good press it was getting back home .
" i came here because my friends were here and i had a good time , and people were more sympathetic , friendlier , " she said . but she points to a new trend among polish migrants to ireland : the temporary .
in the past it was thought that most polish families who moved to the irish republic would stay .
now , according to agnes , people are willing to move more than once .
" so many people go back to poland .
stay here for a few years , then go back to poland . "

that history remains a touchy topic . the expulsion and murder of the so-called " sudeten " germans by war-weary czechs after world war ii traumatized the german-czech relationship .
decades later the two countries are both part of the european union and share an open border .
yet the fate of the three million sudeten german expellees has remained a sensitive topic .
" habermann , " a czech-german-austrian film playing in european theaters this fall portrays the suffering of the germans in czechoslovakia after world war ii for the first time .
the film 's slovakian director , juraj herz , is himself a survivor of the holocaust .
he 's attempted to make a balanced film that is fair to both sides , casting a critical , yet sympathetic eye .
the sudetenland refers the western border regions of then-czechoslovakia that were inhabited mostly by ethnic germans .
a history that spares no one the film opens with a dramatic scene from 1945 : the violent expulsion of the germans by a mob of murderous czechs .
less than a decade before , the title character august habermann , a successful german owner of a lumber mill , married the czech jana .
she 's half-jewish but does n't know it .
habermann sees himself as an apolitical sudeten german .
but just one year later , on september 30 , 1938 the day he and his wife are celebrating their daughter 's baptism , the nazis enter the sudetenland , changing everything .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were many children among the expellees from eastern europe after the war as the war wages on , the once pragmatic habermann finds himself trapped by both sides of the conflict .
he tries again and again to protect his wife and his czech employees and friends .
but the pressure under ss unit leader kurt koslowski and the other nazis only grows .
when habermann 's best friend , the czech jan brezina , is implicated in the murder of two german soldiers , koslowski vows to take revenge and even tries to get habermann to help him .
in the end some czechs ' basest instincts of revenge and resentment take over in a retaliation that spares no one , not even the innocent habermann .
dealing with history the film has its weakness , but what director herz achieves is the depiction of a rarely told story with dramatic images .
with scenes of the bloodthirsty czech mobs and the germans forced to wear the letter " n " to mark themselves as " nemec , " czech for german , he draws parallels with the persecution of the jews under the nazis .
ben becker , who plays koslowski , the film is n't just about identifying fault .
" it 's not necessarily about feeling guilty , " he says .
" it 's about dealing with a part of history . "

and germany ’ s finance ministry said that chancellor angela merkel had already ruled out the idea of issuing bonds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle and merkel rejected the idea of eurozone bonds but german news weekly focus cited sources claiming that germany might drop its objections to such bonds , if strict conditions for tougher sanctions on countries running up excessive deficits were imposed .
the solution would help troubled eurozone countries , including greece , ireland and portugal , by bringing down their borrowing costs .
but this means germany could risk seeing its credit rating deteriorating , and would face higher interest rates .
merkel wants a permanent mechanism merkel is facing tough questions at home as to whether germany , europe ’ s largest economy , should help european partners like ireland out of financial crisis at the risk of damaging germany ’ s solid financial reputation .
merkel is calling for a permanent mechanism to replace the provisional european stability fund , a pot of money member states can draw on if they get into severe financial difficulties .
the provisional fund runs out in the summer of 2013 .
at an eu summit in december , merkel is hoping to lay the foundation for a permanent system for dealing with such situations .
germany is stressing that private investors should also shoulder responsibility for financial insecurity .
finance ministers converge on brussels eu finance ministers are expected to meet in brussels on sunday to finalize an aid plan for ireland before markets open on monday morning .
ministers will be asked to approve the bailout package , worth around 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 113 billion -rrb- in loans .
germany and france are urging a rapid conclusion to negotiations to put an end to uncertainty .
the eu and international monetary fund rescue plan is intended to stop the irish debt crisis spreading to other countries in the eurozone .
german economy minister rainer bruederle gave his assurance that ireland and greece were the only eurozone countries that needed to draw on emergency financial aid .
he rejected the idea that other countries , specifically spain and portugal , were at risk , saying , " spain and portugal are doing everything in their power to keep their national finances in order . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ministers hope the euro will stabilize after the ireland bailout is there enough money in the current fund ?
some in europe have questioned whether the current mechanism for rescuing debt-ravaged countries in the eurozone is adequate .
according to german news magazine der spiegel , marco buti , director general for economic and financial affairs at the european commission wants the existing 750-billion-euro stability fund to be increased , perhaps by double its current level .
however , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble rejected the idea , saying that the current 750 billion euro fund was adequate .
but some economists are suggesting that there should be no limit on rescue deals for eurozone countries in financial trouble .
michael burda of berlin 's humboldt university told the tagesspiegel newspaper that it was dangerous to name concrete figures .
" the eu should give an unlimited guarantee for the debts of member states … only then will the markets calm down , " the economist said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 27.11.2010 german government defends its position on eurozone debt crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the biggest economy in the eurozone as eu finance ministers prepare to meet in brussels to finalize a bailout deal for ireland before markets reopen on monday , the german government is defending its handling of eurozone countries in financial difficulty . foreign minister guido westerwelle said on saturday that germany was not considering issuing eurozone bonds to counter europe ’ s debt crisis .
and germany ’ s finance ministry said that chancellor angela merkel had already ruled out the idea of issuing bonds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle and merkel rejected the idea of eurozone bonds but german news weekly focus cited sources claiming that germany might drop its objections to such bonds , if strict conditions for tougher sanctions on countries running up excessive deficits were imposed .
the solution would help troubled eurozone countries , including greece , ireland and portugal , by bringing down their borrowing costs .
but this means germany could risk seeing its credit rating deteriorating , and would face higher interest rates .
merkel wants a permanent mechanism merkel is facing tough questions at home as to whether germany , europe ’ s largest economy , should help european partners like ireland out of financial crisis at the risk of damaging germany ’ s solid financial reputation .
merkel is calling for a permanent mechanism to replace the provisional european stability fund , a pot of money member states can draw on if they get into severe financial difficulties .
the provisional fund runs out in the summer of 2013 .
at an eu summit in december , merkel is hoping to lay the foundation for a permanent system for dealing with such situations .
germany is stressing that private investors should also shoulder responsibility for financial insecurity .
finance ministers converge on brussels eu finance ministers are expected to meet in brussels on sunday to finalize an aid plan for ireland before markets open on monday morning .
ministers will be asked to approve the bailout package , worth around 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 113 billion -rrb- in loans .
germany and france are urging a rapid conclusion to negotiations to put an end to uncertainty .
the eu and international monetary fund rescue plan is intended to stop the irish debt crisis spreading to other countries in the eurozone .
german economy minister rainer bruederle gave his assurance that ireland and greece were the only eurozone countries that needed to draw on emergency financial aid .
he rejected the idea that other countries , specifically spain and portugal , were at risk , saying , " spain and portugal are doing everything in their power to keep their national finances in order . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ministers hope the euro will stabilize after the ireland bailout is there enough money in the current fund ?
some in europe have questioned whether the current mechanism for rescuing debt-ravaged countries in the eurozone is adequate .
according to german news magazine der spiegel , marco buti , director general for economic and financial affairs at the european commission wants the existing 750-billion-euro stability fund to be increased , perhaps by double its current level .
however , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble rejected the idea , saying that the current 750 billion euro fund was adequate .
but some economists are suggesting that there should be no limit on rescue deals for eurozone countries in financial trouble .
michael burda of berlin 's humboldt university told the tagesspiegel newspaper that it was dangerous to name concrete figures .
" the eu should give an unlimited guarantee for the debts of member states … only then will the markets calm down , " the economist said .

in saturday 's bundesliga action , bayer leverkusen conceded a goal in stoppage time , drawing 2-2 at hoffenheim .
bayern munich trounced frankfurt with a 4-1 win , but dortmund remain the team to beat . third-placed bayer leverkusen dropped agonizing points in stoppage time , after conceding a late penalty to draw 2-2 in hoffenheim .
meanwhile , two goals from anatoliy tymoschchuck helped bayern munich to a comfortable 4-1 win over eintracht frankfurt in saturday ’ s bundesliga action .
elsewhere schalke failed to live up to their recent form in a crushing 5-0 defeat by kaiserslautern .
by contrast , fourth-placed hanover kept up their momentum with a 3-0 win over freiburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund still dominate the table after their 4-1 win on friday night , mainz had pulled to within four points of dortmund with a convincing 3-0 victory at home over nuremberg to consolidate second place .
but dortmund did not waver on saturday , and restored their seven-point lead at the top of the table in the day 's late kick-off , winning 4-1 against moenchengladbach .
out of touch leverkusen move to 26 points but are now four points behind mainz and eleven adrift of runaway leaders borussia dortmund - the fact that they had a two-goal lead against hoffenheim will not help their mood on saturday night .
sidney sam put leverkusen ahead in the eigth minute , and arturo vidal added another with a penalty two minutes later , but hoffenheim made it 2-1 with a vedad ibisevic header in the 39th minute .
the win looked secure for leverkusen until a penalty awarded for a foul by gonzalo castro on marvin commper in stoppage time .
iceland midfielder gylfi thor sigurdsson converted the kick for hoffenheim .
" when you are leading by two goals you want to win the game , but you have to say objectively that hoffenheim deserved the point , " said leverkusen coach jupp heynckes .
champions still in the running bayern secured a comfortable win over frankfurt to keep their title defense alive .
tymoshchuck opened the scoring for bayern on the half hour , only for league top scorer theofanis gekas to level with a header four minutes later for his twelfth goal in 14 games .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's mario gomez ca n't stop scoring thomas mueller scored in the 59th minute after oka nikolov in goal failed to hold a bastian schweinsteiger shot , and mario gomez got bayern ’ s third goal in similar fashion two minutes later .
tymoschchuck completed the scoring with his second two minutes from time .
for gomez , little more than a reserve last season , it was the 15th goal in the last 11 games .
" gomez is very important for us because he is scoring the goals , and that is important for a team , " said coach louis van gaal .
" you can not imagine the team without him now . "
schalke may be in the champions league , but … schalke 's 3-0 midweek win over lyon in the champions league counted for nothing at kaiserslautern where felix magath 's side slumped to a 5-0 defeat .
two corners proved the undoing of schalke in the first half , with srdjan lakic heading kaiserslautern ahead in the eighth minute and martin amedick adding the second in the 39th .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was n't a good night for felix magath lakis scored his second nine minutes after the break before a penalty from ivo ilicevic in the 76th and a header from jan moravek two minutes from time completed the misery for magath 's side .
it was schalke 's heaviest bundesliga defeat since 1992 , when they lost 6-1 against bayer leverkusen .
" we did n't have the attitude , " said magath .
" i am even glad the defeat was so high because it shows clearly what has to be done . "
the day 's other games fourth-placed hanover earned a 3-0 victory over visiting freiburg .
jan schlaudraff struck in the 15th minute and set up didier ya konan for the second in the 73rd before a third in the 89th from mike hanke .
hamburg left stuttgart in trouble near the bottom with a 4-2 victory helped by the early dismissal of stuttgart striker ciprian marica .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 27.11.2010 new film broaches taboo topic of post-war expulsions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film shows depicts dramatic moments in world war ii history the movie " habermann " tells the tragic tale of the germans and czechs living in the sudetenland from the day the nazis marched in until the germans were expelled after world war ii .
that history remains a touchy topic . the expulsion and murder of the so-called " sudeten " germans by war-weary czechs after world war ii traumatized the german-czech relationship .
decades later the two countries are both part of the european union and share an open border .
yet the fate of the three million sudeten german expellees has remained a sensitive topic .
" habermann , " a czech-german-austrian film playing in european theaters this fall portrays the suffering of the germans in czechoslovakia after world war ii for the first time .
the film 's slovakian director , juraj herz , is himself a survivor of the holocaust .
he 's attempted to make a balanced film that is fair to both sides , casting a critical , yet sympathetic eye .
the sudetenland refers the western border regions of then-czechoslovakia that were inhabited mostly by ethnic germans .
a history that spares no one the film opens with a dramatic scene from 1945 : the violent expulsion of the germans by a mob of murderous czechs .
less than a decade before , the title character august habermann , a successful german owner of a lumber mill , married the czech jana .
she 's half-jewish but does n't know it .
habermann sees himself as an apolitical sudeten german .
but just one year later , on september 30 , 1938 the day he and his wife are celebrating their daughter 's baptism , the nazis enter the sudetenland , changing everything .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were many children among the expellees from eastern europe after the war as the war wages on , the once pragmatic habermann finds himself trapped by both sides of the conflict .
he tries again and again to protect his wife and his czech employees and friends .
but the pressure under ss unit leader kurt koslowski and the other nazis only grows .
when habermann 's best friend , the czech jan brezina , is implicated in the murder of two german soldiers , koslowski vows to take revenge and even tries to get habermann to help him .
in the end some czechs ' basest instincts of revenge and resentment take over in a retaliation that spares no one , not even the innocent habermann .
dealing with history the film has its weakness , but what director herz achieves is the depiction of a rarely told story with dramatic images .
with scenes of the bloodthirsty czech mobs and the germans forced to wear the letter " n " to mark themselves as " nemec , " czech for german , he draws parallels with the persecution of the jews under the nazis .
ben becker , who plays koslowski , the film is n't just about identifying fault .
" it 's not necessarily about feeling guilty , " he says .
" it 's about dealing with a part of history . "

unions said the marches were peaceful . tens of thousands of protesters marched through the irish capital dublin to protest against severe austerity measures announced this week .
the government plans to slash the minimum wage and get rid of 25,000 public-sector jobs in an effort to bring its deficit below three percent of gross domestic product by 2014 . the state deficit is currently at a crippling 32 percent .
" we are here to object to the arrogance of the government , " president of the irish congress of trade unions jack o 'connor told the crowd .
" they -lsb- the government -rsb- want to sign a blank cheque for generations to come , " o 'connor added .
" we 're not here to pay for the speculators , we 're here to insist on a fair plan . "

about 700 police officers were deployed on the streets of dublin .
widespread anger members of the crowd waved placards reading " eire not for sale , not to the imf " and " there is a better , fairer way . "
the ictu said about 150,000 people joined the protests while police put the figure at 50,000 .
marchers converged on the general post office , a highly symbolic site for critics of the bailout .
it was the site of ireland ’ s declaration of independence in 1916 . as a precondition for a bailout with the european union and the international monetary fund , the dublin government is aiming to save 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- over the next four years , mainly through cutbacks and tax increases .
the bailout deal could be worth up to 90 billion euros in loans .
by-election defeat on friday , angry voters made their feelings plain at the polls , when the socialist sinn fein party won the northwestern constituency of donegal , previously a fianna fail stronghold , as prime minister brian cowen 's fianna fail -lrb- ff -rrb- party suffered a resounding defeat , cutting the ff / green coalition 's parliamentary majority to just two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister brian cowen is facing record lows in polls opposition parties pressured cowen to call an immediate general election .
labour party leader eamon gilmore said fianna fail " has neither the political mandate nor the moral authority to make the crucial decisions the country now faces . "
" we did n't buy into the austerity .
we 're not for the savage cuts , " said sinn fein leader gerry adams .
he said the goal was to take power in dublin and end austerity measures imposed by the international monetary fund .
cowen has refused to go to the polls until the budget and strict new austerity measures are passed as early as the beginning of december .
eu finance ministers are expected to meet in brussels on sunday to discuss the bailout loans , boosting speculation of an announcement of a deal before markets reopen on monday morning .

that history remains a touchy topic . the expulsion and murder of the so-called " sudeten " germans by war-weary czechs after world war ii traumatized the german-czech relationship .
decades later the two countries are both part of the european union and share an open border .
yet the fate of the three million sudeten german expellees has remained a sensitive topic .
" habermann , " a czech-german-austrian film playing in european theaters this fall portrays the suffering of the germans in czechoslovakia after world war ii for the first time .
the film 's slovakian director , juraj herz , is himself a survivor of the holocaust .
he 's attempted to make a balanced film that is fair to both sides , casting a critical , yet sympathetic eye .
the sudetenland refers the western border regions of then-czechoslovakia that were inhabited mostly by ethnic germans .
a history that spares no one the film opens with a dramatic scene from 1945 : the violent expulsion of the germans by a mob of murderous czechs .
less than a decade before , the title character august habermann , a successful german owner of a lumber mill , married the czech jana .
she 's half-jewish but does n't know it .
habermann sees himself as an apolitical sudeten german .
but just one year later , on september 30 , 1938 the day he and his wife are celebrating their daughter 's baptism , the nazis enter the sudetenland , changing everything .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were many children among the expellees from eastern europe after the war as the war wages on , the once pragmatic habermann finds himself trapped by both sides of the conflict .
he tries again and again to protect his wife and his czech employees and friends .
but the pressure under ss unit leader kurt koslowski and the other nazis only grows .
when habermann 's best friend , the czech jan brezina , is implicated in the murder of two german soldiers , koslowski vows to take revenge and even tries to get habermann to help him .
in the end some czechs ' basest instincts of revenge and resentment take over in a retaliation that spares no one , not even the innocent habermann .
dealing with history the film has its weakness , but what director herz achieves is the depiction of a rarely told story with dramatic images .
with scenes of the bloodthirsty czech mobs and the germans forced to wear the letter " n " to mark themselves as " nemec , " czech for german , he draws parallels with the persecution of the jews under the nazis .
ben becker , who plays koslowski , the film is n't just about identifying fault .
" it 's not necessarily about feeling guilty , " he says .
" it 's about dealing with a part of history . "

in saturday 's bundesliga action , bayer leverkusen conceded a goal in stoppage time , drawing 2-2 at hoffenheim .
bayern munich trounced frankfurt with a 4-1 win , but dortmund remain the team to beat . third-placed bayer leverkusen dropped agonizing points in stoppage time , after conceding a late penalty to draw 2-2 in hoffenheim .
meanwhile , two goals from anatoliy tymoschchuck helped bayern munich to a comfortable 4-1 win over eintracht frankfurt in saturday ’ s bundesliga action .
elsewhere schalke failed to live up to their recent form in a crushing 5-0 defeat by kaiserslautern .
by contrast , fourth-placed hanover kept up their momentum with a 3-0 win over freiburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund still dominate the table after their 4-1 win on friday night , mainz had pulled to within four points of dortmund with a convincing 3-0 victory at home over nuremberg to consolidate second place .
but dortmund did not waver on saturday , and restored their seven-point lead at the top of the table in the day 's late kick-off , winning 4-1 against moenchengladbach .
out of touch leverkusen move to 26 points but are now four points behind mainz and eleven adrift of runaway leaders borussia dortmund - the fact that they had a two-goal lead against hoffenheim will not help their mood on saturday night .
sidney sam put leverkusen ahead in the eigth minute , and arturo vidal added another with a penalty two minutes later , but hoffenheim made it 2-1 with a vedad ibisevic header in the 39th minute .
the win looked secure for leverkusen until a penalty awarded for a foul by gonzalo castro on marvin commper in stoppage time .
iceland midfielder gylfi thor sigurdsson converted the kick for hoffenheim .
" when you are leading by two goals you want to win the game , but you have to say objectively that hoffenheim deserved the point , " said leverkusen coach jupp heynckes .

tymoschchuck completed the scoring with his second two minutes from time .
for gomez , little more than a reserve last season , it was the 15th goal in the last 11 games .
" gomez is very important for us because he is scoring the goals , and that is important for a team , " said coach louis van gaal .
" you can not imagine the team without him now . "
schalke may be in the champions league , but … schalke 's 3-0 midweek win over lyon in the champions league counted for nothing at kaiserslautern where felix magath 's side slumped to a 5-0 defeat .
two corners proved the undoing of schalke in the first half , with srdjan lakic heading kaiserslautern ahead in the eighth minute and martin amedick adding the second in the 39th .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was n't a good night for felix magath lakis scored his second nine minutes after the break before a penalty from ivo ilicevic in the 76th and a header from jan moravek two minutes from time completed the misery for magath 's side .
it was schalke 's heaviest bundesliga defeat since 1992 , when they lost 6-1 against bayer leverkusen .
" we did n't have the attitude , " said magath .
" i am even glad the defeat was so high because it shows clearly what has to be done . "
the day 's other games fourth-placed hanover earned a 3-0 victory over visiting freiburg .
jan schlaudraff struck in the 15th minute and set up didier ya konan for the second in the 73rd before a third in the 89th from mike hanke .

and germany ’ s finance ministry said that chancellor angela merkel had already ruled out the idea of issuing bonds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle and merkel rejected the idea of eurozone bonds but german news weekly focus cited sources claiming that germany might drop its objections to such bonds , if strict conditions for tougher sanctions on countries running up excessive deficits were imposed .
the solution would help troubled eurozone countries , including greece , ireland and portugal , by bringing down their borrowing costs .
but this means germany could risk seeing its credit rating deteriorating , and would face higher interest rates .
merkel wants a permanent mechanism merkel is facing tough questions at home as to whether germany , europe ’ s largest economy , should help european partners like ireland out of financial crisis at the risk of damaging germany ’ s solid financial reputation .
merkel is calling for a permanent mechanism to replace the provisional european stability fund , a pot of money member states can draw on if they get into severe financial difficulties .
the provisional fund runs out in the summer of 2013 .
at an eu summit in december , merkel is hoping to lay the foundation for a permanent system for dealing with such situations .
germany is stressing that private investors should also shoulder responsibility for financial insecurity .
finance ministers converge on brussels eu finance ministers are expected to meet in brussels on sunday to finalize an aid plan for ireland before markets open on monday morning .
ministers will be asked to approve the bailout package , worth around 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 113 billion -rrb- in loans .
germany and france are urging a rapid conclusion to negotiations to put an end to uncertainty .
the eu and international monetary fund rescue plan is intended to stop the irish debt crisis spreading to other countries in the eurozone .
german economy minister rainer bruederle gave his assurance that ireland and greece were the only eurozone countries that needed to draw on emergency financial aid .
he rejected the idea that other countries , specifically spain and portugal , were at risk , saying , " spain and portugal are doing everything in their power to keep their national finances in order . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ministers hope the euro will stabilize after the ireland bailout is there enough money in the current fund ?
some in europe have questioned whether the current mechanism for rescuing debt-ravaged countries in the eurozone is adequate .
according to german news magazine der spiegel , marco buti , director general for economic and financial affairs at the european commission wants the existing 750-billion-euro stability fund to be increased , perhaps by double its current level .
however , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble rejected the idea , saying that the current 750 billion euro fund was adequate .
but some economists are suggesting that there should be no limit on rescue deals for eurozone countries in financial trouble .
michael burda of berlin 's humboldt university told the tagesspiegel newspaper that it was dangerous to name concrete figures .
" the eu should give an unlimited guarantee for the debts of member states … only then will the markets calm down , " the economist said .

the irish government has been slammed at the polls after announcing its proposed austerity plan . following friday 's crushing by-election defeat , ireland 's beleaguered government is bracing itself for major protests on saturday amid a nationwide demonstration against major cutbacks announced earlier this week .
tens of thousands of protesters are expected to join trade unions in demonstrating against the severe austerity package announced on wednesday .
the government plans to cut the minimum wage and eliminate 25,000 public-sector jobs in an effort to bring its deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2014 .
it 's now at 32 percent .
" this is the result of allowing speculators , bankers and developers to run riot , pillaging and ruining our economy , " said jack o 'connor , the head of ireland 's biggest union siptu , calling the proposed budget the " harshest … since the foundation of the state . "
" our national sovereignty is at stake as a result of the government 's policies , " he said .
" the timeframe for the adjustment is too short .
it should be extended to 2017 .
we must not stand idly by while the final nail is driven into the coffin . "
by-election defeat on friday , angry voters made their feelings plain at the polls .
the socialist sinn fein party won the northwestern constituency of donegal , previously a fianna fail stronghold , as prime minister brian cowen 's fianna fail -lrb- ff -rrb- party suffered a resounding defeat , cutting the ff / green coalition 's parliamentary majority to just two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition is pressuring cowen to call an immediate general election opposition parties pressured cowen to call an immediate general election .
labour party leader eamon gilmore said fianna fail " has neither the political mandate nor the moral authority to make the crucial decisions the country now faces . "
" we did n't buy into the austerity .
we 're not for the savage cuts , " said sinn fein leader gerry adams .
he said the goal was to take power in dublin and end austerity measures imposed by the international monetary fund .
cowen has refused to go to the polls until the budget and strict new austerity measures are passed as early as the beginning of december .
that process , however , is unlikely to happen before january .
the passing of the austerity plan and 2011 budget is a crucial condition of a planned 85 billion euro -lrb- $ 113 billion -rrb- bailout from the european union and the imf .
talks on the international aid package , intended to prevent trouble spreading in the eurozone , are expected to wrap up on sunday .
