this came despite anni friesinger-postma 's fall in the semi-finals . the three-woman speed skating team claimed germany 's tenth gold medal on saturday evening following a stunning final race against the japanese team .
stephanie beckert , daniela anschuetz-thoms and katrin mattscherodt crossed the finish line only 0.02 seconds ahead of the japanese , who dominated the first few laps of the three-kilometer race .
the japanese team , comprising masako hozumi , maki tabata and nao kodaira , got off to an immense start and soon built up a lead of over 1.7 seconds in the first part of the race - a small eternity on a speed skating rink .
the germans steadily hauled back the advantage , but were still around three quarters of a second behind going into the final lap .

the 16-time world champion slid over the finish line on her belly and pounded the ice in despair , convinced that she had ruined her team 's chances of a medal .
thirty seconds later , one could only guess at friesinger-postma 's emotions as she looked up at the score board and realized she had still done enough to finish 0.23 seconds ahead of the us team .
following this nerve-racking finish , team coach markus eicher decided not to risk the exhausted friesinger-postma in the final , which took place only an hour and a half later .
in that race , stephanie beckert 's extraordinary final drive proved the decisive factor .
friesinger-postma paid tribute to beckert 's explosive performance in the final , in which she led the last two laps .
" that was a rollercoaster for the emotions , " she said .
" she was our steam engine .
she pulled our girls through those two laps . "
beckert has already won two silver medals in the individual speed skating events .

this came despite anni friesinger-postma 's fall in the semi-finals . the three-woman speed skating team claimed germany 's tenth gold medal on saturday evening following a stunning final race against the japanese team .
stephanie beckert , daniela anschuetz-thoms and katrin mattscherodt crossed the finish line only 0.02 seconds ahead of the japanese , who dominated the first few laps of the three-kilometer race .
the japanese team , comprising masako hozumi , maki tabata and nao kodaira , got off to an immense start and soon built up a lead of over 1.7 seconds in the first part of the race - a small eternity on a speed skating rink .
the germans steadily hauled back the advantage , but were still around three quarters of a second behind going into the final lap .

the 16-time world champion slid over the finish line on her belly and pounded the ice in despair , convinced that she had ruined her team 's chances of a medal .
thirty seconds later , one could only guess at friesinger-postma 's emotions as she looked up at the score board and realized she had still done enough to finish 0.23 seconds ahead of the us team .
following this nerve-racking finish , team coach markus eicher decided not to risk the exhausted friesinger-postma in the final , which took place only an hour and a half later .
in that race , stephanie beckert 's extraordinary final drive proved the decisive factor .
friesinger-postma paid tribute to beckert 's explosive performance in the final , in which she led the last two laps .
" that was a rollercoaster for the emotions , " she said .
" she was our steam engine .
she pulled our girls through those two laps . "
beckert has already won two silver medals in the individual speed skating events .

but as loew contemplates who should be in the squad he will take to south africa , it seems that he can not decide on which out of the three candidates available should be his first choice . loew has named all three in his squad for the friendly against argentina next week - germany 's biggest test before the main event gets underway in june .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese have all been picked despite calamitous losses in form and confidence over the past few weeks . despite assuring the german public that " all three goalkeepers have maintained a high level of quality over the season as a whole , " loew must be concerned at the mistakes the trio have made in recent matches and the fact that not one of them has risen to the top to make a clear case for the coveted no.1 shirt . adler 's recent lack of concentration is a worry bildunterschrift : neuer , adler and wiese compete for the no.1 shirt loew does have a point .
adler , as the shot-stopper for the bundesliga leaders , has had a great season on the whole .
he has been ever-present as leverkusen have gone unbeaten to remain top of the league , with nine clean sheets .
he has conceded 20 goals so far this season but none will be as damaging to his reputation as the gift he gave werder bremen 's claudio pizarro last weekend .
adler let a free kick slip through his legs during the 2-2 draw . while still one of the favorites - on leverkusen 's form - to become germany 's no. 1 , such lapses in concentration will be much more devastating should they occur at the world cup , a fact that wo n't be lost on jogi loew . manuel neuer has also been in good form with schalke , keeping 12 clean sheets and letting in just 17 goals all season . neuer still in contention but mistakes come thick and fast neuer was even being spoken of as a possible replacement for the aging edwin van der sar at manchester united but sir alex ferguson may not have been that impressed by his display against wolfsburg last week .
neuer was clearly at fault as wolfsburg 's brazilian striker grafite equalized and then won the match after failing to be closed down by the schalke keeper .
neuer remains the other main contender for the no.1 jersey but such mistakes come at a critical time for both club and country . the door of opportunity is likely to be closing for tim wiese .
the werder bremen keeper has been there or thereabouts in the fight for the no.1 jersey but his time has probably been and gone . tim wiese 's time may have come and gone the form he showed in bremen 's 2006 bundesliga-title season has never fully been replicated and his gaffs have become more spectacular and regular in recent seasons .
even at the age of 28 , in an era when goalies can play to the age of 40 , wiese looks to have missed the boat , especially as loew is looking to younger stars in a number of positions . that none of these three is an automatic choice and each has failed to convince the national team coach in the run-up to south africa 2010 .
this leaves germany wondering if the goalkeeping conveyor belt , which for years has helped keep the country at the top of the international game may finally have run out of legs . goalkeeping production line drying up great german goalkeepers usually come along with the regularity of london buses .
whenever one is seen to have taken center stage , a precocious upstart is already waiting in the wings for his chance to take over .
when one is ruling the roost , it is hard for many people to imagine finding a successor ; such is the expected resilience of germany 's no. 1 .
but for the germans , it is a matter of course that the keeper-in-waiting should be of equal or better quality than the incumbent . germany 's 1990 world cup-winning keeper bodo illgner looked as though he would be the no.1 forever when he took over the shirt from eike immel after euro ' 88 .
illgner 's understudy , andreas koepke , then became the clear choice between 1996 and 2000 with a young oliver kahn breathing down his neck . kahn was , of course , to go on to become one of the greatest german goalkeepers of all time - and even if he had n't , germany would still have been blessed with a top-draw stopper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann , hildebrand and kahn were all world class keepers while king kahn was racking up his 86 appearances for the national team , his main rival was jens lehmann , a goalkeeper who could have been the first choice for most international teams .
only kahn 's consistency and form kept lehmann from making the no.1 jersey his own on a permanent basis . when lehmann finally creaked his way out of the international arena after losing the final of euro 2008 with germany , there were a number of possible successors but not one clear choice .
eventually one of the following pack rose to prominence over the others . robert enke appeared the most obvious choice to become the next german no.1.
one can only wonder what heights he might have reached had he not tragically taken his own life last year .

some four years later , deutsche welle 's uwe hessler has discovered new hope there . when i was shown around the ruetli school in the tough berlin district of neukoelln by dr. ahmad al-sadi , i felt as if i was accompanying a movie celebrity on a walk downtown .
the 61-year-old former palestinian refugee was wearing a leather jacket and a hat that made him look more like a weather-beaten cowboy than a member of a school 's staff .
but everywhere we went in the school on this tuesday morning in february , he was greeted with shining eyes by youngsters who soon crowded around us , eager to shake hands and get a few words of advice or comfort from the man they lovingly call " uncle sadi . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. ahmad al-sadi has won the trust and respect of the ruetli students al-sadi belongs to a team of teachers , social workers , politicians and community members who are struggling to change the image of a school which was once a symbol of a failing school system that had little to offer - especially to young immigrants .
school of terror in february 2006 , a bunch of rowdy ruetli school students attacked reporters , shouting their disdain for mainstream german society as the cameras rolled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , police moved in at the ruetli school to de-escalate the conflict the violence erupted after the school 's teachers had written an open letter to the school authorities in the neukoelln city district .
" in many classes , " the letter said , " the behavior of students is marked by a total rejection of education and by attitudes which are deeply inhuman .
teachers can only enter classrooms with their mobile phones on to be able to call for help quickly .
we are desperate . "
claudia heckmann was a teacher of english and german at the time .
she said the teaching staff did n't want their protest to lead to a closure of the school .
" we wanted to say that the school system was wrong , " she says now , " and that things must change at the roots . "
back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .
the hauptschule is perceived by many as a place for the " losers " in society , those who will probably end up on social welfare .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neukoelln district still has the image of a troubled immigrant neighborhood at the ruetli school , about 95 percent of the students have an immigrant background .
their parents mostly come from turkey , the balkans and arab countries .
campus ruetli after a recent reform to the school system in berlin , the ruetli school is now a gemeinschaftsschule or community school .
this new type of school has been introduced to give students a better chance of earning the qualifications they need to get jobs or even a university degree .
behind the hundred-year-old ruetli school building , bulldozers are currently levelling a 41,000 square meter -lrb- 10 acres -rrb- construction site , tearing down decrepit buildings and shacks in what used to be a small inner-city industrial area .
they 're making way for campus ruetli - a project which school authorities describe as a model of modern-type schooling that is meant to provide state-of-the-art education for children from pre-school age right up to graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work is changing both the face of the district and people 's minds once it has been completed , campus ruetli will include childcare facilities , a sports ground and a gym , and will incorporate three other schools that already exist close by .
dr. eric denton , an american who teaches english at the ruetli school , said it 's not just the teachers who " dream big " as a result of the new project : " politicians have realized that the way to save a community is to work through the school , to give the school a foundation and the resources it needs , " he says .
" the community gets an identity through the school , and the school benefits and prospers . "
the german government as well as the berlin city administration have earmarked a total of 25 million euros for the project , which is to be completed over the next few years .
changing attitudes about one million euros of this funding have already been spent on renovating the interior of the building .
as al-sadi was guiding me around , he was beaming with pride as he opened the doors to the school 's cafeteria and dining room , all gleaming in bright colors now .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private sponsors have contributed to giving classrooms a facelift al-sadi said that the students had come to cherish the facelift , and added that evidence of this was the fact that vandalism had virtually stopped at the school .
however , there are quite a few people at the ruetli school who believe that al-sadi himself has contributed significantly to the change in attitudes and behaviour .

" we had lost everything ; our home , our property and the transport business my father had owned in the town of nazareth .
i still remember him saying that only education could save us now , and that it was only through our brains that we could improve our situation . "
in 2006 - just two weeks after the outburst of violence at the ruetli school - al-sadi attended a meeting of parents and teachers , which , he said , " was marked by a general lack of understanding and interest on the part of the parents . "
but , he went on , " i stood up to tell them about my father 's message to me .
i was speaking in arabic , and the women started crying as they became aware of their own situation and that of their children .
they asked me what to do , and i told them : ' i will look after your children , but you must promise that you come to the school when there 's a problem to solve . " '
since then al-sadi has been working at the school as one of two " intercultural mediators . "
he 's sold the building company he owned to devote his time entirely to a job that he said " keeps him busy often from the morning until the late evening . "
over the past four years , " uncle sadi " has won the trust of both the students and their parents .
but he has also re-established communication between them and the teaching staff .
and he often has to mediate within the families themselves , notably when it comes to resolving generational problems arising from traditional beliefs and customs .
he describes what he 's doing as working on " the future of germany as a whole . "
he has clear views on social policy : " germans do n't have enough children anymore .
arab families have eight , nine or even ten children .
they will stay here , and they must be given a chance to make a living in this society . "
campus of hope the ruetli school students have come to see al-sadi as a role model for what can be achieved through education and hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a blackboard welcoming visitors in three languages has n't been vandalized for four years they 've embraced the school as theirs , and they 've learned to value what the teachers are doing for them .
" they spend a lot of time so that we can get a job , " said 16-year-old ahmed iraque .
and ezgi güler , a 10th grader from turkey , added that public perception that the school was only for " losers " was entirely wrong .
" this school gives me a chance for my future , more than the school i attended before .
when i leave , i know that i will cry . "
zahra riaz , who is also in the 10th grade , even believes that the multicultural make-up of the school gives the students an advantage over classes made up of only native germans .
" we learn more about different cultures , " she says .
" yes , i think i have a good future here , because i try to be a good student . "
meanwhile , the number of ruetli students going on to an academic education has more than doubled over the past four years .
arabic language classes have been introduced , making it easier for most of the students to learn the second foreign language they need to qualify for university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruetli students are working together for their school and for a better future many students now even spend parts of their leisure time at school , doing their homework or learning in after-school classes .
parents can enjoy a cup of coffee , or discuss problems with teachers at a parents ' center in the school building .
and claudia heckmann , the former english and german teacher , has become the school 's principal .
she said that the bad headlines four years ago prompted teachers , authorities , students and parents to " move closer together " to become a team that had developed a new spirit .
" nevertheless there are still huge difficulties , " she says , " and sometimes we think it 's too much , and too many problems need to be resolved .
but then , there is this vision that we can change things if we focus on the strength of people , and not always on what is not working . "

but everywhere we went in the school on this tuesday morning in february , he was greeted with shining eyes by youngsters who soon crowded around us , eager to shake hands and get a few words of advice or comfort from the man they lovingly call " uncle sadi . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. ahmad al-sadi has won the trust and respect of the ruetli students al-sadi belongs to a team of teachers , social workers , politicians and community members who are struggling to change the image of a school which was once a symbol of a failing school system that had little to offer - especially to young immigrants .
school of terror in february 2006 , a bunch of rowdy ruetli school students attacked reporters , shouting their disdain for mainstream german society as the cameras rolled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , police moved in at the ruetli school to de-escalate the conflict the violence erupted after the school 's teachers had written an open letter to the school authorities in the neukoelln city district .
" in many classes , " the letter said , " the behavior of students is marked by a total rejection of education and by attitudes which are deeply inhuman .
teachers can only enter classrooms with their mobile phones on to be able to call for help quickly .
we are desperate . "
claudia heckmann was a teacher of english and german at the time .
she said the teaching staff did n't want their protest to lead to a closure of the school .
" we wanted to say that the school system was wrong , " she says now , " and that things must change at the roots . "
back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .
the hauptschule is perceived by many as a place for the " losers " in society , those who will probably end up on social welfare .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neukoelln district still has the image of a troubled immigrant neighborhood at the ruetli school , about 95 percent of the students have an immigrant background .
their parents mostly come from turkey , the balkans and arab countries .
campus ruetli after a recent reform to the school system in berlin , the ruetli school is now a gemeinschaftsschule or community school .
this new type of school has been introduced to give students a better chance of earning the qualifications they need to get jobs or even a university degree .
behind the hundred-year-old ruetli school building , bulldozers are currently levelling a 41,000 square meter -lrb- 10 acres -rrb- construction site , tearing down decrepit buildings and shacks in what used to be a small inner-city industrial area .
they 're making way for campus ruetli - a project which school authorities describe as a model of modern-type schooling that is meant to provide state-of-the-art education for children from pre-school age right up to graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work is changing both the face of the district and people 's minds once it has been completed , campus ruetli will include childcare facilities , a sports ground and a gym , and will incorporate three other schools that already exist close by .
dr. eric denton , an american who teaches english at the ruetli school , said it 's not just the teachers who " dream big " as a result of the new project : " politicians have realized that the way to save a community is to work through the school , to give the school a foundation and the resources it needs , " he says .
" the community gets an identity through the school , and the school benefits and prospers . "
the german government as well as the berlin city administration have earmarked a total of 25 million euros for the project , which is to be completed over the next few years .
changing attitudes about one million euros of this funding have already been spent on renovating the interior of the building .
as al-sadi was guiding me around , he was beaming with pride as he opened the doors to the school 's cafeteria and dining room , all gleaming in bright colors now .
the classrooms which he most enjoys showing off , however , are those where natural sciences are taught , which are equipped with the latest science equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private sponsors have contributed to giving classrooms a facelift al-sadi said that the students had come to cherish the facelift , and added that evidence of this was the fact that vandalism had virtually stopped at the school .
however , there are quite a few people at the ruetli school who believe that al-sadi himself has contributed significantly to the change in attitudes and behaviour .

" we had lost everything ; our home , our property and the transport business my father had owned in the town of nazareth .
i still remember him saying that only education could save us now , and that it was only through our brains that we could improve our situation . "
in 2006 - just two weeks after the outburst of violence at the ruetli school - al-sadi attended a meeting of parents and teachers , which , he said , " was marked by a general lack of understanding and interest on the part of the parents . "
but , he went on , " i stood up to tell them about my father 's message to me .
i was speaking in arabic , and the women started crying as they became aware of their own situation and that of their children .
they asked me what to do , and i told them : ' i will look after your children , but you must promise that you come to the school when there 's a problem to solve . " '
since then al-sadi has been working at the school as one of two " intercultural mediators . "
he 's sold the building company he owned to devote his time entirely to a job that he said " keeps him busy often from the morning until the late evening . "
over the past four years , " uncle sadi " has won the trust of both the students and their parents .
but he has also re-established communication between them and the teaching staff .
and he often has to mediate within the families themselves , notably when it comes to resolving generational problems arising from traditional beliefs and customs .
he describes what he 's doing as working on " the future of germany as a whole . "
he has clear views on social policy : " germans do n't have enough children anymore .
arab families have eight , nine or even ten children .
they will stay here , and they must be given a chance to make a living in this society . "
campus of hope the ruetli school students have come to see al-sadi as a role model for what can be achieved through education and hard work .

some four years later , deutsche welle 's uwe hessler has discovered new hope there . when i was shown around the ruetli school in the tough berlin district of neukoelln by dr. ahmad al-sadi , i felt as if i was accompanying a movie celebrity on a walk downtown .
the 61-year-old former palestinian refugee was wearing a leather jacket and a hat that made him look more like a weather-beaten cowboy than a member of a school 's staff .
but everywhere we went in the school on this tuesday morning in february , he was greeted with shining eyes by youngsters who soon crowded around us , eager to shake hands and get a few words of advice or comfort from the man they lovingly call " uncle sadi . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. ahmad al-sadi has won the trust and respect of the ruetli students al-sadi belongs to a team of teachers , social workers , politicians and community members who are struggling to change the image of a school which was once a symbol of a failing school system that had little to offer - especially to young immigrants .
school of terror in february 2006 , a bunch of rowdy ruetli school students attacked reporters , shouting their disdain for mainstream german society as the cameras rolled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , police moved in at the ruetli school to de-escalate the conflict the violence erupted after the school 's teachers had written an open letter to the school authorities in the neukoelln city district .
" in many classes , " the letter said , " the behavior of students is marked by a total rejection of education and by attitudes which are deeply inhuman .
teachers can only enter classrooms with their mobile phones on to be able to call for help quickly .
we are desperate . "
claudia heckmann was a teacher of english and german at the time .
she said the teaching staff did n't want their protest to lead to a closure of the school .
" we wanted to say that the school system was wrong , " she says now , " and that things must change at the roots . "
back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .
the hauptschule is perceived by many as a place for the " losers " in society , those who will probably end up on social welfare .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neukoelln district still has the image of a troubled immigrant neighborhood at the ruetli school , about 95 percent of the students have an immigrant background .
their parents mostly come from turkey , the balkans and arab countries .
campus ruetli after a recent reform to the school system in berlin , the ruetli school is now a gemeinschaftsschule or community school .
this new type of school has been introduced to give students a better chance of earning the qualifications they need to get jobs or even a university degree .

but as loew contemplates who should be in the squad he will take to south africa , it seems that he can not decide on which out of the three candidates available should be his first choice . loew has named all three in his squad for the friendly against argentina next week - germany 's biggest test before the main event gets underway in june .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese have all been picked despite calamitous losses in form and confidence over the past few weeks . despite assuring the german public that " all three goalkeepers have maintained a high level of quality over the season as a whole , " loew must be concerned at the mistakes the trio have made in recent matches and the fact that not one of them has risen to the top to make a clear case for the coveted no.1 shirt . adler 's recent lack of concentration is a worry bildunterschrift : neuer , adler and wiese compete for the no.1 shirt loew does have a point .
adler , as the shot-stopper for the bundesliga leaders , has had a great season on the whole .
he has been ever-present as leverkusen have gone unbeaten to remain top of the league , with nine clean sheets .
he has conceded 20 goals so far this season but none will be as damaging to his reputation as the gift he gave werder bremen 's claudio pizarro last weekend .
adler let a free kick slip through his legs during the 2-2 draw . while still one of the favorites - on leverkusen 's form - to become germany 's no. 1 , such lapses in concentration will be much more devastating should they occur at the world cup , a fact that wo n't be lost on jogi loew . manuel neuer has also been in good form with schalke , keeping 12 clean sheets and letting in just 17 goals all season . neuer still in contention but mistakes come thick and fast neuer was even being spoken of as a possible replacement for the aging edwin van der sar at manchester united but sir alex ferguson may not have been that impressed by his display against wolfsburg last week .
neuer was clearly at fault as wolfsburg 's brazilian striker grafite equalized and then won the match after failing to be closed down by the schalke keeper .
neuer remains the other main contender for the no.1 jersey but such mistakes come at a critical time for both club and country . the door of opportunity is likely to be closing for tim wiese .
the werder bremen keeper has been there or thereabouts in the fight for the no.1 jersey but his time has probably been and gone . tim wiese 's time may have come and gone the form he showed in bremen 's 2006 bundesliga-title season has never fully been replicated and his gaffs have become more spectacular and regular in recent seasons .
even at the age of 28 , in an era when goalies can play to the age of 40 , wiese looks to have missed the boat , especially as loew is looking to younger stars in a number of positions . that none of these three is an automatic choice and each has failed to convince the national team coach in the run-up to south africa 2010 .
this leaves germany wondering if the goalkeeping conveyor belt , which for years has helped keep the country at the top of the international game may finally have run out of legs . goalkeeping production line drying up great german goalkeepers usually come along with the regularity of london buses .
whenever one is seen to have taken center stage , a precocious upstart is already waiting in the wings for his chance to take over .
when one is ruling the roost , it is hard for many people to imagine finding a successor ; such is the expected resilience of germany 's no. 1 .
but for the germans , it is a matter of course that the keeper-in-waiting should be of equal or better quality than the incumbent . germany 's 1990 world cup-winning keeper bodo illgner looked as though he would be the no.1 forever when he took over the shirt from eike immel after euro ' 88 .
illgner 's understudy , andreas koepke , then became the clear choice between 1996 and 2000 with a young oliver kahn breathing down his neck . kahn was , of course , to go on to become one of the greatest german goalkeepers of all time - and even if he had n't , germany would still have been blessed with a top-draw stopper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann , hildebrand and kahn were all world class keepers while king kahn was racking up his 86 appearances for the national team , his main rival was jens lehmann , a goalkeeper who could have been the first choice for most international teams .
only kahn 's consistency and form kept lehmann from making the no.1 jersey his own on a permanent basis . when lehmann finally creaked his way out of the international arena after losing the final of euro 2008 with germany , there were a number of possible successors but not one clear choice .
eventually one of the following pack rose to prominence over the others . robert enke appeared the most obvious choice to become the next german no.1.

he has been ever-present as leverkusen have gone unbeaten to remain top of the league , with nine clean sheets .
he has conceded 20 goals so far this season but none will be as damaging to his reputation as the gift he gave werder bremen 's claudio pizarro last weekend .
adler let a free kick slip through his legs during the 2-2 draw . while still one of the favorites - on leverkusen 's form - to become germany 's no. 1 , such lapses in concentration will be much more devastating should they occur at the world cup , a fact that wo n't be lost on jogi loew . manuel neuer has also been in good form with schalke , keeping 12 clean sheets and letting in just 17 goals all season . neuer still in contention but mistakes come thick and fast neuer was even being spoken of as a possible replacement for the aging edwin van der sar at manchester united but sir alex ferguson may not have been that impressed by his display against wolfsburg last week .
neuer was clearly at fault as wolfsburg 's brazilian striker grafite equalized and then won the match after failing to be closed down by the schalke keeper .
neuer remains the other main contender for the no.1 jersey but such mistakes come at a critical time for both club and country . the door of opportunity is likely to be closing for tim wiese .
the werder bremen keeper has been there or thereabouts in the fight for the no.1 jersey but his time has probably been and gone . tim wiese 's time may have come and gone the form he showed in bremen 's 2006 bundesliga-title season has never fully been replicated and his gaffs have become more spectacular and regular in recent seasons .
even at the age of 28 , in an era when goalies can play to the age of 40 , wiese looks to have missed the boat , especially as loew is looking to younger stars in a number of positions . that none of these three is an automatic choice and each has failed to convince the national team coach in the run-up to south africa 2010 .
this leaves germany wondering if the goalkeeping conveyor belt , which for years has helped keep the country at the top of the international game may finally have run out of legs . goalkeeping production line drying up great german goalkeepers usually come along with the regularity of london buses .
whenever one is seen to have taken center stage , a precocious upstart is already waiting in the wings for his chance to take over .
when one is ruling the roost , it is hard for many people to imagine finding a successor ; such is the expected resilience of germany 's no. 1 .
but for the germans , it is a matter of course that the keeper-in-waiting should be of equal or better quality than the incumbent . germany 's 1990 world cup-winning keeper bodo illgner looked as though he would be the no.1 forever when he took over the shirt from eike immel after euro ' 88 .
illgner 's understudy , andreas koepke , then became the clear choice between 1996 and 2000 with a young oliver kahn breathing down his neck . kahn was , of course , to go on to become one of the greatest german goalkeepers of all time - and even if he had n't , germany would still have been blessed with a top-draw stopper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann , hildebrand and kahn were all world class keepers while king kahn was racking up his 86 appearances for the national team , his main rival was jens lehmann , a goalkeeper who could have been the first choice for most international teams .
only kahn 's consistency and form kept lehmann from making the no.1 jersey his own on a permanent basis . when lehmann finally creaked his way out of the international arena after losing the final of euro 2008 with germany , there were a number of possible successors but not one clear choice .
eventually one of the following pack rose to prominence over the others . robert enke appeared the most obvious choice to become the next german no.1.

but as loew contemplates who should be in the squad he will take to south africa , it seems that he can not decide on which out of the three candidates available should be his first choice . loew has named all three in his squad for the friendly against argentina next week - germany 's biggest test before the main event gets underway in june .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese have all been picked despite calamitous losses in form and confidence over the past few weeks . despite assuring the german public that " all three goalkeepers have maintained a high level of quality over the season as a whole , " loew must be concerned at the mistakes the trio have made in recent matches and the fact that not one of them has risen to the top to make a clear case for the coveted no.1 shirt . adler 's recent lack of concentration is a worry bildunterschrift : neuer , adler and wiese compete for the no.1 shirt loew does have a point .

some four years later , deutsche welle 's uwe hessler has discovered new hope there . when i was shown around the ruetli school in the tough berlin district of neukoelln by dr. ahmad al-sadi , i felt as if i was accompanying a movie celebrity on a walk downtown .
the 61-year-old former palestinian refugee was wearing a leather jacket and a hat that made him look more like a weather-beaten cowboy than a member of a school 's staff .
but everywhere we went in the school on this tuesday morning in february , he was greeted with shining eyes by youngsters who soon crowded around us , eager to shake hands and get a few words of advice or comfort from the man they lovingly call " uncle sadi . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. ahmad al-sadi has won the trust and respect of the ruetli students al-sadi belongs to a team of teachers , social workers , politicians and community members who are struggling to change the image of a school which was once a symbol of a failing school system that had little to offer - especially to young immigrants .
school of terror in february 2006 , a bunch of rowdy ruetli school students attacked reporters , shouting their disdain for mainstream german society as the cameras rolled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , police moved in at the ruetli school to de-escalate the conflict the violence erupted after the school 's teachers had written an open letter to the school authorities in the neukoelln city district .
" in many classes , " the letter said , " the behavior of students is marked by a total rejection of education and by attitudes which are deeply inhuman .
teachers can only enter classrooms with their mobile phones on to be able to call for help quickly .
we are desperate . "
claudia heckmann was a teacher of english and german at the time .
she said the teaching staff did n't want their protest to lead to a closure of the school .
" we wanted to say that the school system was wrong , " she says now , " and that things must change at the roots . "
back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .
the hauptschule is perceived by many as a place for the " losers " in society , those who will probably end up on social welfare .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neukoelln district still has the image of a troubled immigrant neighborhood at the ruetli school , about 95 percent of the students have an immigrant background .
their parents mostly come from turkey , the balkans and arab countries .
campus ruetli after a recent reform to the school system in berlin , the ruetli school is now a gemeinschaftsschule or community school .
this new type of school has been introduced to give students a better chance of earning the qualifications they need to get jobs or even a university degree .
behind the hundred-year-old ruetli school building , bulldozers are currently levelling a 41,000 square meter -lrb- 10 acres -rrb- construction site , tearing down decrepit buildings and shacks in what used to be a small inner-city industrial area .
they 're making way for campus ruetli - a project which school authorities describe as a model of modern-type schooling that is meant to provide state-of-the-art education for children from pre-school age right up to graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work is changing both the face of the district and people 's minds once it has been completed , campus ruetli will include childcare facilities , a sports ground and a gym , and will incorporate three other schools that already exist close by .
dr. eric denton , an american who teaches english at the ruetli school , said it 's not just the teachers who " dream big " as a result of the new project : " politicians have realized that the way to save a community is to work through the school , to give the school a foundation and the resources it needs , " he says .
" the community gets an identity through the school , and the school benefits and prospers . "
the german government as well as the berlin city administration have earmarked a total of 25 million euros for the project , which is to be completed over the next few years .
changing attitudes about one million euros of this funding have already been spent on renovating the interior of the building .
as al-sadi was guiding me around , he was beaming with pride as he opened the doors to the school 's cafeteria and dining room , all gleaming in bright colors now .
the classrooms which he most enjoys showing off , however , are those where natural sciences are taught , which are equipped with the latest science equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private sponsors have contributed to giving classrooms a facelift al-sadi said that the students had come to cherish the facelift , and added that evidence of this was the fact that vandalism had virtually stopped at the school .
however , there are quite a few people at the ruetli school who believe that al-sadi himself has contributed significantly to the change in attitudes and behaviour .
the missing link the palestinian grew up in the irbid refugee camp in jordan , and came to germany in the 1970s to study economics .
" we had lost everything ; our home , our property and the transport business my father had owned in the town of nazareth .
i still remember him saying that only education could save us now , and that it was only through our brains that we could improve our situation . "
in 2006 - just two weeks after the outburst of violence at the ruetli school - al-sadi attended a meeting of parents and teachers , which , he said , " was marked by a general lack of understanding and interest on the part of the parents . "
but , he went on , " i stood up to tell them about my father 's message to me .
i was speaking in arabic , and the women started crying as they became aware of their own situation and that of their children .
they asked me what to do , and i told them : ' i will look after your children , but you must promise that you come to the school when there 's a problem to solve . " '
since then al-sadi has been working at the school as one of two " intercultural mediators . "
he 's sold the building company he owned to devote his time entirely to a job that he said " keeps him busy often from the morning until the late evening . "
over the past four years , " uncle sadi " has won the trust of both the students and their parents .
but he has also re-established communication between them and the teaching staff .
and he often has to mediate within the families themselves , notably when it comes to resolving generational problems arising from traditional beliefs and customs .
he describes what he 's doing as working on " the future of germany as a whole . "
he has clear views on social policy : " germans do n't have enough children anymore .
arab families have eight , nine or even ten children .
they will stay here , and they must be given a chance to make a living in this society . "
campus of hope the ruetli school students have come to see al-sadi as a role model for what can be achieved through education and hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a blackboard welcoming visitors in three languages has n't been vandalized for four years they 've embraced the school as theirs , and they 've learned to value what the teachers are doing for them .
" they spend a lot of time so that we can get a job , " said 16-year-old ahmed iraque .
and ezgi güler , a 10th grader from turkey , added that public perception that the school was only for " losers " was entirely wrong .
" this school gives me a chance for my future , more than the school i attended before .
when i leave , i know that i will cry . "
zahra riaz , who is also in the 10th grade , even believes that the multicultural make-up of the school gives the students an advantage over classes made up of only native germans .
" we learn more about different cultures , " she says .
" yes , i think i have a good future here , because i try to be a good student . "
meanwhile , the number of ruetli students going on to an academic education has more than doubled over the past four years .
arabic language classes have been introduced , making it easier for most of the students to learn the second foreign language they need to qualify for university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruetli students are working together for their school and for a better future many students now even spend parts of their leisure time at school , doing their homework or learning in after-school classes .
parents can enjoy a cup of coffee , or discuss problems with teachers at a parents ' center in the school building .
and claudia heckmann , the former english and german teacher , has become the school 's principal .
she said that the bad headlines four years ago prompted teachers , authorities , students and parents to " move closer together " to become a team that had developed a new spirit .
" nevertheless there are still huge difficulties , " she says , " and sometimes we think it 's too much , and too many problems need to be resolved .
but then , there is this vision that we can change things if we focus on the strength of people , and not always on what is not working . "

some four years later , deutsche welle 's uwe hessler has discovered new hope there . when i was shown around the ruetli school in the tough berlin district of neukoelln by dr. ahmad al-sadi , i felt as if i was accompanying a movie celebrity on a walk downtown .
the 61-year-old former palestinian refugee was wearing a leather jacket and a hat that made him look more like a weather-beaten cowboy than a member of a school 's staff .
but everywhere we went in the school on this tuesday morning in february , he was greeted with shining eyes by youngsters who soon crowded around us , eager to shake hands and get a few words of advice or comfort from the man they lovingly call " uncle sadi . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. ahmad al-sadi has won the trust and respect of the ruetli students al-sadi belongs to a team of teachers , social workers , politicians and community members who are struggling to change the image of a school which was once a symbol of a failing school system that had little to offer - especially to young immigrants .
school of terror in february 2006 , a bunch of rowdy ruetli school students attacked reporters , shouting their disdain for mainstream german society as the cameras rolled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , police moved in at the ruetli school to de-escalate the conflict the violence erupted after the school 's teachers had written an open letter to the school authorities in the neukoelln city district .
" in many classes , " the letter said , " the behavior of students is marked by a total rejection of education and by attitudes which are deeply inhuman .
teachers can only enter classrooms with their mobile phones on to be able to call for help quickly .
we are desperate . "
claudia heckmann was a teacher of english and german at the time .
she said the teaching staff did n't want their protest to lead to a closure of the school .
" we wanted to say that the school system was wrong , " she says now , " and that things must change at the roots . "
back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .
the hauptschule is perceived by many as a place for the " losers " in society , those who will probably end up on social welfare .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neukoelln district still has the image of a troubled immigrant neighborhood at the ruetli school , about 95 percent of the students have an immigrant background .
their parents mostly come from turkey , the balkans and arab countries .
campus ruetli after a recent reform to the school system in berlin , the ruetli school is now a gemeinschaftsschule or community school .
this new type of school has been introduced to give students a better chance of earning the qualifications they need to get jobs or even a university degree .
behind the hundred-year-old ruetli school building , bulldozers are currently levelling a 41,000 square meter -lrb- 10 acres -rrb- construction site , tearing down decrepit buildings and shacks in what used to be a small inner-city industrial area .
they 're making way for campus ruetli - a project which school authorities describe as a model of modern-type schooling that is meant to provide state-of-the-art education for children from pre-school age right up to graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work is changing both the face of the district and people 's minds once it has been completed , campus ruetli will include childcare facilities , a sports ground and a gym , and will incorporate three other schools that already exist close by .

some four years later , deutsche welle 's uwe hessler has discovered new hope there . when i was shown around the ruetli school in the tough berlin district of neukoelln by dr. ahmad al-sadi , i felt as if i was accompanying a movie celebrity on a walk downtown .
the 61-year-old former palestinian refugee was wearing a leather jacket and a hat that made him look more like a weather-beaten cowboy than a member of a school 's staff .
but everywhere we went in the school on this tuesday morning in february , he was greeted with shining eyes by youngsters who soon crowded around us , eager to shake hands and get a few words of advice or comfort from the man they lovingly call " uncle sadi . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. ahmad al-sadi has won the trust and respect of the ruetli students al-sadi belongs to a team of teachers , social workers , politicians and community members who are struggling to change the image of a school which was once a symbol of a failing school system that had little to offer - especially to young immigrants .
school of terror in february 2006 , a bunch of rowdy ruetli school students attacked reporters , shouting their disdain for mainstream german society as the cameras rolled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , police moved in at the ruetli school to de-escalate the conflict the violence erupted after the school 's teachers had written an open letter to the school authorities in the neukoelln city district .
" in many classes , " the letter said , " the behavior of students is marked by a total rejection of education and by attitudes which are deeply inhuman .
teachers can only enter classrooms with their mobile phones on to be able to call for help quickly .
we are desperate . "
claudia heckmann was a teacher of english and german at the time .
she said the teaching staff did n't want their protest to lead to a closure of the school .
" we wanted to say that the school system was wrong , " she says now , " and that things must change at the roots . "
back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .
the hauptschule is perceived by many as a place for the " losers " in society , those who will probably end up on social welfare .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neukoelln district still has the image of a troubled immigrant neighborhood at the ruetli school , about 95 percent of the students have an immigrant background .
their parents mostly come from turkey , the balkans and arab countries .
campus ruetli after a recent reform to the school system in berlin , the ruetli school is now a gemeinschaftsschule or community school .
this new type of school has been introduced to give students a better chance of earning the qualifications they need to get jobs or even a university degree .
behind the hundred-year-old ruetli school building , bulldozers are currently levelling a 41,000 square meter -lrb- 10 acres -rrb- construction site , tearing down decrepit buildings and shacks in what used to be a small inner-city industrial area .
they 're making way for campus ruetli - a project which school authorities describe as a model of modern-type schooling that is meant to provide state-of-the-art education for children from pre-school age right up to graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work is changing both the face of the district and people 's minds once it has been completed , campus ruetli will include childcare facilities , a sports ground and a gym , and will incorporate three other schools that already exist close by .
dr. eric denton , an american who teaches english at the ruetli school , said it 's not just the teachers who " dream big " as a result of the new project : " politicians have realized that the way to save a community is to work through the school , to give the school a foundation and the resources it needs , " he says .
" the community gets an identity through the school , and the school benefits and prospers . "
the german government as well as the berlin city administration have earmarked a total of 25 million euros for the project , which is to be completed over the next few years .
changing attitudes about one million euros of this funding have already been spent on renovating the interior of the building .
as al-sadi was guiding me around , he was beaming with pride as he opened the doors to the school 's cafeteria and dining room , all gleaming in bright colors now .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private sponsors have contributed to giving classrooms a facelift al-sadi said that the students had come to cherish the facelift , and added that evidence of this was the fact that vandalism had virtually stopped at the school .
however , there are quite a few people at the ruetli school who believe that al-sadi himself has contributed significantly to the change in attitudes and behaviour .
the missing link the palestinian grew up in the irbid refugee camp in jordan , and came to germany in the 1970s to study economics .
" we had lost everything ; our home , our property and the transport business my father had owned in the town of nazareth .
i still remember him saying that only education could save us now , and that it was only through our brains that we could improve our situation . "
in 2006 - just two weeks after the outburst of violence at the ruetli school - al-sadi attended a meeting of parents and teachers , which , he said , " was marked by a general lack of understanding and interest on the part of the parents . "
but , he went on , " i stood up to tell them about my father 's message to me .
i was speaking in arabic , and the women started crying as they became aware of their own situation and that of their children .
they asked me what to do , and i told them : ' i will look after your children , but you must promise that you come to the school when there 's a problem to solve . " '
since then al-sadi has been working at the school as one of two " intercultural mediators . "
he 's sold the building company he owned to devote his time entirely to a job that he said " keeps him busy often from the morning until the late evening . "
over the past four years , " uncle sadi " has won the trust of both the students and their parents .
but he has also re-established communication between them and the teaching staff .
and he often has to mediate within the families themselves , notably when it comes to resolving generational problems arising from traditional beliefs and customs .
he describes what he 's doing as working on " the future of germany as a whole . "
he has clear views on social policy : " germans do n't have enough children anymore .
arab families have eight , nine or even ten children .
they will stay here , and they must be given a chance to make a living in this society . "
campus of hope the ruetli school students have come to see al-sadi as a role model for what can be achieved through education and hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a blackboard welcoming visitors in three languages has n't been vandalized for four years they 've embraced the school as theirs , and they 've learned to value what the teachers are doing for them .
" they spend a lot of time so that we can get a job , " said 16-year-old ahmed iraque .
and ezgi güler , a 10th grader from turkey , added that public perception that the school was only for " losers " was entirely wrong .
" this school gives me a chance for my future , more than the school i attended before .
when i leave , i know that i will cry . "
zahra riaz , who is also in the 10th grade , even believes that the multicultural make-up of the school gives the students an advantage over classes made up of only native germans .
" we learn more about different cultures , " she says .
" yes , i think i have a good future here , because i try to be a good student . "
meanwhile , the number of ruetli students going on to an academic education has more than doubled over the past four years .
arabic language classes have been introduced , making it easier for most of the students to learn the second foreign language they need to qualify for university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruetli students are working together for their school and for a better future many students now even spend parts of their leisure time at school , doing their homework or learning in after-school classes .
parents can enjoy a cup of coffee , or discuss problems with teachers at a parents ' center in the school building .
and claudia heckmann , the former english and german teacher , has become the school 's principal .
she said that the bad headlines four years ago prompted teachers , authorities , students and parents to " move closer together " to become a team that had developed a new spirit .
" nevertheless there are still huge difficulties , " she says , " and sometimes we think it 's too much , and too many problems need to be resolved .
but then , there is this vision that we can change things if we focus on the strength of people , and not always on what is not working . "

if all goes according to the church 's plan , the synod will elect schneider for another five years in november .
schneider also reiterated his interest in taking over the role .
" i am open to answering positively , " he said , when asked whether he would accept the role if offered .

this came despite anni friesinger-postma 's fall in the semi-finals . the three-woman speed skating team claimed germany 's tenth gold medal on saturday evening following a stunning final race against the japanese team .
stephanie beckert , daniela anschuetz-thoms and katrin mattscherodt crossed the finish line only 0.02 seconds ahead of the japanese , who dominated the first few laps of the three-kilometer race .
the japanese team , comprising masako hozumi , maki tabata and nao kodaira , got off to an immense start and soon built up a lead of over 1.7 seconds in the first part of the race - a small eternity on a speed skating rink .
the germans steadily hauled back the advantage , but were still around three quarters of a second behind going into the final lap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friesinger-postma threw her skate forward as she scrambled across the line it was only on the home straight that the medal positions were decided , and it took a photo finish to be ensure germany 's victory .
semi-final stumble the victory was all the more remarkable because the fourth member of the german team , anni friesinger-postma , fell on the last corner of the semi-final against the united states , after a nightmarish final lap .
the 16-time world champion slid over the finish line on her belly and pounded the ice in despair , convinced that she had ruined her team 's chances of a medal .
thirty seconds later , one could only guess at friesinger-postma 's emotions as she looked up at the score board and realized she had still done enough to finish 0.23 seconds ahead of the us team .
following this nerve-racking finish , team coach markus eicher decided not to risk the exhausted friesinger-postma in the final , which took place only an hour and a half later .
in that race , stephanie beckert 's extraordinary final drive proved the decisive factor .
friesinger-postma paid tribute to beckert 's explosive performance in the final , in which she led the last two laps .
" that was a rollercoaster for the emotions , " she said .
" she was our steam engine .
she pulled our girls through those two laps . "
beckert has already won two silver medals in the individual speed skating events .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 28.02.2010 berlin 's ruetli school - from a center of violence to a campus of hope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazing things are happening behind the walls of the old ruetli school building the ruetli school in berlin made headlines in 2006 when teachers surrendered to a culture of violence and disrespect .
some four years later , deutsche welle 's uwe hessler has discovered new hope there . when i was shown around the ruetli school in the tough berlin district of neukoelln by dr. ahmad al-sadi , i felt as if i was accompanying a movie celebrity on a walk downtown .
the 61-year-old former palestinian refugee was wearing a leather jacket and a hat that made him look more like a weather-beaten cowboy than a member of a school 's staff .
but everywhere we went in the school on this tuesday morning in february , he was greeted with shining eyes by youngsters who soon crowded around us , eager to shake hands and get a few words of advice or comfort from the man they lovingly call " uncle sadi . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. ahmad al-sadi has won the trust and respect of the ruetli students al-sadi belongs to a team of teachers , social workers , politicians and community members who are struggling to change the image of a school which was once a symbol of a failing school system that had little to offer - especially to young immigrants .
school of terror in february 2006 , a bunch of rowdy ruetli school students attacked reporters , shouting their disdain for mainstream german society as the cameras rolled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , police moved in at the ruetli school to de-escalate the conflict the violence erupted after the school 's teachers had written an open letter to the school authorities in the neukoelln city district .
" in many classes , " the letter said , " the behavior of students is marked by a total rejection of education and by attitudes which are deeply inhuman .
teachers can only enter classrooms with their mobile phones on to be able to call for help quickly .
we are desperate . "
claudia heckmann was a teacher of english and german at the time .
she said the teaching staff did n't want their protest to lead to a closure of the school .
" we wanted to say that the school system was wrong , " she says now , " and that things must change at the roots . "
back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .
the hauptschule is perceived by many as a place for the " losers " in society , those who will probably end up on social welfare .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neukoelln district still has the image of a troubled immigrant neighborhood at the ruetli school , about 95 percent of the students have an immigrant background .

campus ruetli after a recent reform to the school system in berlin , the ruetli school is now a gemeinschaftsschule or community school .
this new type of school has been introduced to give students a better chance of earning the qualifications they need to get jobs or even a university degree .

dr. eric denton , an american who teaches english at the ruetli school , said it 's not just the teachers who " dream big " as a result of the new project : " politicians have realized that the way to save a community is to work through the school , to give the school a foundation and the resources it needs , " he says .
" the community gets an identity through the school , and the school benefits and prospers . "

in 2006 - just two weeks after the outburst of violence at the ruetli school - al-sadi attended a meeting of parents and teachers , which , he said , " was marked by a general lack of understanding and interest on the part of the parents . "

i was speaking in arabic , and the women started crying as they became aware of their own situation and that of their children .

some four years later , deutsche welle 's uwe hessler has discovered new hope there . when i was shown around the ruetli school in the tough berlin district of neukoelln by dr. ahmad al-sadi , i felt as if i was accompanying a movie celebrity on a walk downtown .
the 61-year-old former palestinian refugee was wearing a leather jacket and a hat that made him look more like a weather-beaten cowboy than a member of a school 's staff .
but everywhere we went in the school on this tuesday morning in february , he was greeted with shining eyes by youngsters who soon crowded around us , eager to shake hands and get a few words of advice or comfort from the man they lovingly call " uncle sadi . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. ahmad al-sadi has won the trust and respect of the ruetli students al-sadi belongs to a team of teachers , social workers , politicians and community members who are struggling to change the image of a school which was once a symbol of a failing school system that had little to offer - especially to young immigrants .
school of terror in february 2006 , a bunch of rowdy ruetli school students attacked reporters , shouting their disdain for mainstream german society as the cameras rolled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , police moved in at the ruetli school to de-escalate the conflict the violence erupted after the school 's teachers had written an open letter to the school authorities in the neukoelln city district .
" in many classes , " the letter said , " the behavior of students is marked by a total rejection of education and by attitudes which are deeply inhuman .
teachers can only enter classrooms with their mobile phones on to be able to call for help quickly .
we are desperate . "
claudia heckmann was a teacher of english and german at the time .
she said the teaching staff did n't want their protest to lead to a closure of the school .
" we wanted to say that the school system was wrong , " she says now , " and that things must change at the roots . "
back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .
the hauptschule is perceived by many as a place for the " losers " in society , those who will probably end up on social welfare .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neukoelln district still has the image of a troubled immigrant neighborhood at the ruetli school , about 95 percent of the students have an immigrant background .

some four years later , deutsche welle 's uwe hessler has discovered new hope there . when i was shown around the ruetli school in the tough berlin district of neukoelln by dr. ahmad al-sadi , i felt as if i was accompanying a movie celebrity on a walk downtown .
the 61-year-old former palestinian refugee was wearing a leather jacket and a hat that made him look more like a weather-beaten cowboy than a member of a school 's staff .
but everywhere we went in the school on this tuesday morning in february , he was greeted with shining eyes by youngsters who soon crowded around us , eager to shake hands and get a few words of advice or comfort from the man they lovingly call " uncle sadi . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. ahmad al-sadi has won the trust and respect of the ruetli students al-sadi belongs to a team of teachers , social workers , politicians and community members who are struggling to change the image of a school which was once a symbol of a failing school system that had little to offer - especially to young immigrants .
school of terror in february 2006 , a bunch of rowdy ruetli school students attacked reporters , shouting their disdain for mainstream german society as the cameras rolled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , police moved in at the ruetli school to de-escalate the conflict the violence erupted after the school 's teachers had written an open letter to the school authorities in the neukoelln city district .
" in many classes , " the letter said , " the behavior of students is marked by a total rejection of education and by attitudes which are deeply inhuman .
teachers can only enter classrooms with their mobile phones on to be able to call for help quickly .
we are desperate . "
claudia heckmann was a teacher of english and german at the time .
she said the teaching staff did n't want their protest to lead to a closure of the school .
" we wanted to say that the school system was wrong , " she says now , " and that things must change at the roots . "
back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .
the hauptschule is perceived by many as a place for the " losers " in society , those who will probably end up on social welfare .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neukoelln district still has the image of a troubled immigrant neighborhood at the ruetli school , about 95 percent of the students have an immigrant background .
their parents mostly come from turkey , the balkans and arab countries .
campus ruetli after a recent reform to the school system in berlin , the ruetli school is now a gemeinschaftsschule or community school .
this new type of school has been introduced to give students a better chance of earning the qualifications they need to get jobs or even a university degree .
behind the hundred-year-old ruetli school building , bulldozers are currently levelling a 41,000 square meter -lrb- 10 acres -rrb- construction site , tearing down decrepit buildings and shacks in what used to be a small inner-city industrial area .
they 're making way for campus ruetli - a project which school authorities describe as a model of modern-type schooling that is meant to provide state-of-the-art education for children from pre-school age right up to graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work is changing both the face of the district and people 's minds once it has been completed , campus ruetli will include childcare facilities , a sports ground and a gym , and will incorporate three other schools that already exist close by .
dr. eric denton , an american who teaches english at the ruetli school , said it 's not just the teachers who " dream big " as a result of the new project : " politicians have realized that the way to save a community is to work through the school , to give the school a foundation and the resources it needs , " he says .
" the community gets an identity through the school , and the school benefits and prospers . "
the german government as well as the berlin city administration have earmarked a total of 25 million euros for the project , which is to be completed over the next few years .

" we had lost everything ; our home , our property and the transport business my father had owned in the town of nazareth .
i still remember him saying that only education could save us now , and that it was only through our brains that we could improve our situation . "
in 2006 - just two weeks after the outburst of violence at the ruetli school - al-sadi attended a meeting of parents and teachers , which , he said , " was marked by a general lack of understanding and interest on the part of the parents . "
but , he went on , " i stood up to tell them about my father 's message to me .
i was speaking in arabic , and the women started crying as they became aware of their own situation and that of their children .
they asked me what to do , and i told them : ' i will look after your children , but you must promise that you come to the school when there 's a problem to solve . " '
since then al-sadi has been working at the school as one of two " intercultural mediators . "
he 's sold the building company he owned to devote his time entirely to a job that he said " keeps him busy often from the morning until the late evening . "
over the past four years , " uncle sadi " has won the trust of both the students and their parents .

and he often has to mediate within the families themselves , notably when it comes to resolving generational problems arising from traditional beliefs and customs .

he has clear views on social policy : " germans do n't have enough children anymore .

" this school gives me a chance for my future , more than the school i attended before .

zahra riaz , who is also in the 10th grade , even believes that the multicultural make-up of the school gives the students an advantage over classes made up of only native germans .
" we learn more about different cultures , " she says .
" yes , i think i have a good future here , because i try to be a good student . "
meanwhile , the number of ruetli students going on to an academic education has more than doubled over the past four years .
arabic language classes have been introduced , making it easier for most of the students to learn the second foreign language they need to qualify for university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruetli students are working together for their school and for a better future many students now even spend parts of their leisure time at school , doing their homework or learning in after-school classes .

and claudia heckmann , the former english and german teacher , has become the school 's principal .
she said that the bad headlines four years ago prompted teachers , authorities , students and parents to " move closer together " to become a team that had developed a new spirit .
" nevertheless there are still huge difficulties , " she says , " and sometimes we think it 's too much , and too many problems need to be resolved .
but then , there is this vision that we can change things if we focus on the strength of people , and not always on what is not working . "

some four years later , deutsche welle 's uwe hessler has discovered new hope there . when i was shown around the ruetli school in the tough berlin district of neukoelln by dr. ahmad al-sadi , i felt as if i was accompanying a movie celebrity on a walk downtown .
the 61-year-old former palestinian refugee was wearing a leather jacket and a hat that made him look more like a weather-beaten cowboy than a member of a school 's staff .
but everywhere we went in the school on this tuesday morning in february , he was greeted with shining eyes by youngsters who soon crowded around us , eager to shake hands and get a few words of advice or comfort from the man they lovingly call " uncle sadi . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. ahmad al-sadi has won the trust and respect of the ruetli students al-sadi belongs to a team of teachers , social workers , politicians and community members who are struggling to change the image of a school which was once a symbol of a failing school system that had little to offer - especially to young immigrants .
school of terror in february 2006 , a bunch of rowdy ruetli school students attacked reporters , shouting their disdain for mainstream german society as the cameras rolled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , police moved in at the ruetli school to de-escalate the conflict the violence erupted after the school 's teachers had written an open letter to the school authorities in the neukoelln city district .
" in many classes , " the letter said , " the behavior of students is marked by a total rejection of education and by attitudes which are deeply inhuman .
teachers can only enter classrooms with their mobile phones on to be able to call for help quickly .
we are desperate . "
claudia heckmann was a teacher of english and german at the time .
she said the teaching staff did n't want their protest to lead to a closure of the school .
" we wanted to say that the school system was wrong , " she says now , " and that things must change at the roots . "
back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .
the hauptschule is perceived by many as a place for the " losers " in society , those who will probably end up on social welfare .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neukoelln district still has the image of a troubled immigrant neighborhood at the ruetli school , about 95 percent of the students have an immigrant background .
their parents mostly come from turkey , the balkans and arab countries .
campus ruetli after a recent reform to the school system in berlin , the ruetli school is now a gemeinschaftsschule or community school .
this new type of school has been introduced to give students a better chance of earning the qualifications they need to get jobs or even a university degree .
behind the hundred-year-old ruetli school building , bulldozers are currently levelling a 41,000 square meter -lrb- 10 acres -rrb- construction site , tearing down decrepit buildings and shacks in what used to be a small inner-city industrial area .
they 're making way for campus ruetli - a project which school authorities describe as a model of modern-type schooling that is meant to provide state-of-the-art education for children from pre-school age right up to graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work is changing both the face of the district and people 's minds once it has been completed , campus ruetli will include childcare facilities , a sports ground and a gym , and will incorporate three other schools that already exist close by .
dr. eric denton , an american who teaches english at the ruetli school , said it 's not just the teachers who " dream big " as a result of the new project : " politicians have realized that the way to save a community is to work through the school , to give the school a foundation and the resources it needs , " he says .
" the community gets an identity through the school , and the school benefits and prospers . "
the german government as well as the berlin city administration have earmarked a total of 25 million euros for the project , which is to be completed over the next few years .
changing attitudes about one million euros of this funding have already been spent on renovating the interior of the building .
as al-sadi was guiding me around , he was beaming with pride as he opened the doors to the school 's cafeteria and dining room , all gleaming in bright colors now .
the classrooms which he most enjoys showing off , however , are those where natural sciences are taught , which are equipped with the latest science equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private sponsors have contributed to giving classrooms a facelift al-sadi said that the students had come to cherish the facelift , and added that evidence of this was the fact that vandalism had virtually stopped at the school .
however , there are quite a few people at the ruetli school who believe that al-sadi himself has contributed significantly to the change in attitudes and behaviour .
the missing link the palestinian grew up in the irbid refugee camp in jordan , and came to germany in the 1970s to study economics .
" we had lost everything ; our home , our property and the transport business my father had owned in the town of nazareth .
i still remember him saying that only education could save us now , and that it was only through our brains that we could improve our situation . "
in 2006 - just two weeks after the outburst of violence at the ruetli school - al-sadi attended a meeting of parents and teachers , which , he said , " was marked by a general lack of understanding and interest on the part of the parents . "
but , he went on , " i stood up to tell them about my father 's message to me .
i was speaking in arabic , and the women started crying as they became aware of their own situation and that of their children .
they asked me what to do , and i told them : ' i will look after your children , but you must promise that you come to the school when there 's a problem to solve . " '
since then al-sadi has been working at the school as one of two " intercultural mediators . "
he 's sold the building company he owned to devote his time entirely to a job that he said " keeps him busy often from the morning until the late evening . "
over the past four years , " uncle sadi " has won the trust of both the students and their parents .
but he has also re-established communication between them and the teaching staff .
and he often has to mediate within the families themselves , notably when it comes to resolving generational problems arising from traditional beliefs and customs .
he describes what he 's doing as working on " the future of germany as a whole . "
he has clear views on social policy : " germans do n't have enough children anymore .
arab families have eight , nine or even ten children .
they will stay here , and they must be given a chance to make a living in this society . "
campus of hope the ruetli school students have come to see al-sadi as a role model for what can be achieved through education and hard work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 28.02.2010 iran makes inroads in parts of africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is trying to spread its influence in africa iran has taken an interest in improving relations with african countries in recent years by investing in senegal , nigeria , and sudan .
how have israel and the european union responded to its progress in africa ? looking back at the last decade , iran has improved relations with african countries by turning to them for investment and trade as it has become more isolated by the west .
in africa , iran has engaged in economic and development projects in a number of countries : in senegal where khodro , iran 's largest car manufacturer , opened an assembly line in 2007 ; nigeria with which it has agreed to share nuclear technology for the production of electricity ; and it enjoys good relations with south africa -lrb- a regional leader -rrb- where its support of the anc during the apartheid era has meant that south africa has remained a true friend .
however , nowhere is the success of iran ’ s investment quite as clear as in sudan .
" iran has been successful in strengthening ties with sudan because the two countries have an ideological link .
they are standing up against the west and imperialism , " sanam vakil , an expert on iran at the johns hopkins university in washington dc , told deutsche welle .
why africa matters to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese president , abdoulaye wade , and iranian president , mahmoud ahmadinejad in dakar as a result of its isolation from the world -lrb- particularly the west -rrb- , iran has had to turn to africa in an effort to gain more relevance in global affairs .
" by strengthening its relationship with african countries , iran is trying to overcome its de facto isolation , " walter posch , a researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , told deutsche welle .
vakil agrees : " iran is always trying to expand its areas of diplomatic and economic influence to counterbalance against its own isolation , " she said .
in spite of all its efforts , iran 's success at extending its influence in africa remains unclear , " perhaps with the exception of sudan where there are iranian cars , " posch said .
with a reduction of military aid from china and russia , sudan two years ago turned to iran for help and signed a bilateral agreement that includes military cooperation with the country .
at a meeting late last year with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , his sudanese counterpart , deng alor , openly voiced his country 's support for iran 's nuclear ambitions .
israeli concerns iran 's nuclear ambitions are a threat to stability in the middle east , and naturally its progress in africa is being closely watched by israel .
in addition , israel wants to counterbalance iranian and islamic influence in africa , especially in the horn of africa which has a coastline with the red sea - a gateway to the suez canal .
therefore , israel has tried to establish friendly ties with the only non-islamic county in the horn of africa , ethiopia , which has also used israeli military aid to counter islamic militants in the southeast region which borders somalia .

how have israel and the european union responded to its progress in africa ? looking back at the last decade , iran has improved relations with african countries by turning to them for investment and trade as it has become more isolated by the west .
in africa , iran has engaged in economic and development projects in a number of countries : in senegal where khodro , iran 's largest car manufacturer , opened an assembly line in 2007 ; nigeria with which it has agreed to share nuclear technology for the production of electricity ; and it enjoys good relations with south africa -lrb- a regional leader -rrb- where its support of the anc during the apartheid era has meant that south africa has remained a true friend .
however , nowhere is the success of iran ’ s investment quite as clear as in sudan .
" iran has been successful in strengthening ties with sudan because the two countries have an ideological link .
they are standing up against the west and imperialism , " sanam vakil , an expert on iran at the johns hopkins university in washington dc , told deutsche welle .
why africa matters to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese president , abdoulaye wade , and iranian president , mahmoud ahmadinejad in dakar as a result of its isolation from the world -lrb- particularly the west -rrb- , iran has had to turn to africa in an effort to gain more relevance in global affairs .
" by strengthening its relationship with african countries , iran is trying to overcome its de facto isolation , " walter posch , a researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , told deutsche welle .
vakil agrees : " iran is always trying to expand its areas of diplomatic and economic influence to counterbalance against its own isolation , " she said .
in spite of all its efforts , iran 's success at extending its influence in africa remains unclear , " perhaps with the exception of sudan where there are iranian cars , " posch said .
with a reduction of military aid from china and russia , sudan two years ago turned to iran for help and signed a bilateral agreement that includes military cooperation with the country .
at a meeting late last year with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , his sudanese counterpart , deng alor , openly voiced his country 's support for iran 's nuclear ambitions .
israeli concerns iran 's nuclear ambitions are a threat to stability in the middle east , and naturally its progress in africa is being closely watched by israel .
in addition , israel wants to counterbalance iranian and islamic influence in africa , especially in the horn of africa which has a coastline with the red sea - a gateway to the suez canal .
therefore , israel has tried to establish friendly ties with the only non-islamic county in the horn of africa , ethiopia , which has also used israeli military aid to counter islamic militants in the southeast region which borders somalia .

how have israel and the european union responded to its progress in africa ? looking back at the last decade , iran has improved relations with african countries by turning to them for investment and trade as it has become more isolated by the west .
in africa , iran has engaged in economic and development projects in a number of countries : in senegal where khodro , iran 's largest car manufacturer , opened an assembly line in 2007 ; nigeria with which it has agreed to share nuclear technology for the production of electricity ; and it enjoys good relations with south africa -lrb- a regional leader -rrb- where its support of the anc during the apartheid era has meant that south africa has remained a true friend .
however , nowhere is the success of iran ’ s investment quite as clear as in sudan .
" iran has been successful in strengthening ties with sudan because the two countries have an ideological link .
they are standing up against the west and imperialism , " sanam vakil , an expert on iran at the johns hopkins university in washington dc , told deutsche welle .
why africa matters to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese president , abdoulaye wade , and iranian president , mahmoud ahmadinejad in dakar as a result of its isolation from the world -lrb- particularly the west -rrb- , iran has had to turn to africa in an effort to gain more relevance in global affairs .
" by strengthening its relationship with african countries , iran is trying to overcome its de facto isolation , " walter posch , a researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , told deutsche welle .
vakil agrees : " iran is always trying to expand its areas of diplomatic and economic influence to counterbalance against its own isolation , " she said .
in spite of all its efforts , iran 's success at extending its influence in africa remains unclear , " perhaps with the exception of sudan where there are iranian cars , " posch said .
with a reduction of military aid from china and russia , sudan two years ago turned to iran for help and signed a bilateral agreement that includes military cooperation with the country .
at a meeting late last year with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , his sudanese counterpart , deng alor , openly voiced his country 's support for iran 's nuclear ambitions .
israeli concerns iran 's nuclear ambitions are a threat to stability in the middle east , and naturally its progress in africa is being closely watched by israel .
in addition , israel wants to counterbalance iranian and islamic influence in africa , especially in the horn of africa which has a coastline with the red sea - a gateway to the suez canal .
therefore , israel has tried to establish friendly ties with the only non-islamic county in the horn of africa , ethiopia , which has also used israeli military aid to counter islamic militants in the southeast region which borders somalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethiopia has been using military aid from israel to arm itself against somali militias israel sees iran ’ s inroads in africa -lrb- especially in sudan -rrb- as a threat to its ability to garner african support at the un , and also as a threat to regional stability in the horn of africa because iran ’ s advances contribute to the growth of islam in the region .
in an attempt to counterbalance that perceived threat , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman visited ethiopia , kenya , uganda , ghana , and nigeria in september 2009 , and pledged israel ’ s support for these countries by promising development and economic aid .
europe turns a blind eye by and large , iran 's efforts at establishing better relations with african countries have remained largely ignored by the eu .
javier perez , the political advisor to the eu special representative for sudan told deutsche welle that " sudan is a high priority of the eu foreign policy in africa , but the interest of iran in africa is not being followed as of yet . "
according to posch , europe 's current stance may be due to the fact that iran 's trade and economic cooperation with africa pales in comparison to that of other countries like china , the us , and some european nations .
neverthless , johns hopkins university researcher vakil feels that " the europeans should be watching this because it is happening in europe 's backdoor . "

why africa matters to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese president , abdoulaye wade , and iranian president , mahmoud ahmadinejad in dakar as a result of its isolation from the world -lrb- particularly the west -rrb- , iran has had to turn to africa in an effort to gain more relevance in global affairs .
" by strengthening its relationship with african countries , iran is trying to overcome its de facto isolation , " walter posch , a researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , told deutsche welle .
vakil agrees : " iran is always trying to expand its areas of diplomatic and economic influence to counterbalance against its own isolation , " she said .
in spite of all its efforts , iran 's success at extending its influence in africa remains unclear , " perhaps with the exception of sudan where there are iranian cars , " posch said .
with a reduction of military aid from china and russia , sudan two years ago turned to iran for help and signed a bilateral agreement that includes military cooperation with the country .
at a meeting late last year with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , his sudanese counterpart , deng alor , openly voiced his country 's support for iran 's nuclear ambitions .
israeli concerns iran 's nuclear ambitions are a threat to stability in the middle east , and naturally its progress in africa is being closely watched by israel .
in addition , israel wants to counterbalance iranian and islamic influence in africa , especially in the horn of africa which has a coastline with the red sea - a gateway to the suez canal .
therefore , israel has tried to establish friendly ties with the only non-islamic county in the horn of africa , ethiopia , which has also used israeli military aid to counter islamic militants in the southeast region which borders somalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethiopia has been using military aid from israel to arm itself against somali militias israel sees iran ’ s inroads in africa -lrb- especially in sudan -rrb- as a threat to its ability to garner african support at the un , and also as a threat to regional stability in the horn of africa because iran ’ s advances contribute to the growth of islam in the region .
in an attempt to counterbalance that perceived threat , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman visited ethiopia , kenya , uganda , ghana , and nigeria in september 2009 , and pledged israel ’ s support for these countries by promising development and economic aid .
europe turns a blind eye by and large , iran 's efforts at establishing better relations with african countries have remained largely ignored by the eu .
javier perez , the political advisor to the eu special representative for sudan told deutsche welle that " sudan is a high priority of the eu foreign policy in africa , but the interest of iran in africa is not being followed as of yet . "
according to posch , europe 's current stance may be due to the fact that iran 's trade and economic cooperation with africa pales in comparison to that of other countries like china , the us , and some european nations .
neverthless , johns hopkins university researcher vakil feels that " the europeans should be watching this because it is happening in europe 's backdoor . "

some four years later , deutsche welle 's uwe hessler has discovered new hope there . when i was shown around the ruetli school in the tough berlin district of neukoelln by dr. ahmad al-sadi , i felt as if i was accompanying a movie celebrity on a walk downtown .
the 61-year-old former palestinian refugee was wearing a leather jacket and a hat that made him look more like a weather-beaten cowboy than a member of a school 's staff .
but everywhere we went in the school on this tuesday morning in february , he was greeted with shining eyes by youngsters who soon crowded around us , eager to shake hands and get a few words of advice or comfort from the man they lovingly call " uncle sadi . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. ahmad al-sadi has won the trust and respect of the ruetli students al-sadi belongs to a team of teachers , social workers , politicians and community members who are struggling to change the image of a school which was once a symbol of a failing school system that had little to offer - especially to young immigrants .
school of terror in february 2006 , a bunch of rowdy ruetli school students attacked reporters , shouting their disdain for mainstream german society as the cameras rolled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , police moved in at the ruetli school to de-escalate the conflict the violence erupted after the school 's teachers had written an open letter to the school authorities in the neukoelln city district .
" in many classes , " the letter said , " the behavior of students is marked by a total rejection of education and by attitudes which are deeply inhuman .
teachers can only enter classrooms with their mobile phones on to be able to call for help quickly .
we are desperate . "
claudia heckmann was a teacher of english and german at the time .
she said the teaching staff did n't want their protest to lead to a closure of the school .
" we wanted to say that the school system was wrong , " she says now , " and that things must change at the roots . "
back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .
the hauptschule is perceived by many as a place for the " losers " in society , those who will probably end up on social welfare .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neukoelln district still has the image of a troubled immigrant neighborhood at the ruetli school , about 95 percent of the students have an immigrant background .
their parents mostly come from turkey , the balkans and arab countries .
campus ruetli after a recent reform to the school system in berlin , the ruetli school is now a gemeinschaftsschule or community school .
this new type of school has been introduced to give students a better chance of earning the qualifications they need to get jobs or even a university degree .
behind the hundred-year-old ruetli school building , bulldozers are currently levelling a 41,000 square meter -lrb- 10 acres -rrb- construction site , tearing down decrepit buildings and shacks in what used to be a small inner-city industrial area .
they 're making way for campus ruetli - a project which school authorities describe as a model of modern-type schooling that is meant to provide state-of-the-art education for children from pre-school age right up to graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work is changing both the face of the district and people 's minds once it has been completed , campus ruetli will include childcare facilities , a sports ground and a gym , and will incorporate three other schools that already exist close by .
dr. eric denton , an american who teaches english at the ruetli school , said it 's not just the teachers who " dream big " as a result of the new project : " politicians have realized that the way to save a community is to work through the school , to give the school a foundation and the resources it needs , " he says .
" the community gets an identity through the school , and the school benefits and prospers . "
the german government as well as the berlin city administration have earmarked a total of 25 million euros for the project , which is to be completed over the next few years .
changing attitudes about one million euros of this funding have already been spent on renovating the interior of the building .
as al-sadi was guiding me around , he was beaming with pride as he opened the doors to the school 's cafeteria and dining room , all gleaming in bright colors now .
the classrooms which he most enjoys showing off , however , are those where natural sciences are taught , which are equipped with the latest science equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private sponsors have contributed to giving classrooms a facelift al-sadi said that the students had come to cherish the facelift , and added that evidence of this was the fact that vandalism had virtually stopped at the school .
however , there are quite a few people at the ruetli school who believe that al-sadi himself has contributed significantly to the change in attitudes and behaviour .
the missing link the palestinian grew up in the irbid refugee camp in jordan , and came to germany in the 1970s to study economics .
" we had lost everything ; our home , our property and the transport business my father had owned in the town of nazareth .
i still remember him saying that only education could save us now , and that it was only through our brains that we could improve our situation . "
in 2006 - just two weeks after the outburst of violence at the ruetli school - al-sadi attended a meeting of parents and teachers , which , he said , " was marked by a general lack of understanding and interest on the part of the parents . "
but , he went on , " i stood up to tell them about my father 's message to me .
i was speaking in arabic , and the women started crying as they became aware of their own situation and that of their children .
they asked me what to do , and i told them : ' i will look after your children , but you must promise that you come to the school when there 's a problem to solve . " '
since then al-sadi has been working at the school as one of two " intercultural mediators . "
he 's sold the building company he owned to devote his time entirely to a job that he said " keeps him busy often from the morning until the late evening . "
over the past four years , " uncle sadi " has won the trust of both the students and their parents .
but he has also re-established communication between them and the teaching staff .
and he often has to mediate within the families themselves , notably when it comes to resolving generational problems arising from traditional beliefs and customs .
he describes what he 's doing as working on " the future of germany as a whole . "
he has clear views on social policy : " germans do n't have enough children anymore .
arab families have eight , nine or even ten children .
they will stay here , and they must be given a chance to make a living in this society . "
campus of hope the ruetli school students have come to see al-sadi as a role model for what can be achieved through education and hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a blackboard welcoming visitors in three languages has n't been vandalized for four years they 've embraced the school as theirs , and they 've learned to value what the teachers are doing for them .
" they spend a lot of time so that we can get a job , " said 16-year-old ahmed iraque .
and ezgi güler , a 10th grader from turkey , added that public perception that the school was only for " losers " was entirely wrong .
" this school gives me a chance for my future , more than the school i attended before .
when i leave , i know that i will cry . "
zahra riaz , who is also in the 10th grade , even believes that the multicultural make-up of the school gives the students an advantage over classes made up of only native germans .
" we learn more about different cultures , " she says .
" yes , i think i have a good future here , because i try to be a good student . "
meanwhile , the number of ruetli students going on to an academic education has more than doubled over the past four years .
arabic language classes have been introduced , making it easier for most of the students to learn the second foreign language they need to qualify for university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruetli students are working together for their school and for a better future many students now even spend parts of their leisure time at school , doing their homework or learning in after-school classes .
parents can enjoy a cup of coffee , or discuss problems with teachers at a parents ' center in the school building .
and claudia heckmann , the former english and german teacher , has become the school 's principal .
she said that the bad headlines four years ago prompted teachers , authorities , students and parents to " move closer together " to become a team that had developed a new spirit .
" nevertheless there are still huge difficulties , " she says , " and sometimes we think it 's too much , and too many problems need to be resolved .
but then , there is this vision that we can change things if we focus on the strength of people , and not always on what is not working . "

teachers can only enter classrooms with their mobile phones on to be able to call for help quickly .
we are desperate . "
claudia heckmann was a teacher of english and german at the time .
she said the teaching staff did n't want their protest to lead to a closure of the school .
" we wanted to say that the school system was wrong , " she says now , " and that things must change at the roots . "
back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .
the hauptschule is perceived by many as a place for the " losers " in society , those who will probably end up on social welfare .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neukoelln district still has the image of a troubled immigrant neighborhood at the ruetli school , about 95 percent of the students have an immigrant background .
their parents mostly come from turkey , the balkans and arab countries .
campus ruetli after a recent reform to the school system in berlin , the ruetli school is now a gemeinschaftsschule or community school .
this new type of school has been introduced to give students a better chance of earning the qualifications they need to get jobs or even a university degree .
behind the hundred-year-old ruetli school building , bulldozers are currently levelling a 41,000 square meter -lrb- 10 acres -rrb- construction site , tearing down decrepit buildings and shacks in what used to be a small inner-city industrial area .
they 're making way for campus ruetli - a project which school authorities describe as a model of modern-type schooling that is meant to provide state-of-the-art education for children from pre-school age right up to graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work is changing both the face of the district and people 's minds once it has been completed , campus ruetli will include childcare facilities , a sports ground and a gym , and will incorporate three other schools that already exist close by .
dr. eric denton , an american who teaches english at the ruetli school , said it 's not just the teachers who " dream big " as a result of the new project : " politicians have realized that the way to save a community is to work through the school , to give the school a foundation and the resources it needs , " he says .
" the community gets an identity through the school , and the school benefits and prospers . "
the german government as well as the berlin city administration have earmarked a total of 25 million euros for the project , which is to be completed over the next few years .
changing attitudes about one million euros of this funding have already been spent on renovating the interior of the building .
as al-sadi was guiding me around , he was beaming with pride as he opened the doors to the school 's cafeteria and dining room , all gleaming in bright colors now .
the classrooms which he most enjoys showing off , however , are those where natural sciences are taught , which are equipped with the latest science equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private sponsors have contributed to giving classrooms a facelift al-sadi said that the students had come to cherish the facelift , and added that evidence of this was the fact that vandalism had virtually stopped at the school .
however , there are quite a few people at the ruetli school who believe that al-sadi himself has contributed significantly to the change in attitudes and behaviour .
the missing link the palestinian grew up in the irbid refugee camp in jordan , and came to germany in the 1970s to study economics .
" we had lost everything ; our home , our property and the transport business my father had owned in the town of nazareth .
i still remember him saying that only education could save us now , and that it was only through our brains that we could improve our situation . "
in 2006 - just two weeks after the outburst of violence at the ruetli school - al-sadi attended a meeting of parents and teachers , which , he said , " was marked by a general lack of understanding and interest on the part of the parents . "
but , he went on , " i stood up to tell them about my father 's message to me .
i was speaking in arabic , and the women started crying as they became aware of their own situation and that of their children .
they asked me what to do , and i told them : ' i will look after your children , but you must promise that you come to the school when there 's a problem to solve . " '
since then al-sadi has been working at the school as one of two " intercultural mediators . "
he 's sold the building company he owned to devote his time entirely to a job that he said " keeps him busy often from the morning until the late evening . "
over the past four years , " uncle sadi " has won the trust of both the students and their parents .
but he has also re-established communication between them and the teaching staff .
and he often has to mediate within the families themselves , notably when it comes to resolving generational problems arising from traditional beliefs and customs .
he describes what he 's doing as working on " the future of germany as a whole . "
he has clear views on social policy : " germans do n't have enough children anymore .
arab families have eight , nine or even ten children .
they will stay here , and they must be given a chance to make a living in this society . "
campus of hope the ruetli school students have come to see al-sadi as a role model for what can be achieved through education and hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a blackboard welcoming visitors in three languages has n't been vandalized for four years they 've embraced the school as theirs , and they 've learned to value what the teachers are doing for them .
" they spend a lot of time so that we can get a job , " said 16-year-old ahmed iraque .
and ezgi güler , a 10th grader from turkey , added that public perception that the school was only for " losers " was entirely wrong .
" this school gives me a chance for my future , more than the school i attended before .
when i leave , i know that i will cry . "
zahra riaz , who is also in the 10th grade , even believes that the multicultural make-up of the school gives the students an advantage over classes made up of only native germans .
" we learn more about different cultures , " she says .
" yes , i think i have a good future here , because i try to be a good student . "
meanwhile , the number of ruetli students going on to an academic education has more than doubled over the past four years .
arabic language classes have been introduced , making it easier for most of the students to learn the second foreign language they need to qualify for university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruetli students are working together for their school and for a better future many students now even spend parts of their leisure time at school , doing their homework or learning in after-school classes .
parents can enjoy a cup of coffee , or discuss problems with teachers at a parents ' center in the school building .
and claudia heckmann , the former english and german teacher , has become the school 's principal .
she said that the bad headlines four years ago prompted teachers , authorities , students and parents to " move closer together " to become a team that had developed a new spirit .
" nevertheless there are still huge difficulties , " she says , " and sometimes we think it 's too much , and too many problems need to be resolved .
but then , there is this vision that we can change things if we focus on the strength of people , and not always on what is not working . "

how have israel and the european union responded to its progress in africa ? looking back at the last decade , iran has improved relations with african countries by turning to them for investment and trade as it has become more isolated by the west .
in africa , iran has engaged in economic and development projects in a number of countries : in senegal where khodro , iran 's largest car manufacturer , opened an assembly line in 2007 ; nigeria with which it has agreed to share nuclear technology for the production of electricity ; and it enjoys good relations with south africa -lrb- a regional leader -rrb- where its support of the anc during the apartheid era has meant that south africa has remained a true friend .
however , nowhere is the success of iran ’ s investment quite as clear as in sudan .
" iran has been successful in strengthening ties with sudan because the two countries have an ideological link .
they are standing up against the west and imperialism , " sanam vakil , an expert on iran at the johns hopkins university in washington dc , told deutsche welle .
why africa matters to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese president , abdoulaye wade , and iranian president , mahmoud ahmadinejad in dakar as a result of its isolation from the world -lrb- particularly the west -rrb- , iran has had to turn to africa in an effort to gain more relevance in global affairs .
" by strengthening its relationship with african countries , iran is trying to overcome its de facto isolation , " walter posch , a researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , told deutsche welle .
vakil agrees : " iran is always trying to expand its areas of diplomatic and economic influence to counterbalance against its own isolation , " she said .
in spite of all its efforts , iran 's success at extending its influence in africa remains unclear , " perhaps with the exception of sudan where there are iranian cars , " posch said .
with a reduction of military aid from china and russia , sudan two years ago turned to iran for help and signed a bilateral agreement that includes military cooperation with the country .
at a meeting late last year with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , his sudanese counterpart , deng alor , openly voiced his country 's support for iran 's nuclear ambitions .
israeli concerns iran 's nuclear ambitions are a threat to stability in the middle east , and naturally its progress in africa is being closely watched by israel .
in addition , israel wants to counterbalance iranian and islamic influence in africa , especially in the horn of africa which has a coastline with the red sea - a gateway to the suez canal .
therefore , israel has tried to establish friendly ties with the only non-islamic county in the horn of africa , ethiopia , which has also used israeli military aid to counter islamic militants in the southeast region which borders somalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethiopia has been using military aid from israel to arm itself against somali militias israel sees iran ’ s inroads in africa -lrb- especially in sudan -rrb- as a threat to its ability to garner african support at the un , and also as a threat to regional stability in the horn of africa because iran ’ s advances contribute to the growth of islam in the region .
in an attempt to counterbalance that perceived threat , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman visited ethiopia , kenya , uganda , ghana , and nigeria in september 2009 , and pledged israel ’ s support for these countries by promising development and economic aid .
europe turns a blind eye by and large , iran 's efforts at establishing better relations with african countries have remained largely ignored by the eu .
javier perez , the political advisor to the eu special representative for sudan told deutsche welle that " sudan is a high priority of the eu foreign policy in africa , but the interest of iran in africa is not being followed as of yet . "
according to posch , europe 's current stance may be due to the fact that iran 's trade and economic cooperation with africa pales in comparison to that of other countries like china , the us , and some european nations .
neverthless , johns hopkins university researcher vakil feels that " the europeans should be watching this because it is happening in europe 's backdoor . "

some four years later , deutsche welle 's uwe hessler has discovered new hope there . when i was shown around the ruetli school in the tough berlin district of neukoelln by dr. ahmad al-sadi , i felt as if i was accompanying a movie celebrity on a walk downtown .
the 61-year-old former palestinian refugee was wearing a leather jacket and a hat that made him look more like a weather-beaten cowboy than a member of a school 's staff .
but everywhere we went in the school on this tuesday morning in february , he was greeted with shining eyes by youngsters who soon crowded around us , eager to shake hands and get a few words of advice or comfort from the man they lovingly call " uncle sadi . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. ahmad al-sadi has won the trust and respect of the ruetli students al-sadi belongs to a team of teachers , social workers , politicians and community members who are struggling to change the image of a school which was once a symbol of a failing school system that had little to offer - especially to young immigrants .
school of terror in february 2006 , a bunch of rowdy ruetli school students attacked reporters , shouting their disdain for mainstream german society as the cameras rolled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , police moved in at the ruetli school to de-escalate the conflict the violence erupted after the school 's teachers had written an open letter to the school authorities in the neukoelln city district .
" in many classes , " the letter said , " the behavior of students is marked by a total rejection of education and by attitudes which are deeply inhuman .
teachers can only enter classrooms with their mobile phones on to be able to call for help quickly .
we are desperate . "
claudia heckmann was a teacher of english and german at the time .
she said the teaching staff did n't want their protest to lead to a closure of the school .
" we wanted to say that the school system was wrong , " she says now , " and that things must change at the roots . "
back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .
the hauptschule is perceived by many as a place for the " losers " in society , those who will probably end up on social welfare .

" we had lost everything ; our home , our property and the transport business my father had owned in the town of nazareth .
i still remember him saying that only education could save us now , and that it was only through our brains that we could improve our situation . "
in 2006 - just two weeks after the outburst of violence at the ruetli school - al-sadi attended a meeting of parents and teachers , which , he said , " was marked by a general lack of understanding and interest on the part of the parents . "
but , he went on , " i stood up to tell them about my father 's message to me .
i was speaking in arabic , and the women started crying as they became aware of their own situation and that of their children .
they asked me what to do , and i told them : ' i will look after your children , but you must promise that you come to the school when there 's a problem to solve . " '
since then al-sadi has been working at the school as one of two " intercultural mediators . "
he 's sold the building company he owned to devote his time entirely to a job that he said " keeps him busy often from the morning until the late evening . "
over the past four years , " uncle sadi " has won the trust of both the students and their parents .
but he has also re-established communication between them and the teaching staff .
and he often has to mediate within the families themselves , notably when it comes to resolving generational problems arising from traditional beliefs and customs .
he describes what he 's doing as working on " the future of germany as a whole . "
he has clear views on social policy : " germans do n't have enough children anymore .
arab families have eight , nine or even ten children .
they will stay here , and they must be given a chance to make a living in this society . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 28.02.2010 berlin 's ruetli school - from a center of violence to a campus of hope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazing things are happening behind the walls of the old ruetli school building the ruetli school in berlin made headlines in 2006 when teachers surrendered to a culture of violence and disrespect .
some four years later , deutsche welle 's uwe hessler has discovered new hope there . when i was shown around the ruetli school in the tough berlin district of neukoelln by dr. ahmad al-sadi , i felt as if i was accompanying a movie celebrity on a walk downtown .
the 61-year-old former palestinian refugee was wearing a leather jacket and a hat that made him look more like a weather-beaten cowboy than a member of a school 's staff .
but everywhere we went in the school on this tuesday morning in february , he was greeted with shining eyes by youngsters who soon crowded around us , eager to shake hands and get a few words of advice or comfort from the man they lovingly call " uncle sadi . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. ahmad al-sadi has won the trust and respect of the ruetli students al-sadi belongs to a team of teachers , social workers , politicians and community members who are struggling to change the image of a school which was once a symbol of a failing school system that had little to offer - especially to young immigrants .
school of terror in february 2006 , a bunch of rowdy ruetli school students attacked reporters , shouting their disdain for mainstream german society as the cameras rolled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , police moved in at the ruetli school to de-escalate the conflict the violence erupted after the school 's teachers had written an open letter to the school authorities in the neukoelln city district .
" in many classes , " the letter said , " the behavior of students is marked by a total rejection of education and by attitudes which are deeply inhuman .
teachers can only enter classrooms with their mobile phones on to be able to call for help quickly .
we are desperate . "
claudia heckmann was a teacher of english and german at the time .
she said the teaching staff did n't want their protest to lead to a closure of the school .
" we wanted to say that the school system was wrong , " she says now , " and that things must change at the roots . "
back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .
the hauptschule is perceived by many as a place for the " losers " in society , those who will probably end up on social welfare .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neukoelln district still has the image of a troubled immigrant neighborhood at the ruetli school , about 95 percent of the students have an immigrant background .
their parents mostly come from turkey , the balkans and arab countries .
campus ruetli after a recent reform to the school system in berlin , the ruetli school is now a gemeinschaftsschule or community school .
this new type of school has been introduced to give students a better chance of earning the qualifications they need to get jobs or even a university degree .
behind the hundred-year-old ruetli school building , bulldozers are currently levelling a 41,000 square meter -lrb- 10 acres -rrb- construction site , tearing down decrepit buildings and shacks in what used to be a small inner-city industrial area .
they 're making way for campus ruetli - a project which school authorities describe as a model of modern-type schooling that is meant to provide state-of-the-art education for children from pre-school age right up to graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work is changing both the face of the district and people 's minds once it has been completed , campus ruetli will include childcare facilities , a sports ground and a gym , and will incorporate three other schools that already exist close by .
dr. eric denton , an american who teaches english at the ruetli school , said it 's not just the teachers who " dream big " as a result of the new project : " politicians have realized that the way to save a community is to work through the school , to give the school a foundation and the resources it needs , " he says .
" the community gets an identity through the school , and the school benefits and prospers . "
the german government as well as the berlin city administration have earmarked a total of 25 million euros for the project , which is to be completed over the next few years .
changing attitudes about one million euros of this funding have already been spent on renovating the interior of the building .
as al-sadi was guiding me around , he was beaming with pride as he opened the doors to the school 's cafeteria and dining room , all gleaming in bright colors now .
the classrooms which he most enjoys showing off , however , are those where natural sciences are taught , which are equipped with the latest science equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private sponsors have contributed to giving classrooms a facelift al-sadi said that the students had come to cherish the facelift , and added that evidence of this was the fact that vandalism had virtually stopped at the school .
however , there are quite a few people at the ruetli school who believe that al-sadi himself has contributed significantly to the change in attitudes and behaviour .
the missing link the palestinian grew up in the irbid refugee camp in jordan , and came to germany in the 1970s to study economics .
" we had lost everything ; our home , our property and the transport business my father had owned in the town of nazareth .
i still remember him saying that only education could save us now , and that it was only through our brains that we could improve our situation . "
in 2006 - just two weeks after the outburst of violence at the ruetli school - al-sadi attended a meeting of parents and teachers , which , he said , " was marked by a general lack of understanding and interest on the part of the parents . "
but , he went on , " i stood up to tell them about my father 's message to me .
i was speaking in arabic , and the women started crying as they became aware of their own situation and that of their children .
they asked me what to do , and i told them : ' i will look after your children , but you must promise that you come to the school when there 's a problem to solve . " '
since then al-sadi has been working at the school as one of two " intercultural mediators . "
he 's sold the building company he owned to devote his time entirely to a job that he said " keeps him busy often from the morning until the late evening . "
over the past four years , " uncle sadi " has won the trust of both the students and their parents .
but he has also re-established communication between them and the teaching staff .
and he often has to mediate within the families themselves , notably when it comes to resolving generational problems arising from traditional beliefs and customs .
he describes what he 's doing as working on " the future of germany as a whole . "
he has clear views on social policy : " germans do n't have enough children anymore .
arab families have eight , nine or even ten children .
they will stay here , and they must be given a chance to make a living in this society . "
campus of hope the ruetli school students have come to see al-sadi as a role model for what can be achieved through education and hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a blackboard welcoming visitors in three languages has n't been vandalized for four years they 've embraced the school as theirs , and they 've learned to value what the teachers are doing for them .

how have israel and the european union responded to its progress in africa ? looking back at the last decade , iran has improved relations with african countries by turning to them for investment and trade as it has become more isolated by the west .
in africa , iran has engaged in economic and development projects in a number of countries : in senegal where khodro , iran 's largest car manufacturer , opened an assembly line in 2007 ; nigeria with which it has agreed to share nuclear technology for the production of electricity ; and it enjoys good relations with south africa -lrb- a regional leader -rrb- where its support of the anc during the apartheid era has meant that south africa has remained a true friend .
however , nowhere is the success of iran ’ s investment quite as clear as in sudan .
" iran has been successful in strengthening ties with sudan because the two countries have an ideological link .
they are standing up against the west and imperialism , " sanam vakil , an expert on iran at the johns hopkins university in washington dc , told deutsche welle .
why africa matters to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese president , abdoulaye wade , and iranian president , mahmoud ahmadinejad in dakar as a result of its isolation from the world -lrb- particularly the west -rrb- , iran has had to turn to africa in an effort to gain more relevance in global affairs .
" by strengthening its relationship with african countries , iran is trying to overcome its de facto isolation , " walter posch , a researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , told deutsche welle .
vakil agrees : " iran is always trying to expand its areas of diplomatic and economic influence to counterbalance against its own isolation , " she said .
in spite of all its efforts , iran 's success at extending its influence in africa remains unclear , " perhaps with the exception of sudan where there are iranian cars , " posch said .
with a reduction of military aid from china and russia , sudan two years ago turned to iran for help and signed a bilateral agreement that includes military cooperation with the country .
at a meeting late last year with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , his sudanese counterpart , deng alor , openly voiced his country 's support for iran 's nuclear ambitions .
israeli concerns iran 's nuclear ambitions are a threat to stability in the middle east , and naturally its progress in africa is being closely watched by israel .
in addition , israel wants to counterbalance iranian and islamic influence in africa , especially in the horn of africa which has a coastline with the red sea - a gateway to the suez canal .
therefore , israel has tried to establish friendly ties with the only non-islamic county in the horn of africa , ethiopia , which has also used israeli military aid to counter islamic militants in the southeast region which borders somalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethiopia has been using military aid from israel to arm itself against somali militias israel sees iran ’ s inroads in africa -lrb- especially in sudan -rrb- as a threat to its ability to garner african support at the un , and also as a threat to regional stability in the horn of africa because iran ’ s advances contribute to the growth of islam in the region .
in an attempt to counterbalance that perceived threat , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman visited ethiopia , kenya , uganda , ghana , and nigeria in september 2009 , and pledged israel ’ s support for these countries by promising development and economic aid .
europe turns a blind eye by and large , iran 's efforts at establishing better relations with african countries have remained largely ignored by the eu .
javier perez , the political advisor to the eu special representative for sudan told deutsche welle that " sudan is a high priority of the eu foreign policy in africa , but the interest of iran in africa is not being followed as of yet . "
according to posch , europe 's current stance may be due to the fact that iran 's trade and economic cooperation with africa pales in comparison to that of other countries like china , the us , and some european nations .
neverthless , johns hopkins university researcher vakil feels that " the europeans should be watching this because it is happening in europe 's backdoor . "

nikolaus schneider is to replace former head bishop margot kaessman , who resigned last week after police caught her driving drunk . the german protestant church has apparently settled on a new leader to replace the popular margot kaessmann , who was arrested for drunk driving earlier in the week .
leaders are backing nikolaus schneider to take over .
the church council held a two-day summit in the town of tutzing on the starnberger see in bavaria to decide who they would recommend as margot kaessmann 's successor .
bishop of bavaria joachim friedrich and synod chair katrin goering-eckardt lent their support to 62-year-old nikolaus schneider , who has been fulfilling the role provisionally since kaessmann 's resignation earlier this week following for a drunk-driving arrest .
if all goes according to the church 's plan , the synod will elect schneider for another five years in november .

this came despite anni friesinger-postma 's fall in the semi-finals . the three-woman speed skating team claimed germany 's tenth gold medal on saturday evening following a stunning final race against the japanese team .
stephanie beckert , daniela anschuetz-thoms and katrin mattscherodt crossed the finish line only 0.02 seconds ahead of the japanese , who dominated the first few laps of the three-kilometer race .
the japanese team , comprising masako hozumi , maki tabata and nao kodaira , got off to an immense start and soon built up a lead of over 1.7 seconds in the first part of the race - a small eternity on a speed skating rink .

thirty seconds later , one could only guess at friesinger-postma 's emotions as she looked up at the score board and realized she had still done enough to finish 0.23 seconds ahead of the us team .
following this nerve-racking finish , team coach markus eicher decided not to risk the exhausted friesinger-postma in the final , which took place only an hour and a half later .
in that race , stephanie beckert 's extraordinary final drive proved the decisive factor .
friesinger-postma paid tribute to beckert 's explosive performance in the final , in which she led the last two laps .

this came despite anni friesinger-postma 's fall in the semi-finals . the three-woman speed skating team claimed germany 's tenth gold medal on saturday evening following a stunning final race against the japanese team .
stephanie beckert , daniela anschuetz-thoms and katrin mattscherodt crossed the finish line only 0.02 seconds ahead of the japanese , who dominated the first few laps of the three-kilometer race .
the japanese team , comprising masako hozumi , maki tabata and nao kodaira , got off to an immense start and soon built up a lead of over 1.7 seconds in the first part of the race - a small eternity on a speed skating rink .
the germans steadily hauled back the advantage , but were still around three quarters of a second behind going into the final lap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friesinger-postma threw her skate forward as she scrambled across the line it was only on the home straight that the medal positions were decided , and it took a photo finish to be ensure germany 's victory .
semi-final stumble the victory was all the more remarkable because the fourth member of the german team , anni friesinger-postma , fell on the last corner of the semi-final against the united states , after a nightmarish final lap .
the 16-time world champion slid over the finish line on her belly and pounded the ice in despair , convinced that she had ruined her team 's chances of a medal .
thirty seconds later , one could only guess at friesinger-postma 's emotions as she looked up at the score board and realized she had still done enough to finish 0.23 seconds ahead of the us team .
following this nerve-racking finish , team coach markus eicher decided not to risk the exhausted friesinger-postma in the final , which took place only an hour and a half later .
in that race , stephanie beckert 's extraordinary final drive proved the decisive factor .
friesinger-postma paid tribute to beckert 's explosive performance in the final , in which she led the last two laps .
" that was a rollercoaster for the emotions , " she said .
" she was our steam engine .
she pulled our girls through those two laps . "
beckert has already won two silver medals in the individual speed skating events .

nikolaus schneider is to replace former head bishop margot kaessman , who resigned last week after police caught her driving drunk . the german protestant church has apparently settled on a new leader to replace the popular margot kaessmann , who was arrested for drunk driving earlier in the week .
leaders are backing nikolaus schneider to take over .
the church council held a two-day summit in the town of tutzing on the starnberger see in bavaria to decide who they would recommend as margot kaessmann 's successor .
bishop of bavaria joachim friedrich and synod chair katrin goering-eckardt lent their support to 62-year-old nikolaus schneider , who has been fulfilling the role provisionally since kaessmann 's resignation earlier this week following for a drunk-driving arrest .
if all goes according to the church 's plan , the synod will elect schneider for another five years in november .
schneider also reiterated his interest in taking over the role .
" i am open to answering positively , " he said , when asked whether he would accept the role if offered .
following kaessmann 's plan goering-eckardt described schneider 's appointment as the natural continuation of kaessmann 's tenure .
" the plan that we began with margot kaessmann we will continue successfully under the direction of nikolaus schneider , " she said .
but the council 's recommendation is not official , and must be ratified by the church parliament in any case .
an official recommendation will not be made until the synod convenes in november .
margot kaessmann stepped down from her post as leader of germany 's 25 million lutherans after she was pulled over by police for running a red light in a car provided by the church .
she was found to have a blood-alcohol level three times above the legal limit. bk / dpa / apd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as loew contemplates who should be in the squad he will take to south africa , it seems that he can not decide on which out of the three candidates available should be his first choice . loew has named all three in his squad for the friendly against argentina next week - germany 's biggest test before the main event gets underway in june .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese have all been picked despite calamitous losses in form and confidence over the past few weeks . despite assuring the german public that " all three goalkeepers have maintained a high level of quality over the season as a whole , " loew must be concerned at the mistakes the trio have made in recent matches and the fact that not one of them has risen to the top to make a clear case for the coveted no.1 shirt . adler 's recent lack of concentration is a worry bildunterschrift : neuer , adler and wiese compete for the no.1 shirt loew does have a point .
adler , as the shot-stopper for the bundesliga leaders , has had a great season on the whole .
he has been ever-present as leverkusen have gone unbeaten to remain top of the league , with nine clean sheets .
he has conceded 20 goals so far this season but none will be as damaging to his reputation as the gift he gave werder bremen 's claudio pizarro last weekend .
adler let a free kick slip through his legs during the 2-2 draw . while still one of the favorites - on leverkusen 's form - to become germany 's no. 1 , such lapses in concentration will be much more devastating should they occur at the world cup , a fact that wo n't be lost on jogi loew . manuel neuer has also been in good form with schalke , keeping 12 clean sheets and letting in just 17 goals all season . neuer still in contention but mistakes come thick and fast neuer was even being spoken of as a possible replacement for the aging edwin van der sar at manchester united but sir alex ferguson may not have been that impressed by his display against wolfsburg last week .
neuer was clearly at fault as wolfsburg 's brazilian striker grafite equalized and then won the match after failing to be closed down by the schalke keeper .
neuer remains the other main contender for the no.1 jersey but such mistakes come at a critical time for both club and country . the door of opportunity is likely to be closing for tim wiese .
the werder bremen keeper has been there or thereabouts in the fight for the no.1 jersey but his time has probably been and gone . tim wiese 's time may have come and gone the form he showed in bremen 's 2006 bundesliga-title season has never fully been replicated and his gaffs have become more spectacular and regular in recent seasons .
even at the age of 28 , in an era when goalies can play to the age of 40 , wiese looks to have missed the boat , especially as loew is looking to younger stars in a number of positions . that none of these three is an automatic choice and each has failed to convince the national team coach in the run-up to south africa 2010 .
this leaves germany wondering if the goalkeeping conveyor belt , which for years has helped keep the country at the top of the international game may finally have run out of legs . goalkeeping production line drying up great german goalkeepers usually come along with the regularity of london buses .
whenever one is seen to have taken center stage , a precocious upstart is already waiting in the wings for his chance to take over .
when one is ruling the roost , it is hard for many people to imagine finding a successor ; such is the expected resilience of germany 's no. 1 .
but for the germans , it is a matter of course that the keeper-in-waiting should be of equal or better quality than the incumbent . germany 's 1990 world cup-winning keeper bodo illgner looked as though he would be the no.1 forever when he took over the shirt from eike immel after euro ' 88 .
illgner 's understudy , andreas koepke , then became the clear choice between 1996 and 2000 with a young oliver kahn breathing down his neck . kahn was , of course , to go on to become one of the greatest german goalkeepers of all time - and even if he had n't , germany would still have been blessed with a top-draw stopper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann , hildebrand and kahn were all world class keepers while king kahn was racking up his 86 appearances for the national team , his main rival was jens lehmann , a goalkeeper who could have been the first choice for most international teams .
only kahn 's consistency and form kept lehmann from making the no.1 jersey his own on a permanent basis . when lehmann finally creaked his way out of the international arena after losing the final of euro 2008 with germany , there were a number of possible successors but not one clear choice .
eventually one of the following pack rose to prominence over the others . robert enke appeared the most obvious choice to become the next german no.1.
one can only wonder what heights he might have reached had he not tragically taken his own life last year .
coach loew has made it clear that enke would be his no.1 in south africa . author : nick amies editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" those that consider -lsb- street view -rsb- to be an invasion of their private sphere can make use of the right to object , " merkel said in her weekly podcast on saturday , february 27 . the consumer affairs ministry has drawn up a template letter - available for download from its website - for this purpose .
the internet giant has agreed to blur license plates and faces of individuals who do not want to have their photos appear online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view gives users ground-level views of streets around the world consumer affairs minister ilse aigner has previously threatened to take legal action to prevent google street view from offering photos on the country 's cities and streets . " with these services , i can see where and how someone lives , what private preferences he or she has , how the front door is secured , and what kind of curtains are hanging in the window , " aigner said .
" private things are dragged to the global public without the possibility of protection . " aigner , a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union , had demanded tighter legal constraints on how google distorts images of people and private property , but these now seem unlikely to materialize . " the buildings in question should not be recognizable , and house numbers , faces and cars must also be made completely unrecognizable , " aigner said .
" enlarging the pixels is just not good enough . " filming the streets street view , which offers panoramas of thousands of streets on the internet , already covers large areas of the us and the uk .
it seamlessly stitches together photos taken by camera cars which can capture 360-degree images .
google has been gathering images of streets and public spaces in germany since 2008 . the online service began in 2007 in four cities in the united states .
australia and japan soon followed . in total google has initiated similar imaging projects in 19 countries , including many in europe .
satellites help pinpoint the panoramic scenes on maps using geo-data systems . minister for the internet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel tried to settle the issue on saturday august-wilhelm scheer , president of the internet industry association bitkom , criticized aigner 's campaign against street view as shallow populism .
he also criticized the german government for not having a clear internet policy .
he accused the various ministries of cherry-picking internet-related issues and kicking up some publicity around it . " we need a minister of state for the internet , like we have a minister of state for culture , " scheer said . merkel said she believed in the freedom of the internet , but emphasized that it was not a law-free zone . " that is why we will always make sure that in cases like child pornography , for example , it will always be possible to delete such websites to protect people , " she said . google intends to use the computer conference cebit about to be held in hannover to inform the public about street view . bk / dpa / ape editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this came despite anni friesinger-postma 's fall in the semi-finals . the three-woman speed skating team claimed germany 's tenth gold medal on saturday evening following a stunning final race against the japanese team .
stephanie beckert , daniela anschuetz-thoms and katrin mattscherodt crossed the finish line only 0.02 seconds ahead of the japanese , who dominated the first few laps of the three-kilometer race .
the japanese team , comprising masako hozumi , maki tabata and nao kodaira , got off to an immense start and soon built up a lead of over 1.7 seconds in the first part of the race - a small eternity on a speed skating rink .
the germans steadily hauled back the advantage , but were still around three quarters of a second behind going into the final lap .

semi-final stumble the victory was all the more remarkable because the fourth member of the german team , anni friesinger-postma , fell on the last corner of the semi-final against the united states , after a nightmarish final lap .
the 16-time world champion slid over the finish line on her belly and pounded the ice in despair , convinced that she had ruined her team 's chances of a medal .
thirty seconds later , one could only guess at friesinger-postma 's emotions as she looked up at the score board and realized she had still done enough to finish 0.23 seconds ahead of the us team .
following this nerve-racking finish , team coach markus eicher decided not to risk the exhausted friesinger-postma in the final , which took place only an hour and a half later .
in that race , stephanie beckert 's extraordinary final drive proved the decisive factor .
friesinger-postma paid tribute to beckert 's explosive performance in the final , in which she led the last two laps .
" that was a rollercoaster for the emotions , " she said .
" she was our steam engine .
she pulled our girls through those two laps . "
beckert has already won two silver medals in the individual speed skating events .

how have israel and the european union responded to its progress in africa ? looking back at the last decade , iran has improved relations with african countries by turning to them for investment and trade as it has become more isolated by the west .
in africa , iran has engaged in economic and development projects in a number of countries : in senegal where khodro , iran 's largest car manufacturer , opened an assembly line in 2007 ; nigeria with which it has agreed to share nuclear technology for the production of electricity ; and it enjoys good relations with south africa -lrb- a regional leader -rrb- where its support of the anc during the apartheid era has meant that south africa has remained a true friend .
however , nowhere is the success of iran ’ s investment quite as clear as in sudan .
" iran has been successful in strengthening ties with sudan because the two countries have an ideological link .
they are standing up against the west and imperialism , " sanam vakil , an expert on iran at the johns hopkins university in washington dc , told deutsche welle .
why africa matters to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese president , abdoulaye wade , and iranian president , mahmoud ahmadinejad in dakar as a result of its isolation from the world -lrb- particularly the west -rrb- , iran has had to turn to africa in an effort to gain more relevance in global affairs .
" by strengthening its relationship with african countries , iran is trying to overcome its de facto isolation , " walter posch , a researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , told deutsche welle .
vakil agrees : " iran is always trying to expand its areas of diplomatic and economic influence to counterbalance against its own isolation , " she said .
in spite of all its efforts , iran 's success at extending its influence in africa remains unclear , " perhaps with the exception of sudan where there are iranian cars , " posch said .
with a reduction of military aid from china and russia , sudan two years ago turned to iran for help and signed a bilateral agreement that includes military cooperation with the country .
at a meeting late last year with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , his sudanese counterpart , deng alor , openly voiced his country 's support for iran 's nuclear ambitions .
israeli concerns iran 's nuclear ambitions are a threat to stability in the middle east , and naturally its progress in africa is being closely watched by israel .
in addition , israel wants to counterbalance iranian and islamic influence in africa , especially in the horn of africa which has a coastline with the red sea - a gateway to the suez canal .
therefore , israel has tried to establish friendly ties with the only non-islamic county in the horn of africa , ethiopia , which has also used israeli military aid to counter islamic militants in the southeast region which borders somalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethiopia has been using military aid from israel to arm itself against somali militias israel sees iran ’ s inroads in africa -lrb- especially in sudan -rrb- as a threat to its ability to garner african support at the un , and also as a threat to regional stability in the horn of africa because iran ’ s advances contribute to the growth of islam in the region .
in an attempt to counterbalance that perceived threat , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman visited ethiopia , kenya , uganda , ghana , and nigeria in september 2009 , and pledged israel ’ s support for these countries by promising development and economic aid .
europe turns a blind eye by and large , iran 's efforts at establishing better relations with african countries have remained largely ignored by the eu .
javier perez , the political advisor to the eu special representative for sudan told deutsche welle that " sudan is a high priority of the eu foreign policy in africa , but the interest of iran in africa is not being followed as of yet . "
according to posch , europe 's current stance may be due to the fact that iran 's trade and economic cooperation with africa pales in comparison to that of other countries like china , the us , and some european nations .
neverthless , johns hopkins university researcher vakil feels that " the europeans should be watching this because it is happening in europe 's backdoor . "

how have israel and the european union responded to its progress in africa ? looking back at the last decade , iran has improved relations with african countries by turning to them for investment and trade as it has become more isolated by the west .
in africa , iran has engaged in economic and development projects in a number of countries : in senegal where khodro , iran 's largest car manufacturer , opened an assembly line in 2007 ; nigeria with which it has agreed to share nuclear technology for the production of electricity ; and it enjoys good relations with south africa -lrb- a regional leader -rrb- where its support of the anc during the apartheid era has meant that south africa has remained a true friend .
however , nowhere is the success of iran ’ s investment quite as clear as in sudan .
" iran has been successful in strengthening ties with sudan because the two countries have an ideological link .
they are standing up against the west and imperialism , " sanam vakil , an expert on iran at the johns hopkins university in washington dc , told deutsche welle .
why africa matters to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese president , abdoulaye wade , and iranian president , mahmoud ahmadinejad in dakar as a result of its isolation from the world -lrb- particularly the west -rrb- , iran has had to turn to africa in an effort to gain more relevance in global affairs .
" by strengthening its relationship with african countries , iran is trying to overcome its de facto isolation , " walter posch , a researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , told deutsche welle .
vakil agrees : " iran is always trying to expand its areas of diplomatic and economic influence to counterbalance against its own isolation , " she said .
in spite of all its efforts , iran 's success at extending its influence in africa remains unclear , " perhaps with the exception of sudan where there are iranian cars , " posch said .
with a reduction of military aid from china and russia , sudan two years ago turned to iran for help and signed a bilateral agreement that includes military cooperation with the country .
at a meeting late last year with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , his sudanese counterpart , deng alor , openly voiced his country 's support for iran 's nuclear ambitions .
israeli concerns iran 's nuclear ambitions are a threat to stability in the middle east , and naturally its progress in africa is being closely watched by israel .
in addition , israel wants to counterbalance iranian and islamic influence in africa , especially in the horn of africa which has a coastline with the red sea - a gateway to the suez canal .
therefore , israel has tried to establish friendly ties with the only non-islamic county in the horn of africa , ethiopia , which has also used israeli military aid to counter islamic militants in the southeast region which borders somalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethiopia has been using military aid from israel to arm itself against somali militias israel sees iran ’ s inroads in africa -lrb- especially in sudan -rrb- as a threat to its ability to garner african support at the un , and also as a threat to regional stability in the horn of africa because iran ’ s advances contribute to the growth of islam in the region .
in an attempt to counterbalance that perceived threat , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman visited ethiopia , kenya , uganda , ghana , and nigeria in september 2009 , and pledged israel ’ s support for these countries by promising development and economic aid .
europe turns a blind eye by and large , iran 's efforts at establishing better relations with african countries have remained largely ignored by the eu .
javier perez , the political advisor to the eu special representative for sudan told deutsche welle that " sudan is a high priority of the eu foreign policy in africa , but the interest of iran in africa is not being followed as of yet . "
according to posch , europe 's current stance may be due to the fact that iran 's trade and economic cooperation with africa pales in comparison to that of other countries like china , the us , and some european nations .
neverthless , johns hopkins university researcher vakil feels that " the europeans should be watching this because it is happening in europe 's backdoor . "

with a reduction of military aid from china and russia , sudan two years ago turned to iran for help and signed a bilateral agreement that includes military cooperation with the country .
at a meeting late last year with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , his sudanese counterpart , deng alor , openly voiced his country 's support for iran 's nuclear ambitions .
israeli concerns iran 's nuclear ambitions are a threat to stability in the middle east , and naturally its progress in africa is being closely watched by israel .
in addition , israel wants to counterbalance iranian and islamic influence in africa , especially in the horn of africa which has a coastline with the red sea - a gateway to the suez canal .
therefore , israel has tried to establish friendly ties with the only non-islamic county in the horn of africa , ethiopia , which has also used israeli military aid to counter islamic militants in the southeast region which borders somalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethiopia has been using military aid from israel to arm itself against somali militias israel sees iran ’ s inroads in africa -lrb- especially in sudan -rrb- as a threat to its ability to garner african support at the un , and also as a threat to regional stability in the horn of africa because iran ’ s advances contribute to the growth of islam in the region .
in an attempt to counterbalance that perceived threat , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman visited ethiopia , kenya , uganda , ghana , and nigeria in september 2009 , and pledged israel ’ s support for these countries by promising development and economic aid .
europe turns a blind eye by and large , iran 's efforts at establishing better relations with african countries have remained largely ignored by the eu .
javier perez , the political advisor to the eu special representative for sudan told deutsche welle that " sudan is a high priority of the eu foreign policy in africa , but the interest of iran in africa is not being followed as of yet . "
according to posch , europe 's current stance may be due to the fact that iran 's trade and economic cooperation with africa pales in comparison to that of other countries like china , the us , and some european nations .
neverthless , johns hopkins university researcher vakil feels that " the europeans should be watching this because it is happening in europe 's backdoor . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 28.02.2010 berlin 's ruetli school - from a center of violence to a campus of hope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazing things are happening behind the walls of the old ruetli school building the ruetli school in berlin made headlines in 2006 when teachers surrendered to a culture of violence and disrespect .
some four years later , deutsche welle 's uwe hessler has discovered new hope there . when i was shown around the ruetli school in the tough berlin district of neukoelln by dr. ahmad al-sadi , i felt as if i was accompanying a movie celebrity on a walk downtown .
the 61-year-old former palestinian refugee was wearing a leather jacket and a hat that made him look more like a weather-beaten cowboy than a member of a school 's staff .
but everywhere we went in the school on this tuesday morning in february , he was greeted with shining eyes by youngsters who soon crowded around us , eager to shake hands and get a few words of advice or comfort from the man they lovingly call " uncle sadi . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. ahmad al-sadi has won the trust and respect of the ruetli students al-sadi belongs to a team of teachers , social workers , politicians and community members who are struggling to change the image of a school which was once a symbol of a failing school system that had little to offer - especially to young immigrants .
school of terror in february 2006 , a bunch of rowdy ruetli school students attacked reporters , shouting their disdain for mainstream german society as the cameras rolled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , police moved in at the ruetli school to de-escalate the conflict the violence erupted after the school 's teachers had written an open letter to the school authorities in the neukoelln city district .
" in many classes , " the letter said , " the behavior of students is marked by a total rejection of education and by attitudes which are deeply inhuman .
teachers can only enter classrooms with their mobile phones on to be able to call for help quickly .
we are desperate . "
claudia heckmann was a teacher of english and german at the time .
she said the teaching staff did n't want their protest to lead to a closure of the school .
" we wanted to say that the school system was wrong , " she says now , " and that things must change at the roots . "
back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .
the hauptschule is perceived by many as a place for the " losers " in society , those who will probably end up on social welfare .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neukoelln district still has the image of a troubled immigrant neighborhood at the ruetli school , about 95 percent of the students have an immigrant background .
their parents mostly come from turkey , the balkans and arab countries .
campus ruetli after a recent reform to the school system in berlin , the ruetli school is now a gemeinschaftsschule or community school .
this new type of school has been introduced to give students a better chance of earning the qualifications they need to get jobs or even a university degree .
behind the hundred-year-old ruetli school building , bulldozers are currently levelling a 41,000 square meter -lrb- 10 acres -rrb- construction site , tearing down decrepit buildings and shacks in what used to be a small inner-city industrial area .
they 're making way for campus ruetli - a project which school authorities describe as a model of modern-type schooling that is meant to provide state-of-the-art education for children from pre-school age right up to graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work is changing both the face of the district and people 's minds once it has been completed , campus ruetli will include childcare facilities , a sports ground and a gym , and will incorporate three other schools that already exist close by .
dr. eric denton , an american who teaches english at the ruetli school , said it 's not just the teachers who " dream big " as a result of the new project : " politicians have realized that the way to save a community is to work through the school , to give the school a foundation and the resources it needs , " he says .
" the community gets an identity through the school , and the school benefits and prospers . "
the german government as well as the berlin city administration have earmarked a total of 25 million euros for the project , which is to be completed over the next few years .
changing attitudes about one million euros of this funding have already been spent on renovating the interior of the building .
as al-sadi was guiding me around , he was beaming with pride as he opened the doors to the school 's cafeteria and dining room , all gleaming in bright colors now .
the classrooms which he most enjoys showing off , however , are those where natural sciences are taught , which are equipped with the latest science equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private sponsors have contributed to giving classrooms a facelift al-sadi said that the students had come to cherish the facelift , and added that evidence of this was the fact that vandalism had virtually stopped at the school .
however , there are quite a few people at the ruetli school who believe that al-sadi himself has contributed significantly to the change in attitudes and behaviour .
the missing link the palestinian grew up in the irbid refugee camp in jordan , and came to germany in the 1970s to study economics .
" we had lost everything ; our home , our property and the transport business my father had owned in the town of nazareth .
i still remember him saying that only education could save us now , and that it was only through our brains that we could improve our situation . "
in 2006 - just two weeks after the outburst of violence at the ruetli school - al-sadi attended a meeting of parents and teachers , which , he said , " was marked by a general lack of understanding and interest on the part of the parents . "
but , he went on , " i stood up to tell them about my father 's message to me .
i was speaking in arabic , and the women started crying as they became aware of their own situation and that of their children .
they asked me what to do , and i told them : ' i will look after your children , but you must promise that you come to the school when there 's a problem to solve . " '
since then al-sadi has been working at the school as one of two " intercultural mediators . "
he 's sold the building company he owned to devote his time entirely to a job that he said " keeps him busy often from the morning until the late evening . "
over the past four years , " uncle sadi " has won the trust of both the students and their parents .
but he has also re-established communication between them and the teaching staff .
and he often has to mediate within the families themselves , notably when it comes to resolving generational problems arising from traditional beliefs and customs .
he describes what he 's doing as working on " the future of germany as a whole . "
he has clear views on social policy : " germans do n't have enough children anymore .
arab families have eight , nine or even ten children .
they will stay here , and they must be given a chance to make a living in this society . "
campus of hope the ruetli school students have come to see al-sadi as a role model for what can be achieved through education and hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a blackboard welcoming visitors in three languages has n't been vandalized for four years they 've embraced the school as theirs , and they 've learned to value what the teachers are doing for them .
" they spend a lot of time so that we can get a job , " said 16-year-old ahmed iraque .
and ezgi güler , a 10th grader from turkey , added that public perception that the school was only for " losers " was entirely wrong .
" this school gives me a chance for my future , more than the school i attended before .
when i leave , i know that i will cry . "
zahra riaz , who is also in the 10th grade , even believes that the multicultural make-up of the school gives the students an advantage over classes made up of only native germans .
" we learn more about different cultures , " she says .
" yes , i think i have a good future here , because i try to be a good student . "
meanwhile , the number of ruetli students going on to an academic education has more than doubled over the past four years .
arabic language classes have been introduced , making it easier for most of the students to learn the second foreign language they need to qualify for university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruetli students are working together for their school and for a better future many students now even spend parts of their leisure time at school , doing their homework or learning in after-school classes .
parents can enjoy a cup of coffee , or discuss problems with teachers at a parents ' center in the school building .
and claudia heckmann , the former english and german teacher , has become the school 's principal .
she said that the bad headlines four years ago prompted teachers , authorities , students and parents to " move closer together " to become a team that had developed a new spirit .
" nevertheless there are still huge difficulties , " she says , " and sometimes we think it 's too much , and too many problems need to be resolved .
but then , there is this vision that we can change things if we focus on the strength of people , and not always on what is not working . "

how have israel and the european union responded to its progress in africa ? looking back at the last decade , iran has improved relations with african countries by turning to them for investment and trade as it has become more isolated by the west .
in africa , iran has engaged in economic and development projects in a number of countries : in senegal where khodro , iran 's largest car manufacturer , opened an assembly line in 2007 ; nigeria with which it has agreed to share nuclear technology for the production of electricity ; and it enjoys good relations with south africa -lrb- a regional leader -rrb- where its support of the anc during the apartheid era has meant that south africa has remained a true friend .
however , nowhere is the success of iran ’ s investment quite as clear as in sudan .
" iran has been successful in strengthening ties with sudan because the two countries have an ideological link .
they are standing up against the west and imperialism , " sanam vakil , an expert on iran at the johns hopkins university in washington dc , told deutsche welle .
why africa matters to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese president , abdoulaye wade , and iranian president , mahmoud ahmadinejad in dakar as a result of its isolation from the world -lrb- particularly the west -rrb- , iran has had to turn to africa in an effort to gain more relevance in global affairs .
" by strengthening its relationship with african countries , iran is trying to overcome its de facto isolation , " walter posch , a researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , told deutsche welle .
vakil agrees : " iran is always trying to expand its areas of diplomatic and economic influence to counterbalance against its own isolation , " she said .
in spite of all its efforts , iran 's success at extending its influence in africa remains unclear , " perhaps with the exception of sudan where there are iranian cars , " posch said .

" they spend a lot of time so that we can get a job , " said 16-year-old ahmed iraque .

" this school gives me a chance for my future , more than the school i attended before .

zahra riaz , who is also in the 10th grade , even believes that the multicultural make-up of the school gives the students an advantage over classes made up of only native germans .
" we learn more about different cultures , " she says .
" yes , i think i have a good future here , because i try to be a good student . "
meanwhile , the number of ruetli students going on to an academic education has more than doubled over the past four years .
arabic language classes have been introduced , making it easier for most of the students to learn the second foreign language they need to qualify for university .

" nevertheless there are still huge difficulties , " she says , " and sometimes we think it 's too much , and too many problems need to be resolved .
but then , there is this vision that we can change things if we focus on the strength of people , and not always on what is not working . "

but as loew contemplates who should be in the squad he will take to south africa , it seems that he can not decide on which out of the three candidates available should be his first choice . loew has named all three in his squad for the friendly against argentina next week - germany 's biggest test before the main event gets underway in june .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese have all been picked despite calamitous losses in form and confidence over the past few weeks . despite assuring the german public that " all three goalkeepers have maintained a high level of quality over the season as a whole , " loew must be concerned at the mistakes the trio have made in recent matches and the fact that not one of them has risen to the top to make a clear case for the coveted no.1 shirt . adler 's recent lack of concentration is a worry bildunterschrift : neuer , adler and wiese compete for the no.1 shirt loew does have a point .
adler , as the shot-stopper for the bundesliga leaders , has had a great season on the whole .
he has been ever-present as leverkusen have gone unbeaten to remain top of the league , with nine clean sheets .
he has conceded 20 goals so far this season but none will be as damaging to his reputation as the gift he gave werder bremen 's claudio pizarro last weekend .
adler let a free kick slip through his legs during the 2-2 draw . while still one of the favorites - on leverkusen 's form - to become germany 's no. 1 , such lapses in concentration will be much more devastating should they occur at the world cup , a fact that wo n't be lost on jogi loew . manuel neuer has also been in good form with schalke , keeping 12 clean sheets and letting in just 17 goals all season . neuer still in contention but mistakes come thick and fast neuer was even being spoken of as a possible replacement for the aging edwin van der sar at manchester united but sir alex ferguson may not have been that impressed by his display against wolfsburg last week .
neuer was clearly at fault as wolfsburg 's brazilian striker grafite equalized and then won the match after failing to be closed down by the schalke keeper .
neuer remains the other main contender for the no.1 jersey but such mistakes come at a critical time for both club and country . the door of opportunity is likely to be closing for tim wiese .
the werder bremen keeper has been there or thereabouts in the fight for the no.1 jersey but his time has probably been and gone . tim wiese 's time may have come and gone the form he showed in bremen 's 2006 bundesliga-title season has never fully been replicated and his gaffs have become more spectacular and regular in recent seasons .
even at the age of 28 , in an era when goalies can play to the age of 40 , wiese looks to have missed the boat , especially as loew is looking to younger stars in a number of positions . that none of these three is an automatic choice and each has failed to convince the national team coach in the run-up to south africa 2010 .
this leaves germany wondering if the goalkeeping conveyor belt , which for years has helped keep the country at the top of the international game may finally have run out of legs . goalkeeping production line drying up great german goalkeepers usually come along with the regularity of london buses .
whenever one is seen to have taken center stage , a precocious upstart is already waiting in the wings for his chance to take over .
when one is ruling the roost , it is hard for many people to imagine finding a successor ; such is the expected resilience of germany 's no. 1 .
but for the germans , it is a matter of course that the keeper-in-waiting should be of equal or better quality than the incumbent . germany 's 1990 world cup-winning keeper bodo illgner looked as though he would be the no.1 forever when he took over the shirt from eike immel after euro ' 88 .
illgner 's understudy , andreas koepke , then became the clear choice between 1996 and 2000 with a young oliver kahn breathing down his neck . kahn was , of course , to go on to become one of the greatest german goalkeepers of all time - and even if he had n't , germany would still have been blessed with a top-draw stopper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann , hildebrand and kahn were all world class keepers while king kahn was racking up his 86 appearances for the national team , his main rival was jens lehmann , a goalkeeper who could have been the first choice for most international teams .
only kahn 's consistency and form kept lehmann from making the no.1 jersey his own on a permanent basis . when lehmann finally creaked his way out of the international arena after losing the final of euro 2008 with germany , there were a number of possible successors but not one clear choice .
eventually one of the following pack rose to prominence over the others . robert enke appeared the most obvious choice to become the next german no.1.

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 28.02.2010 berlin 's ruetli school - from a center of violence to a campus of hope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazing things are happening behind the walls of the old ruetli school building the ruetli school in berlin made headlines in 2006 when teachers surrendered to a culture of violence and disrespect .
some four years later , deutsche welle 's uwe hessler has discovered new hope there . when i was shown around the ruetli school in the tough berlin district of neukoelln by dr. ahmad al-sadi , i felt as if i was accompanying a movie celebrity on a walk downtown .
the 61-year-old former palestinian refugee was wearing a leather jacket and a hat that made him look more like a weather-beaten cowboy than a member of a school 's staff .
but everywhere we went in the school on this tuesday morning in february , he was greeted with shining eyes by youngsters who soon crowded around us , eager to shake hands and get a few words of advice or comfort from the man they lovingly call " uncle sadi . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. ahmad al-sadi has won the trust and respect of the ruetli students al-sadi belongs to a team of teachers , social workers , politicians and community members who are struggling to change the image of a school which was once a symbol of a failing school system that had little to offer - especially to young immigrants .
school of terror in february 2006 , a bunch of rowdy ruetli school students attacked reporters , shouting their disdain for mainstream german society as the cameras rolled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , police moved in at the ruetli school to de-escalate the conflict the violence erupted after the school 's teachers had written an open letter to the school authorities in the neukoelln city district .
" in many classes , " the letter said , " the behavior of students is marked by a total rejection of education and by attitudes which are deeply inhuman .
teachers can only enter classrooms with their mobile phones on to be able to call for help quickly .
we are desperate . "
claudia heckmann was a teacher of english and german at the time .
she said the teaching staff did n't want their protest to lead to a closure of the school .
" we wanted to say that the school system was wrong , " she says now , " and that things must change at the roots . "
back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .
the hauptschule is perceived by many as a place for the " losers " in society , those who will probably end up on social welfare .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neukoelln district still has the image of a troubled immigrant neighborhood at the ruetli school , about 95 percent of the students have an immigrant background .
their parents mostly come from turkey , the balkans and arab countries .
campus ruetli after a recent reform to the school system in berlin , the ruetli school is now a gemeinschaftsschule or community school .
this new type of school has been introduced to give students a better chance of earning the qualifications they need to get jobs or even a university degree .
behind the hundred-year-old ruetli school building , bulldozers are currently levelling a 41,000 square meter -lrb- 10 acres -rrb- construction site , tearing down decrepit buildings and shacks in what used to be a small inner-city industrial area .
they 're making way for campus ruetli - a project which school authorities describe as a model of modern-type schooling that is meant to provide state-of-the-art education for children from pre-school age right up to graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work is changing both the face of the district and people 's minds once it has been completed , campus ruetli will include childcare facilities , a sports ground and a gym , and will incorporate three other schools that already exist close by .
dr. eric denton , an american who teaches english at the ruetli school , said it 's not just the teachers who " dream big " as a result of the new project : " politicians have realized that the way to save a community is to work through the school , to give the school a foundation and the resources it needs , " he says .
" the community gets an identity through the school , and the school benefits and prospers . "
the german government as well as the berlin city administration have earmarked a total of 25 million euros for the project , which is to be completed over the next few years .
changing attitudes about one million euros of this funding have already been spent on renovating the interior of the building .
as al-sadi was guiding me around , he was beaming with pride as he opened the doors to the school 's cafeteria and dining room , all gleaming in bright colors now .
the classrooms which he most enjoys showing off , however , are those where natural sciences are taught , which are equipped with the latest science equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private sponsors have contributed to giving classrooms a facelift al-sadi said that the students had come to cherish the facelift , and added that evidence of this was the fact that vandalism had virtually stopped at the school .
however , there are quite a few people at the ruetli school who believe that al-sadi himself has contributed significantly to the change in attitudes and behaviour .
the missing link the palestinian grew up in the irbid refugee camp in jordan , and came to germany in the 1970s to study economics .
" we had lost everything ; our home , our property and the transport business my father had owned in the town of nazareth .
i still remember him saying that only education could save us now , and that it was only through our brains that we could improve our situation . "
in 2006 - just two weeks after the outburst of violence at the ruetli school - al-sadi attended a meeting of parents and teachers , which , he said , " was marked by a general lack of understanding and interest on the part of the parents . "
but , he went on , " i stood up to tell them about my father 's message to me .
i was speaking in arabic , and the women started crying as they became aware of their own situation and that of their children .
they asked me what to do , and i told them : ' i will look after your children , but you must promise that you come to the school when there 's a problem to solve . " '
since then al-sadi has been working at the school as one of two " intercultural mediators . "
he 's sold the building company he owned to devote his time entirely to a job that he said " keeps him busy often from the morning until the late evening . "
over the past four years , " uncle sadi " has won the trust of both the students and their parents .
but he has also re-established communication between them and the teaching staff .
and he often has to mediate within the families themselves , notably when it comes to resolving generational problems arising from traditional beliefs and customs .
he describes what he 's doing as working on " the future of germany as a whole . "
he has clear views on social policy : " germans do n't have enough children anymore .
arab families have eight , nine or even ten children .
they will stay here , and they must be given a chance to make a living in this society . "
campus of hope the ruetli school students have come to see al-sadi as a role model for what can be achieved through education and hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a blackboard welcoming visitors in three languages has n't been vandalized for four years they 've embraced the school as theirs , and they 've learned to value what the teachers are doing for them .
" they spend a lot of time so that we can get a job , " said 16-year-old ahmed iraque .
and ezgi güler , a 10th grader from turkey , added that public perception that the school was only for " losers " was entirely wrong .
" this school gives me a chance for my future , more than the school i attended before .
when i leave , i know that i will cry . "
zahra riaz , who is also in the 10th grade , even believes that the multicultural make-up of the school gives the students an advantage over classes made up of only native germans .
" we learn more about different cultures , " she says .
" yes , i think i have a good future here , because i try to be a good student . "
meanwhile , the number of ruetli students going on to an academic education has more than doubled over the past four years .
arabic language classes have been introduced , making it easier for most of the students to learn the second foreign language they need to qualify for university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruetli students are working together for their school and for a better future many students now even spend parts of their leisure time at school , doing their homework or learning in after-school classes .
parents can enjoy a cup of coffee , or discuss problems with teachers at a parents ' center in the school building .
and claudia heckmann , the former english and german teacher , has become the school 's principal .
she said that the bad headlines four years ago prompted teachers , authorities , students and parents to " move closer together " to become a team that had developed a new spirit .
" nevertheless there are still huge difficulties , " she says , " and sometimes we think it 's too much , and too many problems need to be resolved .
but then , there is this vision that we can change things if we focus on the strength of people , and not always on what is not working . "

this came despite anni friesinger-postma 's fall in the semi-finals . the three-woman speed skating team claimed germany 's tenth gold medal on saturday evening following a stunning final race against the japanese team .
stephanie beckert , daniela anschuetz-thoms and katrin mattscherodt crossed the finish line only 0.02 seconds ahead of the japanese , who dominated the first few laps of the three-kilometer race .
the japanese team , comprising masako hozumi , maki tabata and nao kodaira , got off to an immense start and soon built up a lead of over 1.7 seconds in the first part of the race - a small eternity on a speed skating rink .

thirty seconds later , one could only guess at friesinger-postma 's emotions as she looked up at the score board and realized she had still done enough to finish 0.23 seconds ahead of the us team .

in that race , stephanie beckert 's extraordinary final drive proved the decisive factor .
friesinger-postma paid tribute to beckert 's explosive performance in the final , in which she led the last two laps .
" that was a rollercoaster for the emotions , " she said .
" she was our steam engine .
she pulled our girls through those two laps . "

" those that consider -lsb- street view -rsb- to be an invasion of their private sphere can make use of the right to object , " merkel said in her weekly podcast on saturday , february 27 . the consumer affairs ministry has drawn up a template letter - available for download from its website - for this purpose .
the internet giant has agreed to blur license plates and faces of individuals who do not want to have their photos appear online . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view gives users ground-level views of streets around the world consumer affairs minister ilse aigner has previously threatened to take legal action to prevent google street view from offering photos on the country 's cities and streets . " with these services , i can see where and how someone lives , what private preferences he or she has , how the front door is secured , and what kind of curtains are hanging in the window , " aigner said .
" private things are dragged to the global public without the possibility of protection . " aigner , a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union , had demanded tighter legal constraints on how google distorts images of people and private property , but these now seem unlikely to materialize . " the buildings in question should not be recognizable , and house numbers , faces and cars must also be made completely unrecognizable , " aigner said .
" enlarging the pixels is just not good enough . " filming the streets street view , which offers panoramas of thousands of streets on the internet , already covers large areas of the us and the uk .
it seamlessly stitches together photos taken by camera cars which can capture 360-degree images .
google has been gathering images of streets and public spaces in germany since 2008 . the online service began in 2007 in four cities in the united states .
australia and japan soon followed . in total google has initiated similar imaging projects in 19 countries , including many in europe .
satellites help pinpoint the panoramic scenes on maps using geo-data systems . minister for the internet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel tried to settle the issue on saturday august-wilhelm scheer , president of the internet industry association bitkom , criticized aigner 's campaign against street view as shallow populism .
he also criticized the german government for not having a clear internet policy .
he accused the various ministries of cherry-picking internet-related issues and kicking up some publicity around it . " we need a minister of state for the internet , like we have a minister of state for culture , " scheer said . merkel said she believed in the freedom of the internet , but emphasized that it was not a law-free zone . " that is why we will always make sure that in cases like child pornography , for example , it will always be possible to delete such websites to protect people , " she said . google intends to use the computer conference cebit about to be held in hannover to inform the public about street view . bk / dpa / ape editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this came despite anni friesinger-postma 's fall in the semi-finals . the three-woman speed skating team claimed germany 's tenth gold medal on saturday evening following a stunning final race against the japanese team .
stephanie beckert , daniela anschuetz-thoms and katrin mattscherodt crossed the finish line only 0.02 seconds ahead of the japanese , who dominated the first few laps of the three-kilometer race .
the japanese team , comprising masako hozumi , maki tabata and nao kodaira , got off to an immense start and soon built up a lead of over 1.7 seconds in the first part of the race - a small eternity on a speed skating rink .
the germans steadily hauled back the advantage , but were still around three quarters of a second behind going into the final lap .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friesinger-postma threw her skate forward as she scrambled across the line it was only on the home straight that the medal positions were decided , and it took a photo finish to be ensure germany 's victory .

the 16-time world champion slid over the finish line on her belly and pounded the ice in despair , convinced that she had ruined her team 's chances of a medal .
thirty seconds later , one could only guess at friesinger-postma 's emotions as she looked up at the score board and realized she had still done enough to finish 0.23 seconds ahead of the us team .
following this nerve-racking finish , team coach markus eicher decided not to risk the exhausted friesinger-postma in the final , which took place only an hour and a half later .
in that race , stephanie beckert 's extraordinary final drive proved the decisive factor .
friesinger-postma paid tribute to beckert 's explosive performance in the final , in which she led the last two laps .
" that was a rollercoaster for the emotions , " she said .
" she was our steam engine .

this came despite anni friesinger-postma 's fall in the semi-finals . the three-woman speed skating team claimed germany 's tenth gold medal on saturday evening following a stunning final race against the japanese team .
stephanie beckert , daniela anschuetz-thoms and katrin mattscherodt crossed the finish line only 0.02 seconds ahead of the japanese , who dominated the first few laps of the three-kilometer race .
the japanese team , comprising masako hozumi , maki tabata and nao kodaira , got off to an immense start and soon built up a lead of over 1.7 seconds in the first part of the race - a small eternity on a speed skating rink .

thirty seconds later , one could only guess at friesinger-postma 's emotions as she looked up at the score board and realized she had still done enough to finish 0.23 seconds ahead of the us team .
following this nerve-racking finish , team coach markus eicher decided not to risk the exhausted friesinger-postma in the final , which took place only an hour and a half later .
in that race , stephanie beckert 's extraordinary final drive proved the decisive factor .
friesinger-postma paid tribute to beckert 's explosive performance in the final , in which she led the last two laps .

but as loew contemplates who should be in the squad he will take to south africa , it seems that he can not decide on which out of the three candidates available should be his first choice . loew has named all three in his squad for the friendly against argentina next week - germany 's biggest test before the main event gets underway in june .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese have all been picked despite calamitous losses in form and confidence over the past few weeks . despite assuring the german public that " all three goalkeepers have maintained a high level of quality over the season as a whole , " loew must be concerned at the mistakes the trio have made in recent matches and the fact that not one of them has risen to the top to make a clear case for the coveted no.1 shirt . adler 's recent lack of concentration is a worry bildunterschrift : neuer , adler and wiese compete for the no.1 shirt loew does have a point .
adler , as the shot-stopper for the bundesliga leaders , has had a great season on the whole .
he has been ever-present as leverkusen have gone unbeaten to remain top of the league , with nine clean sheets .
he has conceded 20 goals so far this season but none will be as damaging to his reputation as the gift he gave werder bremen 's claudio pizarro last weekend .
adler let a free kick slip through his legs during the 2-2 draw . while still one of the favorites - on leverkusen 's form - to become germany 's no. 1 , such lapses in concentration will be much more devastating should they occur at the world cup , a fact that wo n't be lost on jogi loew . manuel neuer has also been in good form with schalke , keeping 12 clean sheets and letting in just 17 goals all season . neuer still in contention but mistakes come thick and fast neuer was even being spoken of as a possible replacement for the aging edwin van der sar at manchester united but sir alex ferguson may not have been that impressed by his display against wolfsburg last week .
neuer was clearly at fault as wolfsburg 's brazilian striker grafite equalized and then won the match after failing to be closed down by the schalke keeper .
neuer remains the other main contender for the no.1 jersey but such mistakes come at a critical time for both club and country . the door of opportunity is likely to be closing for tim wiese .
the werder bremen keeper has been there or thereabouts in the fight for the no.1 jersey but his time has probably been and gone . tim wiese 's time may have come and gone the form he showed in bremen 's 2006 bundesliga-title season has never fully been replicated and his gaffs have become more spectacular and regular in recent seasons .
even at the age of 28 , in an era when goalies can play to the age of 40 , wiese looks to have missed the boat , especially as loew is looking to younger stars in a number of positions . that none of these three is an automatic choice and each has failed to convince the national team coach in the run-up to south africa 2010 .
this leaves germany wondering if the goalkeeping conveyor belt , which for years has helped keep the country at the top of the international game may finally have run out of legs . goalkeeping production line drying up great german goalkeepers usually come along with the regularity of london buses .
whenever one is seen to have taken center stage , a precocious upstart is already waiting in the wings for his chance to take over .
when one is ruling the roost , it is hard for many people to imagine finding a successor ; such is the expected resilience of germany 's no. 1 .
but for the germans , it is a matter of course that the keeper-in-waiting should be of equal or better quality than the incumbent . germany 's 1990 world cup-winning keeper bodo illgner looked as though he would be the no.1 forever when he took over the shirt from eike immel after euro ' 88 .
illgner 's understudy , andreas koepke , then became the clear choice between 1996 and 2000 with a young oliver kahn breathing down his neck . kahn was , of course , to go on to become one of the greatest german goalkeepers of all time - and even if he had n't , germany would still have been blessed with a top-draw stopper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann , hildebrand and kahn were all world class keepers while king kahn was racking up his 86 appearances for the national team , his main rival was jens lehmann , a goalkeeper who could have been the first choice for most international teams .
only kahn 's consistency and form kept lehmann from making the no.1 jersey his own on a permanent basis . when lehmann finally creaked his way out of the international arena after losing the final of euro 2008 with germany , there were a number of possible successors but not one clear choice .
eventually one of the following pack rose to prominence over the others . robert enke appeared the most obvious choice to become the next german no.1.
one can only wonder what heights he might have reached had he not tragically taken his own life last year .

but as loew contemplates who should be in the squad he will take to south africa , it seems that he can not decide on which out of the three candidates available should be his first choice . loew has named all three in his squad for the friendly against argentina next week - germany 's biggest test before the main event gets underway in june .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese have all been picked despite calamitous losses in form and confidence over the past few weeks . despite assuring the german public that " all three goalkeepers have maintained a high level of quality over the season as a whole , " loew must be concerned at the mistakes the trio have made in recent matches and the fact that not one of them has risen to the top to make a clear case for the coveted no.1 shirt . adler 's recent lack of concentration is a worry bildunterschrift : neuer , adler and wiese compete for the no.1 shirt loew does have a point .
adler , as the shot-stopper for the bundesliga leaders , has had a great season on the whole .
he has been ever-present as leverkusen have gone unbeaten to remain top of the league , with nine clean sheets .
he has conceded 20 goals so far this season but none will be as damaging to his reputation as the gift he gave werder bremen 's claudio pizarro last weekend .
adler let a free kick slip through his legs during the 2-2 draw . while still one of the favorites - on leverkusen 's form - to become germany 's no. 1 , such lapses in concentration will be much more devastating should they occur at the world cup , a fact that wo n't be lost on jogi loew . manuel neuer has also been in good form with schalke , keeping 12 clean sheets and letting in just 17 goals all season . neuer still in contention but mistakes come thick and fast neuer was even being spoken of as a possible replacement for the aging edwin van der sar at manchester united but sir alex ferguson may not have been that impressed by his display against wolfsburg last week .
neuer was clearly at fault as wolfsburg 's brazilian striker grafite equalized and then won the match after failing to be closed down by the schalke keeper .
neuer remains the other main contender for the no.1 jersey but such mistakes come at a critical time for both club and country . the door of opportunity is likely to be closing for tim wiese .
the werder bremen keeper has been there or thereabouts in the fight for the no.1 jersey but his time has probably been and gone . tim wiese 's time may have come and gone the form he showed in bremen 's 2006 bundesliga-title season has never fully been replicated and his gaffs have become more spectacular and regular in recent seasons .
even at the age of 28 , in an era when goalies can play to the age of 40 , wiese looks to have missed the boat , especially as loew is looking to younger stars in a number of positions . that none of these three is an automatic choice and each has failed to convince the national team coach in the run-up to south africa 2010 .
this leaves germany wondering if the goalkeeping conveyor belt , which for years has helped keep the country at the top of the international game may finally have run out of legs . goalkeeping production line drying up great german goalkeepers usually come along with the regularity of london buses .

bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese have all been picked despite calamitous losses in form and confidence over the past few weeks . despite assuring the german public that " all three goalkeepers have maintained a high level of quality over the season as a whole , " loew must be concerned at the mistakes the trio have made in recent matches and the fact that not one of them has risen to the top to make a clear case for the coveted no.1 shirt . adler 's recent lack of concentration is a worry bildunterschrift : neuer , adler and wiese compete for the no.1 shirt loew does have a point .
adler , as the shot-stopper for the bundesliga leaders , has had a great season on the whole .
he has been ever-present as leverkusen have gone unbeaten to remain top of the league , with nine clean sheets .
he has conceded 20 goals so far this season but none will be as damaging to his reputation as the gift he gave werder bremen 's claudio pizarro last weekend .
adler let a free kick slip through his legs during the 2-2 draw . while still one of the favorites - on leverkusen 's form - to become germany 's no. 1 , such lapses in concentration will be much more devastating should they occur at the world cup , a fact that wo n't be lost on jogi loew . manuel neuer has also been in good form with schalke , keeping 12 clean sheets and letting in just 17 goals all season . neuer still in contention but mistakes come thick and fast neuer was even being spoken of as a possible replacement for the aging edwin van der sar at manchester united but sir alex ferguson may not have been that impressed by his display against wolfsburg last week .
neuer was clearly at fault as wolfsburg 's brazilian striker grafite equalized and then won the match after failing to be closed down by the schalke keeper .
neuer remains the other main contender for the no.1 jersey but such mistakes come at a critical time for both club and country . the door of opportunity is likely to be closing for tim wiese .
the werder bremen keeper has been there or thereabouts in the fight for the no.1 jersey but his time has probably been and gone . tim wiese 's time may have come and gone the form he showed in bremen 's 2006 bundesliga-title season has never fully been replicated and his gaffs have become more spectacular and regular in recent seasons .
even at the age of 28 , in an era when goalies can play to the age of 40 , wiese looks to have missed the boat , especially as loew is looking to younger stars in a number of positions . that none of these three is an automatic choice and each has failed to convince the national team coach in the run-up to south africa 2010 .
this leaves germany wondering if the goalkeeping conveyor belt , which for years has helped keep the country at the top of the international game may finally have run out of legs . goalkeeping production line drying up great german goalkeepers usually come along with the regularity of london buses .
whenever one is seen to have taken center stage , a precocious upstart is already waiting in the wings for his chance to take over .
when one is ruling the roost , it is hard for many people to imagine finding a successor ; such is the expected resilience of germany 's no. 1 .
but for the germans , it is a matter of course that the keeper-in-waiting should be of equal or better quality than the incumbent . germany 's 1990 world cup-winning keeper bodo illgner looked as though he would be the no.1 forever when he took over the shirt from eike immel after euro ' 88 .
illgner 's understudy , andreas koepke , then became the clear choice between 1996 and 2000 with a young oliver kahn breathing down his neck . kahn was , of course , to go on to become one of the greatest german goalkeepers of all time - and even if he had n't , germany would still have been blessed with a top-draw stopper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann , hildebrand and kahn were all world class keepers while king kahn was racking up his 86 appearances for the national team , his main rival was jens lehmann , a goalkeeper who could have been the first choice for most international teams .
only kahn 's consistency and form kept lehmann from making the no.1 jersey his own on a permanent basis . when lehmann finally creaked his way out of the international arena after losing the final of euro 2008 with germany , there were a number of possible successors but not one clear choice .
eventually one of the following pack rose to prominence over the others . robert enke appeared the most obvious choice to become the next german no.1.

but as loew contemplates who should be in the squad he will take to south africa , it seems that he can not decide on which out of the three candidates available should be his first choice . loew has named all three in his squad for the friendly against argentina next week - germany 's biggest test before the main event gets underway in june .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese have all been picked despite calamitous losses in form and confidence over the past few weeks . despite assuring the german public that " all three goalkeepers have maintained a high level of quality over the season as a whole , " loew must be concerned at the mistakes the trio have made in recent matches and the fact that not one of them has risen to the top to make a clear case for the coveted no.1 shirt . adler 's recent lack of concentration is a worry bildunterschrift : neuer , adler and wiese compete for the no.1 shirt loew does have a point .
adler , as the shot-stopper for the bundesliga leaders , has had a great season on the whole .
he has been ever-present as leverkusen have gone unbeaten to remain top of the league , with nine clean sheets .
he has conceded 20 goals so far this season but none will be as damaging to his reputation as the gift he gave werder bremen 's claudio pizarro last weekend .
adler let a free kick slip through his legs during the 2-2 draw . while still one of the favorites - on leverkusen 's form - to become germany 's no. 1 , such lapses in concentration will be much more devastating should they occur at the world cup , a fact that wo n't be lost on jogi loew . manuel neuer has also been in good form with schalke , keeping 12 clean sheets and letting in just 17 goals all season . neuer still in contention but mistakes come thick and fast neuer was even being spoken of as a possible replacement for the aging edwin van der sar at manchester united but sir alex ferguson may not have been that impressed by his display against wolfsburg last week .
neuer was clearly at fault as wolfsburg 's brazilian striker grafite equalized and then won the match after failing to be closed down by the schalke keeper .
neuer remains the other main contender for the no.1 jersey but such mistakes come at a critical time for both club and country . the door of opportunity is likely to be closing for tim wiese .
the werder bremen keeper has been there or thereabouts in the fight for the no.1 jersey but his time has probably been and gone . tim wiese 's time may have come and gone the form he showed in bremen 's 2006 bundesliga-title season has never fully been replicated and his gaffs have become more spectacular and regular in recent seasons .
even at the age of 28 , in an era when goalies can play to the age of 40 , wiese looks to have missed the boat , especially as loew is looking to younger stars in a number of positions . that none of these three is an automatic choice and each has failed to convince the national team coach in the run-up to south africa 2010 .
this leaves germany wondering if the goalkeeping conveyor belt , which for years has helped keep the country at the top of the international game may finally have run out of legs . goalkeeping production line drying up great german goalkeepers usually come along with the regularity of london buses .
whenever one is seen to have taken center stage , a precocious upstart is already waiting in the wings for his chance to take over .
when one is ruling the roost , it is hard for many people to imagine finding a successor ; such is the expected resilience of germany 's no. 1 .
but for the germans , it is a matter of course that the keeper-in-waiting should be of equal or better quality than the incumbent . germany 's 1990 world cup-winning keeper bodo illgner looked as though he would be the no.1 forever when he took over the shirt from eike immel after euro ' 88 .
illgner 's understudy , andreas koepke , then became the clear choice between 1996 and 2000 with a young oliver kahn breathing down his neck . kahn was , of course , to go on to become one of the greatest german goalkeepers of all time - and even if he had n't , germany would still have been blessed with a top-draw stopper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann , hildebrand and kahn were all world class keepers while king kahn was racking up his 86 appearances for the national team , his main rival was jens lehmann , a goalkeeper who could have been the first choice for most international teams .
only kahn 's consistency and form kept lehmann from making the no.1 jersey his own on a permanent basis . when lehmann finally creaked his way out of the international arena after losing the final of euro 2008 with germany , there were a number of possible successors but not one clear choice .
eventually one of the following pack rose to prominence over the others . robert enke appeared the most obvious choice to become the next german no.1.

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 28.02.2010 berlin 's ruetli school - from a center of violence to a campus of hope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazing things are happening behind the walls of the old ruetli school building the ruetli school in berlin made headlines in 2006 when teachers surrendered to a culture of violence and disrespect .
some four years later , deutsche welle 's uwe hessler has discovered new hope there . when i was shown around the ruetli school in the tough berlin district of neukoelln by dr. ahmad al-sadi , i felt as if i was accompanying a movie celebrity on a walk downtown .
the 61-year-old former palestinian refugee was wearing a leather jacket and a hat that made him look more like a weather-beaten cowboy than a member of a school 's staff .
but everywhere we went in the school on this tuesday morning in february , he was greeted with shining eyes by youngsters who soon crowded around us , eager to shake hands and get a few words of advice or comfort from the man they lovingly call " uncle sadi . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. ahmad al-sadi has won the trust and respect of the ruetli students al-sadi belongs to a team of teachers , social workers , politicians and community members who are struggling to change the image of a school which was once a symbol of a failing school system that had little to offer - especially to young immigrants .
school of terror in february 2006 , a bunch of rowdy ruetli school students attacked reporters , shouting their disdain for mainstream german society as the cameras rolled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , police moved in at the ruetli school to de-escalate the conflict the violence erupted after the school 's teachers had written an open letter to the school authorities in the neukoelln city district .
" in many classes , " the letter said , " the behavior of students is marked by a total rejection of education and by attitudes which are deeply inhuman .
teachers can only enter classrooms with their mobile phones on to be able to call for help quickly .
we are desperate . "
claudia heckmann was a teacher of english and german at the time .
she said the teaching staff did n't want their protest to lead to a closure of the school .
" we wanted to say that the school system was wrong , " she says now , " and that things must change at the roots . "
back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .
the hauptschule is perceived by many as a place for the " losers " in society , those who will probably end up on social welfare .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neukoelln district still has the image of a troubled immigrant neighborhood at the ruetli school , about 95 percent of the students have an immigrant background .
their parents mostly come from turkey , the balkans and arab countries .
campus ruetli after a recent reform to the school system in berlin , the ruetli school is now a gemeinschaftsschule or community school .

some four years later , deutsche welle 's uwe hessler has discovered new hope there . when i was shown around the ruetli school in the tough berlin district of neukoelln by dr. ahmad al-sadi , i felt as if i was accompanying a movie celebrity on a walk downtown .
the 61-year-old former palestinian refugee was wearing a leather jacket and a hat that made him look more like a weather-beaten cowboy than a member of a school 's staff .
but everywhere we went in the school on this tuesday morning in february , he was greeted with shining eyes by youngsters who soon crowded around us , eager to shake hands and get a few words of advice or comfort from the man they lovingly call " uncle sadi . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. ahmad al-sadi has won the trust and respect of the ruetli students al-sadi belongs to a team of teachers , social workers , politicians and community members who are struggling to change the image of a school which was once a symbol of a failing school system that had little to offer - especially to young immigrants .
school of terror in february 2006 , a bunch of rowdy ruetli school students attacked reporters , shouting their disdain for mainstream german society as the cameras rolled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , police moved in at the ruetli school to de-escalate the conflict the violence erupted after the school 's teachers had written an open letter to the school authorities in the neukoelln city district .
" in many classes , " the letter said , " the behavior of students is marked by a total rejection of education and by attitudes which are deeply inhuman .
teachers can only enter classrooms with their mobile phones on to be able to call for help quickly .
we are desperate . "
claudia heckmann was a teacher of english and german at the time .
she said the teaching staff did n't want their protest to lead to a closure of the school .
" we wanted to say that the school system was wrong , " she says now , " and that things must change at the roots . "
back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .
the hauptschule is perceived by many as a place for the " losers " in society , those who will probably end up on social welfare .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neukoelln district still has the image of a troubled immigrant neighborhood at the ruetli school , about 95 percent of the students have an immigrant background .

some four years later , deutsche welle 's uwe hessler has discovered new hope there . when i was shown around the ruetli school in the tough berlin district of neukoelln by dr. ahmad al-sadi , i felt as if i was accompanying a movie celebrity on a walk downtown .
the 61-year-old former palestinian refugee was wearing a leather jacket and a hat that made him look more like a weather-beaten cowboy than a member of a school 's staff .
but everywhere we went in the school on this tuesday morning in february , he was greeted with shining eyes by youngsters who soon crowded around us , eager to shake hands and get a few words of advice or comfort from the man they lovingly call " uncle sadi . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. ahmad al-sadi has won the trust and respect of the ruetli students al-sadi belongs to a team of teachers , social workers , politicians and community members who are struggling to change the image of a school which was once a symbol of a failing school system that had little to offer - especially to young immigrants .
school of terror in february 2006 , a bunch of rowdy ruetli school students attacked reporters , shouting their disdain for mainstream german society as the cameras rolled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , police moved in at the ruetli school to de-escalate the conflict the violence erupted after the school 's teachers had written an open letter to the school authorities in the neukoelln city district .
" in many classes , " the letter said , " the behavior of students is marked by a total rejection of education and by attitudes which are deeply inhuman .
teachers can only enter classrooms with their mobile phones on to be able to call for help quickly .
we are desperate . "
claudia heckmann was a teacher of english and german at the time .
she said the teaching staff did n't want their protest to lead to a closure of the school .
" we wanted to say that the school system was wrong , " she says now , " and that things must change at the roots . "
back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .
the hauptschule is perceived by many as a place for the " losers " in society , those who will probably end up on social welfare .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neukoelln district still has the image of a troubled immigrant neighborhood at the ruetli school , about 95 percent of the students have an immigrant background .
their parents mostly come from turkey , the balkans and arab countries .
campus ruetli after a recent reform to the school system in berlin , the ruetli school is now a gemeinschaftsschule or community school .
this new type of school has been introduced to give students a better chance of earning the qualifications they need to get jobs or even a university degree .
behind the hundred-year-old ruetli school building , bulldozers are currently levelling a 41,000 square meter -lrb- 10 acres -rrb- construction site , tearing down decrepit buildings and shacks in what used to be a small inner-city industrial area .
they 're making way for campus ruetli - a project which school authorities describe as a model of modern-type schooling that is meant to provide state-of-the-art education for children from pre-school age right up to graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work is changing both the face of the district and people 's minds once it has been completed , campus ruetli will include childcare facilities , a sports ground and a gym , and will incorporate three other schools that already exist close by .
dr. eric denton , an american who teaches english at the ruetli school , said it 's not just the teachers who " dream big " as a result of the new project : " politicians have realized that the way to save a community is to work through the school , to give the school a foundation and the resources it needs , " he says .
" the community gets an identity through the school , and the school benefits and prospers . "
the german government as well as the berlin city administration have earmarked a total of 25 million euros for the project , which is to be completed over the next few years .
changing attitudes about one million euros of this funding have already been spent on renovating the interior of the building .
as al-sadi was guiding me around , he was beaming with pride as he opened the doors to the school 's cafeteria and dining room , all gleaming in bright colors now .
the classrooms which he most enjoys showing off , however , are those where natural sciences are taught , which are equipped with the latest science equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private sponsors have contributed to giving classrooms a facelift al-sadi said that the students had come to cherish the facelift , and added that evidence of this was the fact that vandalism had virtually stopped at the school .
however , there are quite a few people at the ruetli school who believe that al-sadi himself has contributed significantly to the change in attitudes and behaviour .

" we had lost everything ; our home , our property and the transport business my father had owned in the town of nazareth .
i still remember him saying that only education could save us now , and that it was only through our brains that we could improve our situation . "
in 2006 - just two weeks after the outburst of violence at the ruetli school - al-sadi attended a meeting of parents and teachers , which , he said , " was marked by a general lack of understanding and interest on the part of the parents . "
but , he went on , " i stood up to tell them about my father 's message to me .
i was speaking in arabic , and the women started crying as they became aware of their own situation and that of their children .
they asked me what to do , and i told them : ' i will look after your children , but you must promise that you come to the school when there 's a problem to solve . " '
since then al-sadi has been working at the school as one of two " intercultural mediators . "
he 's sold the building company he owned to devote his time entirely to a job that he said " keeps him busy often from the morning until the late evening . "
over the past four years , " uncle sadi " has won the trust of both the students and their parents .
but he has also re-established communication between them and the teaching staff .
and he often has to mediate within the families themselves , notably when it comes to resolving generational problems arising from traditional beliefs and customs .
he describes what he 's doing as working on " the future of germany as a whole . "
he has clear views on social policy : " germans do n't have enough children anymore .
arab families have eight , nine or even ten children .
they will stay here , and they must be given a chance to make a living in this society . "
campus of hope the ruetli school students have come to see al-sadi as a role model for what can be achieved through education and hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a blackboard welcoming visitors in three languages has n't been vandalized for four years they 've embraced the school as theirs , and they 've learned to value what the teachers are doing for them .
" they spend a lot of time so that we can get a job , " said 16-year-old ahmed iraque .
and ezgi güler , a 10th grader from turkey , added that public perception that the school was only for " losers " was entirely wrong .
" this school gives me a chance for my future , more than the school i attended before .
when i leave , i know that i will cry . "
zahra riaz , who is also in the 10th grade , even believes that the multicultural make-up of the school gives the students an advantage over classes made up of only native germans .
" we learn more about different cultures , " she says .
" yes , i think i have a good future here , because i try to be a good student . "
meanwhile , the number of ruetli students going on to an academic education has more than doubled over the past four years .
arabic language classes have been introduced , making it easier for most of the students to learn the second foreign language they need to qualify for university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruetli students are working together for their school and for a better future many students now even spend parts of their leisure time at school , doing their homework or learning in after-school classes .
parents can enjoy a cup of coffee , or discuss problems with teachers at a parents ' center in the school building .
and claudia heckmann , the former english and german teacher , has become the school 's principal .
she said that the bad headlines four years ago prompted teachers , authorities , students and parents to " move closer together " to become a team that had developed a new spirit .
" nevertheless there are still huge difficulties , " she says , " and sometimes we think it 's too much , and too many problems need to be resolved .
but then , there is this vision that we can change things if we focus on the strength of people , and not always on what is not working . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 28.02.2010 lack of obvious no.1 raises concern over german goalkeeping lineage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi loew -lrb- r . -rrb- has a hard decision to make about his goalies germany will go to the world cup in south africa in a position that the national team has not found itself in for many years : head coach jogi loew 's squad lacks a clear no. 1 goalkeeper . in recent tournaments it 's been clear who the best goalkeeper in the country is and who should be given germany 's no.1 jersey .
but as loew contemplates who should be in the squad he will take to south africa , it seems that he can not decide on which out of the three candidates available should be his first choice . loew has named all three in his squad for the friendly against argentina next week - germany 's biggest test before the main event gets underway in june .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese have all been picked despite calamitous losses in form and confidence over the past few weeks . despite assuring the german public that " all three goalkeepers have maintained a high level of quality over the season as a whole , " loew must be concerned at the mistakes the trio have made in recent matches and the fact that not one of them has risen to the top to make a clear case for the coveted no.1 shirt . adler 's recent lack of concentration is a worry bildunterschrift : neuer , adler and wiese compete for the no.1 shirt loew does have a point .
adler , as the shot-stopper for the bundesliga leaders , has had a great season on the whole .
he has been ever-present as leverkusen have gone unbeaten to remain top of the league , with nine clean sheets .
he has conceded 20 goals so far this season but none will be as damaging to his reputation as the gift he gave werder bremen 's claudio pizarro last weekend .
adler let a free kick slip through his legs during the 2-2 draw . while still one of the favorites - on leverkusen 's form - to become germany 's no. 1 , such lapses in concentration will be much more devastating should they occur at the world cup , a fact that wo n't be lost on jogi loew . manuel neuer has also been in good form with schalke , keeping 12 clean sheets and letting in just 17 goals all season . neuer still in contention but mistakes come thick and fast neuer was even being spoken of as a possible replacement for the aging edwin van der sar at manchester united but sir alex ferguson may not have been that impressed by his display against wolfsburg last week .
neuer was clearly at fault as wolfsburg 's brazilian striker grafite equalized and then won the match after failing to be closed down by the schalke keeper .
neuer remains the other main contender for the no.1 jersey but such mistakes come at a critical time for both club and country . the door of opportunity is likely to be closing for tim wiese .
the werder bremen keeper has been there or thereabouts in the fight for the no.1 jersey but his time has probably been and gone . tim wiese 's time may have come and gone the form he showed in bremen 's 2006 bundesliga-title season has never fully been replicated and his gaffs have become more spectacular and regular in recent seasons .
even at the age of 28 , in an era when goalies can play to the age of 40 , wiese looks to have missed the boat , especially as loew is looking to younger stars in a number of positions . that none of these three is an automatic choice and each has failed to convince the national team coach in the run-up to south africa 2010 .
this leaves germany wondering if the goalkeeping conveyor belt , which for years has helped keep the country at the top of the international game may finally have run out of legs . goalkeeping production line drying up great german goalkeepers usually come along with the regularity of london buses .
whenever one is seen to have taken center stage , a precocious upstart is already waiting in the wings for his chance to take over .
when one is ruling the roost , it is hard for many people to imagine finding a successor ; such is the expected resilience of germany 's no. 1 .
but for the germans , it is a matter of course that the keeper-in-waiting should be of equal or better quality than the incumbent . germany 's 1990 world cup-winning keeper bodo illgner looked as though he would be the no.1 forever when he took over the shirt from eike immel after euro ' 88 .
illgner 's understudy , andreas koepke , then became the clear choice between 1996 and 2000 with a young oliver kahn breathing down his neck . kahn was , of course , to go on to become one of the greatest german goalkeepers of all time - and even if he had n't , germany would still have been blessed with a top-draw stopper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann , hildebrand and kahn were all world class keepers while king kahn was racking up his 86 appearances for the national team , his main rival was jens lehmann , a goalkeeper who could have been the first choice for most international teams .
only kahn 's consistency and form kept lehmann from making the no.1 jersey his own on a permanent basis . when lehmann finally creaked his way out of the international arena after losing the final of euro 2008 with germany , there were a number of possible successors but not one clear choice .
eventually one of the following pack rose to prominence over the others . robert enke appeared the most obvious choice to become the next german no.1.
one can only wonder what heights he might have reached had he not tragically taken his own life last year .
coach loew has made it clear that enke would be his no.1 in south africa . author : nick amies editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some four years later , deutsche welle 's uwe hessler has discovered new hope there . when i was shown around the ruetli school in the tough berlin district of neukoelln by dr. ahmad al-sadi , i felt as if i was accompanying a movie celebrity on a walk downtown .
the 61-year-old former palestinian refugee was wearing a leather jacket and a hat that made him look more like a weather-beaten cowboy than a member of a school 's staff .
but everywhere we went in the school on this tuesday morning in february , he was greeted with shining eyes by youngsters who soon crowded around us , eager to shake hands and get a few words of advice or comfort from the man they lovingly call " uncle sadi . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. ahmad al-sadi has won the trust and respect of the ruetli students al-sadi belongs to a team of teachers , social workers , politicians and community members who are struggling to change the image of a school which was once a symbol of a failing school system that had little to offer - especially to young immigrants .
school of terror in february 2006 , a bunch of rowdy ruetli school students attacked reporters , shouting their disdain for mainstream german society as the cameras rolled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , police moved in at the ruetli school to de-escalate the conflict the violence erupted after the school 's teachers had written an open letter to the school authorities in the neukoelln city district .
" in many classes , " the letter said , " the behavior of students is marked by a total rejection of education and by attitudes which are deeply inhuman .
teachers can only enter classrooms with their mobile phones on to be able to call for help quickly .
we are desperate . "
claudia heckmann was a teacher of english and german at the time .
she said the teaching staff did n't want their protest to lead to a closure of the school .
" we wanted to say that the school system was wrong , " she says now , " and that things must change at the roots . "
back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .
the hauptschule is perceived by many as a place for the " losers " in society , those who will probably end up on social welfare .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neukoelln district still has the image of a troubled immigrant neighborhood at the ruetli school , about 95 percent of the students have an immigrant background .
their parents mostly come from turkey , the balkans and arab countries .
campus ruetli after a recent reform to the school system in berlin , the ruetli school is now a gemeinschaftsschule or community school .
this new type of school has been introduced to give students a better chance of earning the qualifications they need to get jobs or even a university degree .
behind the hundred-year-old ruetli school building , bulldozers are currently levelling a 41,000 square meter -lrb- 10 acres -rrb- construction site , tearing down decrepit buildings and shacks in what used to be a small inner-city industrial area .
they 're making way for campus ruetli - a project which school authorities describe as a model of modern-type schooling that is meant to provide state-of-the-art education for children from pre-school age right up to graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work is changing both the face of the district and people 's minds once it has been completed , campus ruetli will include childcare facilities , a sports ground and a gym , and will incorporate three other schools that already exist close by .
dr. eric denton , an american who teaches english at the ruetli school , said it 's not just the teachers who " dream big " as a result of the new project : " politicians have realized that the way to save a community is to work through the school , to give the school a foundation and the resources it needs , " he says .
" the community gets an identity through the school , and the school benefits and prospers . "
the german government as well as the berlin city administration have earmarked a total of 25 million euros for the project , which is to be completed over the next few years .
changing attitudes about one million euros of this funding have already been spent on renovating the interior of the building .
as al-sadi was guiding me around , he was beaming with pride as he opened the doors to the school 's cafeteria and dining room , all gleaming in bright colors now .
the classrooms which he most enjoys showing off , however , are those where natural sciences are taught , which are equipped with the latest science equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private sponsors have contributed to giving classrooms a facelift al-sadi said that the students had come to cherish the facelift , and added that evidence of this was the fact that vandalism had virtually stopped at the school .
however , there are quite a few people at the ruetli school who believe that al-sadi himself has contributed significantly to the change in attitudes and behaviour .
the missing link the palestinian grew up in the irbid refugee camp in jordan , and came to germany in the 1970s to study economics .
" we had lost everything ; our home , our property and the transport business my father had owned in the town of nazareth .
i still remember him saying that only education could save us now , and that it was only through our brains that we could improve our situation . "
in 2006 - just two weeks after the outburst of violence at the ruetli school - al-sadi attended a meeting of parents and teachers , which , he said , " was marked by a general lack of understanding and interest on the part of the parents . "
but , he went on , " i stood up to tell them about my father 's message to me .
i was speaking in arabic , and the women started crying as they became aware of their own situation and that of their children .
they asked me what to do , and i told them : ' i will look after your children , but you must promise that you come to the school when there 's a problem to solve . " '
since then al-sadi has been working at the school as one of two " intercultural mediators . "
he 's sold the building company he owned to devote his time entirely to a job that he said " keeps him busy often from the morning until the late evening . "
over the past four years , " uncle sadi " has won the trust of both the students and their parents .
but he has also re-established communication between them and the teaching staff .
and he often has to mediate within the families themselves , notably when it comes to resolving generational problems arising from traditional beliefs and customs .
he describes what he 's doing as working on " the future of germany as a whole . "
he has clear views on social policy : " germans do n't have enough children anymore .
arab families have eight , nine or even ten children .
they will stay here , and they must be given a chance to make a living in this society . "
campus of hope the ruetli school students have come to see al-sadi as a role model for what can be achieved through education and hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a blackboard welcoming visitors in three languages has n't been vandalized for four years they 've embraced the school as theirs , and they 've learned to value what the teachers are doing for them .
" they spend a lot of time so that we can get a job , " said 16-year-old ahmed iraque .
and ezgi güler , a 10th grader from turkey , added that public perception that the school was only for " losers " was entirely wrong .
" this school gives me a chance for my future , more than the school i attended before .
when i leave , i know that i will cry . "
zahra riaz , who is also in the 10th grade , even believes that the multicultural make-up of the school gives the students an advantage over classes made up of only native germans .
" we learn more about different cultures , " she says .
" yes , i think i have a good future here , because i try to be a good student . "
meanwhile , the number of ruetli students going on to an academic education has more than doubled over the past four years .
arabic language classes have been introduced , making it easier for most of the students to learn the second foreign language they need to qualify for university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruetli students are working together for their school and for a better future many students now even spend parts of their leisure time at school , doing their homework or learning in after-school classes .
parents can enjoy a cup of coffee , or discuss problems with teachers at a parents ' center in the school building .
and claudia heckmann , the former english and german teacher , has become the school 's principal .
she said that the bad headlines four years ago prompted teachers , authorities , students and parents to " move closer together " to become a team that had developed a new spirit .
" nevertheless there are still huge difficulties , " she says , " and sometimes we think it 's too much , and too many problems need to be resolved .
but then , there is this vision that we can change things if we focus on the strength of people , and not always on what is not working . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 28.02.2010 lack of obvious no.1 raises concern over german goalkeeping lineage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi loew -lrb- r . -rrb- has a hard decision to make about his goalies germany will go to the world cup in south africa in a position that the national team has not found itself in for many years : head coach jogi loew 's squad lacks a clear no. 1 goalkeeper . in recent tournaments it 's been clear who the best goalkeeper in the country is and who should be given germany 's no.1 jersey .
but as loew contemplates who should be in the squad he will take to south africa , it seems that he can not decide on which out of the three candidates available should be his first choice . loew has named all three in his squad for the friendly against argentina next week - germany 's biggest test before the main event gets underway in june .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese have all been picked despite calamitous losses in form and confidence over the past few weeks . despite assuring the german public that " all three goalkeepers have maintained a high level of quality over the season as a whole , " loew must be concerned at the mistakes the trio have made in recent matches and the fact that not one of them has risen to the top to make a clear case for the coveted no.1 shirt . adler 's recent lack of concentration is a worry bildunterschrift : neuer , adler and wiese compete for the no.1 shirt loew does have a point .
adler , as the shot-stopper for the bundesliga leaders , has had a great season on the whole .
he has been ever-present as leverkusen have gone unbeaten to remain top of the league , with nine clean sheets .
he has conceded 20 goals so far this season but none will be as damaging to his reputation as the gift he gave werder bremen 's claudio pizarro last weekend .
adler let a free kick slip through his legs during the 2-2 draw . while still one of the favorites - on leverkusen 's form - to become germany 's no. 1 , such lapses in concentration will be much more devastating should they occur at the world cup , a fact that wo n't be lost on jogi loew . manuel neuer has also been in good form with schalke , keeping 12 clean sheets and letting in just 17 goals all season . neuer still in contention but mistakes come thick and fast neuer was even being spoken of as a possible replacement for the aging edwin van der sar at manchester united but sir alex ferguson may not have been that impressed by his display against wolfsburg last week .
neuer was clearly at fault as wolfsburg 's brazilian striker grafite equalized and then won the match after failing to be closed down by the schalke keeper .
neuer remains the other main contender for the no.1 jersey but such mistakes come at a critical time for both club and country . the door of opportunity is likely to be closing for tim wiese .
the werder bremen keeper has been there or thereabouts in the fight for the no.1 jersey but his time has probably been and gone . tim wiese 's time may have come and gone the form he showed in bremen 's 2006 bundesliga-title season has never fully been replicated and his gaffs have become more spectacular and regular in recent seasons .
even at the age of 28 , in an era when goalies can play to the age of 40 , wiese looks to have missed the boat , especially as loew is looking to younger stars in a number of positions . that none of these three is an automatic choice and each has failed to convince the national team coach in the run-up to south africa 2010 .
this leaves germany wondering if the goalkeeping conveyor belt , which for years has helped keep the country at the top of the international game may finally have run out of legs . goalkeeping production line drying up great german goalkeepers usually come along with the regularity of london buses .
whenever one is seen to have taken center stage , a precocious upstart is already waiting in the wings for his chance to take over .
when one is ruling the roost , it is hard for many people to imagine finding a successor ; such is the expected resilience of germany 's no. 1 .
but for the germans , it is a matter of course that the keeper-in-waiting should be of equal or better quality than the incumbent . germany 's 1990 world cup-winning keeper bodo illgner looked as though he would be the no.1 forever when he took over the shirt from eike immel after euro ' 88 .
illgner 's understudy , andreas koepke , then became the clear choice between 1996 and 2000 with a young oliver kahn breathing down his neck . kahn was , of course , to go on to become one of the greatest german goalkeepers of all time - and even if he had n't , germany would still have been blessed with a top-draw stopper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann , hildebrand and kahn were all world class keepers while king kahn was racking up his 86 appearances for the national team , his main rival was jens lehmann , a goalkeeper who could have been the first choice for most international teams .
only kahn 's consistency and form kept lehmann from making the no.1 jersey his own on a permanent basis . when lehmann finally creaked his way out of the international arena after losing the final of euro 2008 with germany , there were a number of possible successors but not one clear choice .
eventually one of the following pack rose to prominence over the others . robert enke appeared the most obvious choice to become the next german no.1.
one can only wonder what heights he might have reached had he not tragically taken his own life last year .
coach loew has made it clear that enke would be his no.1 in south africa . author : nick amies editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as loew contemplates who should be in the squad he will take to south africa , it seems that he can not decide on which out of the three candidates available should be his first choice . loew has named all three in his squad for the friendly against argentina next week - germany 's biggest test before the main event gets underway in june .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese have all been picked despite calamitous losses in form and confidence over the past few weeks . despite assuring the german public that " all three goalkeepers have maintained a high level of quality over the season as a whole , " loew must be concerned at the mistakes the trio have made in recent matches and the fact that not one of them has risen to the top to make a clear case for the coveted no.1 shirt . adler 's recent lack of concentration is a worry bildunterschrift : neuer , adler and wiese compete for the no.1 shirt loew does have a point .
adler , as the shot-stopper for the bundesliga leaders , has had a great season on the whole .
he has been ever-present as leverkusen have gone unbeaten to remain top of the league , with nine clean sheets .
he has conceded 20 goals so far this season but none will be as damaging to his reputation as the gift he gave werder bremen 's claudio pizarro last weekend .
adler let a free kick slip through his legs during the 2-2 draw . while still one of the favorites - on leverkusen 's form - to become germany 's no. 1 , such lapses in concentration will be much more devastating should they occur at the world cup , a fact that wo n't be lost on jogi loew . manuel neuer has also been in good form with schalke , keeping 12 clean sheets and letting in just 17 goals all season . neuer still in contention but mistakes come thick and fast neuer was even being spoken of as a possible replacement for the aging edwin van der sar at manchester united but sir alex ferguson may not have been that impressed by his display against wolfsburg last week .
neuer was clearly at fault as wolfsburg 's brazilian striker grafite equalized and then won the match after failing to be closed down by the schalke keeper .
neuer remains the other main contender for the no.1 jersey but such mistakes come at a critical time for both club and country . the door of opportunity is likely to be closing for tim wiese .
the werder bremen keeper has been there or thereabouts in the fight for the no.1 jersey but his time has probably been and gone . tim wiese 's time may have come and gone the form he showed in bremen 's 2006 bundesliga-title season has never fully been replicated and his gaffs have become more spectacular and regular in recent seasons .
even at the age of 28 , in an era when goalies can play to the age of 40 , wiese looks to have missed the boat , especially as loew is looking to younger stars in a number of positions . that none of these three is an automatic choice and each has failed to convince the national team coach in the run-up to south africa 2010 .
this leaves germany wondering if the goalkeeping conveyor belt , which for years has helped keep the country at the top of the international game may finally have run out of legs . goalkeeping production line drying up great german goalkeepers usually come along with the regularity of london buses .
whenever one is seen to have taken center stage , a precocious upstart is already waiting in the wings for his chance to take over .
when one is ruling the roost , it is hard for many people to imagine finding a successor ; such is the expected resilience of germany 's no. 1 .
but for the germans , it is a matter of course that the keeper-in-waiting should be of equal or better quality than the incumbent . germany 's 1990 world cup-winning keeper bodo illgner looked as though he would be the no.1 forever when he took over the shirt from eike immel after euro ' 88 .
illgner 's understudy , andreas koepke , then became the clear choice between 1996 and 2000 with a young oliver kahn breathing down his neck . kahn was , of course , to go on to become one of the greatest german goalkeepers of all time - and even if he had n't , germany would still have been blessed with a top-draw stopper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann , hildebrand and kahn were all world class keepers while king kahn was racking up his 86 appearances for the national team , his main rival was jens lehmann , a goalkeeper who could have been the first choice for most international teams .
only kahn 's consistency and form kept lehmann from making the no.1 jersey his own on a permanent basis . when lehmann finally creaked his way out of the international arena after losing the final of euro 2008 with germany , there were a number of possible successors but not one clear choice .
eventually one of the following pack rose to prominence over the others . robert enke appeared the most obvious choice to become the next german no.1.

but as loew contemplates who should be in the squad he will take to south africa , it seems that he can not decide on which out of the three candidates available should be his first choice . loew has named all three in his squad for the friendly against argentina next week - germany 's biggest test before the main event gets underway in june .
bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , manuel neuer of schalke 04 and werder bremen 's tim wiese have all been picked despite calamitous losses in form and confidence over the past few weeks . despite assuring the german public that " all three goalkeepers have maintained a high level of quality over the season as a whole , " loew must be concerned at the mistakes the trio have made in recent matches and the fact that not one of them has risen to the top to make a clear case for the coveted no.1 shirt . adler 's recent lack of concentration is a worry bildunterschrift : neuer , adler and wiese compete for the no.1 shirt loew does have a point .

neuer was clearly at fault as wolfsburg 's brazilian striker grafite equalized and then won the match after failing to be closed down by the schalke keeper .
neuer remains the other main contender for the no.1 jersey but such mistakes come at a critical time for both club and country . the door of opportunity is likely to be closing for tim wiese .

thirty seconds later , one could only guess at friesinger-postma 's emotions as she looked up at the score board and realized she had still done enough to finish 0.23 seconds ahead of the us team .
following this nerve-racking finish , team coach markus eicher decided not to risk the exhausted friesinger-postma in the final , which took place only an hour and a half later .
in that race , stephanie beckert 's extraordinary final drive proved the decisive factor .
friesinger-postma paid tribute to beckert 's explosive performance in the final , in which she led the last two laps .
" that was a rollercoaster for the emotions , " she said .
" she was our steam engine .
she pulled our girls through those two laps . "
beckert has already won two silver medals in the individual speed skating events .

" those that consider -lsb- street view -rsb- to be an invasion of their private sphere can make use of the right to object , " merkel said in her weekly podcast on saturday , february 27 . the consumer affairs ministry has drawn up a template letter - available for download from its website - for this purpose .

" with these services , i can see where and how someone lives , what private preferences he or she has , how the front door is secured , and what kind of curtains are hanging in the window , " aigner said .
" private things are dragged to the global public without the possibility of protection . " aigner , a member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union , had demanded tighter legal constraints on how google distorts images of people and private property , but these now seem unlikely to materialize .

" enlarging the pixels is just not good enough . " filming the streets street view , which offers panoramas of thousands of streets on the internet , already covers large areas of the us and the uk .
it seamlessly stitches together photos taken by camera cars which can capture 360-degree images .
google has been gathering images of streets and public spaces in germany since 2008 . the online service began in 2007 in four cities in the united states .
australia and japan soon followed . in total google has initiated similar imaging projects in 19 countries , including many in europe .

the 61-year-old former palestinian refugee was wearing a leather jacket and a hat that made him look more like a weather-beaten cowboy than a member of a school 's staff .
but everywhere we went in the school on this tuesday morning in february , he was greeted with shining eyes by youngsters who soon crowded around us , eager to shake hands and get a few words of advice or comfort from the man they lovingly call " uncle sadi . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. ahmad al-sadi has won the trust and respect of the ruetli students al-sadi belongs to a team of teachers , social workers , politicians and community members who are struggling to change the image of a school which was once a symbol of a failing school system that had little to offer - especially to young immigrants .
school of terror in february 2006 , a bunch of rowdy ruetli school students attacked reporters , shouting their disdain for mainstream german society as the cameras rolled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , police moved in at the ruetli school to de-escalate the conflict the violence erupted after the school 's teachers had written an open letter to the school authorities in the neukoelln city district .
" in many classes , " the letter said , " the behavior of students is marked by a total rejection of education and by attitudes which are deeply inhuman .
teachers can only enter classrooms with their mobile phones on to be able to call for help quickly .
we are desperate . "
claudia heckmann was a teacher of english and german at the time .
she said the teaching staff did n't want their protest to lead to a closure of the school .
" we wanted to say that the school system was wrong , " she says now , " and that things must change at the roots . "
back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .
the hauptschule is perceived by many as a place for the " losers " in society , those who will probably end up on social welfare .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neukoelln district still has the image of a troubled immigrant neighborhood at the ruetli school , about 95 percent of the students have an immigrant background .
their parents mostly come from turkey , the balkans and arab countries .
campus ruetli after a recent reform to the school system in berlin , the ruetli school is now a gemeinschaftsschule or community school .
this new type of school has been introduced to give students a better chance of earning the qualifications they need to get jobs or even a university degree .
behind the hundred-year-old ruetli school building , bulldozers are currently levelling a 41,000 square meter -lrb- 10 acres -rrb- construction site , tearing down decrepit buildings and shacks in what used to be a small inner-city industrial area .
they 're making way for campus ruetli - a project which school authorities describe as a model of modern-type schooling that is meant to provide state-of-the-art education for children from pre-school age right up to graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work is changing both the face of the district and people 's minds once it has been completed , campus ruetli will include childcare facilities , a sports ground and a gym , and will incorporate three other schools that already exist close by .
dr. eric denton , an american who teaches english at the ruetli school , said it 's not just the teachers who " dream big " as a result of the new project : " politicians have realized that the way to save a community is to work through the school , to give the school a foundation and the resources it needs , " he says .
" the community gets an identity through the school , and the school benefits and prospers . "
the german government as well as the berlin city administration have earmarked a total of 25 million euros for the project , which is to be completed over the next few years .

however , there are quite a few people at the ruetli school who believe that al-sadi himself has contributed significantly to the change in attitudes and behaviour .

" we had lost everything ; our home , our property and the transport business my father had owned in the town of nazareth .
i still remember him saying that only education could save us now , and that it was only through our brains that we could improve our situation . "
in 2006 - just two weeks after the outburst of violence at the ruetli school - al-sadi attended a meeting of parents and teachers , which , he said , " was marked by a general lack of understanding and interest on the part of the parents . "
but , he went on , " i stood up to tell them about my father 's message to me .
i was speaking in arabic , and the women started crying as they became aware of their own situation and that of their children .
they asked me what to do , and i told them : ' i will look after your children , but you must promise that you come to the school when there 's a problem to solve . " '
since then al-sadi has been working at the school as one of two " intercultural mediators . "
he 's sold the building company he owned to devote his time entirely to a job that he said " keeps him busy often from the morning until the late evening . "
over the past four years , " uncle sadi " has won the trust of both the students and their parents .
but he has also re-established communication between them and the teaching staff .
and he often has to mediate within the families themselves , notably when it comes to resolving generational problems arising from traditional beliefs and customs .
he describes what he 's doing as working on " the future of germany as a whole . "
he has clear views on social policy : " germans do n't have enough children anymore .
arab families have eight , nine or even ten children .
they will stay here , and they must be given a chance to make a living in this society . "
campus of hope the ruetli school students have come to see al-sadi as a role model for what can be achieved through education and hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a blackboard welcoming visitors in three languages has n't been vandalized for four years they 've embraced the school as theirs , and they 've learned to value what the teachers are doing for them .
" they spend a lot of time so that we can get a job , " said 16-year-old ahmed iraque .
and ezgi güler , a 10th grader from turkey , added that public perception that the school was only for " losers " was entirely wrong .
" this school gives me a chance for my future , more than the school i attended before .

zahra riaz , who is also in the 10th grade , even believes that the multicultural make-up of the school gives the students an advantage over classes made up of only native germans .
" we learn more about different cultures , " she says .
" yes , i think i have a good future here , because i try to be a good student . "
meanwhile , the number of ruetli students going on to an academic education has more than doubled over the past four years .
arabic language classes have been introduced , making it easier for most of the students to learn the second foreign language they need to qualify for university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruetli students are working together for their school and for a better future many students now even spend parts of their leisure time at school , doing their homework or learning in after-school classes .

and claudia heckmann , the former english and german teacher , has become the school 's principal .
she said that the bad headlines four years ago prompted teachers , authorities , students and parents to " move closer together " to become a team that had developed a new spirit .
" nevertheless there are still huge difficulties , " she says , " and sometimes we think it 's too much , and too many problems need to be resolved .
but then , there is this vision that we can change things if we focus on the strength of people , and not always on what is not working . "

some four years later , deutsche welle 's uwe hessler has discovered new hope there . when i was shown around the ruetli school in the tough berlin district of neukoelln by dr. ahmad al-sadi , i felt as if i was accompanying a movie celebrity on a walk downtown .
the 61-year-old former palestinian refugee was wearing a leather jacket and a hat that made him look more like a weather-beaten cowboy than a member of a school 's staff .
but everywhere we went in the school on this tuesday morning in february , he was greeted with shining eyes by youngsters who soon crowded around us , eager to shake hands and get a few words of advice or comfort from the man they lovingly call " uncle sadi . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. ahmad al-sadi has won the trust and respect of the ruetli students al-sadi belongs to a team of teachers , social workers , politicians and community members who are struggling to change the image of a school which was once a symbol of a failing school system that had little to offer - especially to young immigrants .
school of terror in february 2006 , a bunch of rowdy ruetli school students attacked reporters , shouting their disdain for mainstream german society as the cameras rolled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , police moved in at the ruetli school to de-escalate the conflict the violence erupted after the school 's teachers had written an open letter to the school authorities in the neukoelln city district .
" in many classes , " the letter said , " the behavior of students is marked by a total rejection of education and by attitudes which are deeply inhuman .
teachers can only enter classrooms with their mobile phones on to be able to call for help quickly .
we are desperate . "
claudia heckmann was a teacher of english and german at the time .
she said the teaching staff did n't want their protest to lead to a closure of the school .
" we wanted to say that the school system was wrong , " she says now , " and that things must change at the roots . "
back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .
the hauptschule is perceived by many as a place for the " losers " in society , those who will probably end up on social welfare .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neukoelln district still has the image of a troubled immigrant neighborhood at the ruetli school , about 95 percent of the students have an immigrant background .
their parents mostly come from turkey , the balkans and arab countries .
campus ruetli after a recent reform to the school system in berlin , the ruetli school is now a gemeinschaftsschule or community school .
this new type of school has been introduced to give students a better chance of earning the qualifications they need to get jobs or even a university degree .
behind the hundred-year-old ruetli school building , bulldozers are currently levelling a 41,000 square meter -lrb- 10 acres -rrb- construction site , tearing down decrepit buildings and shacks in what used to be a small inner-city industrial area .
they 're making way for campus ruetli - a project which school authorities describe as a model of modern-type schooling that is meant to provide state-of-the-art education for children from pre-school age right up to graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work is changing both the face of the district and people 's minds once it has been completed , campus ruetli will include childcare facilities , a sports ground and a gym , and will incorporate three other schools that already exist close by .
dr. eric denton , an american who teaches english at the ruetli school , said it 's not just the teachers who " dream big " as a result of the new project : " politicians have realized that the way to save a community is to work through the school , to give the school a foundation and the resources it needs , " he says .
" the community gets an identity through the school , and the school benefits and prospers . "
the german government as well as the berlin city administration have earmarked a total of 25 million euros for the project , which is to be completed over the next few years .
changing attitudes about one million euros of this funding have already been spent on renovating the interior of the building .

back then the ruetli school was a kind of school known in german as a hauptschule - a school for students who are n't smart enough to make it to a better school .

how have israel and the european union responded to its progress in africa ? looking back at the last decade , iran has improved relations with african countries by turning to them for investment and trade as it has become more isolated by the west .
in africa , iran has engaged in economic and development projects in a number of countries : in senegal where khodro , iran 's largest car manufacturer , opened an assembly line in 2007 ; nigeria with which it has agreed to share nuclear technology for the production of electricity ; and it enjoys good relations with south africa -lrb- a regional leader -rrb- where its support of the anc during the apartheid era has meant that south africa has remained a true friend .
however , nowhere is the success of iran ’ s investment quite as clear as in sudan .
" iran has been successful in strengthening ties with sudan because the two countries have an ideological link .
they are standing up against the west and imperialism , " sanam vakil , an expert on iran at the johns hopkins university in washington dc , told deutsche welle .
why africa matters to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese president , abdoulaye wade , and iranian president , mahmoud ahmadinejad in dakar as a result of its isolation from the world -lrb- particularly the west -rrb- , iran has had to turn to africa in an effort to gain more relevance in global affairs .
" by strengthening its relationship with african countries , iran is trying to overcome its de facto isolation , " walter posch , a researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , told deutsche welle .
vakil agrees : " iran is always trying to expand its areas of diplomatic and economic influence to counterbalance against its own isolation , " she said .
in spite of all its efforts , iran 's success at extending its influence in africa remains unclear , " perhaps with the exception of sudan where there are iranian cars , " posch said .
with a reduction of military aid from china and russia , sudan two years ago turned to iran for help and signed a bilateral agreement that includes military cooperation with the country .
at a meeting late last year with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , his sudanese counterpart , deng alor , openly voiced his country 's support for iran 's nuclear ambitions .
israeli concerns iran 's nuclear ambitions are a threat to stability in the middle east , and naturally its progress in africa is being closely watched by israel .
in addition , israel wants to counterbalance iranian and islamic influence in africa , especially in the horn of africa which has a coastline with the red sea - a gateway to the suez canal .
therefore , israel has tried to establish friendly ties with the only non-islamic county in the horn of africa , ethiopia , which has also used israeli military aid to counter islamic militants in the southeast region which borders somalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethiopia has been using military aid from israel to arm itself against somali militias israel sees iran ’ s inroads in africa -lrb- especially in sudan -rrb- as a threat to its ability to garner african support at the un , and also as a threat to regional stability in the horn of africa because iran ’ s advances contribute to the growth of islam in the region .
in an attempt to counterbalance that perceived threat , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman visited ethiopia , kenya , uganda , ghana , and nigeria in september 2009 , and pledged israel ’ s support for these countries by promising development and economic aid .
europe turns a blind eye by and large , iran 's efforts at establishing better relations with african countries have remained largely ignored by the eu .
javier perez , the political advisor to the eu special representative for sudan told deutsche welle that " sudan is a high priority of the eu foreign policy in africa , but the interest of iran in africa is not being followed as of yet . "
according to posch , europe 's current stance may be due to the fact that iran 's trade and economic cooperation with africa pales in comparison to that of other countries like china , the us , and some european nations .
neverthless , johns hopkins university researcher vakil feels that " the europeans should be watching this because it is happening in europe 's backdoor . "

how have israel and the european union responded to its progress in africa ? looking back at the last decade , iran has improved relations with african countries by turning to them for investment and trade as it has become more isolated by the west .
in africa , iran has engaged in economic and development projects in a number of countries : in senegal where khodro , iran 's largest car manufacturer , opened an assembly line in 2007 ; nigeria with which it has agreed to share nuclear technology for the production of electricity ; and it enjoys good relations with south africa -lrb- a regional leader -rrb- where its support of the anc during the apartheid era has meant that south africa has remained a true friend .
however , nowhere is the success of iran ’ s investment quite as clear as in sudan .
" iran has been successful in strengthening ties with sudan because the two countries have an ideological link .
they are standing up against the west and imperialism , " sanam vakil , an expert on iran at the johns hopkins university in washington dc , told deutsche welle .
why africa matters to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese president , abdoulaye wade , and iranian president , mahmoud ahmadinejad in dakar as a result of its isolation from the world -lrb- particularly the west -rrb- , iran has had to turn to africa in an effort to gain more relevance in global affairs .
" by strengthening its relationship with african countries , iran is trying to overcome its de facto isolation , " walter posch , a researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , told deutsche welle .
vakil agrees : " iran is always trying to expand its areas of diplomatic and economic influence to counterbalance against its own isolation , " she said .
in spite of all its efforts , iran 's success at extending its influence in africa remains unclear , " perhaps with the exception of sudan where there are iranian cars , " posch said .
with a reduction of military aid from china and russia , sudan two years ago turned to iran for help and signed a bilateral agreement that includes military cooperation with the country .
at a meeting late last year with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , his sudanese counterpart , deng alor , openly voiced his country 's support for iran 's nuclear ambitions .
israeli concerns iran 's nuclear ambitions are a threat to stability in the middle east , and naturally its progress in africa is being closely watched by israel .
in addition , israel wants to counterbalance iranian and islamic influence in africa , especially in the horn of africa which has a coastline with the red sea - a gateway to the suez canal .
therefore , israel has tried to establish friendly ties with the only non-islamic county in the horn of africa , ethiopia , which has also used israeli military aid to counter islamic militants in the southeast region which borders somalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethiopia has been using military aid from israel to arm itself against somali militias israel sees iran ’ s inroads in africa -lrb- especially in sudan -rrb- as a threat to its ability to garner african support at the un , and also as a threat to regional stability in the horn of africa because iran ’ s advances contribute to the growth of islam in the region .
in an attempt to counterbalance that perceived threat , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman visited ethiopia , kenya , uganda , ghana , and nigeria in september 2009 , and pledged israel ’ s support for these countries by promising development and economic aid .
europe turns a blind eye by and large , iran 's efforts at establishing better relations with african countries have remained largely ignored by the eu .
javier perez , the political advisor to the eu special representative for sudan told deutsche welle that " sudan is a high priority of the eu foreign policy in africa , but the interest of iran in africa is not being followed as of yet . "
according to posch , europe 's current stance may be due to the fact that iran 's trade and economic cooperation with africa pales in comparison to that of other countries like china , the us , and some european nations .
neverthless , johns hopkins university researcher vakil feels that " the europeans should be watching this because it is happening in europe 's backdoor . "

with a reduction of military aid from china and russia , sudan two years ago turned to iran for help and signed a bilateral agreement that includes military cooperation with the country .
at a meeting late last year with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , his sudanese counterpart , deng alor , openly voiced his country 's support for iran 's nuclear ambitions .
israeli concerns iran 's nuclear ambitions are a threat to stability in the middle east , and naturally its progress in africa is being closely watched by israel .
in addition , israel wants to counterbalance iranian and islamic influence in africa , especially in the horn of africa which has a coastline with the red sea - a gateway to the suez canal .
therefore , israel has tried to establish friendly ties with the only non-islamic county in the horn of africa , ethiopia , which has also used israeli military aid to counter islamic militants in the southeast region which borders somalia .

in an attempt to counterbalance that perceived threat , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman visited ethiopia , kenya , uganda , ghana , and nigeria in september 2009 , and pledged israel ’ s support for these countries by promising development and economic aid .
europe turns a blind eye by and large , iran 's efforts at establishing better relations with african countries have remained largely ignored by the eu .
javier perez , the political advisor to the eu special representative for sudan told deutsche welle that " sudan is a high priority of the eu foreign policy in africa , but the interest of iran in africa is not being followed as of yet . "
according to posch , europe 's current stance may be due to the fact that iran 's trade and economic cooperation with africa pales in comparison to that of other countries like china , the us , and some european nations .
neverthless , johns hopkins university researcher vakil feels that " the europeans should be watching this because it is happening in europe 's backdoor . "

this came despite anni friesinger-postma 's fall in the semi-finals . the three-woman speed skating team claimed germany 's tenth gold medal on saturday evening following a stunning final race against the japanese team .
stephanie beckert , daniela anschuetz-thoms and katrin mattscherodt crossed the finish line only 0.02 seconds ahead of the japanese , who dominated the first few laps of the three-kilometer race .
the japanese team , comprising masako hozumi , maki tabata and nao kodaira , got off to an immense start and soon built up a lead of over 1.7 seconds in the first part of the race - a small eternity on a speed skating rink .
the germans steadily hauled back the advantage , but were still around three quarters of a second behind going into the final lap .

the 16-time world champion slid over the finish line on her belly and pounded the ice in despair , convinced that she had ruined her team 's chances of a medal .
thirty seconds later , one could only guess at friesinger-postma 's emotions as she looked up at the score board and realized she had still done enough to finish 0.23 seconds ahead of the us team .
following this nerve-racking finish , team coach markus eicher decided not to risk the exhausted friesinger-postma in the final , which took place only an hour and a half later .
in that race , stephanie beckert 's extraordinary final drive proved the decisive factor .
friesinger-postma paid tribute to beckert 's explosive performance in the final , in which she led the last two laps .
" that was a rollercoaster for the emotions , " she said .
" she was our steam engine .
she pulled our girls through those two laps . "
beckert has already won two silver medals in the individual speed skating events .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 28.02.2010 iran makes inroads in parts of africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is trying to spread its influence in africa iran has taken an interest in improving relations with african countries in recent years by investing in senegal , nigeria , and sudan .
how have israel and the european union responded to its progress in africa ? looking back at the last decade , iran has improved relations with african countries by turning to them for investment and trade as it has become more isolated by the west .
in africa , iran has engaged in economic and development projects in a number of countries : in senegal where khodro , iran 's largest car manufacturer , opened an assembly line in 2007 ; nigeria with which it has agreed to share nuclear technology for the production of electricity ; and it enjoys good relations with south africa -lrb- a regional leader -rrb- where its support of the anc during the apartheid era has meant that south africa has remained a true friend .
however , nowhere is the success of iran ’ s investment quite as clear as in sudan .
" iran has been successful in strengthening ties with sudan because the two countries have an ideological link .
they are standing up against the west and imperialism , " sanam vakil , an expert on iran at the johns hopkins university in washington dc , told deutsche welle .
why africa matters to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese president , abdoulaye wade , and iranian president , mahmoud ahmadinejad in dakar as a result of its isolation from the world -lrb- particularly the west -rrb- , iran has had to turn to africa in an effort to gain more relevance in global affairs .
" by strengthening its relationship with african countries , iran is trying to overcome its de facto isolation , " walter posch , a researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , told deutsche welle .
vakil agrees : " iran is always trying to expand its areas of diplomatic and economic influence to counterbalance against its own isolation , " she said .
in spite of all its efforts , iran 's success at extending its influence in africa remains unclear , " perhaps with the exception of sudan where there are iranian cars , " posch said .
with a reduction of military aid from china and russia , sudan two years ago turned to iran for help and signed a bilateral agreement that includes military cooperation with the country .
at a meeting late last year with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , his sudanese counterpart , deng alor , openly voiced his country 's support for iran 's nuclear ambitions .
israeli concerns iran 's nuclear ambitions are a threat to stability in the middle east , and naturally its progress in africa is being closely watched by israel .
in addition , israel wants to counterbalance iranian and islamic influence in africa , especially in the horn of africa which has a coastline with the red sea - a gateway to the suez canal .
therefore , israel has tried to establish friendly ties with the only non-islamic county in the horn of africa , ethiopia , which has also used israeli military aid to counter islamic militants in the southeast region which borders somalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethiopia has been using military aid from israel to arm itself against somali militias israel sees iran ’ s inroads in africa -lrb- especially in sudan -rrb- as a threat to its ability to garner african support at the un , and also as a threat to regional stability in the horn of africa because iran ’ s advances contribute to the growth of islam in the region .
in an attempt to counterbalance that perceived threat , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman visited ethiopia , kenya , uganda , ghana , and nigeria in september 2009 , and pledged israel ’ s support for these countries by promising development and economic aid .
europe turns a blind eye by and large , iran 's efforts at establishing better relations with african countries have remained largely ignored by the eu .
javier perez , the political advisor to the eu special representative for sudan told deutsche welle that " sudan is a high priority of the eu foreign policy in africa , but the interest of iran in africa is not being followed as of yet . "
according to posch , europe 's current stance may be due to the fact that iran 's trade and economic cooperation with africa pales in comparison to that of other countries like china , the us , and some european nations .
neverthless , johns hopkins university researcher vakil feels that " the europeans should be watching this because it is happening in europe 's backdoor . "

in an attempt to counterbalance that perceived threat , israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman visited ethiopia , kenya , uganda , ghana , and nigeria in september 2009 , and pledged israel ’ s support for these countries by promising development and economic aid .

according to posch , europe 's current stance may be due to the fact that iran 's trade and economic cooperation with africa pales in comparison to that of other countries like china , the us , and some european nations .

how have israel and the european union responded to its progress in africa ? looking back at the last decade , iran has improved relations with african countries by turning to them for investment and trade as it has become more isolated by the west .
in africa , iran has engaged in economic and development projects in a number of countries : in senegal where khodro , iran 's largest car manufacturer , opened an assembly line in 2007 ; nigeria with which it has agreed to share nuclear technology for the production of electricity ; and it enjoys good relations with south africa -lrb- a regional leader -rrb- where its support of the anc during the apartheid era has meant that south africa has remained a true friend .
however , nowhere is the success of iran ’ s investment quite as clear as in sudan .
" iran has been successful in strengthening ties with sudan because the two countries have an ideological link .
they are standing up against the west and imperialism , " sanam vakil , an expert on iran at the johns hopkins university in washington dc , told deutsche welle .
why africa matters to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senegalese president , abdoulaye wade , and iranian president , mahmoud ahmadinejad in dakar as a result of its isolation from the world -lrb- particularly the west -rrb- , iran has had to turn to africa in an effort to gain more relevance in global affairs .
" by strengthening its relationship with african countries , iran is trying to overcome its de facto isolation , " walter posch , a researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin , told deutsche welle .
vakil agrees : " iran is always trying to expand its areas of diplomatic and economic influence to counterbalance against its own isolation , " she said .
in spite of all its efforts , iran 's success at extending its influence in africa remains unclear , " perhaps with the exception of sudan where there are iranian cars , " posch said .
with a reduction of military aid from china and russia , sudan two years ago turned to iran for help and signed a bilateral agreement that includes military cooperation with the country .
at a meeting late last year with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , his sudanese counterpart , deng alor , openly voiced his country 's support for iran 's nuclear ambitions .
israeli concerns iran 's nuclear ambitions are a threat to stability in the middle east , and naturally its progress in africa is being closely watched by israel .
in addition , israel wants to counterbalance iranian and islamic influence in africa , especially in the horn of africa which has a coastline with the red sea - a gateway to the suez canal .
