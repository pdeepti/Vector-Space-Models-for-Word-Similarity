street view allows users to look at photos of individual streets at ground level all over the world , with images taken from specially equipped vehicles .
the panoramic views of cities in the us , japan , australia and parts of europe are already available online .
the product is a supplement to google 's maps .
the german government complained that this software could encroach on the privacy of its citizens .
aigner argued that thieves could use the pictures of houses to gauge people 's wealth and prepare burglaries , and that people 's pictures might be published online without their consent .
aigner 's aides said the minister told google that " what is private has to stay private . "
opting out google now says it will wait until later this year to launch its german images to give people the chance to file complaints .
anyone who wishes can have the image of their house blocked out , and google has promised to obscure any faces present in the pictures .
the company has offered this same service to people around the world , but retroactively , removing the images only after publishing them .
for germany , it is agreeing to do its editing beforehand where possible .
privacy concerns are a particularly contentious issue in germany , due to the abuses by hitler 's nazi government and the communist rulers of the former east germany in the past. msh / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 01.05.2010 credit rating agencies under a harsh spotlight again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger is mounting over the role and influence of rating agencies european politicians are fuming over the us credit ratings agencies and their role in various financial crises .
but some experts say it was governments who allowed rating firms to gain too much power in the first place . after stocks and the euro took a tumble this week on the announcement that credit rating agency standard and poor 's was downgrading greece 's credit rating to junk status , new calls have gone out for ratings agencies to act " responsibly " and for the creation of an independent european rating agency . but responsibility is not a word that has been associated with credit ratings agencies much in the wake of the global financial crisis , especially after it emerged that the business practices of the big three us ratings firms - standard and poor 's , moody 's and fitch - played a central role in helping bring about the economic meltdown . " we should not make the welfare of europe dependent on ratings agencies , " peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's independent economic advisory panel , told the newspaper die welt . german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who called for a european credit rating agency , said rating agencies must not develop , sell and rate financial products at the same time . " conflicts of interest are guaranteed , " he said . a matter of accuracy a top international monetary fund official questioned the agencies ' accuracy , arguing that that their assessments reflect mainly investors ' perceptions of a nation 's financial health . " that 's why you should n't believe too much in what they say , " imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle wants a european ratings agency but according to manfred jäger-ambrozewicz of the cologne institute of business research , government regulators and governments themselves , who also depend on ratings agencies analysis , have played a role in the increase of the agencies ' influence . " it 's kind of ridiculous that they 've turned on them now , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are the ones who have largely given them so much power . " he added that the creation of a new european ratings agency would be possible , but that agencies are built on their reputations , and it would take some time for a brand-new ratings entity to become credible . " but if in addition to the private rating we had something from a semi-state agency or a rating by a body like the imf or the european central bank , that could be helpful , " jäger-ambrozewicz said . later this year , new eu rules which were hammered out last year will apply some regulation on already-existing agencies that operate in europe . the rules , which go into effect in december , will oblige the agencies to disclose information about the models and methods on which their ratings are based and require adherence to new corporate governance standards meant to guard against potential conflicts of interest . risk assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standard and poor 's rating downgrade for greece sent stocks and the euro tumbling credit ratings agencies began their lives as market researchers , analyzing corporate debt for people or groups considering whether or not to purchase that debt .
potential buyers depend on ratings to determine the credit risk involved . for most of their existence , rating agencies answered a simple , but critical question : if i loan somebody money by buying one of their bonds , am i going to get that money back ? the agencies developed a grading system to indicate the sureness of the investment .
companies , cities and countries get rated .
standard and poor 's gives ibm its top rating , meaning there is very low risk .
argentina , on the other hand , gets the equivalent of a b- . for investors , ratings agencies are supposed to provide independent measurements of credit risk , which in turn increases market efficiency , and adds to the supply of risk capital in the market , which can lead to stronger growth . mission creep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit rating agencies are now in the crosshairs starting in the 1970s , credit rating agencies began to get more powerful and these days , a significant bond issuance must have at least one rating from a respected ratings agency to be successful . by the early 1980s , a different kind of bond appeared on the scene : so-called structured finance instruments such as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations .
those are the now infamous complex financial creations made up of thousands of loans and mortgages bundled together and then sold as bonds .
in effect , they became almost too complex for ratings agencies to get a handle on , but they rated them anyway , usually positively . " mixing cocktails of risk , you really want to know what is the percentage of alcohol in the drinks , " said irwin collier , a professor of finance at berlin 's free university .
" financial innovation is a good thing , but what is bad is when the information gets falsified . " initial success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rating agencies trippled their revenues between 2002 and 2007 it was the rise and initial success of those complex financial instruments that led the three big rating agencies down a path of great financial gain for themselves , but disaster for economy as a whole .
they began looking for ways to give their seal of approval to bonds , even working directly with the bond issuer .
and that , critics say , drove a stake in the heart of their neutrality . ratings agencies make their money by charging fees to those they rated , creating an inherent conflict of interest . furthermore , if moody 's , for example , indicated to a bond issuer that it was not willing to give it a good rating , the issuer could simply go over to standard and poor 's or fitch , whichever would be willing to provide the aaa imprimatur . it was in the agencies ' own financial interest to work with bond issuers to find a way to give out these top ratings .
and agencies ' pursued that interest aggressively .
between 2002 and 2007 , the firms tripled their revenues . " it 's like the parties in court paying the judge 's salary , " said us senator carl levin at a hearing last week in washington that looked into whether the agencies failed to provide honest assessments of securities to investors . poor performance , poor oversight the credit agencies ' track record is not very impressive .
according to the new york times , of aaa-rated subprime-mortgage-backed securities issued in 2006 , 93 percent have been downgraded to junk status .
they failed to foresee the collapse of the us housing market . the agencies are not overseen by the us securities and exchange commission , and they have escaped any legal liability by claiming that their ratings are just opinions , protected by the american first amendment right to free speech . while the credibility of the big agencies has been hit , they are still the only game in town and have tremendous power , as the reaction to the greek debt rating and subsequent ratings about portugal and spain have shown . " the markets are still listening , that 's clear , " collier said . author : kyle james editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a prominent iranian scholar argues that islam is integral to european society . hamid dabashi is an american-iranian intellectual historian who has studied iran and shia islam from a postcolonial perspective .
he 's currently hagop kervokian professor of iranian studies at columbia university in new york . deutsche welle : in europe , many muslims live in ' parallel societies ' , in the states there 's no such problem .
why are american muslims so much better integrated ?
hamid dabashi : the arab-muslim immigration in the united states has historically been quite minimal , very , very minuscule compared to others .
the basic impetus behind immigration is economic .
capital - in my judgement - is color-blind , and gender-neutral .
you can trace the history of feminist movements around the world , for example , to the necessity of cheap labor , that 's when women entered the job market , and as workers began demanding and exacting more rights .
the same is true for immigrants : they are paid less than others .
so if you are , for example , lebanese , or sudanese , or turkish , or iranian , or pakistani , coming to the united states , entering the job market , it has absolutely nothing to do with your religion ; it is entirely irrelevant .
europe , in my judgement , has successfully posited the myth of a more homogenous cultural entity for itself .
a combination of self-secularized christianity , and - after the horrors of the holocaust - the manufacturing of a " judeo-christian " identity has given europe a renewed reliance on the myth of its origin .
and then , of course , there is the french revolution , the enlightenment , the unification of europe , and the post-soviet reconstruction of a european identity .
europe itself , in this renewed conception of itself , has enough problems now of assimilating the eastern european to the domain of its collective identity .
the idea of europe , historically , is really limited to that of the western europe . when giscard d 'estaing talks about not accepting the turks in the european union , he speaks a christian language , despite his self-secularized conception of who he is and what he stands for .
so the problem europe has with muslims coming from africa , coming from the middle east , coming from south asia is , in part , a reflection of its own inner anxieties with two sorts of europeans - eastern europeans and muslim europeans .
here is an issue that since the time of austria-hungarian imperial rivalry with the ottomans has been a very disconcerting issue for the idea of " europe , " i.e. the notion of muslim europe .
so for all of these reasons , europe has a more difficult time assimilating its muslims than the us .
so with all these integration difficulties already , is it , do you think , too much for the european mind to cope with the idea of turkey becoming part of the european union ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could benefit on several fronts by making turkey a member dabashi : well , that 's obviously something for the aging and thinning population of white europeans to decide .
because of the well being of europeans over many years , europe is an ageing society .
as a result , it needs labour - the cheaper the labor the better - that 's the logic of capital .
and yet labor comes with a baggage .
the european economy needs cheap labor , but european culture does n't like the fact that , ultimately , culture will be influenced by labor migration .
this is the dilemma that europe faces : it wants to have its cake and eat it , too .
but this is what we 're facing right now ; it 's a clash between culture and capital .
would you , then , say that " european islam , " the idea of islam becoming part of a european culture , more modern , more moderate , is also a false concept in this respect ?
dabashi : my problem with tariq ramadan -lrb- swiss muslim scholar - ed . -rrb- is that he thinks if he just writes it , it will happen .
islam , by virtue of european muslims , has to contend with other european moral , intellectual , imaginative , and political forces .
the difference between someone like me and tariq ramadan is that i do n't think of islam , i think of muslims .
muslims have precedent .
islam is an abstraction .
so whether giscard d 'estaing likes it or not , islam - by virtue of labour migration , by virtue of muslims walking in the streets of paris , and london etc . - becomes integral to the european society - it already is ; and as a result the collective disposition of the culture will change , too .
in effect , the changes are going to be made by social forces , not by muslim intellectuals . but are you confident this is going to happen ?
because if you argue this way everyone who is an islamist will inevitably deny this because he knows that if he 's willing to accept it his faith is going to be powerless one day in the foreseeable future .
if you look at europe , the power of religion , its influence on society has decreased ever since the enlightenment .
dabashi : forget about europe for now - if you go to india and go to saudi arabia and go to morocco and go to china you have four different kinds of islam .
islam is not quintessential .
it is a sacred language spoken in different dialects by people living different lives .
so by the same logic when muslims come to europe , they will redefine islam .
and there is nobody on planet earth who can tell them , what you 're doing is not islamic , you 're losing your religion .
the successive generations will redefine islam .
this is what i have against mandatory laws against veiling .
veiling will persist or else be modified by second and third generation muslims .
when they 're going to school , if they do n't want to wear it , they wo n't , if they want to wear it , they will .
if there is force at home for them to wear it , gradually , that force will be contexualized by other forces , by peer pressure , by forces of the market , by mass and globalized culture .
the thing that you do n't want is to have the state come and tell you what clothing item you can wear or can not wear .
back to the issue of turkey : what is your personal opinion , should europe ask turkey to become a member of the european union ?
dabashi : i think the membership of turkey in the european union will inevitably happen .
first , it will provide the european economy with cheap labor .
second it will expand the eu in terms of raw material available in turkey .
third , it will expand the european economic market .
fourth , it will strategically strengthen europe in terms of its inevitable rivalries with the united states in the region .
so economically , politically and militarily , it is to the benefit of europe .
and many of my progressive turkish colleagues are very happy about this move because they think that the questions of women 's rights , human rights , freedom of expression will have a catalytic effect on turkey as well .

a prominent iranian scholar argues that islam is integral to european society . hamid dabashi is an american-iranian intellectual historian who has studied iran and shia islam from a postcolonial perspective .
he 's currently hagop kervokian professor of iranian studies at columbia university in new york . deutsche welle : in europe , many muslims live in ' parallel societies ' , in the states there 's no such problem .
why are american muslims so much better integrated ?
hamid dabashi : the arab-muslim immigration in the united states has historically been quite minimal , very , very minuscule compared to others .
the basic impetus behind immigration is economic .
capital - in my judgement - is color-blind , and gender-neutral .
you can trace the history of feminist movements around the world , for example , to the necessity of cheap labor , that 's when women entered the job market , and as workers began demanding and exacting more rights .
the same is true for immigrants : they are paid less than others .
so if you are , for example , lebanese , or sudanese , or turkish , or iranian , or pakistani , coming to the united states , entering the job market , it has absolutely nothing to do with your religion ; it is entirely irrelevant .
europe , in my judgement , has successfully posited the myth of a more homogenous cultural entity for itself .
a combination of self-secularized christianity , and - after the horrors of the holocaust - the manufacturing of a " judeo-christian " identity has given europe a renewed reliance on the myth of its origin .
and then , of course , there is the french revolution , the enlightenment , the unification of europe , and the post-soviet reconstruction of a european identity .
europe itself , in this renewed conception of itself , has enough problems now of assimilating the eastern european to the domain of its collective identity .
the idea of europe , historically , is really limited to that of the western europe . when giscard d 'estaing talks about not accepting the turks in the european union , he speaks a christian language , despite his self-secularized conception of who he is and what he stands for .
so the problem europe has with muslims coming from africa , coming from the middle east , coming from south asia is , in part , a reflection of its own inner anxieties with two sorts of europeans - eastern europeans and muslim europeans .
here is an issue that since the time of austria-hungarian imperial rivalry with the ottomans has been a very disconcerting issue for the idea of " europe , " i.e. the notion of muslim europe .
so for all of these reasons , europe has a more difficult time assimilating its muslims than the us .
so with all these integration difficulties already , is it , do you think , too much for the european mind to cope with the idea of turkey becoming part of the european union ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could benefit on several fronts by making turkey a member dabashi : well , that 's obviously something for the aging and thinning population of white europeans to decide .
because of the well being of europeans over many years , europe is an ageing society .
as a result , it needs labour - the cheaper the labor the better - that 's the logic of capital .
and yet labor comes with a baggage .
the european economy needs cheap labor , but european culture does n't like the fact that , ultimately , culture will be influenced by labor migration .
this is the dilemma that europe faces : it wants to have its cake and eat it , too .
but this is what we 're facing right now ; it 's a clash between culture and capital .
would you , then , say that " european islam , " the idea of islam becoming part of a european culture , more modern , more moderate , is also a false concept in this respect ?
dabashi : my problem with tariq ramadan -lrb- swiss muslim scholar - ed . -rrb- is that he thinks if he just writes it , it will happen .
islam , by virtue of european muslims , has to contend with other european moral , intellectual , imaginative , and political forces .
the difference between someone like me and tariq ramadan is that i do n't think of islam , i think of muslims .
muslims have precedent .
islam is an abstraction .
so whether giscard d 'estaing likes it or not , islam - by virtue of labour migration , by virtue of muslims walking in the streets of paris , and london etc . - becomes integral to the european society - it already is ; and as a result the collective disposition of the culture will change , too .
in effect , the changes are going to be made by social forces , not by muslim intellectuals . but are you confident this is going to happen ?
because if you argue this way everyone who is an islamist will inevitably deny this because he knows that if he 's willing to accept it his faith is going to be powerless one day in the foreseeable future .
if you look at europe , the power of religion , its influence on society has decreased ever since the enlightenment .
dabashi : forget about europe for now - if you go to india and go to saudi arabia and go to morocco and go to china you have four different kinds of islam .
islam is not quintessential .
it is a sacred language spoken in different dialects by people living different lives .
so by the same logic when muslims come to europe , they will redefine islam .
and there is nobody on planet earth who can tell them , what you 're doing is not islamic , you 're losing your religion .
the successive generations will redefine islam .
this is what i have against mandatory laws against veiling .
veiling will persist or else be modified by second and third generation muslims .
when they 're going to school , if they do n't want to wear it , they wo n't , if they want to wear it , they will .
if there is force at home for them to wear it , gradually , that force will be contexualized by other forces , by peer pressure , by forces of the market , by mass and globalized culture .
the thing that you do n't want is to have the state come and tell you what clothing item you can wear or can not wear .
back to the issue of turkey : what is your personal opinion , should europe ask turkey to become a member of the european union ?
dabashi : i think the membership of turkey in the european union will inevitably happen .
first , it will provide the european economy with cheap labor .
second it will expand the eu in terms of raw material available in turkey .
third , it will expand the european economic market .
fourth , it will strategically strengthen europe in terms of its inevitable rivalries with the united states in the region .
so economically , politically and militarily , it is to the benefit of europe .
and many of my progressive turkish colleagues are very happy about this move because they think that the questions of women 's rights , human rights , freedom of expression will have a catalytic effect on turkey as well .
so it seems like a happy marriage .

so economically , politically and militarily , it is to the benefit of europe .
and many of my progressive turkish colleagues are very happy about this move because they think that the questions of women 's rights , human rights , freedom of expression will have a catalytic effect on turkey as well .

street view allows users to look at photos of individual streets at ground level all over the world , with images taken from specially equipped vehicles .
the panoramic views of cities in the us , japan , australia and parts of europe are already available online .
the product is a supplement to google 's maps .
the german government complained that this software could encroach on the privacy of its citizens .
aigner argued that thieves could use the pictures of houses to gauge people 's wealth and prepare burglaries , and that people 's pictures might be published online without their consent .
aigner 's aides said the minister told google that " what is private has to stay private . "
opting out google now says it will wait until later this year to launch its german images to give people the chance to file complaints .
anyone who wishes can have the image of their house blocked out , and google has promised to obscure any faces present in the pictures .

street view allows users to look at photos of individual streets at ground level all over the world , with images taken from specially equipped vehicles .
the panoramic views of cities in the us , japan , australia and parts of europe are already available online .
the product is a supplement to google 's maps .
the german government complained that this software could encroach on the privacy of its citizens .
aigner argued that thieves could use the pictures of houses to gauge people 's wealth and prepare burglaries , and that people 's pictures might be published online without their consent .
aigner 's aides said the minister told google that " what is private has to stay private . "
opting out google now says it will wait until later this year to launch its german images to give people the chance to file complaints .
anyone who wishes can have the image of their house blocked out , and google has promised to obscure any faces present in the pictures .
the company has offered this same service to people around the world , but retroactively , removing the images only after publishing them .
for germany , it is agreeing to do its editing beforehand where possible .
privacy concerns are a particularly contentious issue in germany , due to the abuses by hitler 's nazi government and the communist rulers of the former east germany in the past. msh / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 01.05.2010 credit rating agencies under a harsh spotlight again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger is mounting over the role and influence of rating agencies european politicians are fuming over the us credit ratings agencies and their role in various financial crises .
but some experts say it was governments who allowed rating firms to gain too much power in the first place . after stocks and the euro took a tumble this week on the announcement that credit rating agency standard and poor 's was downgrading greece 's credit rating to junk status , new calls have gone out for ratings agencies to act " responsibly " and for the creation of an independent european rating agency . but responsibility is not a word that has been associated with credit ratings agencies much in the wake of the global financial crisis , especially after it emerged that the business practices of the big three us ratings firms - standard and poor 's , moody 's and fitch - played a central role in helping bring about the economic meltdown . " we should not make the welfare of europe dependent on ratings agencies , " peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's independent economic advisory panel , told the newspaper die welt . german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who called for a european credit rating agency , said rating agencies must not develop , sell and rate financial products at the same time . " conflicts of interest are guaranteed , " he said . a matter of accuracy a top international monetary fund official questioned the agencies ' accuracy , arguing that that their assessments reflect mainly investors ' perceptions of a nation 's financial health . " that 's why you should n't believe too much in what they say , " imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle wants a european ratings agency but according to manfred jäger-ambrozewicz of the cologne institute of business research , government regulators and governments themselves , who also depend on ratings agencies analysis , have played a role in the increase of the agencies ' influence . " it 's kind of ridiculous that they 've turned on them now , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are the ones who have largely given them so much power . " he added that the creation of a new european ratings agency would be possible , but that agencies are built on their reputations , and it would take some time for a brand-new ratings entity to become credible . " but if in addition to the private rating we had something from a semi-state agency or a rating by a body like the imf or the european central bank , that could be helpful , " jäger-ambrozewicz said . later this year , new eu rules which were hammered out last year will apply some regulation on already-existing agencies that operate in europe . the rules , which go into effect in december , will oblige the agencies to disclose information about the models and methods on which their ratings are based and require adherence to new corporate governance standards meant to guard against potential conflicts of interest . risk assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standard and poor 's rating downgrade for greece sent stocks and the euro tumbling credit ratings agencies began their lives as market researchers , analyzing corporate debt for people or groups considering whether or not to purchase that debt .
potential buyers depend on ratings to determine the credit risk involved . for most of their existence , rating agencies answered a simple , but critical question : if i loan somebody money by buying one of their bonds , am i going to get that money back ? the agencies developed a grading system to indicate the sureness of the investment .
companies , cities and countries get rated .
standard and poor 's gives ibm its top rating , meaning there is very low risk .
argentina , on the other hand , gets the equivalent of a b- . for investors , ratings agencies are supposed to provide independent measurements of credit risk , which in turn increases market efficiency , and adds to the supply of risk capital in the market , which can lead to stronger growth . mission creep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit rating agencies are now in the crosshairs starting in the 1970s , credit rating agencies began to get more powerful and these days , a significant bond issuance must have at least one rating from a respected ratings agency to be successful . by the early 1980s , a different kind of bond appeared on the scene : so-called structured finance instruments such as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations .
those are the now infamous complex financial creations made up of thousands of loans and mortgages bundled together and then sold as bonds .
in effect , they became almost too complex for ratings agencies to get a handle on , but they rated them anyway , usually positively . " mixing cocktails of risk , you really want to know what is the percentage of alcohol in the drinks , " said irwin collier , a professor of finance at berlin 's free university .
" financial innovation is a good thing , but what is bad is when the information gets falsified . " initial success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rating agencies trippled their revenues between 2002 and 2007 it was the rise and initial success of those complex financial instruments that led the three big rating agencies down a path of great financial gain for themselves , but disaster for economy as a whole .
they began looking for ways to give their seal of approval to bonds , even working directly with the bond issuer .
and that , critics say , drove a stake in the heart of their neutrality . ratings agencies make their money by charging fees to those they rated , creating an inherent conflict of interest . furthermore , if moody 's , for example , indicated to a bond issuer that it was not willing to give it a good rating , the issuer could simply go over to standard and poor 's or fitch , whichever would be willing to provide the aaa imprimatur . it was in the agencies ' own financial interest to work with bond issuers to find a way to give out these top ratings .
and agencies ' pursued that interest aggressively .
between 2002 and 2007 , the firms tripled their revenues . " it 's like the parties in court paying the judge 's salary , " said us senator carl levin at a hearing last week in washington that looked into whether the agencies failed to provide honest assessments of securities to investors . poor performance , poor oversight the credit agencies ' track record is not very impressive .
according to the new york times , of aaa-rated subprime-mortgage-backed securities issued in 2006 , 93 percent have been downgraded to junk status .
they failed to foresee the collapse of the us housing market . the agencies are not overseen by the us securities and exchange commission , and they have escaped any legal liability by claiming that their ratings are just opinions , protected by the american first amendment right to free speech . while the credibility of the big agencies has been hit , they are still the only game in town and have tremendous power , as the reaction to the greek debt rating and subsequent ratings about portugal and spain have shown . " the markets are still listening , that 's clear , " collier said . author : kyle james editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a prominent iranian scholar argues that islam is integral to european society . hamid dabashi is an american-iranian intellectual historian who has studied iran and shia islam from a postcolonial perspective .
he 's currently hagop kervokian professor of iranian studies at columbia university in new york . deutsche welle : in europe , many muslims live in ' parallel societies ' , in the states there 's no such problem .
why are american muslims so much better integrated ?
hamid dabashi : the arab-muslim immigration in the united states has historically been quite minimal , very , very minuscule compared to others .
the basic impetus behind immigration is economic .
capital - in my judgement - is color-blind , and gender-neutral .
you can trace the history of feminist movements around the world , for example , to the necessity of cheap labor , that 's when women entered the job market , and as workers began demanding and exacting more rights .
the same is true for immigrants : they are paid less than others .
so if you are , for example , lebanese , or sudanese , or turkish , or iranian , or pakistani , coming to the united states , entering the job market , it has absolutely nothing to do with your religion ; it is entirely irrelevant .
europe , in my judgement , has successfully posited the myth of a more homogenous cultural entity for itself .
a combination of self-secularized christianity , and - after the horrors of the holocaust - the manufacturing of a " judeo-christian " identity has given europe a renewed reliance on the myth of its origin .
and then , of course , there is the french revolution , the enlightenment , the unification of europe , and the post-soviet reconstruction of a european identity .
europe itself , in this renewed conception of itself , has enough problems now of assimilating the eastern european to the domain of its collective identity .
the idea of europe , historically , is really limited to that of the western europe . when giscard d 'estaing talks about not accepting the turks in the european union , he speaks a christian language , despite his self-secularized conception of who he is and what he stands for .
so the problem europe has with muslims coming from africa , coming from the middle east , coming from south asia is , in part , a reflection of its own inner anxieties with two sorts of europeans - eastern europeans and muslim europeans .
here is an issue that since the time of austria-hungarian imperial rivalry with the ottomans has been a very disconcerting issue for the idea of " europe , " i.e. the notion of muslim europe .
so for all of these reasons , europe has a more difficult time assimilating its muslims than the us .
so with all these integration difficulties already , is it , do you think , too much for the european mind to cope with the idea of turkey becoming part of the european union ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could benefit on several fronts by making turkey a member dabashi : well , that 's obviously something for the aging and thinning population of white europeans to decide .
because of the well being of europeans over many years , europe is an ageing society .
as a result , it needs labour - the cheaper the labor the better - that 's the logic of capital .
and yet labor comes with a baggage .
the european economy needs cheap labor , but european culture does n't like the fact that , ultimately , culture will be influenced by labor migration .
this is the dilemma that europe faces : it wants to have its cake and eat it , too .
but this is what we 're facing right now ; it 's a clash between culture and capital .
would you , then , say that " european islam , " the idea of islam becoming part of a european culture , more modern , more moderate , is also a false concept in this respect ?
dabashi : my problem with tariq ramadan -lrb- swiss muslim scholar - ed . -rrb- is that he thinks if he just writes it , it will happen .
islam , by virtue of european muslims , has to contend with other european moral , intellectual , imaginative , and political forces .
the difference between someone like me and tariq ramadan is that i do n't think of islam , i think of muslims .
muslims have precedent .
islam is an abstraction .
so whether giscard d 'estaing likes it or not , islam - by virtue of labour migration , by virtue of muslims walking in the streets of paris , and london etc . - becomes integral to the european society - it already is ; and as a result the collective disposition of the culture will change , too .
in effect , the changes are going to be made by social forces , not by muslim intellectuals . but are you confident this is going to happen ?
because if you argue this way everyone who is an islamist will inevitably deny this because he knows that if he 's willing to accept it his faith is going to be powerless one day in the foreseeable future .
if you look at europe , the power of religion , its influence on society has decreased ever since the enlightenment .
dabashi : forget about europe for now - if you go to india and go to saudi arabia and go to morocco and go to china you have four different kinds of islam .
islam is not quintessential .
it is a sacred language spoken in different dialects by people living different lives .
so by the same logic when muslims come to europe , they will redefine islam .
and there is nobody on planet earth who can tell them , what you 're doing is not islamic , you 're losing your religion .
the successive generations will redefine islam .
this is what i have against mandatory laws against veiling .
veiling will persist or else be modified by second and third generation muslims .
when they 're going to school , if they do n't want to wear it , they wo n't , if they want to wear it , they will .
if there is force at home for them to wear it , gradually , that force will be contexualized by other forces , by peer pressure , by forces of the market , by mass and globalized culture .
the thing that you do n't want is to have the state come and tell you what clothing item you can wear or can not wear .
back to the issue of turkey : what is your personal opinion , should europe ask turkey to become a member of the european union ?
dabashi : i think the membership of turkey in the european union will inevitably happen .
first , it will provide the european economy with cheap labor .
second it will expand the eu in terms of raw material available in turkey .
third , it will expand the european economic market .
fourth , it will strategically strengthen europe in terms of its inevitable rivalries with the united states in the region .
so economically , politically and militarily , it is to the benefit of europe .
and many of my progressive turkish colleagues are very happy about this move because they think that the questions of women 's rights , human rights , freedom of expression will have a catalytic effect on turkey as well .
so it seems like a happy marriage .

islam , by virtue of european muslims , has to contend with other european moral , intellectual , imaginative , and political forces .
the difference between someone like me and tariq ramadan is that i do n't think of islam , i think of muslims .
muslims have precedent .
islam is an abstraction .
so whether giscard d 'estaing likes it or not , islam - by virtue of labour migration , by virtue of muslims walking in the streets of paris , and london etc . - becomes integral to the european society - it already is ; and as a result the collective disposition of the culture will change , too .
in effect , the changes are going to be made by social forces , not by muslim intellectuals . but are you confident this is going to happen ?
because if you argue this way everyone who is an islamist will inevitably deny this because he knows that if he 's willing to accept it his faith is going to be powerless one day in the foreseeable future .
if you look at europe , the power of religion , its influence on society has decreased ever since the enlightenment .
dabashi : forget about europe for now - if you go to india and go to saudi arabia and go to morocco and go to china you have four different kinds of islam .
islam is not quintessential .
it is a sacred language spoken in different dialects by people living different lives .
so by the same logic when muslims come to europe , they will redefine islam .
and there is nobody on planet earth who can tell them , what you 're doing is not islamic , you 're losing your religion .
the successive generations will redefine islam .
this is what i have against mandatory laws against veiling .
veiling will persist or else be modified by second and third generation muslims .
when they 're going to school , if they do n't want to wear it , they wo n't , if they want to wear it , they will .
if there is force at home for them to wear it , gradually , that force will be contexualized by other forces , by peer pressure , by forces of the market , by mass and globalized culture .
the thing that you do n't want is to have the state come and tell you what clothing item you can wear or can not wear .
back to the issue of turkey : what is your personal opinion , should europe ask turkey to become a member of the european union ?
dabashi : i think the membership of turkey in the european union will inevitably happen .
first , it will provide the european economy with cheap labor .
second it will expand the eu in terms of raw material available in turkey .
third , it will expand the european economic market .
fourth , it will strategically strengthen europe in terms of its inevitable rivalries with the united states in the region .
so economically , politically and militarily , it is to the benefit of europe .
and many of my progressive turkish colleagues are very happy about this move because they think that the questions of women 's rights , human rights , freedom of expression will have a catalytic effect on turkey as well .
so it seems like a happy marriage .

a prominent iranian scholar argues that islam is integral to european society . hamid dabashi is an american-iranian intellectual historian who has studied iran and shia islam from a postcolonial perspective .
he 's currently hagop kervokian professor of iranian studies at columbia university in new york . deutsche welle : in europe , many muslims live in ' parallel societies ' , in the states there 's no such problem .
why are american muslims so much better integrated ?
hamid dabashi : the arab-muslim immigration in the united states has historically been quite minimal , very , very minuscule compared to others .
the basic impetus behind immigration is economic .
capital - in my judgement - is color-blind , and gender-neutral .
you can trace the history of feminist movements around the world , for example , to the necessity of cheap labor , that 's when women entered the job market , and as workers began demanding and exacting more rights .
the same is true for immigrants : they are paid less than others .
so if you are , for example , lebanese , or sudanese , or turkish , or iranian , or pakistani , coming to the united states , entering the job market , it has absolutely nothing to do with your religion ; it is entirely irrelevant .
europe , in my judgement , has successfully posited the myth of a more homogenous cultural entity for itself .
a combination of self-secularized christianity , and - after the horrors of the holocaust - the manufacturing of a " judeo-christian " identity has given europe a renewed reliance on the myth of its origin .
and then , of course , there is the french revolution , the enlightenment , the unification of europe , and the post-soviet reconstruction of a european identity .
europe itself , in this renewed conception of itself , has enough problems now of assimilating the eastern european to the domain of its collective identity .
the idea of europe , historically , is really limited to that of the western europe . when giscard d 'estaing talks about not accepting the turks in the european union , he speaks a christian language , despite his self-secularized conception of who he is and what he stands for .
so the problem europe has with muslims coming from africa , coming from the middle east , coming from south asia is , in part , a reflection of its own inner anxieties with two sorts of europeans - eastern europeans and muslim europeans .
here is an issue that since the time of austria-hungarian imperial rivalry with the ottomans has been a very disconcerting issue for the idea of " europe , " i.e. the notion of muslim europe .
so for all of these reasons , europe has a more difficult time assimilating its muslims than the us .
so with all these integration difficulties already , is it , do you think , too much for the european mind to cope with the idea of turkey becoming part of the european union ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could benefit on several fronts by making turkey a member dabashi : well , that 's obviously something for the aging and thinning population of white europeans to decide .
because of the well being of europeans over many years , europe is an ageing society .
as a result , it needs labour - the cheaper the labor the better - that 's the logic of capital .
and yet labor comes with a baggage .
the european economy needs cheap labor , but european culture does n't like the fact that , ultimately , culture will be influenced by labor migration .
this is the dilemma that europe faces : it wants to have its cake and eat it , too .
but this is what we 're facing right now ; it 's a clash between culture and capital .
would you , then , say that " european islam , " the idea of islam becoming part of a european culture , more modern , more moderate , is also a false concept in this respect ?
dabashi : my problem with tariq ramadan -lrb- swiss muslim scholar - ed . -rrb- is that he thinks if he just writes it , it will happen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : greek financial tragedy eurozone wants tough mechanism to defend stability of the euro french parliament approves greek aid ahead of german vote german parliament gives thumbs up to greece aid package chancellor merkel fails to win opposition support for greece bailout economy -pipe- 01.05.2010 germany 's merkel favors bank help for greek loan package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will be digging deep , but she 'd love some help chancellor angela merkel said she would welcome a contribution from germany 's private sector to the greek financial aid package , while a prominent opposition leader called the proposed move " no more than a placebo . " " i would very much welcome voluntary participation from banks , " merkel said , according to advance excerpts from an interview set to be published in the mass-circulation bild am sonntag paper on sunday , may 2 . the eurozone and imf emergency loans deal for greece is unpopular in germany , and politicians were initially reluctant to support the idea .
however , most now seem to believe that the measure is necessary to prop up the single european currency , the euro . the former leader of the opposition social democrats and current state premier of rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck , was among the first politicians to suggest that banks should contribute to the greek rescue fund - and the idea has picked up speed since then . state broadcaster ard , citing insider sources , now reports that germany 's banks will contribute around 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- to the rescue package .
germany is set to provide just over 8 billion euros in the first year , paying the largest share of any eurozone nation because germany is the bloc 's largest economy . france will be the second largest eurozone contributor to the greek package and merkel and her french counterpart , nicolas sarkozy , are ready to act quickly to unlock a massive rescue plan for greece , sarkozy 's office said saturday .
sarkozy spoke by phone with the german chancellor and both " reaffirmed their determination to act quickly to implement the support plan " once spending cuts are agreed with athens , said an elysee statement .
' just a placebo ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt-based banking community is already exposed to the greek market but bank participation in the greece rescue plan is not to everyone 's liking .
chancellor merkel 's main adversary in the bundestag and leader of the social democrats , sigmar gabriel , is not excited by the prospect of banks contributing to the loan package . gabriel said in an interview with the neue westfaelische newspaper on saturday that the proposition was just an attempt to " quell the public rage that taxpayers would have to pay for the greed of bankers and speculators for a second time . " " what 's now being considered by deutsche bank boss josef ackermann and the coalition government in berlin , namely for banks to voluntarily contribute -lsb- towards the greek rescue -rsb- , is nothing more than a placebo , " gabriel said . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann has not yet commented publicly on the issue , but a series of reports all name him as the coordinator of a bank contribution to the greek fund . ackermann held an emergency meeting with greek prime minister george papandreou and finance minister george papaconstantinou in athens in february , looking for ways to help the country , which owes money to deutsche bank . german banks have the second-largest exposure to the greek market , after their french counterparts . payback time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks are not very popular among germans right now as in much of the western world , anti-bank sentiment in germany is currently very strong .
popular perception is that the institutions single-handedly caused the recent recession , only to be bailed out by the government and taxpayers . germany was one of many countries that helped its banks stay afloat during the recent recession - with perhaps the most famous near-failed money-lender , hypo real-estate , applying for another 1.85 billion euros on friday .
hre has already received a string of loans and credit guarantees from berlin worth in excess of 100 billion euros . the fact that derivatives trading and currency speculation helped tip greek interest rates to an unmanageable level - forcing athens to apply for these emergency loans - has only strengthened public opinion that the financial sector is again at fault for greece 's problems . in principle , at least , the greek rescue package differs from much of the state financial aid offered during the financial crisis . eurozone nations intend to borrow money , and then lend that money to greece at a slightly higher rate of interest , which would still be more competitive than the rates offered directly to athens on the open market . assuming heavily indebted greece is one day in a position to repay the loans , the donors - including any banks that contribute - are set to make a slight profit . it would go against the eu 's lisbon treaty for countries to simply give money to greece , as " bailouts " are not permitted under current eurozone rules . msh / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" koch-mehrin said personal and religious freedom should be defended , but should not " go so far as to take away a person 's face in public . " " the burqa is a massive attack on the rights of women .
it is a mobile prison , " she wrote . koch-mehrin also wrote that coming across veiled women in the street irritated her because she could not judge who they were or what their intentions were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burqa is an attack on women 's rights , says koch-mehrin the german lawmaker 's comments come just two days after the belgian parliament voted unanimously , as the first country in europe , to ban the public wearing of veils that entirely cover the face .
the belgian law , which must still be approved by the upper house of parliament , calls for fines of 250 euros and up to a week in jail . some of the 16 federal states in germany have already imposed bans on the wearing of headscarves by public school teachers . the belgian move has reignited the european debate on how to deal with muslim veils . the french government has proposed jailing and fining anyone who forces women to wear a full-face veil , as well as fining the wearer .

capital - in my judgement - is color-blind , and gender-neutral .
you can trace the history of feminist movements around the world , for example , to the necessity of cheap labor , that 's when women entered the job market , and as workers began demanding and exacting more rights .
the same is true for immigrants : they are paid less than others .
so if you are , for example , lebanese , or sudanese , or turkish , or iranian , or pakistani , coming to the united states , entering the job market , it has absolutely nothing to do with your religion ; it is entirely irrelevant .
europe , in my judgement , has successfully posited the myth of a more homogenous cultural entity for itself .
a combination of self-secularized christianity , and - after the horrors of the holocaust - the manufacturing of a " judeo-christian " identity has given europe a renewed reliance on the myth of its origin .
and then , of course , there is the french revolution , the enlightenment , the unification of europe , and the post-soviet reconstruction of a european identity .
europe itself , in this renewed conception of itself , has enough problems now of assimilating the eastern european to the domain of its collective identity .
the idea of europe , historically , is really limited to that of the western europe . when giscard d 'estaing talks about not accepting the turks in the european union , he speaks a christian language , despite his self-secularized conception of who he is and what he stands for .
so the problem europe has with muslims coming from africa , coming from the middle east , coming from south asia is , in part , a reflection of its own inner anxieties with two sorts of europeans - eastern europeans and muslim europeans .
here is an issue that since the time of austria-hungarian imperial rivalry with the ottomans has been a very disconcerting issue for the idea of " europe , " i.e. the notion of muslim europe .
so for all of these reasons , europe has a more difficult time assimilating its muslims than the us .
so with all these integration difficulties already , is it , do you think , too much for the european mind to cope with the idea of turkey becoming part of the european union ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could benefit on several fronts by making turkey a member dabashi : well , that 's obviously something for the aging and thinning population of white europeans to decide .
because of the well being of europeans over many years , europe is an ageing society .
as a result , it needs labour - the cheaper the labor the better - that 's the logic of capital .
and yet labor comes with a baggage .
the european economy needs cheap labor , but european culture does n't like the fact that , ultimately , culture will be influenced by labor migration .
this is the dilemma that europe faces : it wants to have its cake and eat it , too .
but this is what we 're facing right now ; it 's a clash between culture and capital .
would you , then , say that " european islam , " the idea of islam becoming part of a european culture , more modern , more moderate , is also a false concept in this respect ?
dabashi : my problem with tariq ramadan -lrb- swiss muslim scholar - ed . -rrb- is that he thinks if he just writes it , it will happen .
islam , by virtue of european muslims , has to contend with other european moral , intellectual , imaginative , and political forces .
the difference between someone like me and tariq ramadan is that i do n't think of islam , i think of muslims .
muslims have precedent .
islam is an abstraction .
so whether giscard d 'estaing likes it or not , islam - by virtue of labour migration , by virtue of muslims walking in the streets of paris , and london etc . - becomes integral to the european society - it already is ; and as a result the collective disposition of the culture will change , too .
in effect , the changes are going to be made by social forces , not by muslim intellectuals . but are you confident this is going to happen ?
because if you argue this way everyone who is an islamist will inevitably deny this because he knows that if he 's willing to accept it his faith is going to be powerless one day in the foreseeable future .
if you look at europe , the power of religion , its influence on society has decreased ever since the enlightenment .
dabashi : forget about europe for now - if you go to india and go to saudi arabia and go to morocco and go to china you have four different kinds of islam .
islam is not quintessential .
it is a sacred language spoken in different dialects by people living different lives .
so by the same logic when muslims come to europe , they will redefine islam .
and there is nobody on planet earth who can tell them , what you 're doing is not islamic , you 're losing your religion .
the successive generations will redefine islam .
this is what i have against mandatory laws against veiling .
veiling will persist or else be modified by second and third generation muslims .
when they 're going to school , if they do n't want to wear it , they wo n't , if they want to wear it , they will .
if there is force at home for them to wear it , gradually , that force will be contexualized by other forces , by peer pressure , by forces of the market , by mass and globalized culture .
the thing that you do n't want is to have the state come and tell you what clothing item you can wear or can not wear .
back to the issue of turkey : what is your personal opinion , should europe ask turkey to become a member of the european union ?
dabashi : i think the membership of turkey in the european union will inevitably happen .
first , it will provide the european economy with cheap labor .
second it will expand the eu in terms of raw material available in turkey .
third , it will expand the european economic market .
fourth , it will strategically strengthen europe in terms of its inevitable rivalries with the united states in the region .
so economically , politically and militarily , it is to the benefit of europe .
and many of my progressive turkish colleagues are very happy about this move because they think that the questions of women 's rights , human rights , freedom of expression will have a catalytic effect on turkey as well .
so it seems like a happy marriage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 01.05.2010 credit rating agencies under a harsh spotlight again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger is mounting over the role and influence of rating agencies european politicians are fuming over the us credit ratings agencies and their role in various financial crises .
but some experts say it was governments who allowed rating firms to gain too much power in the first place . after stocks and the euro took a tumble this week on the announcement that credit rating agency standard and poor 's was downgrading greece 's credit rating to junk status , new calls have gone out for ratings agencies to act " responsibly " and for the creation of an independent european rating agency . but responsibility is not a word that has been associated with credit ratings agencies much in the wake of the global financial crisis , especially after it emerged that the business practices of the big three us ratings firms - standard and poor 's , moody 's and fitch - played a central role in helping bring about the economic meltdown . " we should not make the welfare of europe dependent on ratings agencies , " peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's independent economic advisory panel , told the newspaper die welt . german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who called for a european credit rating agency , said rating agencies must not develop , sell and rate financial products at the same time . " conflicts of interest are guaranteed , " he said . a matter of accuracy a top international monetary fund official questioned the agencies ' accuracy , arguing that that their assessments reflect mainly investors ' perceptions of a nation 's financial health . " that 's why you should n't believe too much in what they say , " imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle wants a european ratings agency but according to manfred jäger-ambrozewicz of the cologne institute of business research , government regulators and governments themselves , who also depend on ratings agencies analysis , have played a role in the increase of the agencies ' influence . " it 's kind of ridiculous that they 've turned on them now , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are the ones who have largely given them so much power . " he added that the creation of a new european ratings agency would be possible , but that agencies are built on their reputations , and it would take some time for a brand-new ratings entity to become credible . " but if in addition to the private rating we had something from a semi-state agency or a rating by a body like the imf or the european central bank , that could be helpful , " jäger-ambrozewicz said . later this year , new eu rules which were hammered out last year will apply some regulation on already-existing agencies that operate in europe . the rules , which go into effect in december , will oblige the agencies to disclose information about the models and methods on which their ratings are based and require adherence to new corporate governance standards meant to guard against potential conflicts of interest . risk assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standard and poor 's rating downgrade for greece sent stocks and the euro tumbling credit ratings agencies began their lives as market researchers , analyzing corporate debt for people or groups considering whether or not to purchase that debt .
potential buyers depend on ratings to determine the credit risk involved . for most of their existence , rating agencies answered a simple , but critical question : if i loan somebody money by buying one of their bonds , am i going to get that money back ? the agencies developed a grading system to indicate the sureness of the investment .
companies , cities and countries get rated .
standard and poor 's gives ibm its top rating , meaning there is very low risk .
argentina , on the other hand , gets the equivalent of a b- . for investors , ratings agencies are supposed to provide independent measurements of credit risk , which in turn increases market efficiency , and adds to the supply of risk capital in the market , which can lead to stronger growth . mission creep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit rating agencies are now in the crosshairs starting in the 1970s , credit rating agencies began to get more powerful and these days , a significant bond issuance must have at least one rating from a respected ratings agency to be successful . by the early 1980s , a different kind of bond appeared on the scene : so-called structured finance instruments such as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations .
those are the now infamous complex financial creations made up of thousands of loans and mortgages bundled together and then sold as bonds .
in effect , they became almost too complex for ratings agencies to get a handle on , but they rated them anyway , usually positively . " mixing cocktails of risk , you really want to know what is the percentage of alcohol in the drinks , " said irwin collier , a professor of finance at berlin 's free university .
" financial innovation is a good thing , but what is bad is when the information gets falsified . " initial success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rating agencies trippled their revenues between 2002 and 2007 it was the rise and initial success of those complex financial instruments that led the three big rating agencies down a path of great financial gain for themselves , but disaster for economy as a whole .
they began looking for ways to give their seal of approval to bonds , even working directly with the bond issuer .
and that , critics say , drove a stake in the heart of their neutrality . ratings agencies make their money by charging fees to those they rated , creating an inherent conflict of interest . furthermore , if moody 's , for example , indicated to a bond issuer that it was not willing to give it a good rating , the issuer could simply go over to standard and poor 's or fitch , whichever would be willing to provide the aaa imprimatur . it was in the agencies ' own financial interest to work with bond issuers to find a way to give out these top ratings .
and agencies ' pursued that interest aggressively .
between 2002 and 2007 , the firms tripled their revenues . " it 's like the parties in court paying the judge 's salary , " said us senator carl levin at a hearing last week in washington that looked into whether the agencies failed to provide honest assessments of securities to investors . poor performance , poor oversight the credit agencies ' track record is not very impressive .
according to the new york times , of aaa-rated subprime-mortgage-backed securities issued in 2006 , 93 percent have been downgraded to junk status .
they failed to foresee the collapse of the us housing market . the agencies are not overseen by the us securities and exchange commission , and they have escaped any legal liability by claiming that their ratings are just opinions , protected by the american first amendment right to free speech . while the credibility of the big agencies has been hit , they are still the only game in town and have tremendous power , as the reaction to the greek debt rating and subsequent ratings about portugal and spain have shown .

but some experts say it was governments who allowed rating firms to gain too much power in the first place . after stocks and the euro took a tumble this week on the announcement that credit rating agency standard and poor 's was downgrading greece 's credit rating to junk status , new calls have gone out for ratings agencies to act " responsibly " and for the creation of an independent european rating agency . but responsibility is not a word that has been associated with credit ratings agencies much in the wake of the global financial crisis , especially after it emerged that the business practices of the big three us ratings firms - standard and poor 's , moody 's and fitch - played a central role in helping bring about the economic meltdown . " we should not make the welfare of europe dependent on ratings agencies , " peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's independent economic advisory panel , told the newspaper die welt . german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who called for a european credit rating agency , said rating agencies must not develop , sell and rate financial products at the same time . " conflicts of interest are guaranteed , " he said . a matter of accuracy a top international monetary fund official questioned the agencies ' accuracy , arguing that that their assessments reflect mainly investors ' perceptions of a nation 's financial health . " that 's why you should n't believe too much in what they say , " imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle wants a european ratings agency but according to manfred jäger-ambrozewicz of the cologne institute of business research , government regulators and governments themselves , who also depend on ratings agencies analysis , have played a role in the increase of the agencies ' influence . " it 's kind of ridiculous that they 've turned on them now , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are the ones who have largely given them so much power . " he added that the creation of a new european ratings agency would be possible , but that agencies are built on their reputations , and it would take some time for a brand-new ratings entity to become credible . " but if in addition to the private rating we had something from a semi-state agency or a rating by a body like the imf or the european central bank , that could be helpful , " jäger-ambrozewicz said . later this year , new eu rules which were hammered out last year will apply some regulation on already-existing agencies that operate in europe . the rules , which go into effect in december , will oblige the agencies to disclose information about the models and methods on which their ratings are based and require adherence to new corporate governance standards meant to guard against potential conflicts of interest . risk assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standard and poor 's rating downgrade for greece sent stocks and the euro tumbling credit ratings agencies began their lives as market researchers , analyzing corporate debt for people or groups considering whether or not to purchase that debt .
potential buyers depend on ratings to determine the credit risk involved . for most of their existence , rating agencies answered a simple , but critical question : if i loan somebody money by buying one of their bonds , am i going to get that money back ? the agencies developed a grading system to indicate the sureness of the investment .
companies , cities and countries get rated .
standard and poor 's gives ibm its top rating , meaning there is very low risk .
argentina , on the other hand , gets the equivalent of a b- . for investors , ratings agencies are supposed to provide independent measurements of credit risk , which in turn increases market efficiency , and adds to the supply of risk capital in the market , which can lead to stronger growth . mission creep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit rating agencies are now in the crosshairs starting in the 1970s , credit rating agencies began to get more powerful and these days , a significant bond issuance must have at least one rating from a respected ratings agency to be successful . by the early 1980s , a different kind of bond appeared on the scene : so-called structured finance instruments such as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations .
those are the now infamous complex financial creations made up of thousands of loans and mortgages bundled together and then sold as bonds .
in effect , they became almost too complex for ratings agencies to get a handle on , but they rated them anyway , usually positively . " mixing cocktails of risk , you really want to know what is the percentage of alcohol in the drinks , " said irwin collier , a professor of finance at berlin 's free university .
" financial innovation is a good thing , but what is bad is when the information gets falsified . " initial success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rating agencies trippled their revenues between 2002 and 2007 it was the rise and initial success of those complex financial instruments that led the three big rating agencies down a path of great financial gain for themselves , but disaster for economy as a whole .
they began looking for ways to give their seal of approval to bonds , even working directly with the bond issuer .
and that , critics say , drove a stake in the heart of their neutrality . ratings agencies make their money by charging fees to those they rated , creating an inherent conflict of interest . furthermore , if moody 's , for example , indicated to a bond issuer that it was not willing to give it a good rating , the issuer could simply go over to standard and poor 's or fitch , whichever would be willing to provide the aaa imprimatur . it was in the agencies ' own financial interest to work with bond issuers to find a way to give out these top ratings .
and agencies ' pursued that interest aggressively .
between 2002 and 2007 , the firms tripled their revenues . " it 's like the parties in court paying the judge 's salary , " said us senator carl levin at a hearing last week in washington that looked into whether the agencies failed to provide honest assessments of securities to investors . poor performance , poor oversight the credit agencies ' track record is not very impressive .
according to the new york times , of aaa-rated subprime-mortgage-backed securities issued in 2006 , 93 percent have been downgraded to junk status .
they failed to foresee the collapse of the us housing market . the agencies are not overseen by the us securities and exchange commission , and they have escaped any legal liability by claiming that their ratings are just opinions , protected by the american first amendment right to free speech . while the credibility of the big agencies has been hit , they are still the only game in town and have tremendous power , as the reaction to the greek debt rating and subsequent ratings about portugal and spain have shown .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 01.05.2010 credit rating agencies under a harsh spotlight again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger is mounting over the role and influence of rating agencies european politicians are fuming over the us credit ratings agencies and their role in various financial crises .
but some experts say it was governments who allowed rating firms to gain too much power in the first place . after stocks and the euro took a tumble this week on the announcement that credit rating agency standard and poor 's was downgrading greece 's credit rating to junk status , new calls have gone out for ratings agencies to act " responsibly " and for the creation of an independent european rating agency . but responsibility is not a word that has been associated with credit ratings agencies much in the wake of the global financial crisis , especially after it emerged that the business practices of the big three us ratings firms - standard and poor 's , moody 's and fitch - played a central role in helping bring about the economic meltdown . " we should not make the welfare of europe dependent on ratings agencies , " peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's independent economic advisory panel , told the newspaper die welt . german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who called for a european credit rating agency , said rating agencies must not develop , sell and rate financial products at the same time . " conflicts of interest are guaranteed , " he said . a matter of accuracy a top international monetary fund official questioned the agencies ' accuracy , arguing that that their assessments reflect mainly investors ' perceptions of a nation 's financial health . " that 's why you should n't believe too much in what they say , " imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle wants a european ratings agency but according to manfred jäger-ambrozewicz of the cologne institute of business research , government regulators and governments themselves , who also depend on ratings agencies analysis , have played a role in the increase of the agencies ' influence . " it 's kind of ridiculous that they 've turned on them now , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are the ones who have largely given them so much power . " he added that the creation of a new european ratings agency would be possible , but that agencies are built on their reputations , and it would take some time for a brand-new ratings entity to become credible . " but if in addition to the private rating we had something from a semi-state agency or a rating by a body like the imf or the european central bank , that could be helpful , " jäger-ambrozewicz said . later this year , new eu rules which were hammered out last year will apply some regulation on already-existing agencies that operate in europe . the rules , which go into effect in december , will oblige the agencies to disclose information about the models and methods on which their ratings are based and require adherence to new corporate governance standards meant to guard against potential conflicts of interest . risk assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standard and poor 's rating downgrade for greece sent stocks and the euro tumbling credit ratings agencies began their lives as market researchers , analyzing corporate debt for people or groups considering whether or not to purchase that debt .
potential buyers depend on ratings to determine the credit risk involved . for most of their existence , rating agencies answered a simple , but critical question : if i loan somebody money by buying one of their bonds , am i going to get that money back ? the agencies developed a grading system to indicate the sureness of the investment .
companies , cities and countries get rated .
standard and poor 's gives ibm its top rating , meaning there is very low risk .
argentina , on the other hand , gets the equivalent of a b- . for investors , ratings agencies are supposed to provide independent measurements of credit risk , which in turn increases market efficiency , and adds to the supply of risk capital in the market , which can lead to stronger growth . mission creep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit rating agencies are now in the crosshairs starting in the 1970s , credit rating agencies began to get more powerful and these days , a significant bond issuance must have at least one rating from a respected ratings agency to be successful . by the early 1980s , a different kind of bond appeared on the scene : so-called structured finance instruments such as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations .
those are the now infamous complex financial creations made up of thousands of loans and mortgages bundled together and then sold as bonds .
in effect , they became almost too complex for ratings agencies to get a handle on , but they rated them anyway , usually positively . " mixing cocktails of risk , you really want to know what is the percentage of alcohol in the drinks , " said irwin collier , a professor of finance at berlin 's free university .
" financial innovation is a good thing , but what is bad is when the information gets falsified . " initial success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rating agencies trippled their revenues between 2002 and 2007 it was the rise and initial success of those complex financial instruments that led the three big rating agencies down a path of great financial gain for themselves , but disaster for economy as a whole .
they began looking for ways to give their seal of approval to bonds , even working directly with the bond issuer .
and that , critics say , drove a stake in the heart of their neutrality . ratings agencies make their money by charging fees to those they rated , creating an inherent conflict of interest . furthermore , if moody 's , for example , indicated to a bond issuer that it was not willing to give it a good rating , the issuer could simply go over to standard and poor 's or fitch , whichever would be willing to provide the aaa imprimatur . it was in the agencies ' own financial interest to work with bond issuers to find a way to give out these top ratings .
and agencies ' pursued that interest aggressively .
between 2002 and 2007 , the firms tripled their revenues . " it 's like the parties in court paying the judge 's salary , " said us senator carl levin at a hearing last week in washington that looked into whether the agencies failed to provide honest assessments of securities to investors . poor performance , poor oversight the credit agencies ' track record is not very impressive .
according to the new york times , of aaa-rated subprime-mortgage-backed securities issued in 2006 , 93 percent have been downgraded to junk status .
they failed to foresee the collapse of the us housing market . the agencies are not overseen by the us securities and exchange commission , and they have escaped any legal liability by claiming that their ratings are just opinions , protected by the american first amendment right to free speech . while the credibility of the big agencies has been hit , they are still the only game in town and have tremendous power , as the reaction to the greek debt rating and subsequent ratings about portugal and spain have shown .

street view allows users to look at photos of individual streets at ground level all over the world , with images taken from specially equipped vehicles .
the panoramic views of cities in the us , japan , australia and parts of europe are already available online .
the product is a supplement to google 's maps .
the german government complained that this software could encroach on the privacy of its citizens .
aigner argued that thieves could use the pictures of houses to gauge people 's wealth and prepare burglaries , and that people 's pictures might be published online without their consent .
aigner 's aides said the minister told google that " what is private has to stay private . "
opting out google now says it will wait until later this year to launch its german images to give people the chance to file complaints .
anyone who wishes can have the image of their house blocked out , and google has promised to obscure any faces present in the pictures .
the company has offered this same service to people around the world , but retroactively , removing the images only after publishing them .
for germany , it is agreeing to do its editing beforehand where possible .
privacy concerns are a particularly contentious issue in germany , due to the abuses by hitler 's nazi government and the communist rulers of the former east germany in the past. msh / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" koch-mehrin said personal and religious freedom should be defended , but should not " go so far as to take away a person 's face in public .

but some experts say it was governments who allowed rating firms to gain too much power in the first place . after stocks and the euro took a tumble this week on the announcement that credit rating agency standard and poor 's was downgrading greece 's credit rating to junk status , new calls have gone out for ratings agencies to act " responsibly " and for the creation of an independent european rating agency . but responsibility is not a word that has been associated with credit ratings agencies much in the wake of the global financial crisis , especially after it emerged that the business practices of the big three us ratings firms - standard and poor 's , moody 's and fitch - played a central role in helping bring about the economic meltdown . " we should not make the welfare of europe dependent on ratings agencies , " peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's independent economic advisory panel , told the newspaper die welt . german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who called for a european credit rating agency , said rating agencies must not develop , sell and rate financial products at the same time . " conflicts of interest are guaranteed , " he said . a matter of accuracy a top international monetary fund official questioned the agencies ' accuracy , arguing that that their assessments reflect mainly investors ' perceptions of a nation 's financial health . " that 's why you should n't believe too much in what they say , " imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle wants a european ratings agency but according to manfred jäger-ambrozewicz of the cologne institute of business research , government regulators and governments themselves , who also depend on ratings agencies analysis , have played a role in the increase of the agencies ' influence . " it 's kind of ridiculous that they 've turned on them now , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are the ones who have largely given them so much power . " he added that the creation of a new european ratings agency would be possible , but that agencies are built on their reputations , and it would take some time for a brand-new ratings entity to become credible . " but if in addition to the private rating we had something from a semi-state agency or a rating by a body like the imf or the european central bank , that could be helpful , " jäger-ambrozewicz said . later this year , new eu rules which were hammered out last year will apply some regulation on already-existing agencies that operate in europe . the rules , which go into effect in december , will oblige the agencies to disclose information about the models and methods on which their ratings are based and require adherence to new corporate governance standards meant to guard against potential conflicts of interest . risk assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standard and poor 's rating downgrade for greece sent stocks and the euro tumbling credit ratings agencies began their lives as market researchers , analyzing corporate debt for people or groups considering whether or not to purchase that debt .
potential buyers depend on ratings to determine the credit risk involved . for most of their existence , rating agencies answered a simple , but critical question : if i loan somebody money by buying one of their bonds , am i going to get that money back ? the agencies developed a grading system to indicate the sureness of the investment .
companies , cities and countries get rated .
standard and poor 's gives ibm its top rating , meaning there is very low risk .
argentina , on the other hand , gets the equivalent of a b- . for investors , ratings agencies are supposed to provide independent measurements of credit risk , which in turn increases market efficiency , and adds to the supply of risk capital in the market , which can lead to stronger growth . mission creep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit rating agencies are now in the crosshairs starting in the 1970s , credit rating agencies began to get more powerful and these days , a significant bond issuance must have at least one rating from a respected ratings agency to be successful . by the early 1980s , a different kind of bond appeared on the scene : so-called structured finance instruments such as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations .
those are the now infamous complex financial creations made up of thousands of loans and mortgages bundled together and then sold as bonds .
in effect , they became almost too complex for ratings agencies to get a handle on , but they rated them anyway , usually positively . " mixing cocktails of risk , you really want to know what is the percentage of alcohol in the drinks , " said irwin collier , a professor of finance at berlin 's free university .
" financial innovation is a good thing , but what is bad is when the information gets falsified . " initial success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rating agencies trippled their revenues between 2002 and 2007 it was the rise and initial success of those complex financial instruments that led the three big rating agencies down a path of great financial gain for themselves , but disaster for economy as a whole .
they began looking for ways to give their seal of approval to bonds , even working directly with the bond issuer .
and that , critics say , drove a stake in the heart of their neutrality . ratings agencies make their money by charging fees to those they rated , creating an inherent conflict of interest . furthermore , if moody 's , for example , indicated to a bond issuer that it was not willing to give it a good rating , the issuer could simply go over to standard and poor 's or fitch , whichever would be willing to provide the aaa imprimatur . it was in the agencies ' own financial interest to work with bond issuers to find a way to give out these top ratings .
and agencies ' pursued that interest aggressively .
between 2002 and 2007 , the firms tripled their revenues . " it 's like the parties in court paying the judge 's salary , " said us senator carl levin at a hearing last week in washington that looked into whether the agencies failed to provide honest assessments of securities to investors . poor performance , poor oversight the credit agencies ' track record is not very impressive .
according to the new york times , of aaa-rated subprime-mortgage-backed securities issued in 2006 , 93 percent have been downgraded to junk status .
they failed to foresee the collapse of the us housing market . the agencies are not overseen by the us securities and exchange commission , and they have escaped any legal liability by claiming that their ratings are just opinions , protected by the american first amendment right to free speech . while the credibility of the big agencies has been hit , they are still the only game in town and have tremendous power , as the reaction to the greek debt rating and subsequent ratings about portugal and spain have shown . " the markets are still listening , that 's clear , " collier said . author : kyle james editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a prominent iranian scholar argues that islam is integral to european society . hamid dabashi is an american-iranian intellectual historian who has studied iran and shia islam from a postcolonial perspective .
he 's currently hagop kervokian professor of iranian studies at columbia university in new york . deutsche welle : in europe , many muslims live in ' parallel societies ' , in the states there 's no such problem .
why are american muslims so much better integrated ?
hamid dabashi : the arab-muslim immigration in the united states has historically been quite minimal , very , very minuscule compared to others .
the basic impetus behind immigration is economic .
capital - in my judgement - is color-blind , and gender-neutral .
you can trace the history of feminist movements around the world , for example , to the necessity of cheap labor , that 's when women entered the job market , and as workers began demanding and exacting more rights .
the same is true for immigrants : they are paid less than others .
so if you are , for example , lebanese , or sudanese , or turkish , or iranian , or pakistani , coming to the united states , entering the job market , it has absolutely nothing to do with your religion ; it is entirely irrelevant .
europe , in my judgement , has successfully posited the myth of a more homogenous cultural entity for itself .
a combination of self-secularized christianity , and - after the horrors of the holocaust - the manufacturing of a " judeo-christian " identity has given europe a renewed reliance on the myth of its origin .
and then , of course , there is the french revolution , the enlightenment , the unification of europe , and the post-soviet reconstruction of a european identity .
europe itself , in this renewed conception of itself , has enough problems now of assimilating the eastern european to the domain of its collective identity .
the idea of europe , historically , is really limited to that of the western europe . when giscard d 'estaing talks about not accepting the turks in the european union , he speaks a christian language , despite his self-secularized conception of who he is and what he stands for .
so the problem europe has with muslims coming from africa , coming from the middle east , coming from south asia is , in part , a reflection of its own inner anxieties with two sorts of europeans - eastern europeans and muslim europeans .
here is an issue that since the time of austria-hungarian imperial rivalry with the ottomans has been a very disconcerting issue for the idea of " europe , " i.e. the notion of muslim europe .
so for all of these reasons , europe has a more difficult time assimilating its muslims than the us .
so with all these integration difficulties already , is it , do you think , too much for the european mind to cope with the idea of turkey becoming part of the european union ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could benefit on several fronts by making turkey a member dabashi : well , that 's obviously something for the aging and thinning population of white europeans to decide .
because of the well being of europeans over many years , europe is an ageing society .
as a result , it needs labour - the cheaper the labor the better - that 's the logic of capital .
and yet labor comes with a baggage .
the european economy needs cheap labor , but european culture does n't like the fact that , ultimately , culture will be influenced by labor migration .
this is the dilemma that europe faces : it wants to have its cake and eat it , too .
but this is what we 're facing right now ; it 's a clash between culture and capital .
would you , then , say that " european islam , " the idea of islam becoming part of a european culture , more modern , more moderate , is also a false concept in this respect ?
dabashi : my problem with tariq ramadan -lrb- swiss muslim scholar - ed . -rrb- is that he thinks if he just writes it , it will happen .
islam , by virtue of european muslims , has to contend with other european moral , intellectual , imaginative , and political forces .
the difference between someone like me and tariq ramadan is that i do n't think of islam , i think of muslims .
muslims have precedent .
islam is an abstraction .
so whether giscard d 'estaing likes it or not , islam - by virtue of labour migration , by virtue of muslims walking in the streets of paris , and london etc . - becomes integral to the european society - it already is ; and as a result the collective disposition of the culture will change , too .
in effect , the changes are going to be made by social forces , not by muslim intellectuals . but are you confident this is going to happen ?
because if you argue this way everyone who is an islamist will inevitably deny this because he knows that if he 's willing to accept it his faith is going to be powerless one day in the foreseeable future .
if you look at europe , the power of religion , its influence on society has decreased ever since the enlightenment .
dabashi : forget about europe for now - if you go to india and go to saudi arabia and go to morocco and go to china you have four different kinds of islam .
islam is not quintessential .
it is a sacred language spoken in different dialects by people living different lives .
so by the same logic when muslims come to europe , they will redefine islam .
and there is nobody on planet earth who can tell them , what you 're doing is not islamic , you 're losing your religion .
the successive generations will redefine islam .
this is what i have against mandatory laws against veiling .
veiling will persist or else be modified by second and third generation muslims .
when they 're going to school , if they do n't want to wear it , they wo n't , if they want to wear it , they will .
if there is force at home for them to wear it , gradually , that force will be contexualized by other forces , by peer pressure , by forces of the market , by mass and globalized culture .
the thing that you do n't want is to have the state come and tell you what clothing item you can wear or can not wear .
back to the issue of turkey : what is your personal opinion , should europe ask turkey to become a member of the european union ?
dabashi : i think the membership of turkey in the european union will inevitably happen .
first , it will provide the european economy with cheap labor .
second it will expand the eu in terms of raw material available in turkey .
third , it will expand the european economic market .
fourth , it will strategically strengthen europe in terms of its inevitable rivalries with the united states in the region .
so economically , politically and militarily , it is to the benefit of europe .
and many of my progressive turkish colleagues are very happy about this move because they think that the questions of women 's rights , human rights , freedom of expression will have a catalytic effect on turkey as well .
so it seems like a happy marriage .

street view allows users to look at photos of individual streets at ground level all over the world , with images taken from specially equipped vehicles .
the panoramic views of cities in the us , japan , australia and parts of europe are already available online .

the german government complained that this software could encroach on the privacy of its citizens .
aigner argued that thieves could use the pictures of houses to gauge people 's wealth and prepare burglaries , and that people 's pictures might be published online without their consent .
aigner 's aides said the minister told google that " what is private has to stay private . "
opting out google now says it will wait until later this year to launch its german images to give people the chance to file complaints .
anyone who wishes can have the image of their house blocked out , and google has promised to obscure any faces present in the pictures .
the company has offered this same service to people around the world , but retroactively , removing the images only after publishing them .
for germany , it is agreeing to do its editing beforehand where possible .

a prominent iranian scholar argues that islam is integral to european society . hamid dabashi is an american-iranian intellectual historian who has studied iran and shia islam from a postcolonial perspective .
he 's currently hagop kervokian professor of iranian studies at columbia university in new york . deutsche welle : in europe , many muslims live in ' parallel societies ' , in the states there 's no such problem .
why are american muslims so much better integrated ?
hamid dabashi : the arab-muslim immigration in the united states has historically been quite minimal , very , very minuscule compared to others .
the basic impetus behind immigration is economic .
capital - in my judgement - is color-blind , and gender-neutral .
you can trace the history of feminist movements around the world , for example , to the necessity of cheap labor , that 's when women entered the job market , and as workers began demanding and exacting more rights .
the same is true for immigrants : they are paid less than others .
so if you are , for example , lebanese , or sudanese , or turkish , or iranian , or pakistani , coming to the united states , entering the job market , it has absolutely nothing to do with your religion ; it is entirely irrelevant .
europe , in my judgement , has successfully posited the myth of a more homogenous cultural entity for itself .
a combination of self-secularized christianity , and - after the horrors of the holocaust - the manufacturing of a " judeo-christian " identity has given europe a renewed reliance on the myth of its origin .
and then , of course , there is the french revolution , the enlightenment , the unification of europe , and the post-soviet reconstruction of a european identity .
europe itself , in this renewed conception of itself , has enough problems now of assimilating the eastern european to the domain of its collective identity .
the idea of europe , historically , is really limited to that of the western europe . when giscard d 'estaing talks about not accepting the turks in the european union , he speaks a christian language , despite his self-secularized conception of who he is and what he stands for .
so the problem europe has with muslims coming from africa , coming from the middle east , coming from south asia is , in part , a reflection of its own inner anxieties with two sorts of europeans - eastern europeans and muslim europeans .
here is an issue that since the time of austria-hungarian imperial rivalry with the ottomans has been a very disconcerting issue for the idea of " europe , " i.e. the notion of muslim europe .
so for all of these reasons , europe has a more difficult time assimilating its muslims than the us .
so with all these integration difficulties already , is it , do you think , too much for the european mind to cope with the idea of turkey becoming part of the european union ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could benefit on several fronts by making turkey a member dabashi : well , that 's obviously something for the aging and thinning population of white europeans to decide .
because of the well being of europeans over many years , europe is an ageing society .
as a result , it needs labour - the cheaper the labor the better - that 's the logic of capital .
and yet labor comes with a baggage .
the european economy needs cheap labor , but european culture does n't like the fact that , ultimately , culture will be influenced by labor migration .
this is the dilemma that europe faces : it wants to have its cake and eat it , too .
but this is what we 're facing right now ; it 's a clash between culture and capital .
would you , then , say that " european islam , " the idea of islam becoming part of a european culture , more modern , more moderate , is also a false concept in this respect ?
dabashi : my problem with tariq ramadan -lrb- swiss muslim scholar - ed . -rrb- is that he thinks if he just writes it , it will happen .
islam , by virtue of european muslims , has to contend with other european moral , intellectual , imaginative , and political forces .
the difference between someone like me and tariq ramadan is that i do n't think of islam , i think of muslims .
muslims have precedent .
islam is an abstraction .
so whether giscard d 'estaing likes it or not , islam - by virtue of labour migration , by virtue of muslims walking in the streets of paris , and london etc . - becomes integral to the european society - it already is ; and as a result the collective disposition of the culture will change , too .
in effect , the changes are going to be made by social forces , not by muslim intellectuals . but are you confident this is going to happen ?
because if you argue this way everyone who is an islamist will inevitably deny this because he knows that if he 's willing to accept it his faith is going to be powerless one day in the foreseeable future .
if you look at europe , the power of religion , its influence on society has decreased ever since the enlightenment .
dabashi : forget about europe for now - if you go to india and go to saudi arabia and go to morocco and go to china you have four different kinds of islam .
islam is not quintessential .
it is a sacred language spoken in different dialects by people living different lives .
so by the same logic when muslims come to europe , they will redefine islam .
and there is nobody on planet earth who can tell them , what you 're doing is not islamic , you 're losing your religion .
the successive generations will redefine islam .
this is what i have against mandatory laws against veiling .
veiling will persist or else be modified by second and third generation muslims .
when they 're going to school , if they do n't want to wear it , they wo n't , if they want to wear it , they will .
if there is force at home for them to wear it , gradually , that force will be contexualized by other forces , by peer pressure , by forces of the market , by mass and globalized culture .
the thing that you do n't want is to have the state come and tell you what clothing item you can wear or can not wear .
back to the issue of turkey : what is your personal opinion , should europe ask turkey to become a member of the european union ?
dabashi : i think the membership of turkey in the european union will inevitably happen .
first , it will provide the european economy with cheap labor .
second it will expand the eu in terms of raw material available in turkey .
third , it will expand the european economic market .
fourth , it will strategically strengthen europe in terms of its inevitable rivalries with the united states in the region .
so economically , politically and militarily , it is to the benefit of europe .
and many of my progressive turkish colleagues are very happy about this move because they think that the questions of women 's rights , human rights , freedom of expression will have a catalytic effect on turkey as well .
so it seems like a happy marriage .

a prominent iranian scholar argues that islam is integral to european society . hamid dabashi is an american-iranian intellectual historian who has studied iran and shia islam from a postcolonial perspective .
he 's currently hagop kervokian professor of iranian studies at columbia university in new york . deutsche welle : in europe , many muslims live in ' parallel societies ' , in the states there 's no such problem .
why are american muslims so much better integrated ?
hamid dabashi : the arab-muslim immigration in the united states has historically been quite minimal , very , very minuscule compared to others .
the basic impetus behind immigration is economic .
capital - in my judgement - is color-blind , and gender-neutral .
you can trace the history of feminist movements around the world , for example , to the necessity of cheap labor , that 's when women entered the job market , and as workers began demanding and exacting more rights .
the same is true for immigrants : they are paid less than others .
so if you are , for example , lebanese , or sudanese , or turkish , or iranian , or pakistani , coming to the united states , entering the job market , it has absolutely nothing to do with your religion ; it is entirely irrelevant .
europe , in my judgement , has successfully posited the myth of a more homogenous cultural entity for itself .
a combination of self-secularized christianity , and - after the horrors of the holocaust - the manufacturing of a " judeo-christian " identity has given europe a renewed reliance on the myth of its origin .
and then , of course , there is the french revolution , the enlightenment , the unification of europe , and the post-soviet reconstruction of a european identity .
europe itself , in this renewed conception of itself , has enough problems now of assimilating the eastern european to the domain of its collective identity .
the idea of europe , historically , is really limited to that of the western europe . when giscard d 'estaing talks about not accepting the turks in the european union , he speaks a christian language , despite his self-secularized conception of who he is and what he stands for .
so the problem europe has with muslims coming from africa , coming from the middle east , coming from south asia is , in part , a reflection of its own inner anxieties with two sorts of europeans - eastern europeans and muslim europeans .
here is an issue that since the time of austria-hungarian imperial rivalry with the ottomans has been a very disconcerting issue for the idea of " europe , " i.e. the notion of muslim europe .
so for all of these reasons , europe has a more difficult time assimilating its muslims than the us .
so with all these integration difficulties already , is it , do you think , too much for the european mind to cope with the idea of turkey becoming part of the european union ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could benefit on several fronts by making turkey a member dabashi : well , that 's obviously something for the aging and thinning population of white europeans to decide .
because of the well being of europeans over many years , europe is an ageing society .
as a result , it needs labour - the cheaper the labor the better - that 's the logic of capital .
and yet labor comes with a baggage .
the european economy needs cheap labor , but european culture does n't like the fact that , ultimately , culture will be influenced by labor migration .
this is the dilemma that europe faces : it wants to have its cake and eat it , too .
but this is what we 're facing right now ; it 's a clash between culture and capital .
would you , then , say that " european islam , " the idea of islam becoming part of a european culture , more modern , more moderate , is also a false concept in this respect ?
dabashi : my problem with tariq ramadan -lrb- swiss muslim scholar - ed . -rrb- is that he thinks if he just writes it , it will happen .
islam , by virtue of european muslims , has to contend with other european moral , intellectual , imaginative , and political forces .
the difference between someone like me and tariq ramadan is that i do n't think of islam , i think of muslims .
muslims have precedent .
islam is an abstraction .
so whether giscard d 'estaing likes it or not , islam - by virtue of labour migration , by virtue of muslims walking in the streets of paris , and london etc . - becomes integral to the european society - it already is ; and as a result the collective disposition of the culture will change , too .
in effect , the changes are going to be made by social forces , not by muslim intellectuals . but are you confident this is going to happen ?
because if you argue this way everyone who is an islamist will inevitably deny this because he knows that if he 's willing to accept it his faith is going to be powerless one day in the foreseeable future .
if you look at europe , the power of religion , its influence on society has decreased ever since the enlightenment .
dabashi : forget about europe for now - if you go to india and go to saudi arabia and go to morocco and go to china you have four different kinds of islam .
islam is not quintessential .
it is a sacred language spoken in different dialects by people living different lives .
so by the same logic when muslims come to europe , they will redefine islam .
and there is nobody on planet earth who can tell them , what you 're doing is not islamic , you 're losing your religion .
the successive generations will redefine islam .
this is what i have against mandatory laws against veiling .
veiling will persist or else be modified by second and third generation muslims .
when they 're going to school , if they do n't want to wear it , they wo n't , if they want to wear it , they will .
if there is force at home for them to wear it , gradually , that force will be contexualized by other forces , by peer pressure , by forces of the market , by mass and globalized culture .
the thing that you do n't want is to have the state come and tell you what clothing item you can wear or can not wear .
back to the issue of turkey : what is your personal opinion , should europe ask turkey to become a member of the european union ?
dabashi : i think the membership of turkey in the european union will inevitably happen .
first , it will provide the european economy with cheap labor .
second it will expand the eu in terms of raw material available in turkey .
third , it will expand the european economic market .
fourth , it will strategically strengthen europe in terms of its inevitable rivalries with the united states in the region .
so economically , politically and militarily , it is to the benefit of europe .
and many of my progressive turkish colleagues are very happy about this move because they think that the questions of women 's rights , human rights , freedom of expression will have a catalytic effect on turkey as well .
so it seems like a happy marriage .

a prominent iranian scholar argues that islam is integral to european society . hamid dabashi is an american-iranian intellectual historian who has studied iran and shia islam from a postcolonial perspective .
he 's currently hagop kervokian professor of iranian studies at columbia university in new york . deutsche welle : in europe , many muslims live in ' parallel societies ' , in the states there 's no such problem .
why are american muslims so much better integrated ?
hamid dabashi : the arab-muslim immigration in the united states has historically been quite minimal , very , very minuscule compared to others .
the basic impetus behind immigration is economic .
capital - in my judgement - is color-blind , and gender-neutral .
you can trace the history of feminist movements around the world , for example , to the necessity of cheap labor , that 's when women entered the job market , and as workers began demanding and exacting more rights .
the same is true for immigrants : they are paid less than others .
so if you are , for example , lebanese , or sudanese , or turkish , or iranian , or pakistani , coming to the united states , entering the job market , it has absolutely nothing to do with your religion ; it is entirely irrelevant .
europe , in my judgement , has successfully posited the myth of a more homogenous cultural entity for itself .
a combination of self-secularized christianity , and - after the horrors of the holocaust - the manufacturing of a " judeo-christian " identity has given europe a renewed reliance on the myth of its origin .
and then , of course , there is the french revolution , the enlightenment , the unification of europe , and the post-soviet reconstruction of a european identity .
europe itself , in this renewed conception of itself , has enough problems now of assimilating the eastern european to the domain of its collective identity .
the idea of europe , historically , is really limited to that of the western europe . when giscard d 'estaing talks about not accepting the turks in the european union , he speaks a christian language , despite his self-secularized conception of who he is and what he stands for .
so the problem europe has with muslims coming from africa , coming from the middle east , coming from south asia is , in part , a reflection of its own inner anxieties with two sorts of europeans - eastern europeans and muslim europeans .
here is an issue that since the time of austria-hungarian imperial rivalry with the ottomans has been a very disconcerting issue for the idea of " europe , " i.e. the notion of muslim europe .
so for all of these reasons , europe has a more difficult time assimilating its muslims than the us .
so with all these integration difficulties already , is it , do you think , too much for the european mind to cope with the idea of turkey becoming part of the european union ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could benefit on several fronts by making turkey a member dabashi : well , that 's obviously something for the aging and thinning population of white europeans to decide .
because of the well being of europeans over many years , europe is an ageing society .
as a result , it needs labour - the cheaper the labor the better - that 's the logic of capital .
and yet labor comes with a baggage .
the european economy needs cheap labor , but european culture does n't like the fact that , ultimately , culture will be influenced by labor migration .
this is the dilemma that europe faces : it wants to have its cake and eat it , too .
but this is what we 're facing right now ; it 's a clash between culture and capital .
would you , then , say that " european islam , " the idea of islam becoming part of a european culture , more modern , more moderate , is also a false concept in this respect ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could benefit on several fronts by making turkey a member dabashi : well , that 's obviously something for the aging and thinning population of white europeans to decide .
because of the well being of europeans over many years , europe is an ageing society .
as a result , it needs labour - the cheaper the labor the better - that 's the logic of capital .
and yet labor comes with a baggage .
the european economy needs cheap labor , but european culture does n't like the fact that , ultimately , culture will be influenced by labor migration .
this is the dilemma that europe faces : it wants to have its cake and eat it , too .
but this is what we 're facing right now ; it 's a clash between culture and capital .
would you , then , say that " european islam , " the idea of islam becoming part of a european culture , more modern , more moderate , is also a false concept in this respect ?
dabashi : my problem with tariq ramadan -lrb- swiss muslim scholar - ed . -rrb- is that he thinks if he just writes it , it will happen .
islam , by virtue of european muslims , has to contend with other european moral , intellectual , imaginative , and political forces .
the difference between someone like me and tariq ramadan is that i do n't think of islam , i think of muslims .
muslims have precedent .
islam is an abstraction .
so whether giscard d 'estaing likes it or not , islam - by virtue of labour migration , by virtue of muslims walking in the streets of paris , and london etc . - becomes integral to the european society - it already is ; and as a result the collective disposition of the culture will change , too .
in effect , the changes are going to be made by social forces , not by muslim intellectuals . but are you confident this is going to happen ?
because if you argue this way everyone who is an islamist will inevitably deny this because he knows that if he 's willing to accept it his faith is going to be powerless one day in the foreseeable future .
if you look at europe , the power of religion , its influence on society has decreased ever since the enlightenment .
dabashi : forget about europe for now - if you go to india and go to saudi arabia and go to morocco and go to china you have four different kinds of islam .
islam is not quintessential .
it is a sacred language spoken in different dialects by people living different lives .
so by the same logic when muslims come to europe , they will redefine islam .
and there is nobody on planet earth who can tell them , what you 're doing is not islamic , you 're losing your religion .
the successive generations will redefine islam .
this is what i have against mandatory laws against veiling .
veiling will persist or else be modified by second and third generation muslims .
when they 're going to school , if they do n't want to wear it , they wo n't , if they want to wear it , they will .
if there is force at home for them to wear it , gradually , that force will be contexualized by other forces , by peer pressure , by forces of the market , by mass and globalized culture .
the thing that you do n't want is to have the state come and tell you what clothing item you can wear or can not wear .
back to the issue of turkey : what is your personal opinion , should europe ask turkey to become a member of the european union ?
dabashi : i think the membership of turkey in the european union will inevitably happen .
first , it will provide the european economy with cheap labor .
second it will expand the eu in terms of raw material available in turkey .
third , it will expand the european economic market .
fourth , it will strategically strengthen europe in terms of its inevitable rivalries with the united states in the region .
so economically , politically and militarily , it is to the benefit of europe .
and many of my progressive turkish colleagues are very happy about this move because they think that the questions of women 's rights , human rights , freedom of expression will have a catalytic effect on turkey as well .
so it seems like a happy marriage .

a prominent iranian scholar argues that islam is integral to european society . hamid dabashi is an american-iranian intellectual historian who has studied iran and shia islam from a postcolonial perspective .
he 's currently hagop kervokian professor of iranian studies at columbia university in new york . deutsche welle : in europe , many muslims live in ' parallel societies ' , in the states there 's no such problem .
why are american muslims so much better integrated ?
hamid dabashi : the arab-muslim immigration in the united states has historically been quite minimal , very , very minuscule compared to others .
the basic impetus behind immigration is economic .
capital - in my judgement - is color-blind , and gender-neutral .
you can trace the history of feminist movements around the world , for example , to the necessity of cheap labor , that 's when women entered the job market , and as workers began demanding and exacting more rights .
the same is true for immigrants : they are paid less than others .
so if you are , for example , lebanese , or sudanese , or turkish , or iranian , or pakistani , coming to the united states , entering the job market , it has absolutely nothing to do with your religion ; it is entirely irrelevant .
europe , in my judgement , has successfully posited the myth of a more homogenous cultural entity for itself .
a combination of self-secularized christianity , and - after the horrors of the holocaust - the manufacturing of a " judeo-christian " identity has given europe a renewed reliance on the myth of its origin .
and then , of course , there is the french revolution , the enlightenment , the unification of europe , and the post-soviet reconstruction of a european identity .
europe itself , in this renewed conception of itself , has enough problems now of assimilating the eastern european to the domain of its collective identity .
the idea of europe , historically , is really limited to that of the western europe . when giscard d 'estaing talks about not accepting the turks in the european union , he speaks a christian language , despite his self-secularized conception of who he is and what he stands for .
so the problem europe has with muslims coming from africa , coming from the middle east , coming from south asia is , in part , a reflection of its own inner anxieties with two sorts of europeans - eastern europeans and muslim europeans .
here is an issue that since the time of austria-hungarian imperial rivalry with the ottomans has been a very disconcerting issue for the idea of " europe , " i.e. the notion of muslim europe .
so for all of these reasons , europe has a more difficult time assimilating its muslims than the us .
so with all these integration difficulties already , is it , do you think , too much for the european mind to cope with the idea of turkey becoming part of the european union ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could benefit on several fronts by making turkey a member dabashi : well , that 's obviously something for the aging and thinning population of white europeans to decide .

" the time of the resistance has come , " socialist leader edi rama told the crowd gathered in front of the albanian government building in tirana . " we are determined to continue the protests and civil disobedience , to oblige the government either to be transparent in regard to the fraud-marked elections or to leave , " he said . fatmir xhasa , a socialist deputy , told the protestors that 22 lawmakers would launch a hunger strike in front of the seat of government to demand election transparency . the conservative democrats , led by prime minister sali berisha , narrowly won the general elections on june 28 but have been hounded by allegations of vote-rigging ever since .
in response , the opposition socialists have staged a boycott , effectively stalling the government for months . the socialists returned to parliament in february , but still refuse to take part in any votes .
they are calling for a recount of ballots in several voting districts , but the ruling government has rejected the demands as illegal . the political deadlock has hindered albania 's eu ambitions – the country submitted its candidacy in april last year – and its plans to become part of the visa-free schengen zone , which covers most of europe . cmk / afp / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

street view allows users to look at photos of individual streets at ground level all over the world , with images taken from specially equipped vehicles .
the panoramic views of cities in the us , japan , australia and parts of europe are already available online .
the product is a supplement to google 's maps .
the german government complained that this software could encroach on the privacy of its citizens .
aigner argued that thieves could use the pictures of houses to gauge people 's wealth and prepare burglaries , and that people 's pictures might be published online without their consent .
aigner 's aides said the minister told google that " what is private has to stay private . "
opting out google now says it will wait until later this year to launch its german images to give people the chance to file complaints .
anyone who wishes can have the image of their house blocked out , and google has promised to obscure any faces present in the pictures .
the company has offered this same service to people around the world , but retroactively , removing the images only after publishing them .
for germany , it is agreeing to do its editing beforehand where possible .

street view allows users to look at photos of individual streets at ground level all over the world , with images taken from specially equipped vehicles .
the panoramic views of cities in the us , japan , australia and parts of europe are already available online .
the product is a supplement to google 's maps .
the german government complained that this software could encroach on the privacy of its citizens .
aigner argued that thieves could use the pictures of houses to gauge people 's wealth and prepare burglaries , and that people 's pictures might be published online without their consent .
aigner 's aides said the minister told google that " what is private has to stay private . "
opting out google now says it will wait until later this year to launch its german images to give people the chance to file complaints .
anyone who wishes can have the image of their house blocked out , and google has promised to obscure any faces present in the pictures .
the company has offered this same service to people around the world , but retroactively , removing the images only after publishing them .
for germany , it is agreeing to do its editing beforehand where possible .
privacy concerns are a particularly contentious issue in germany , due to the abuses by hitler 's nazi government and the communist rulers of the former east germany in the past. msh / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " i would very much welcome voluntary participation from banks , " merkel said , according to advance excerpts from an interview set to be published in the mass-circulation bild am sonntag paper on sunday , may 2 . the eurozone and imf emergency loans deal for greece is unpopular in germany , and politicians were initially reluctant to support the idea .
however , most now seem to believe that the measure is necessary to prop up the single european currency , the euro . the former leader of the opposition social democrats and current state premier of rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck , was among the first politicians to suggest that banks should contribute to the greek rescue fund - and the idea has picked up speed since then . state broadcaster ard , citing insider sources , now reports that germany 's banks will contribute around 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- to the rescue package .
germany is set to provide just over 8 billion euros in the first year , paying the largest share of any eurozone nation because germany is the bloc 's largest economy . france will be the second largest eurozone contributor to the greek package and merkel and her french counterpart , nicolas sarkozy , are ready to act quickly to unlock a massive rescue plan for greece , sarkozy 's office said saturday .
sarkozy spoke by phone with the german chancellor and both " reaffirmed their determination to act quickly to implement the support plan " once spending cuts are agreed with athens , said an elysee statement .
' just a placebo ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt-based banking community is already exposed to the greek market but bank participation in the greece rescue plan is not to everyone 's liking .
chancellor merkel 's main adversary in the bundestag and leader of the social democrats , sigmar gabriel , is not excited by the prospect of banks contributing to the loan package . gabriel said in an interview with the neue westfaelische newspaper on saturday that the proposition was just an attempt to " quell the public rage that taxpayers would have to pay for the greed of bankers and speculators for a second time . " " what 's now being considered by deutsche bank boss josef ackermann and the coalition government in berlin , namely for banks to voluntarily contribute -lsb- towards the greek rescue -rsb- , is nothing more than a placebo , " gabriel said . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann has not yet commented publicly on the issue , but a series of reports all name him as the coordinator of a bank contribution to the greek fund . ackermann held an emergency meeting with greek prime minister george papandreou and finance minister george papaconstantinou in athens in february , looking for ways to help the country , which owes money to deutsche bank . german banks have the second-largest exposure to the greek market , after their french counterparts . payback time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks are not very popular among germans right now as in much of the western world , anti-bank sentiment in germany is currently very strong .
popular perception is that the institutions single-handedly caused the recent recession , only to be bailed out by the government and taxpayers . germany was one of many countries that helped its banks stay afloat during the recent recession - with perhaps the most famous near-failed money-lender , hypo real-estate , applying for another 1.85 billion euros on friday .
hre has already received a string of loans and credit guarantees from berlin worth in excess of 100 billion euros . the fact that derivatives trading and currency speculation helped tip greek interest rates to an unmanageable level - forcing athens to apply for these emergency loans - has only strengthened public opinion that the financial sector is again at fault for greece 's problems . in principle , at least , the greek rescue package differs from much of the state financial aid offered during the financial crisis . eurozone nations intend to borrow money , and then lend that money to greece at a slightly higher rate of interest , which would still be more competitive than the rates offered directly to athens on the open market . assuming heavily indebted greece is one day in a position to repay the loans , the donors - including any banks that contribute - are set to make a slight profit . it would go against the eu 's lisbon treaty for countries to simply give money to greece , as " bailouts " are not permitted under current eurozone rules . msh / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some experts say it was governments who allowed rating firms to gain too much power in the first place . after stocks and the euro took a tumble this week on the announcement that credit rating agency standard and poor 's was downgrading greece 's credit rating to junk status , new calls have gone out for ratings agencies to act " responsibly " and for the creation of an independent european rating agency . but responsibility is not a word that has been associated with credit ratings agencies much in the wake of the global financial crisis , especially after it emerged that the business practices of the big three us ratings firms - standard and poor 's , moody 's and fitch - played a central role in helping bring about the economic meltdown . " we should not make the welfare of europe dependent on ratings agencies , " peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's independent economic advisory panel , told the newspaper die welt . german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who called for a european credit rating agency , said rating agencies must not develop , sell and rate financial products at the same time . " conflicts of interest are guaranteed , " he said . a matter of accuracy a top international monetary fund official questioned the agencies ' accuracy , arguing that that their assessments reflect mainly investors ' perceptions of a nation 's financial health . " that 's why you should n't believe too much in what they say , " imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle wants a european ratings agency but according to manfred jäger-ambrozewicz of the cologne institute of business research , government regulators and governments themselves , who also depend on ratings agencies analysis , have played a role in the increase of the agencies ' influence . " it 's kind of ridiculous that they 've turned on them now , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are the ones who have largely given them so much power . " he added that the creation of a new european ratings agency would be possible , but that agencies are built on their reputations , and it would take some time for a brand-new ratings entity to become credible . " but if in addition to the private rating we had something from a semi-state agency or a rating by a body like the imf or the european central bank , that could be helpful , " jäger-ambrozewicz said . later this year , new eu rules which were hammered out last year will apply some regulation on already-existing agencies that operate in europe . the rules , which go into effect in december , will oblige the agencies to disclose information about the models and methods on which their ratings are based and require adherence to new corporate governance standards meant to guard against potential conflicts of interest . risk assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standard and poor 's rating downgrade for greece sent stocks and the euro tumbling credit ratings agencies began their lives as market researchers , analyzing corporate debt for people or groups considering whether or not to purchase that debt .
potential buyers depend on ratings to determine the credit risk involved . for most of their existence , rating agencies answered a simple , but critical question : if i loan somebody money by buying one of their bonds , am i going to get that money back ? the agencies developed a grading system to indicate the sureness of the investment .
companies , cities and countries get rated .
standard and poor 's gives ibm its top rating , meaning there is very low risk .
argentina , on the other hand , gets the equivalent of a b- . for investors , ratings agencies are supposed to provide independent measurements of credit risk , which in turn increases market efficiency , and adds to the supply of risk capital in the market , which can lead to stronger growth . mission creep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit rating agencies are now in the crosshairs starting in the 1970s , credit rating agencies began to get more powerful and these days , a significant bond issuance must have at least one rating from a respected ratings agency to be successful . by the early 1980s , a different kind of bond appeared on the scene : so-called structured finance instruments such as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations .
those are the now infamous complex financial creations made up of thousands of loans and mortgages bundled together and then sold as bonds .
in effect , they became almost too complex for ratings agencies to get a handle on , but they rated them anyway , usually positively . " mixing cocktails of risk , you really want to know what is the percentage of alcohol in the drinks , " said irwin collier , a professor of finance at berlin 's free university .
" financial innovation is a good thing , but what is bad is when the information gets falsified . " initial success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rating agencies trippled their revenues between 2002 and 2007 it was the rise and initial success of those complex financial instruments that led the three big rating agencies down a path of great financial gain for themselves , but disaster for economy as a whole .
they began looking for ways to give their seal of approval to bonds , even working directly with the bond issuer .
and that , critics say , drove a stake in the heart of their neutrality . ratings agencies make their money by charging fees to those they rated , creating an inherent conflict of interest . furthermore , if moody 's , for example , indicated to a bond issuer that it was not willing to give it a good rating , the issuer could simply go over to standard and poor 's or fitch , whichever would be willing to provide the aaa imprimatur . it was in the agencies ' own financial interest to work with bond issuers to find a way to give out these top ratings .
and agencies ' pursued that interest aggressively .
between 2002 and 2007 , the firms tripled their revenues . " it 's like the parties in court paying the judge 's salary , " said us senator carl levin at a hearing last week in washington that looked into whether the agencies failed to provide honest assessments of securities to investors . poor performance , poor oversight the credit agencies ' track record is not very impressive .
according to the new york times , of aaa-rated subprime-mortgage-backed securities issued in 2006 , 93 percent have been downgraded to junk status .
they failed to foresee the collapse of the us housing market . the agencies are not overseen by the us securities and exchange commission , and they have escaped any legal liability by claiming that their ratings are just opinions , protected by the american first amendment right to free speech . while the credibility of the big agencies has been hit , they are still the only game in town and have tremendous power , as the reaction to the greek debt rating and subsequent ratings about portugal and spain have shown . " the markets are still listening , that 's clear , " collier said . author : kyle james editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a prominent iranian scholar argues that islam is integral to european society . hamid dabashi is an american-iranian intellectual historian who has studied iran and shia islam from a postcolonial perspective .
he 's currently hagop kervokian professor of iranian studies at columbia university in new york . deutsche welle : in europe , many muslims live in ' parallel societies ' , in the states there 's no such problem .
why are american muslims so much better integrated ?
hamid dabashi : the arab-muslim immigration in the united states has historically been quite minimal , very , very minuscule compared to others .
the basic impetus behind immigration is economic .
capital - in my judgement - is color-blind , and gender-neutral .
you can trace the history of feminist movements around the world , for example , to the necessity of cheap labor , that 's when women entered the job market , and as workers began demanding and exacting more rights .
the same is true for immigrants : they are paid less than others .
so if you are , for example , lebanese , or sudanese , or turkish , or iranian , or pakistani , coming to the united states , entering the job market , it has absolutely nothing to do with your religion ; it is entirely irrelevant .
europe , in my judgement , has successfully posited the myth of a more homogenous cultural entity for itself .
a combination of self-secularized christianity , and - after the horrors of the holocaust - the manufacturing of a " judeo-christian " identity has given europe a renewed reliance on the myth of its origin .
and then , of course , there is the french revolution , the enlightenment , the unification of europe , and the post-soviet reconstruction of a european identity .
europe itself , in this renewed conception of itself , has enough problems now of assimilating the eastern european to the domain of its collective identity .
the idea of europe , historically , is really limited to that of the western europe . when giscard d 'estaing talks about not accepting the turks in the european union , he speaks a christian language , despite his self-secularized conception of who he is and what he stands for .
so the problem europe has with muslims coming from africa , coming from the middle east , coming from south asia is , in part , a reflection of its own inner anxieties with two sorts of europeans - eastern europeans and muslim europeans .
here is an issue that since the time of austria-hungarian imperial rivalry with the ottomans has been a very disconcerting issue for the idea of " europe , " i.e. the notion of muslim europe .
so for all of these reasons , europe has a more difficult time assimilating its muslims than the us .
so with all these integration difficulties already , is it , do you think , too much for the european mind to cope with the idea of turkey becoming part of the european union ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could benefit on several fronts by making turkey a member dabashi : well , that 's obviously something for the aging and thinning population of white europeans to decide .
because of the well being of europeans over many years , europe is an ageing society .
as a result , it needs labour - the cheaper the labor the better - that 's the logic of capital .
and yet labor comes with a baggage .
the european economy needs cheap labor , but european culture does n't like the fact that , ultimately , culture will be influenced by labor migration .
this is the dilemma that europe faces : it wants to have its cake and eat it , too .
but this is what we 're facing right now ; it 's a clash between culture and capital .
would you , then , say that " european islam , " the idea of islam becoming part of a european culture , more modern , more moderate , is also a false concept in this respect ?
dabashi : my problem with tariq ramadan -lrb- swiss muslim scholar - ed . -rrb- is that he thinks if he just writes it , it will happen .
islam , by virtue of european muslims , has to contend with other european moral , intellectual , imaginative , and political forces .
the difference between someone like me and tariq ramadan is that i do n't think of islam , i think of muslims .
muslims have precedent .
islam is an abstraction .
so whether giscard d 'estaing likes it or not , islam - by virtue of labour migration , by virtue of muslims walking in the streets of paris , and london etc . - becomes integral to the european society - it already is ; and as a result the collective disposition of the culture will change , too .
in effect , the changes are going to be made by social forces , not by muslim intellectuals . but are you confident this is going to happen ?
because if you argue this way everyone who is an islamist will inevitably deny this because he knows that if he 's willing to accept it his faith is going to be powerless one day in the foreseeable future .
if you look at europe , the power of religion , its influence on society has decreased ever since the enlightenment .
dabashi : forget about europe for now - if you go to india and go to saudi arabia and go to morocco and go to china you have four different kinds of islam .
islam is not quintessential .
it is a sacred language spoken in different dialects by people living different lives .
so by the same logic when muslims come to europe , they will redefine islam .
and there is nobody on planet earth who can tell them , what you 're doing is not islamic , you 're losing your religion .
the successive generations will redefine islam .
this is what i have against mandatory laws against veiling .
veiling will persist or else be modified by second and third generation muslims .
when they 're going to school , if they do n't want to wear it , they wo n't , if they want to wear it , they will .
if there is force at home for them to wear it , gradually , that force will be contexualized by other forces , by peer pressure , by forces of the market , by mass and globalized culture .
the thing that you do n't want is to have the state come and tell you what clothing item you can wear or can not wear .
back to the issue of turkey : what is your personal opinion , should europe ask turkey to become a member of the european union ?
dabashi : i think the membership of turkey in the european union will inevitably happen .
first , it will provide the european economy with cheap labor .
second it will expand the eu in terms of raw material available in turkey .
third , it will expand the european economic market .
fourth , it will strategically strengthen europe in terms of its inevitable rivalries with the united states in the region .
so economically , politically and militarily , it is to the benefit of europe .
and many of my progressive turkish colleagues are very happy about this move because they think that the questions of women 's rights , human rights , freedom of expression will have a catalytic effect on turkey as well .
so it seems like a happy marriage .

a prominent iranian scholar argues that islam is integral to european society . hamid dabashi is an american-iranian intellectual historian who has studied iran and shia islam from a postcolonial perspective .
he 's currently hagop kervokian professor of iranian studies at columbia university in new york . deutsche welle : in europe , many muslims live in ' parallel societies ' , in the states there 's no such problem .
why are american muslims so much better integrated ?
hamid dabashi : the arab-muslim immigration in the united states has historically been quite minimal , very , very minuscule compared to others .
the basic impetus behind immigration is economic .
capital - in my judgement - is color-blind , and gender-neutral .
you can trace the history of feminist movements around the world , for example , to the necessity of cheap labor , that 's when women entered the job market , and as workers began demanding and exacting more rights .
the same is true for immigrants : they are paid less than others .
so if you are , for example , lebanese , or sudanese , or turkish , or iranian , or pakistani , coming to the united states , entering the job market , it has absolutely nothing to do with your religion ; it is entirely irrelevant .
europe , in my judgement , has successfully posited the myth of a more homogenous cultural entity for itself .
a combination of self-secularized christianity , and - after the horrors of the holocaust - the manufacturing of a " judeo-christian " identity has given europe a renewed reliance on the myth of its origin .
and then , of course , there is the french revolution , the enlightenment , the unification of europe , and the post-soviet reconstruction of a european identity .
europe itself , in this renewed conception of itself , has enough problems now of assimilating the eastern european to the domain of its collective identity .
the idea of europe , historically , is really limited to that of the western europe . when giscard d 'estaing talks about not accepting the turks in the european union , he speaks a christian language , despite his self-secularized conception of who he is and what he stands for .
so the problem europe has with muslims coming from africa , coming from the middle east , coming from south asia is , in part , a reflection of its own inner anxieties with two sorts of europeans - eastern europeans and muslim europeans .
here is an issue that since the time of austria-hungarian imperial rivalry with the ottomans has been a very disconcerting issue for the idea of " europe , " i.e. the notion of muslim europe .
so for all of these reasons , europe has a more difficult time assimilating its muslims than the us .
so with all these integration difficulties already , is it , do you think , too much for the european mind to cope with the idea of turkey becoming part of the european union ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could benefit on several fronts by making turkey a member dabashi : well , that 's obviously something for the aging and thinning population of white europeans to decide .
because of the well being of europeans over many years , europe is an ageing society .
as a result , it needs labour - the cheaper the labor the better - that 's the logic of capital .
and yet labor comes with a baggage .
the european economy needs cheap labor , but european culture does n't like the fact that , ultimately , culture will be influenced by labor migration .
this is the dilemma that europe faces : it wants to have its cake and eat it , too .
but this is what we 're facing right now ; it 's a clash between culture and capital .
would you , then , say that " european islam , " the idea of islam becoming part of a european culture , more modern , more moderate , is also a false concept in this respect ?
dabashi : my problem with tariq ramadan -lrb- swiss muslim scholar - ed . -rrb- is that he thinks if he just writes it , it will happen .
islam , by virtue of european muslims , has to contend with other european moral , intellectual , imaginative , and political forces .
the difference between someone like me and tariq ramadan is that i do n't think of islam , i think of muslims .
muslims have precedent .
islam is an abstraction .
so whether giscard d 'estaing likes it or not , islam - by virtue of labour migration , by virtue of muslims walking in the streets of paris , and london etc . - becomes integral to the european society - it already is ; and as a result the collective disposition of the culture will change , too .

so with all these integration difficulties already , is it , do you think , too much for the european mind to cope with the idea of turkey becoming part of the european union ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could benefit on several fronts by making turkey a member dabashi : well , that 's obviously something for the aging and thinning population of white europeans to decide .
because of the well being of europeans over many years , europe is an ageing society .
as a result , it needs labour - the cheaper the labor the better - that 's the logic of capital .
and yet labor comes with a baggage .
the european economy needs cheap labor , but european culture does n't like the fact that , ultimately , culture will be influenced by labor migration .
this is the dilemma that europe faces : it wants to have its cake and eat it , too .
but this is what we 're facing right now ; it 's a clash between culture and capital .
would you , then , say that " european islam , " the idea of islam becoming part of a european culture , more modern , more moderate , is also a false concept in this respect ?
dabashi : my problem with tariq ramadan -lrb- swiss muslim scholar - ed . -rrb- is that he thinks if he just writes it , it will happen .
islam , by virtue of european muslims , has to contend with other european moral , intellectual , imaginative , and political forces .
the difference between someone like me and tariq ramadan is that i do n't think of islam , i think of muslims .
muslims have precedent .
islam is an abstraction .
so whether giscard d 'estaing likes it or not , islam - by virtue of labour migration , by virtue of muslims walking in the streets of paris , and london etc . - becomes integral to the european society - it already is ; and as a result the collective disposition of the culture will change , too .
in effect , the changes are going to be made by social forces , not by muslim intellectuals . but are you confident this is going to happen ?
because if you argue this way everyone who is an islamist will inevitably deny this because he knows that if he 's willing to accept it his faith is going to be powerless one day in the foreseeable future .
if you look at europe , the power of religion , its influence on society has decreased ever since the enlightenment .
dabashi : forget about europe for now - if you go to india and go to saudi arabia and go to morocco and go to china you have four different kinds of islam .
islam is not quintessential .
it is a sacred language spoken in different dialects by people living different lives .
so by the same logic when muslims come to europe , they will redefine islam .
and there is nobody on planet earth who can tell them , what you 're doing is not islamic , you 're losing your religion .
the successive generations will redefine islam .
this is what i have against mandatory laws against veiling .
veiling will persist or else be modified by second and third generation muslims .
when they 're going to school , if they do n't want to wear it , they wo n't , if they want to wear it , they will .
if there is force at home for them to wear it , gradually , that force will be contexualized by other forces , by peer pressure , by forces of the market , by mass and globalized culture .
the thing that you do n't want is to have the state come and tell you what clothing item you can wear or can not wear .
back to the issue of turkey : what is your personal opinion , should europe ask turkey to become a member of the european union ?
dabashi : i think the membership of turkey in the european union will inevitably happen .
first , it will provide the european economy with cheap labor .
second it will expand the eu in terms of raw material available in turkey .
third , it will expand the european economic market .
fourth , it will strategically strengthen europe in terms of its inevitable rivalries with the united states in the region .
so economically , politically and militarily , it is to the benefit of europe .
and many of my progressive turkish colleagues are very happy about this move because they think that the questions of women 's rights , human rights , freedom of expression will have a catalytic effect on turkey as well .
so it seems like a happy marriage .

a prominent iranian scholar argues that islam is integral to european society . hamid dabashi is an american-iranian intellectual historian who has studied iran and shia islam from a postcolonial perspective .
he 's currently hagop kervokian professor of iranian studies at columbia university in new york . deutsche welle : in europe , many muslims live in ' parallel societies ' , in the states there 's no such problem .
why are american muslims so much better integrated ?
hamid dabashi : the arab-muslim immigration in the united states has historically been quite minimal , very , very minuscule compared to others .
the basic impetus behind immigration is economic .
capital - in my judgement - is color-blind , and gender-neutral .
you can trace the history of feminist movements around the world , for example , to the necessity of cheap labor , that 's when women entered the job market , and as workers began demanding and exacting more rights .
the same is true for immigrants : they are paid less than others .
so if you are , for example , lebanese , or sudanese , or turkish , or iranian , or pakistani , coming to the united states , entering the job market , it has absolutely nothing to do with your religion ; it is entirely irrelevant .
europe , in my judgement , has successfully posited the myth of a more homogenous cultural entity for itself .
a combination of self-secularized christianity , and - after the horrors of the holocaust - the manufacturing of a " judeo-christian " identity has given europe a renewed reliance on the myth of its origin .
and then , of course , there is the french revolution , the enlightenment , the unification of europe , and the post-soviet reconstruction of a european identity .
europe itself , in this renewed conception of itself , has enough problems now of assimilating the eastern european to the domain of its collective identity .
the idea of europe , historically , is really limited to that of the western europe . when giscard d 'estaing talks about not accepting the turks in the european union , he speaks a christian language , despite his self-secularized conception of who he is and what he stands for .
so the problem europe has with muslims coming from africa , coming from the middle east , coming from south asia is , in part , a reflection of its own inner anxieties with two sorts of europeans - eastern europeans and muslim europeans .
here is an issue that since the time of austria-hungarian imperial rivalry with the ottomans has been a very disconcerting issue for the idea of " europe , " i.e. the notion of muslim europe .

the idea of europe , historically , is really limited to that of the western europe . when giscard d 'estaing talks about not accepting the turks in the european union , he speaks a christian language , despite his self-secularized conception of who he is and what he stands for .
so the problem europe has with muslims coming from africa , coming from the middle east , coming from south asia is , in part , a reflection of its own inner anxieties with two sorts of europeans - eastern europeans and muslim europeans .
here is an issue that since the time of austria-hungarian imperial rivalry with the ottomans has been a very disconcerting issue for the idea of " europe , " i.e. the notion of muslim europe .
so for all of these reasons , europe has a more difficult time assimilating its muslims than the us .
so with all these integration difficulties already , is it , do you think , too much for the european mind to cope with the idea of turkey becoming part of the european union ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could benefit on several fronts by making turkey a member dabashi : well , that 's obviously something for the aging and thinning population of white europeans to decide .
because of the well being of europeans over many years , europe is an ageing society .
as a result , it needs labour - the cheaper the labor the better - that 's the logic of capital .
and yet labor comes with a baggage .
the european economy needs cheap labor , but european culture does n't like the fact that , ultimately , culture will be influenced by labor migration .
this is the dilemma that europe faces : it wants to have its cake and eat it , too .
but this is what we 're facing right now ; it 's a clash between culture and capital .
would you , then , say that " european islam , " the idea of islam becoming part of a european culture , more modern , more moderate , is also a false concept in this respect ?
dabashi : my problem with tariq ramadan -lrb- swiss muslim scholar - ed . -rrb- is that he thinks if he just writes it , it will happen .
islam , by virtue of european muslims , has to contend with other european moral , intellectual , imaginative , and political forces .
the difference between someone like me and tariq ramadan is that i do n't think of islam , i think of muslims .
muslims have precedent .
islam is an abstraction .
so whether giscard d 'estaing likes it or not , islam - by virtue of labour migration , by virtue of muslims walking in the streets of paris , and london etc . - becomes integral to the european society - it already is ; and as a result the collective disposition of the culture will change , too .
in effect , the changes are going to be made by social forces , not by muslim intellectuals . but are you confident this is going to happen ?
because if you argue this way everyone who is an islamist will inevitably deny this because he knows that if he 's willing to accept it his faith is going to be powerless one day in the foreseeable future .
if you look at europe , the power of religion , its influence on society has decreased ever since the enlightenment .
dabashi : forget about europe for now - if you go to india and go to saudi arabia and go to morocco and go to china you have four different kinds of islam .
islam is not quintessential .
it is a sacred language spoken in different dialects by people living different lives .
so by the same logic when muslims come to europe , they will redefine islam .
and there is nobody on planet earth who can tell them , what you 're doing is not islamic , you 're losing your religion .
the successive generations will redefine islam .
this is what i have against mandatory laws against veiling .
veiling will persist or else be modified by second and third generation muslims .
when they 're going to school , if they do n't want to wear it , they wo n't , if they want to wear it , they will .
if there is force at home for them to wear it , gradually , that force will be contexualized by other forces , by peer pressure , by forces of the market , by mass and globalized culture .
the thing that you do n't want is to have the state come and tell you what clothing item you can wear or can not wear .
back to the issue of turkey : what is your personal opinion , should europe ask turkey to become a member of the european union ?
dabashi : i think the membership of turkey in the european union will inevitably happen .
first , it will provide the european economy with cheap labor .
second it will expand the eu in terms of raw material available in turkey .
third , it will expand the european economic market .
fourth , it will strategically strengthen europe in terms of its inevitable rivalries with the united states in the region .
so economically , politically and militarily , it is to the benefit of europe .
and many of my progressive turkish colleagues are very happy about this move because they think that the questions of women 's rights , human rights , freedom of expression will have a catalytic effect on turkey as well .
so it seems like a happy marriage .

a prominent iranian scholar argues that islam is integral to european society . hamid dabashi is an american-iranian intellectual historian who has studied iran and shia islam from a postcolonial perspective .
he 's currently hagop kervokian professor of iranian studies at columbia university in new york . deutsche welle : in europe , many muslims live in ' parallel societies ' , in the states there 's no such problem .
why are american muslims so much better integrated ?
hamid dabashi : the arab-muslim immigration in the united states has historically been quite minimal , very , very minuscule compared to others .
the basic impetus behind immigration is economic .
capital - in my judgement - is color-blind , and gender-neutral .
you can trace the history of feminist movements around the world , for example , to the necessity of cheap labor , that 's when women entered the job market , and as workers began demanding and exacting more rights .
the same is true for immigrants : they are paid less than others .
so if you are , for example , lebanese , or sudanese , or turkish , or iranian , or pakistani , coming to the united states , entering the job market , it has absolutely nothing to do with your religion ; it is entirely irrelevant .
europe , in my judgement , has successfully posited the myth of a more homogenous cultural entity for itself .
a combination of self-secularized christianity , and - after the horrors of the holocaust - the manufacturing of a " judeo-christian " identity has given europe a renewed reliance on the myth of its origin .
and then , of course , there is the french revolution , the enlightenment , the unification of europe , and the post-soviet reconstruction of a european identity .
europe itself , in this renewed conception of itself , has enough problems now of assimilating the eastern european to the domain of its collective identity .
the idea of europe , historically , is really limited to that of the western europe . when giscard d 'estaing talks about not accepting the turks in the european union , he speaks a christian language , despite his self-secularized conception of who he is and what he stands for .

" koch-mehrin said personal and religious freedom should be defended , but should not " go so far as to take away a person 's face in public . " " the burqa is a massive attack on the rights of women .

the belgian law , which must still be approved by the upper house of parliament , calls for fines of 250 euros and up to a week in jail . some of the 16 federal states in germany have already imposed bans on the wearing of headscarves by public school teachers . the belgian move has reignited the european debate on how to deal with muslim veils . the french government has proposed jailing and fining anyone who forces women to wear a full-face veil , as well as fining the wearer .

" koch-mehrin said personal and religious freedom should be defended , but should not " go so far as to take away a person 's face in public .

" " i would very much welcome voluntary participation from banks , " merkel said , according to advance excerpts from an interview set to be published in the mass-circulation bild am sonntag paper on sunday , may 2 . the eurozone and imf emergency loans deal for greece is unpopular in germany , and politicians were initially reluctant to support the idea .
however , most now seem to believe that the measure is necessary to prop up the single european currency , the euro . the former leader of the opposition social democrats and current state premier of rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck , was among the first politicians to suggest that banks should contribute to the greek rescue fund - and the idea has picked up speed since then . state broadcaster ard , citing insider sources , now reports that germany 's banks will contribute around 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- to the rescue package .
germany is set to provide just over 8 billion euros in the first year , paying the largest share of any eurozone nation because germany is the bloc 's largest economy . france will be the second largest eurozone contributor to the greek package and merkel and her french counterpart , nicolas sarkozy , are ready to act quickly to unlock a massive rescue plan for greece , sarkozy 's office said saturday .

" " what 's now being considered by deutsche bank boss josef ackermann and the coalition government in berlin , namely for banks to voluntarily contribute -lsb- towards the greek rescue -rsb- , is nothing more than a placebo , " gabriel said . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann has not yet commented publicly on the issue , but a series of reports all name him as the coordinator of a bank contribution to the greek fund . ackermann held an emergency meeting with greek prime minister george papandreou and finance minister george papaconstantinou in athens in february , looking for ways to help the country , which owes money to deutsche bank . german banks have the second-largest exposure to the greek market , after their french counterparts . payback time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks are not very popular among germans right now as in much of the western world , anti-bank sentiment in germany is currently very strong .
popular perception is that the institutions single-handedly caused the recent recession , only to be bailed out by the government and taxpayers . germany was one of many countries that helped its banks stay afloat during the recent recession - with perhaps the most famous near-failed money-lender , hypo real-estate , applying for another 1.85 billion euros on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical -pipe- 01.05.2010 us conductor axelrod plans rave , reality show with french orchestra großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : axelrod 's plans for the orchestra go beyond the concert hall john axelrod is beginning his new post as music director of france 's orchestre national des pays de la loire .
he spoke with dw about being an american musician in europe and the post-concert rave he 's planning . john axelrod , who was born in texas , has worked extensively in europe and with many german orchestras , including the gewandhaus orchestra in leipzig , the ndr radio philharmonie of hannover and the dresden philharmonic .
this year he begins his three-year contract as music director of the orchestre national des pays de la loire -lrb- onpl -rrb- , based in western france .
with more than 11,000 subscribers , the onpl has the largest subscription audience among french orchestras .
deutsche welle spoke with john axelrod about his new engagement and his experiences as a conductor .
deutsche welle : you 've said part of the reason you got involved with this orchestra was the surprisingly large demand for cultural activities in the region .
what else drew you to the onpl ?
john axelrod : i had not worked with this orchestra before , although i had worked with most of the other orchestras in france , and i was so surprised and impressed by the quality of the orchestra .
what was remarkable to me was their professionalism , quality and technical ability - and , most of all , their engagement !
this is not a group that after the first or second concert says , " okay , we 're done - on to the next program . "
they also have an incredible repertoire that 's not exclusive just to french composers .
they strike a great balance between the classical , romanic and contemporary repertoires .
what is your vision for the orchestra during your next three years as music director ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the orchestra in nantes , france , is one of two comprising the onpl our programming reflects this balance between classical , romantic , contemporary and popular works that the orchestra has achieved - but it does so in a way that can satisfy both the audience we currently have while increasing that audience as well , both here and internationally .
our philosophy for the orchestra is that it should be open to all and inclusive - not exclusive or elitist .
during my first season as music director , for example , our theme is based on universal brotherhood .
so , naturally , we will present beethoven 's ninth symphony - including the line " alle menschen werden brueder -lrb- all men become brothers -rrb- . "
that 's our starting point , but we 're doing it in a unique way .
i 've commissioned a work by an iraqi composer called the " seventh voyage of sinbad " that 's inspired by beethoven 's ninth with a turkish march .
and we 'll also do a world premiere of a piece by sergei prokofiev 's grandson , gabriel prokofiev .
he is a very unique composer who combines electronica with orchestral instruments and compositions .
so , his piece is essentially a variation on the themes of " an die freude " from the ninth symphony for a dj and an orchestra .
at the end of the concert , we 'll open the concert hall into a giant rave for the young people of nantes to enjoy an experience that they might not otherwise have with an orchestra .
i sense that the perception exists in europe that america is not the place to go for culture , even though there are many great orchestras there .
have you encountered this perception as an american working in europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raves and reality shows join classical music in the onpl 's programming i have been confronted with that perception quite often .
as an american conductor , usually i 'm asked to do american music .
in america , of course , orchestras are encouraged to engage european conductors because they would like to have that association with the european pedigree , while european orchestras may be open to having americans come and conduct .
but i do believe that situation has changed somewhat .
my first engagement as a conductor and not just an assistant was with the duesseldorfer symphoniker .
the dusseldorf symphony rightfully asked , " what do you , some kid from texas , know about beethoven ?
after all , schumann was one of our conductors ! "
and they were right .
but it 's also important that we recognize , as the world has now gotten smaller , that the appreciation and knowledge of this music is such that you do n't have to necessarily come from a particular country in order to be able to know , understand , interpret , and perform it .
you 've said you have a strong relationship with the duesseldorfer symphoniker as well as other orchestras you have conducted there .
are your activities with the onpl relevant for the music scene in germany ?
i think there could be a lesson for germany in the leadership france is currently showing in terms of support for music .
france is leading the way on music education and public financial support for orchestras .
within the onpl , we are also making music education our focus by encouraging families to get involved with music together .
for example , we 've put together the concept for a tv reality show in which three families from the region will take part in a musical competition where each family member will play a role in performing a composition .
i once read a statistic that shows how much the tradition of learning an instrument at home faded after world war ii in germany .
but it 's important to realize how crucial the german musical tradition is to the country 's identity .
if germany loses sight of its musical past , a very significant part of its culture will die .

street view allows users to look at photos of individual streets at ground level all over the world , with images taken from specially equipped vehicles .
the panoramic views of cities in the us , japan , australia and parts of europe are already available online .
the product is a supplement to google 's maps .
the german government complained that this software could encroach on the privacy of its citizens .
aigner argued that thieves could use the pictures of houses to gauge people 's wealth and prepare burglaries , and that people 's pictures might be published online without their consent .
aigner 's aides said the minister told google that " what is private has to stay private . "
opting out google now says it will wait until later this year to launch its german images to give people the chance to file complaints .
anyone who wishes can have the image of their house blocked out , and google has promised to obscure any faces present in the pictures .
the company has offered this same service to people around the world , but retroactively , removing the images only after publishing them .
for germany , it is agreeing to do its editing beforehand where possible .
privacy concerns are a particularly contentious issue in germany , due to the abuses by hitler 's nazi government and the communist rulers of the former east germany in the past. msh / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

street view allows users to look at photos of individual streets at ground level all over the world , with images taken from specially equipped vehicles .
the panoramic views of cities in the us , japan , australia and parts of europe are already available online .
the product is a supplement to google 's maps .
the german government complained that this software could encroach on the privacy of its citizens .
aigner argued that thieves could use the pictures of houses to gauge people 's wealth and prepare burglaries , and that people 's pictures might be published online without their consent .
aigner 's aides said the minister told google that " what is private has to stay private . "
opting out google now says it will wait until later this year to launch its german images to give people the chance to file complaints .
anyone who wishes can have the image of their house blocked out , and google has promised to obscure any faces present in the pictures .
the company has offered this same service to people around the world , but retroactively , removing the images only after publishing them .
for germany , it is agreeing to do its editing beforehand where possible .
privacy concerns are a particularly contentious issue in germany , due to the abuses by hitler 's nazi government and the communist rulers of the former east germany in the past. msh / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a prominent iranian scholar argues that islam is integral to european society . hamid dabashi is an american-iranian intellectual historian who has studied iran and shia islam from a postcolonial perspective .
he 's currently hagop kervokian professor of iranian studies at columbia university in new york . deutsche welle : in europe , many muslims live in ' parallel societies ' , in the states there 's no such problem .
why are american muslims so much better integrated ?
hamid dabashi : the arab-muslim immigration in the united states has historically been quite minimal , very , very minuscule compared to others .
the basic impetus behind immigration is economic .
capital - in my judgement - is color-blind , and gender-neutral .
you can trace the history of feminist movements around the world , for example , to the necessity of cheap labor , that 's when women entered the job market , and as workers began demanding and exacting more rights .
the same is true for immigrants : they are paid less than others .
so if you are , for example , lebanese , or sudanese , or turkish , or iranian , or pakistani , coming to the united states , entering the job market , it has absolutely nothing to do with your religion ; it is entirely irrelevant .
europe , in my judgement , has successfully posited the myth of a more homogenous cultural entity for itself .
a combination of self-secularized christianity , and - after the horrors of the holocaust - the manufacturing of a " judeo-christian " identity has given europe a renewed reliance on the myth of its origin .
and then , of course , there is the french revolution , the enlightenment , the unification of europe , and the post-soviet reconstruction of a european identity .
europe itself , in this renewed conception of itself , has enough problems now of assimilating the eastern european to the domain of its collective identity .
the idea of europe , historically , is really limited to that of the western europe . when giscard d 'estaing talks about not accepting the turks in the european union , he speaks a christian language , despite his self-secularized conception of who he is and what he stands for .
so the problem europe has with muslims coming from africa , coming from the middle east , coming from south asia is , in part , a reflection of its own inner anxieties with two sorts of europeans - eastern europeans and muslim europeans .
here is an issue that since the time of austria-hungarian imperial rivalry with the ottomans has been a very disconcerting issue for the idea of " europe , " i.e. the notion of muslim europe .
so for all of these reasons , europe has a more difficult time assimilating its muslims than the us .
so with all these integration difficulties already , is it , do you think , too much for the european mind to cope with the idea of turkey becoming part of the european union ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could benefit on several fronts by making turkey a member dabashi : well , that 's obviously something for the aging and thinning population of white europeans to decide .
because of the well being of europeans over many years , europe is an ageing society .
as a result , it needs labour - the cheaper the labor the better - that 's the logic of capital .
and yet labor comes with a baggage .
the european economy needs cheap labor , but european culture does n't like the fact that , ultimately , culture will be influenced by labor migration .
this is the dilemma that europe faces : it wants to have its cake and eat it , too .
but this is what we 're facing right now ; it 's a clash between culture and capital .
would you , then , say that " european islam , " the idea of islam becoming part of a european culture , more modern , more moderate , is also a false concept in this respect ?
dabashi : my problem with tariq ramadan -lrb- swiss muslim scholar - ed . -rrb- is that he thinks if he just writes it , it will happen .
islam , by virtue of european muslims , has to contend with other european moral , intellectual , imaginative , and political forces .
the difference between someone like me and tariq ramadan is that i do n't think of islam , i think of muslims .
muslims have precedent .
islam is an abstraction .
so whether giscard d 'estaing likes it or not , islam - by virtue of labour migration , by virtue of muslims walking in the streets of paris , and london etc . - becomes integral to the european society - it already is ; and as a result the collective disposition of the culture will change , too .
in effect , the changes are going to be made by social forces , not by muslim intellectuals . but are you confident this is going to happen ?
because if you argue this way everyone who is an islamist will inevitably deny this because he knows that if he 's willing to accept it his faith is going to be powerless one day in the foreseeable future .
if you look at europe , the power of religion , its influence on society has decreased ever since the enlightenment .
dabashi : forget about europe for now - if you go to india and go to saudi arabia and go to morocco and go to china you have four different kinds of islam .
islam is not quintessential .
it is a sacred language spoken in different dialects by people living different lives .
so by the same logic when muslims come to europe , they will redefine islam .
and there is nobody on planet earth who can tell them , what you 're doing is not islamic , you 're losing your religion .
the successive generations will redefine islam .
this is what i have against mandatory laws against veiling .
veiling will persist or else be modified by second and third generation muslims .
when they 're going to school , if they do n't want to wear it , they wo n't , if they want to wear it , they will .
if there is force at home for them to wear it , gradually , that force will be contexualized by other forces , by peer pressure , by forces of the market , by mass and globalized culture .
the thing that you do n't want is to have the state come and tell you what clothing item you can wear or can not wear .
back to the issue of turkey : what is your personal opinion , should europe ask turkey to become a member of the european union ?
dabashi : i think the membership of turkey in the european union will inevitably happen .
first , it will provide the european economy with cheap labor .
second it will expand the eu in terms of raw material available in turkey .
third , it will expand the european economic market .
fourth , it will strategically strengthen europe in terms of its inevitable rivalries with the united states in the region .
so economically , politically and militarily , it is to the benefit of europe .
and many of my progressive turkish colleagues are very happy about this move because they think that the questions of women 's rights , human rights , freedom of expression will have a catalytic effect on turkey as well .
so it seems like a happy marriage .

a prominent iranian scholar argues that islam is integral to european society . hamid dabashi is an american-iranian intellectual historian who has studied iran and shia islam from a postcolonial perspective .
he 's currently hagop kervokian professor of iranian studies at columbia university in new york . deutsche welle : in europe , many muslims live in ' parallel societies ' , in the states there 's no such problem .
why are american muslims so much better integrated ?
hamid dabashi : the arab-muslim immigration in the united states has historically been quite minimal , very , very minuscule compared to others .
the basic impetus behind immigration is economic .
capital - in my judgement - is color-blind , and gender-neutral .
you can trace the history of feminist movements around the world , for example , to the necessity of cheap labor , that 's when women entered the job market , and as workers began demanding and exacting more rights .
the same is true for immigrants : they are paid less than others .
so if you are , for example , lebanese , or sudanese , or turkish , or iranian , or pakistani , coming to the united states , entering the job market , it has absolutely nothing to do with your religion ; it is entirely irrelevant .
europe , in my judgement , has successfully posited the myth of a more homogenous cultural entity for itself .
a combination of self-secularized christianity , and - after the horrors of the holocaust - the manufacturing of a " judeo-christian " identity has given europe a renewed reliance on the myth of its origin .
and then , of course , there is the french revolution , the enlightenment , the unification of europe , and the post-soviet reconstruction of a european identity .
europe itself , in this renewed conception of itself , has enough problems now of assimilating the eastern european to the domain of its collective identity .
the idea of europe , historically , is really limited to that of the western europe . when giscard d 'estaing talks about not accepting the turks in the european union , he speaks a christian language , despite his self-secularized conception of who he is and what he stands for .
so the problem europe has with muslims coming from africa , coming from the middle east , coming from south asia is , in part , a reflection of its own inner anxieties with two sorts of europeans - eastern europeans and muslim europeans .
here is an issue that since the time of austria-hungarian imperial rivalry with the ottomans has been a very disconcerting issue for the idea of " europe , " i.e. the notion of muslim europe .
so for all of these reasons , europe has a more difficult time assimilating its muslims than the us .
so with all these integration difficulties already , is it , do you think , too much for the european mind to cope with the idea of turkey becoming part of the european union ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could benefit on several fronts by making turkey a member dabashi : well , that 's obviously something for the aging and thinning population of white europeans to decide .
because of the well being of europeans over many years , europe is an ageing society .
as a result , it needs labour - the cheaper the labor the better - that 's the logic of capital .
and yet labor comes with a baggage .
the european economy needs cheap labor , but european culture does n't like the fact that , ultimately , culture will be influenced by labor migration .
this is the dilemma that europe faces : it wants to have its cake and eat it , too .
but this is what we 're facing right now ; it 's a clash between culture and capital .
would you , then , say that " european islam , " the idea of islam becoming part of a european culture , more modern , more moderate , is also a false concept in this respect ?
dabashi : my problem with tariq ramadan -lrb- swiss muslim scholar - ed . -rrb- is that he thinks if he just writes it , it will happen .
islam , by virtue of european muslims , has to contend with other european moral , intellectual , imaginative , and political forces .
the difference between someone like me and tariq ramadan is that i do n't think of islam , i think of muslims .
muslims have precedent .
islam is an abstraction .
so whether giscard d 'estaing likes it or not , islam - by virtue of labour migration , by virtue of muslims walking in the streets of paris , and london etc . - becomes integral to the european society - it already is ; and as a result the collective disposition of the culture will change , too .
in effect , the changes are going to be made by social forces , not by muslim intellectuals . but are you confident this is going to happen ?
because if you argue this way everyone who is an islamist will inevitably deny this because he knows that if he 's willing to accept it his faith is going to be powerless one day in the foreseeable future .
if you look at europe , the power of religion , its influence on society has decreased ever since the enlightenment .
dabashi : forget about europe for now - if you go to india and go to saudi arabia and go to morocco and go to china you have four different kinds of islam .
islam is not quintessential .
it is a sacred language spoken in different dialects by people living different lives .
so by the same logic when muslims come to europe , they will redefine islam .
and there is nobody on planet earth who can tell them , what you 're doing is not islamic , you 're losing your religion .
the successive generations will redefine islam .
this is what i have against mandatory laws against veiling .
veiling will persist or else be modified by second and third generation muslims .
when they 're going to school , if they do n't want to wear it , they wo n't , if they want to wear it , they will .
if there is force at home for them to wear it , gradually , that force will be contexualized by other forces , by peer pressure , by forces of the market , by mass and globalized culture .
the thing that you do n't want is to have the state come and tell you what clothing item you can wear or can not wear .
back to the issue of turkey : what is your personal opinion , should europe ask turkey to become a member of the european union ?
dabashi : i think the membership of turkey in the european union will inevitably happen .
first , it will provide the european economy with cheap labor .
second it will expand the eu in terms of raw material available in turkey .
third , it will expand the european economic market .
fourth , it will strategically strengthen europe in terms of its inevitable rivalries with the united states in the region .
so economically , politically and militarily , it is to the benefit of europe .
and many of my progressive turkish colleagues are very happy about this move because they think that the questions of women 's rights , human rights , freedom of expression will have a catalytic effect on turkey as well .
so it seems like a happy marriage .

a prominent iranian scholar argues that islam is integral to european society . hamid dabashi is an american-iranian intellectual historian who has studied iran and shia islam from a postcolonial perspective .
he 's currently hagop kervokian professor of iranian studies at columbia university in new york . deutsche welle : in europe , many muslims live in ' parallel societies ' , in the states there 's no such problem .
why are american muslims so much better integrated ?
hamid dabashi : the arab-muslim immigration in the united states has historically been quite minimal , very , very minuscule compared to others .
the basic impetus behind immigration is economic .
capital - in my judgement - is color-blind , and gender-neutral .
you can trace the history of feminist movements around the world , for example , to the necessity of cheap labor , that 's when women entered the job market , and as workers began demanding and exacting more rights .
the same is true for immigrants : they are paid less than others .
so if you are , for example , lebanese , or sudanese , or turkish , or iranian , or pakistani , coming to the united states , entering the job market , it has absolutely nothing to do with your religion ; it is entirely irrelevant .
europe , in my judgement , has successfully posited the myth of a more homogenous cultural entity for itself .
a combination of self-secularized christianity , and - after the horrors of the holocaust - the manufacturing of a " judeo-christian " identity has given europe a renewed reliance on the myth of its origin .
and then , of course , there is the french revolution , the enlightenment , the unification of europe , and the post-soviet reconstruction of a european identity .
europe itself , in this renewed conception of itself , has enough problems now of assimilating the eastern european to the domain of its collective identity .
the idea of europe , historically , is really limited to that of the western europe . when giscard d 'estaing talks about not accepting the turks in the european union , he speaks a christian language , despite his self-secularized conception of who he is and what he stands for .
so the problem europe has with muslims coming from africa , coming from the middle east , coming from south asia is , in part , a reflection of its own inner anxieties with two sorts of europeans - eastern europeans and muslim europeans .
here is an issue that since the time of austria-hungarian imperial rivalry with the ottomans has been a very disconcerting issue for the idea of " europe , " i.e. the notion of muslim europe .
so for all of these reasons , europe has a more difficult time assimilating its muslims than the us .
so with all these integration difficulties already , is it , do you think , too much for the european mind to cope with the idea of turkey becoming part of the european union ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could benefit on several fronts by making turkey a member dabashi : well , that 's obviously something for the aging and thinning population of white europeans to decide .
because of the well being of europeans over many years , europe is an ageing society .
as a result , it needs labour - the cheaper the labor the better - that 's the logic of capital .
and yet labor comes with a baggage .
the european economy needs cheap labor , but european culture does n't like the fact that , ultimately , culture will be influenced by labor migration .
this is the dilemma that europe faces : it wants to have its cake and eat it , too .
but this is what we 're facing right now ; it 's a clash between culture and capital .
would you , then , say that " european islam , " the idea of islam becoming part of a european culture , more modern , more moderate , is also a false concept in this respect ?
dabashi : my problem with tariq ramadan -lrb- swiss muslim scholar - ed . -rrb- is that he thinks if he just writes it , it will happen .
islam , by virtue of european muslims , has to contend with other european moral , intellectual , imaginative , and political forces .
the difference between someone like me and tariq ramadan is that i do n't think of islam , i think of muslims .
muslims have precedent .
islam is an abstraction .
so whether giscard d 'estaing likes it or not , islam - by virtue of labour migration , by virtue of muslims walking in the streets of paris , and london etc . - becomes integral to the european society - it already is ; and as a result the collective disposition of the culture will change , too .
in effect , the changes are going to be made by social forces , not by muslim intellectuals . but are you confident this is going to happen ?
because if you argue this way everyone who is an islamist will inevitably deny this because he knows that if he 's willing to accept it his faith is going to be powerless one day in the foreseeable future .
if you look at europe , the power of religion , its influence on society has decreased ever since the enlightenment .
dabashi : forget about europe for now - if you go to india and go to saudi arabia and go to morocco and go to china you have four different kinds of islam .
islam is not quintessential .
it is a sacred language spoken in different dialects by people living different lives .
so by the same logic when muslims come to europe , they will redefine islam .
and there is nobody on planet earth who can tell them , what you 're doing is not islamic , you 're losing your religion .
the successive generations will redefine islam .
this is what i have against mandatory laws against veiling .
veiling will persist or else be modified by second and third generation muslims .
when they 're going to school , if they do n't want to wear it , they wo n't , if they want to wear it , they will .
if there is force at home for them to wear it , gradually , that force will be contexualized by other forces , by peer pressure , by forces of the market , by mass and globalized culture .
the thing that you do n't want is to have the state come and tell you what clothing item you can wear or can not wear .
back to the issue of turkey : what is your personal opinion , should europe ask turkey to become a member of the european union ?
dabashi : i think the membership of turkey in the european union will inevitably happen .
first , it will provide the european economy with cheap labor .
second it will expand the eu in terms of raw material available in turkey .
third , it will expand the european economic market .
fourth , it will strategically strengthen europe in terms of its inevitable rivalries with the united states in the region .
so economically , politically and militarily , it is to the benefit of europe .
and many of my progressive turkish colleagues are very happy about this move because they think that the questions of women 's rights , human rights , freedom of expression will have a catalytic effect on turkey as well .
so it seems like a happy marriage .

but some experts say it was governments who allowed rating firms to gain too much power in the first place . after stocks and the euro took a tumble this week on the announcement that credit rating agency standard and poor 's was downgrading greece 's credit rating to junk status , new calls have gone out for ratings agencies to act " responsibly " and for the creation of an independent european rating agency . but responsibility is not a word that has been associated with credit ratings agencies much in the wake of the global financial crisis , especially after it emerged that the business practices of the big three us ratings firms - standard and poor 's , moody 's and fitch - played a central role in helping bring about the economic meltdown . " we should not make the welfare of europe dependent on ratings agencies , " peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's independent economic advisory panel , told the newspaper die welt . german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who called for a european credit rating agency , said rating agencies must not develop , sell and rate financial products at the same time . " conflicts of interest are guaranteed , " he said . a matter of accuracy a top international monetary fund official questioned the agencies ' accuracy , arguing that that their assessments reflect mainly investors ' perceptions of a nation 's financial health . " that 's why you should n't believe too much in what they say , " imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle wants a european ratings agency but according to manfred jäger-ambrozewicz of the cologne institute of business research , government regulators and governments themselves , who also depend on ratings agencies analysis , have played a role in the increase of the agencies ' influence . " it 's kind of ridiculous that they 've turned on them now , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are the ones who have largely given them so much power . " he added that the creation of a new european ratings agency would be possible , but that agencies are built on their reputations , and it would take some time for a brand-new ratings entity to become credible . " but if in addition to the private rating we had something from a semi-state agency or a rating by a body like the imf or the european central bank , that could be helpful , " jäger-ambrozewicz said . later this year , new eu rules which were hammered out last year will apply some regulation on already-existing agencies that operate in europe . the rules , which go into effect in december , will oblige the agencies to disclose information about the models and methods on which their ratings are based and require adherence to new corporate governance standards meant to guard against potential conflicts of interest . risk assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standard and poor 's rating downgrade for greece sent stocks and the euro tumbling credit ratings agencies began their lives as market researchers , analyzing corporate debt for people or groups considering whether or not to purchase that debt .
potential buyers depend on ratings to determine the credit risk involved . for most of their existence , rating agencies answered a simple , but critical question : if i loan somebody money by buying one of their bonds , am i going to get that money back ? the agencies developed a grading system to indicate the sureness of the investment .

argentina , on the other hand , gets the equivalent of a b- . for investors , ratings agencies are supposed to provide independent measurements of credit risk , which in turn increases market efficiency , and adds to the supply of risk capital in the market , which can lead to stronger growth . mission creep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit rating agencies are now in the crosshairs starting in the 1970s , credit rating agencies began to get more powerful and these days , a significant bond issuance must have at least one rating from a respected ratings agency to be successful . by the early 1980s , a different kind of bond appeared on the scene : so-called structured finance instruments such as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations .
those are the now infamous complex financial creations made up of thousands of loans and mortgages bundled together and then sold as bonds .
in effect , they became almost too complex for ratings agencies to get a handle on , but they rated them anyway , usually positively . " mixing cocktails of risk , you really want to know what is the percentage of alcohol in the drinks , " said irwin collier , a professor of finance at berlin 's free university .
" financial innovation is a good thing , but what is bad is when the information gets falsified . " initial success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rating agencies trippled their revenues between 2002 and 2007 it was the rise and initial success of those complex financial instruments that led the three big rating agencies down a path of great financial gain for themselves , but disaster for economy as a whole .
they began looking for ways to give their seal of approval to bonds , even working directly with the bond issuer .
and that , critics say , drove a stake in the heart of their neutrality . ratings agencies make their money by charging fees to those they rated , creating an inherent conflict of interest . furthermore , if moody 's , for example , indicated to a bond issuer that it was not willing to give it a good rating , the issuer could simply go over to standard and poor 's or fitch , whichever would be willing to provide the aaa imprimatur . it was in the agencies ' own financial interest to work with bond issuers to find a way to give out these top ratings .
and agencies ' pursued that interest aggressively .
between 2002 and 2007 , the firms tripled their revenues . " it 's like the parties in court paying the judge 's salary , " said us senator carl levin at a hearing last week in washington that looked into whether the agencies failed to provide honest assessments of securities to investors . poor performance , poor oversight the credit agencies ' track record is not very impressive .
according to the new york times , of aaa-rated subprime-mortgage-backed securities issued in 2006 , 93 percent have been downgraded to junk status .
they failed to foresee the collapse of the us housing market . the agencies are not overseen by the us securities and exchange commission , and they have escaped any legal liability by claiming that their ratings are just opinions , protected by the american first amendment right to free speech . while the credibility of the big agencies has been hit , they are still the only game in town and have tremendous power , as the reaction to the greek debt rating and subsequent ratings about portugal and spain have shown .

street view allows users to look at photos of individual streets at ground level all over the world , with images taken from specially equipped vehicles .
the panoramic views of cities in the us , japan , australia and parts of europe are already available online .
the product is a supplement to google 's maps .
the german government complained that this software could encroach on the privacy of its citizens .
aigner argued that thieves could use the pictures of houses to gauge people 's wealth and prepare burglaries , and that people 's pictures might be published online without their consent .
aigner 's aides said the minister told google that " what is private has to stay private . "
opting out google now says it will wait until later this year to launch its german images to give people the chance to file complaints .
anyone who wishes can have the image of their house blocked out , and google has promised to obscure any faces present in the pictures .
the company has offered this same service to people around the world , but retroactively , removing the images only after publishing them .
for germany , it is agreeing to do its editing beforehand where possible .
privacy concerns are a particularly contentious issue in germany , due to the abuses by hitler 's nazi government and the communist rulers of the former east germany in the past. msh / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the time of the resistance has come , " socialist leader edi rama told the crowd gathered in front of the albanian government building in tirana . " we are determined to continue the protests and civil disobedience , to oblige the government either to be transparent in regard to the fraud-marked elections or to leave , " he said . fatmir xhasa , a socialist deputy , told the protestors that 22 lawmakers would launch a hunger strike in front of the seat of government to demand election transparency . the conservative democrats , led by prime minister sali berisha , narrowly won the general elections on june 28 but have been hounded by allegations of vote-rigging ever since .
in response , the opposition socialists have staged a boycott , effectively stalling the government for months . the socialists returned to parliament in february , but still refuse to take part in any votes .
they are calling for a recount of ballots in several voting districts , but the ruling government has rejected the demands as illegal . the political deadlock has hindered albania 's eu ambitions – the country submitted its candidacy in april last year – and its plans to become part of the visa-free schengen zone , which covers most of europe . cmk / afp / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : greek financial tragedy eurozone wants tough mechanism to defend stability of the euro french parliament approves greek aid ahead of german vote german parliament gives thumbs up to greece aid package chancellor merkel fails to win opposition support for greece bailout economy -pipe- 01.05.2010 germany 's merkel favors bank help for greek loan package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will be digging deep , but she 'd love some help chancellor angela merkel said she would welcome a contribution from germany 's private sector to the greek financial aid package , while a prominent opposition leader called the proposed move " no more than a placebo . " " i would very much welcome voluntary participation from banks , " merkel said , according to advance excerpts from an interview set to be published in the mass-circulation bild am sonntag paper on sunday , may 2 . the eurozone and imf emergency loans deal for greece is unpopular in germany , and politicians were initially reluctant to support the idea .
however , most now seem to believe that the measure is necessary to prop up the single european currency , the euro . the former leader of the opposition social democrats and current state premier of rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck , was among the first politicians to suggest that banks should contribute to the greek rescue fund - and the idea has picked up speed since then . state broadcaster ard , citing insider sources , now reports that germany 's banks will contribute around 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- to the rescue package .
germany is set to provide just over 8 billion euros in the first year , paying the largest share of any eurozone nation because germany is the bloc 's largest economy . france will be the second largest eurozone contributor to the greek package and merkel and her french counterpart , nicolas sarkozy , are ready to act quickly to unlock a massive rescue plan for greece , sarkozy 's office said saturday .
sarkozy spoke by phone with the german chancellor and both " reaffirmed their determination to act quickly to implement the support plan " once spending cuts are agreed with athens , said an elysee statement .
' just a placebo ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt-based banking community is already exposed to the greek market but bank participation in the greece rescue plan is not to everyone 's liking .
chancellor merkel 's main adversary in the bundestag and leader of the social democrats , sigmar gabriel , is not excited by the prospect of banks contributing to the loan package . gabriel said in an interview with the neue westfaelische newspaper on saturday that the proposition was just an attempt to " quell the public rage that taxpayers would have to pay for the greed of bankers and speculators for a second time . " " what 's now being considered by deutsche bank boss josef ackermann and the coalition government in berlin , namely for banks to voluntarily contribute -lsb- towards the greek rescue -rsb- , is nothing more than a placebo , " gabriel said . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann has not yet commented publicly on the issue , but a series of reports all name him as the coordinator of a bank contribution to the greek fund . ackermann held an emergency meeting with greek prime minister george papandreou and finance minister george papaconstantinou in athens in february , looking for ways to help the country , which owes money to deutsche bank . german banks have the second-largest exposure to the greek market , after their french counterparts . payback time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks are not very popular among germans right now as in much of the western world , anti-bank sentiment in germany is currently very strong .
popular perception is that the institutions single-handedly caused the recent recession , only to be bailed out by the government and taxpayers . germany was one of many countries that helped its banks stay afloat during the recent recession - with perhaps the most famous near-failed money-lender , hypo real-estate , applying for another 1.85 billion euros on friday .
hre has already received a string of loans and credit guarantees from berlin worth in excess of 100 billion euros . the fact that derivatives trading and currency speculation helped tip greek interest rates to an unmanageable level - forcing athens to apply for these emergency loans - has only strengthened public opinion that the financial sector is again at fault for greece 's problems . in principle , at least , the greek rescue package differs from much of the state financial aid offered during the financial crisis . eurozone nations intend to borrow money , and then lend that money to greece at a slightly higher rate of interest , which would still be more competitive than the rates offered directly to athens on the open market . assuming heavily indebted greece is one day in a position to repay the loans , the donors - including any banks that contribute - are set to make a slight profit . it would go against the eu 's lisbon treaty for countries to simply give money to greece , as " bailouts " are not permitted under current eurozone rules . msh / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " i would very much welcome voluntary participation from banks , " merkel said , according to advance excerpts from an interview set to be published in the mass-circulation bild am sonntag paper on sunday , may 2 . the eurozone and imf emergency loans deal for greece is unpopular in germany , and politicians were initially reluctant to support the idea .
however , most now seem to believe that the measure is necessary to prop up the single european currency , the euro . the former leader of the opposition social democrats and current state premier of rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck , was among the first politicians to suggest that banks should contribute to the greek rescue fund - and the idea has picked up speed since then . state broadcaster ard , citing insider sources , now reports that germany 's banks will contribute around 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- to the rescue package .
germany is set to provide just over 8 billion euros in the first year , paying the largest share of any eurozone nation because germany is the bloc 's largest economy . france will be the second largest eurozone contributor to the greek package and merkel and her french counterpart , nicolas sarkozy , are ready to act quickly to unlock a massive rescue plan for greece , sarkozy 's office said saturday .

chancellor merkel 's main adversary in the bundestag and leader of the social democrats , sigmar gabriel , is not excited by the prospect of banks contributing to the loan package . gabriel said in an interview with the neue westfaelische newspaper on saturday that the proposition was just an attempt to " quell the public rage that taxpayers would have to pay for the greed of bankers and speculators for a second time . " " what 's now being considered by deutsche bank boss josef ackermann and the coalition government in berlin , namely for banks to voluntarily contribute -lsb- towards the greek rescue -rsb- , is nothing more than a placebo , " gabriel said . deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann has not yet commented publicly on the issue , but a series of reports all name him as the coordinator of a bank contribution to the greek fund . ackermann held an emergency meeting with greek prime minister george papandreou and finance minister george papaconstantinou in athens in february , looking for ways to help the country , which owes money to deutsche bank . german banks have the second-largest exposure to the greek market , after their french counterparts . payback time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks are not very popular among germans right now as in much of the western world , anti-bank sentiment in germany is currently very strong .
popular perception is that the institutions single-handedly caused the recent recession , only to be bailed out by the government and taxpayers . germany was one of many countries that helped its banks stay afloat during the recent recession - with perhaps the most famous near-failed money-lender , hypo real-estate , applying for another 1.85 billion euros on friday .
hre has already received a string of loans and credit guarantees from berlin worth in excess of 100 billion euros . the fact that derivatives trading and currency speculation helped tip greek interest rates to an unmanageable level - forcing athens to apply for these emergency loans - has only strengthened public opinion that the financial sector is again at fault for greece 's problems . in principle , at least , the greek rescue package differs from much of the state financial aid offered during the financial crisis . eurozone nations intend to borrow money , and then lend that money to greece at a slightly higher rate of interest , which would still be more competitive than the rates offered directly to athens on the open market . assuming heavily indebted greece is one day in a position to repay the loans , the donors - including any banks that contribute - are set to make a slight profit . it would go against the eu 's lisbon treaty for countries to simply give money to greece , as " bailouts " are not permitted under current eurozone rules . msh / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a prominent iranian scholar argues that islam is integral to european society . hamid dabashi is an american-iranian intellectual historian who has studied iran and shia islam from a postcolonial perspective .
he 's currently hagop kervokian professor of iranian studies at columbia university in new york . deutsche welle : in europe , many muslims live in ' parallel societies ' , in the states there 's no such problem .
why are american muslims so much better integrated ?
hamid dabashi : the arab-muslim immigration in the united states has historically been quite minimal , very , very minuscule compared to others .
the basic impetus behind immigration is economic .
capital - in my judgement - is color-blind , and gender-neutral .
you can trace the history of feminist movements around the world , for example , to the necessity of cheap labor , that 's when women entered the job market , and as workers began demanding and exacting more rights .
the same is true for immigrants : they are paid less than others .
so if you are , for example , lebanese , or sudanese , or turkish , or iranian , or pakistani , coming to the united states , entering the job market , it has absolutely nothing to do with your religion ; it is entirely irrelevant .
europe , in my judgement , has successfully posited the myth of a more homogenous cultural entity for itself .
a combination of self-secularized christianity , and - after the horrors of the holocaust - the manufacturing of a " judeo-christian " identity has given europe a renewed reliance on the myth of its origin .
and then , of course , there is the french revolution , the enlightenment , the unification of europe , and the post-soviet reconstruction of a european identity .
europe itself , in this renewed conception of itself , has enough problems now of assimilating the eastern european to the domain of its collective identity .
the idea of europe , historically , is really limited to that of the western europe . when giscard d 'estaing talks about not accepting the turks in the european union , he speaks a christian language , despite his self-secularized conception of who he is and what he stands for .
so the problem europe has with muslims coming from africa , coming from the middle east , coming from south asia is , in part , a reflection of its own inner anxieties with two sorts of europeans - eastern europeans and muslim europeans .
here is an issue that since the time of austria-hungarian imperial rivalry with the ottomans has been a very disconcerting issue for the idea of " europe , " i.e. the notion of muslim europe .
so for all of these reasons , europe has a more difficult time assimilating its muslims than the us .
so with all these integration difficulties already , is it , do you think , too much for the european mind to cope with the idea of turkey becoming part of the european union ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could benefit on several fronts by making turkey a member dabashi : well , that 's obviously something for the aging and thinning population of white europeans to decide .
because of the well being of europeans over many years , europe is an ageing society .
as a result , it needs labour - the cheaper the labor the better - that 's the logic of capital .
and yet labor comes with a baggage .
the european economy needs cheap labor , but european culture does n't like the fact that , ultimately , culture will be influenced by labor migration .
this is the dilemma that europe faces : it wants to have its cake and eat it , too .
but this is what we 're facing right now ; it 's a clash between culture and capital .
would you , then , say that " european islam , " the idea of islam becoming part of a european culture , more modern , more moderate , is also a false concept in this respect ?
dabashi : my problem with tariq ramadan -lrb- swiss muslim scholar - ed . -rrb- is that he thinks if he just writes it , it will happen .
islam , by virtue of european muslims , has to contend with other european moral , intellectual , imaginative , and political forces .
the difference between someone like me and tariq ramadan is that i do n't think of islam , i think of muslims .
muslims have precedent .
islam is an abstraction .
so whether giscard d 'estaing likes it or not , islam - by virtue of labour migration , by virtue of muslims walking in the streets of paris , and london etc . - becomes integral to the european society - it already is ; and as a result the collective disposition of the culture will change , too .
in effect , the changes are going to be made by social forces , not by muslim intellectuals . but are you confident this is going to happen ?
because if you argue this way everyone who is an islamist will inevitably deny this because he knows that if he 's willing to accept it his faith is going to be powerless one day in the foreseeable future .
if you look at europe , the power of religion , its influence on society has decreased ever since the enlightenment .
dabashi : forget about europe for now - if you go to india and go to saudi arabia and go to morocco and go to china you have four different kinds of islam .
islam is not quintessential .
it is a sacred language spoken in different dialects by people living different lives .
so by the same logic when muslims come to europe , they will redefine islam .
and there is nobody on planet earth who can tell them , what you 're doing is not islamic , you 're losing your religion .
the successive generations will redefine islam .
this is what i have against mandatory laws against veiling .
veiling will persist or else be modified by second and third generation muslims .
when they 're going to school , if they do n't want to wear it , they wo n't , if they want to wear it , they will .
if there is force at home for them to wear it , gradually , that force will be contexualized by other forces , by peer pressure , by forces of the market , by mass and globalized culture .
the thing that you do n't want is to have the state come and tell you what clothing item you can wear or can not wear .
back to the issue of turkey : what is your personal opinion , should europe ask turkey to become a member of the european union ?
dabashi : i think the membership of turkey in the european union will inevitably happen .
first , it will provide the european economy with cheap labor .
second it will expand the eu in terms of raw material available in turkey .
third , it will expand the european economic market .
fourth , it will strategically strengthen europe in terms of its inevitable rivalries with the united states in the region .
so economically , politically and militarily , it is to the benefit of europe .
and many of my progressive turkish colleagues are very happy about this move because they think that the questions of women 's rights , human rights , freedom of expression will have a catalytic effect on turkey as well .
so it seems like a happy marriage .

if you look at europe , the power of religion , its influence on society has decreased ever since the enlightenment .
dabashi : forget about europe for now - if you go to india and go to saudi arabia and go to morocco and go to china you have four different kinds of islam .
islam is not quintessential .
it is a sacred language spoken in different dialects by people living different lives .
so by the same logic when muslims come to europe , they will redefine islam .
and there is nobody on planet earth who can tell them , what you 're doing is not islamic , you 're losing your religion .
the successive generations will redefine islam .
this is what i have against mandatory laws against veiling .
veiling will persist or else be modified by second and third generation muslims .
when they 're going to school , if they do n't want to wear it , they wo n't , if they want to wear it , they will .
if there is force at home for them to wear it , gradually , that force will be contexualized by other forces , by peer pressure , by forces of the market , by mass and globalized culture .
the thing that you do n't want is to have the state come and tell you what clothing item you can wear or can not wear .
back to the issue of turkey : what is your personal opinion , should europe ask turkey to become a member of the european union ?
dabashi : i think the membership of turkey in the european union will inevitably happen .
first , it will provide the european economy with cheap labor .
second it will expand the eu in terms of raw material available in turkey .
third , it will expand the european economic market .
fourth , it will strategically strengthen europe in terms of its inevitable rivalries with the united states in the region .
so economically , politically and militarily , it is to the benefit of europe .
and many of my progressive turkish colleagues are very happy about this move because they think that the questions of women 's rights , human rights , freedom of expression will have a catalytic effect on turkey as well .
so it seems like a happy marriage .

a prominent iranian scholar argues that islam is integral to european society . hamid dabashi is an american-iranian intellectual historian who has studied iran and shia islam from a postcolonial perspective .
he 's currently hagop kervokian professor of iranian studies at columbia university in new york . deutsche welle : in europe , many muslims live in ' parallel societies ' , in the states there 's no such problem .
why are american muslims so much better integrated ?
hamid dabashi : the arab-muslim immigration in the united states has historically been quite minimal , very , very minuscule compared to others .
the basic impetus behind immigration is economic .
capital - in my judgement - is color-blind , and gender-neutral .
you can trace the history of feminist movements around the world , for example , to the necessity of cheap labor , that 's when women entered the job market , and as workers began demanding and exacting more rights .
the same is true for immigrants : they are paid less than others .
so if you are , for example , lebanese , or sudanese , or turkish , or iranian , or pakistani , coming to the united states , entering the job market , it has absolutely nothing to do with your religion ; it is entirely irrelevant .
europe , in my judgement , has successfully posited the myth of a more homogenous cultural entity for itself .
a combination of self-secularized christianity , and - after the horrors of the holocaust - the manufacturing of a " judeo-christian " identity has given europe a renewed reliance on the myth of its origin .
and then , of course , there is the french revolution , the enlightenment , the unification of europe , and the post-soviet reconstruction of a european identity .
europe itself , in this renewed conception of itself , has enough problems now of assimilating the eastern european to the domain of its collective identity .
the idea of europe , historically , is really limited to that of the western europe . when giscard d 'estaing talks about not accepting the turks in the european union , he speaks a christian language , despite his self-secularized conception of who he is and what he stands for .
so the problem europe has with muslims coming from africa , coming from the middle east , coming from south asia is , in part , a reflection of its own inner anxieties with two sorts of europeans - eastern europeans and muslim europeans .
here is an issue that since the time of austria-hungarian imperial rivalry with the ottomans has been a very disconcerting issue for the idea of " europe , " i.e. the notion of muslim europe .
so for all of these reasons , europe has a more difficult time assimilating its muslims than the us .
so with all these integration difficulties already , is it , do you think , too much for the european mind to cope with the idea of turkey becoming part of the european union ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could benefit on several fronts by making turkey a member dabashi : well , that 's obviously something for the aging and thinning population of white europeans to decide .
because of the well being of europeans over many years , europe is an ageing society .
as a result , it needs labour - the cheaper the labor the better - that 's the logic of capital .
and yet labor comes with a baggage .
the european economy needs cheap labor , but european culture does n't like the fact that , ultimately , culture will be influenced by labor migration .
this is the dilemma that europe faces : it wants to have its cake and eat it , too .
but this is what we 're facing right now ; it 's a clash between culture and capital .
would you , then , say that " european islam , " the idea of islam becoming part of a european culture , more modern , more moderate , is also a false concept in this respect ?
dabashi : my problem with tariq ramadan -lrb- swiss muslim scholar - ed . -rrb- is that he thinks if he just writes it , it will happen .
islam , by virtue of european muslims , has to contend with other european moral , intellectual , imaginative , and political forces .
the difference between someone like me and tariq ramadan is that i do n't think of islam , i think of muslims .
muslims have precedent .
islam is an abstraction .
so whether giscard d 'estaing likes it or not , islam - by virtue of labour migration , by virtue of muslims walking in the streets of paris , and london etc . - becomes integral to the european society - it already is ; and as a result the collective disposition of the culture will change , too .
in effect , the changes are going to be made by social forces , not by muslim intellectuals . but are you confident this is going to happen ?
because if you argue this way everyone who is an islamist will inevitably deny this because he knows that if he 's willing to accept it his faith is going to be powerless one day in the foreseeable future .

dabashi : my problem with tariq ramadan -lrb- swiss muslim scholar - ed . -rrb- is that he thinks if he just writes it , it will happen .
islam , by virtue of european muslims , has to contend with other european moral , intellectual , imaginative , and political forces .
the difference between someone like me and tariq ramadan is that i do n't think of islam , i think of muslims .
muslims have precedent .
islam is an abstraction .
so whether giscard d 'estaing likes it or not , islam - by virtue of labour migration , by virtue of muslims walking in the streets of paris , and london etc . - becomes integral to the european society - it already is ; and as a result the collective disposition of the culture will change , too .
in effect , the changes are going to be made by social forces , not by muslim intellectuals . but are you confident this is going to happen ?
because if you argue this way everyone who is an islamist will inevitably deny this because he knows that if he 's willing to accept it his faith is going to be powerless one day in the foreseeable future .
if you look at europe , the power of religion , its influence on society has decreased ever since the enlightenment .
dabashi : forget about europe for now - if you go to india and go to saudi arabia and go to morocco and go to china you have four different kinds of islam .
islam is not quintessential .
it is a sacred language spoken in different dialects by people living different lives .
so by the same logic when muslims come to europe , they will redefine islam .
and there is nobody on planet earth who can tell them , what you 're doing is not islamic , you 're losing your religion .
the successive generations will redefine islam .
this is what i have against mandatory laws against veiling .
veiling will persist or else be modified by second and third generation muslims .
when they 're going to school , if they do n't want to wear it , they wo n't , if they want to wear it , they will .
if there is force at home for them to wear it , gradually , that force will be contexualized by other forces , by peer pressure , by forces of the market , by mass and globalized culture .
the thing that you do n't want is to have the state come and tell you what clothing item you can wear or can not wear .
back to the issue of turkey : what is your personal opinion , should europe ask turkey to become a member of the european union ?
dabashi : i think the membership of turkey in the european union will inevitably happen .
first , it will provide the european economy with cheap labor .
second it will expand the eu in terms of raw material available in turkey .
third , it will expand the european economic market .
fourth , it will strategically strengthen europe in terms of its inevitable rivalries with the united states in the region .
so economically , politically and militarily , it is to the benefit of europe .
and many of my progressive turkish colleagues are very happy about this move because they think that the questions of women 's rights , human rights , freedom of expression will have a catalytic effect on turkey as well .
so it seems like a happy marriage .

a prominent iranian scholar argues that islam is integral to european society . hamid dabashi is an american-iranian intellectual historian who has studied iran and shia islam from a postcolonial perspective .
he 's currently hagop kervokian professor of iranian studies at columbia university in new york . deutsche welle : in europe , many muslims live in ' parallel societies ' , in the states there 's no such problem .
why are american muslims so much better integrated ?
hamid dabashi : the arab-muslim immigration in the united states has historically been quite minimal , very , very minuscule compared to others .
the basic impetus behind immigration is economic .
capital - in my judgement - is color-blind , and gender-neutral .
you can trace the history of feminist movements around the world , for example , to the necessity of cheap labor , that 's when women entered the job market , and as workers began demanding and exacting more rights .
the same is true for immigrants : they are paid less than others .
so if you are , for example , lebanese , or sudanese , or turkish , or iranian , or pakistani , coming to the united states , entering the job market , it has absolutely nothing to do with your religion ; it is entirely irrelevant .
europe , in my judgement , has successfully posited the myth of a more homogenous cultural entity for itself .
a combination of self-secularized christianity , and - after the horrors of the holocaust - the manufacturing of a " judeo-christian " identity has given europe a renewed reliance on the myth of its origin .
and then , of course , there is the french revolution , the enlightenment , the unification of europe , and the post-soviet reconstruction of a european identity .
europe itself , in this renewed conception of itself , has enough problems now of assimilating the eastern european to the domain of its collective identity .
the idea of europe , historically , is really limited to that of the western europe . when giscard d 'estaing talks about not accepting the turks in the european union , he speaks a christian language , despite his self-secularized conception of who he is and what he stands for .
so the problem europe has with muslims coming from africa , coming from the middle east , coming from south asia is , in part , a reflection of its own inner anxieties with two sorts of europeans - eastern europeans and muslim europeans .
here is an issue that since the time of austria-hungarian imperial rivalry with the ottomans has been a very disconcerting issue for the idea of " europe , " i.e. the notion of muslim europe .
so for all of these reasons , europe has a more difficult time assimilating its muslims than the us .
so with all these integration difficulties already , is it , do you think , too much for the european mind to cope with the idea of turkey becoming part of the european union ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could benefit on several fronts by making turkey a member dabashi : well , that 's obviously something for the aging and thinning population of white europeans to decide .
because of the well being of europeans over many years , europe is an ageing society .
as a result , it needs labour - the cheaper the labor the better - that 's the logic of capital .
and yet labor comes with a baggage .
the european economy needs cheap labor , but european culture does n't like the fact that , ultimately , culture will be influenced by labor migration .
this is the dilemma that europe faces : it wants to have its cake and eat it , too .
but this is what we 're facing right now ; it 's a clash between culture and capital .
would you , then , say that " european islam , " the idea of islam becoming part of a european culture , more modern , more moderate , is also a false concept in this respect ?

so the problem europe has with muslims coming from africa , coming from the middle east , coming from south asia is , in part , a reflection of its own inner anxieties with two sorts of europeans - eastern europeans and muslim europeans .
here is an issue that since the time of austria-hungarian imperial rivalry with the ottomans has been a very disconcerting issue for the idea of " europe , " i.e. the notion of muslim europe .
so for all of these reasons , europe has a more difficult time assimilating its muslims than the us .
so with all these integration difficulties already , is it , do you think , too much for the european mind to cope with the idea of turkey becoming part of the european union ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could benefit on several fronts by making turkey a member dabashi : well , that 's obviously something for the aging and thinning population of white europeans to decide .
because of the well being of europeans over many years , europe is an ageing society .
as a result , it needs labour - the cheaper the labor the better - that 's the logic of capital .
and yet labor comes with a baggage .
the european economy needs cheap labor , but european culture does n't like the fact that , ultimately , culture will be influenced by labor migration .
this is the dilemma that europe faces : it wants to have its cake and eat it , too .
but this is what we 're facing right now ; it 's a clash between culture and capital .
would you , then , say that " european islam , " the idea of islam becoming part of a european culture , more modern , more moderate , is also a false concept in this respect ?
dabashi : my problem with tariq ramadan -lrb- swiss muslim scholar - ed . -rrb- is that he thinks if he just writes it , it will happen .
islam , by virtue of european muslims , has to contend with other european moral , intellectual , imaginative , and political forces .
the difference between someone like me and tariq ramadan is that i do n't think of islam , i think of muslims .
muslims have precedent .
islam is an abstraction .
so whether giscard d 'estaing likes it or not , islam - by virtue of labour migration , by virtue of muslims walking in the streets of paris , and london etc . - becomes integral to the european society - it already is ; and as a result the collective disposition of the culture will change , too .
in effect , the changes are going to be made by social forces , not by muslim intellectuals . but are you confident this is going to happen ?
because if you argue this way everyone who is an islamist will inevitably deny this because he knows that if he 's willing to accept it his faith is going to be powerless one day in the foreseeable future .
if you look at europe , the power of religion , its influence on society has decreased ever since the enlightenment .
dabashi : forget about europe for now - if you go to india and go to saudi arabia and go to morocco and go to china you have four different kinds of islam .
islam is not quintessential .
it is a sacred language spoken in different dialects by people living different lives .
so by the same logic when muslims come to europe , they will redefine islam .
and there is nobody on planet earth who can tell them , what you 're doing is not islamic , you 're losing your religion .
the successive generations will redefine islam .
this is what i have against mandatory laws against veiling .
veiling will persist or else be modified by second and third generation muslims .
when they 're going to school , if they do n't want to wear it , they wo n't , if they want to wear it , they will .
if there is force at home for them to wear it , gradually , that force will be contexualized by other forces , by peer pressure , by forces of the market , by mass and globalized culture .
the thing that you do n't want is to have the state come and tell you what clothing item you can wear or can not wear .
back to the issue of turkey : what is your personal opinion , should europe ask turkey to become a member of the european union ?
dabashi : i think the membership of turkey in the european union will inevitably happen .
first , it will provide the european economy with cheap labor .
second it will expand the eu in terms of raw material available in turkey .
third , it will expand the european economic market .
fourth , it will strategically strengthen europe in terms of its inevitable rivalries with the united states in the region .
so economically , politically and militarily , it is to the benefit of europe .
and many of my progressive turkish colleagues are very happy about this move because they think that the questions of women 's rights , human rights , freedom of expression will have a catalytic effect on turkey as well .
so it seems like a happy marriage .

" the time of the resistance has come , " socialist leader edi rama told the crowd gathered in front of the albanian government building in tirana . " we are determined to continue the protests and civil disobedience , to oblige the government either to be transparent in regard to the fraud-marked elections or to leave , " he said . fatmir xhasa , a socialist deputy , told the protestors that 22 lawmakers would launch a hunger strike in front of the seat of government to demand election transparency . the conservative democrats , led by prime minister sali berisha , narrowly won the general elections on june 28 but have been hounded by allegations of vote-rigging ever since .
in response , the opposition socialists have staged a boycott , effectively stalling the government for months . the socialists returned to parliament in february , but still refuse to take part in any votes .
they are calling for a recount of ballots in several voting districts , but the ruling government has rejected the demands as illegal . the political deadlock has hindered albania 's eu ambitions – the country submitted its candidacy in april last year – and its plans to become part of the visa-free schengen zone , which covers most of europe . cmk / afp / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some experts say it was governments who allowed rating firms to gain too much power in the first place . after stocks and the euro took a tumble this week on the announcement that credit rating agency standard and poor 's was downgrading greece 's credit rating to junk status , new calls have gone out for ratings agencies to act " responsibly " and for the creation of an independent european rating agency . but responsibility is not a word that has been associated with credit ratings agencies much in the wake of the global financial crisis , especially after it emerged that the business practices of the big three us ratings firms - standard and poor 's , moody 's and fitch - played a central role in helping bring about the economic meltdown . " we should not make the welfare of europe dependent on ratings agencies , " peter bofinger , a member of the german government 's independent economic advisory panel , told the newspaper die welt . german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who called for a european credit rating agency , said rating agencies must not develop , sell and rate financial products at the same time . " conflicts of interest are guaranteed , " he said . a matter of accuracy a top international monetary fund official questioned the agencies ' accuracy , arguing that that their assessments reflect mainly investors ' perceptions of a nation 's financial health . " that 's why you should n't believe too much in what they say , " imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle wants a european ratings agency but according to manfred jäger-ambrozewicz of the cologne institute of business research , government regulators and governments themselves , who also depend on ratings agencies analysis , have played a role in the increase of the agencies ' influence . " it 's kind of ridiculous that they 've turned on them now , " he told deutsche welle .
" they are the ones who have largely given them so much power . " he added that the creation of a new european ratings agency would be possible , but that agencies are built on their reputations , and it would take some time for a brand-new ratings entity to become credible . " but if in addition to the private rating we had something from a semi-state agency or a rating by a body like the imf or the european central bank , that could be helpful , " jäger-ambrozewicz said . later this year , new eu rules which were hammered out last year will apply some regulation on already-existing agencies that operate in europe . the rules , which go into effect in december , will oblige the agencies to disclose information about the models and methods on which their ratings are based and require adherence to new corporate governance standards meant to guard against potential conflicts of interest . risk assessment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standard and poor 's rating downgrade for greece sent stocks and the euro tumbling credit ratings agencies began their lives as market researchers , analyzing corporate debt for people or groups considering whether or not to purchase that debt .
potential buyers depend on ratings to determine the credit risk involved . for most of their existence , rating agencies answered a simple , but critical question : if i loan somebody money by buying one of their bonds , am i going to get that money back ? the agencies developed a grading system to indicate the sureness of the investment .
companies , cities and countries get rated .
standard and poor 's gives ibm its top rating , meaning there is very low risk .

however , most now seem to believe that the measure is necessary to prop up the single european currency , the euro . the former leader of the opposition social democrats and current state premier of rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck , was among the first politicians to suggest that banks should contribute to the greek rescue fund - and the idea has picked up speed since then . state broadcaster ard , citing insider sources , now reports that germany 's banks will contribute around 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- to the rescue package .
germany is set to provide just over 8 billion euros in the first year , paying the largest share of any eurozone nation because germany is the bloc 's largest economy . france will be the second largest eurozone contributor to the greek package and merkel and her french counterpart , nicolas sarkozy , are ready to act quickly to unlock a massive rescue plan for greece , sarkozy 's office said saturday .

street view allows users to look at photos of individual streets at ground level all over the world , with images taken from specially equipped vehicles .
the panoramic views of cities in the us , japan , australia and parts of europe are already available online .
the product is a supplement to google 's maps .
the german government complained that this software could encroach on the privacy of its citizens .
aigner argued that thieves could use the pictures of houses to gauge people 's wealth and prepare burglaries , and that people 's pictures might be published online without their consent .
aigner 's aides said the minister told google that " what is private has to stay private . "
opting out google now says it will wait until later this year to launch its german images to give people the chance to file complaints .
anyone who wishes can have the image of their house blocked out , and google has promised to obscure any faces present in the pictures .
the company has offered this same service to people around the world , but retroactively , removing the images only after publishing them .
for germany , it is agreeing to do its editing beforehand where possible .
privacy concerns are a particularly contentious issue in germany , due to the abuses by hitler 's nazi government and the communist rulers of the former east germany in the past. msh / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

street view allows users to look at photos of individual streets at ground level all over the world , with images taken from specially equipped vehicles .
the panoramic views of cities in the us , japan , australia and parts of europe are already available online .
the product is a supplement to google 's maps .
the german government complained that this software could encroach on the privacy of its citizens .
aigner argued that thieves could use the pictures of houses to gauge people 's wealth and prepare burglaries , and that people 's pictures might be published online without their consent .
aigner 's aides said the minister told google that " what is private has to stay private . "
opting out google now says it will wait until later this year to launch its german images to give people the chance to file complaints .
anyone who wishes can have the image of their house blocked out , and google has promised to obscure any faces present in the pictures .
the company has offered this same service to people around the world , but retroactively , removing the images only after publishing them .
for germany , it is agreeing to do its editing beforehand where possible .
privacy concerns are a particularly contentious issue in germany , due to the abuses by hitler 's nazi government and the communist rulers of the former east germany in the past. msh / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle : you 've said part of the reason you got involved with this orchestra was the surprisingly large demand for cultural activities in the region .
what else drew you to the onpl ?
john axelrod : i had not worked with this orchestra before , although i had worked with most of the other orchestras in france , and i was so surprised and impressed by the quality of the orchestra .
what was remarkable to me was their professionalism , quality and technical ability - and , most of all , their engagement !
this is not a group that after the first or second concert says , " okay , we 're done - on to the next program . "
they also have an incredible repertoire that 's not exclusive just to french composers .
they strike a great balance between the classical , romanic and contemporary repertoires .
what is your vision for the orchestra during your next three years as music director ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the orchestra in nantes , france , is one of two comprising the onpl our programming reflects this balance between classical , romantic , contemporary and popular works that the orchestra has achieved - but it does so in a way that can satisfy both the audience we currently have while increasing that audience as well , both here and internationally .
our philosophy for the orchestra is that it should be open to all and inclusive - not exclusive or elitist .
during my first season as music director , for example , our theme is based on universal brotherhood .
so , naturally , we will present beethoven 's ninth symphony - including the line " alle menschen werden brueder -lrb- all men become brothers -rrb- . "
that 's our starting point , but we 're doing it in a unique way .
i 've commissioned a work by an iraqi composer called the " seventh voyage of sinbad " that 's inspired by beethoven 's ninth with a turkish march .
and we 'll also do a world premiere of a piece by sergei prokofiev 's grandson , gabriel prokofiev .
he is a very unique composer who combines electronica with orchestral instruments and compositions .
so , his piece is essentially a variation on the themes of " an die freude " from the ninth symphony for a dj and an orchestra .
at the end of the concert , we 'll open the concert hall into a giant rave for the young people of nantes to enjoy an experience that they might not otherwise have with an orchestra .
i sense that the perception exists in europe that america is not the place to go for culture , even though there are many great orchestras there .
have you encountered this perception as an american working in europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raves and reality shows join classical music in the onpl 's programming i have been confronted with that perception quite often .
as an american conductor , usually i 'm asked to do american music .
in america , of course , orchestras are encouraged to engage european conductors because they would like to have that association with the european pedigree , while european orchestras may be open to having americans come and conduct .
but i do believe that situation has changed somewhat .
my first engagement as a conductor and not just an assistant was with the duesseldorfer symphoniker .
the dusseldorf symphony rightfully asked , " what do you , some kid from texas , know about beethoven ?
after all , schumann was one of our conductors ! "
and they were right .
but it 's also important that we recognize , as the world has now gotten smaller , that the appreciation and knowledge of this music is such that you do n't have to necessarily come from a particular country in order to be able to know , understand , interpret , and perform it .
you 've said you have a strong relationship with the duesseldorfer symphoniker as well as other orchestras you have conducted there .
are your activities with the onpl relevant for the music scene in germany ?
i think there could be a lesson for germany in the leadership france is currently showing in terms of support for music .
france is leading the way on music education and public financial support for orchestras .
within the onpl , we are also making music education our focus by encouraging families to get involved with music together .
for example , we 've put together the concept for a tv reality show in which three families from the region will take part in a musical competition where each family member will play a role in performing a composition .
i once read a statistic that shows how much the tradition of learning an instrument at home faded after world war ii in germany .
but it 's important to realize how crucial the german musical tradition is to the country 's identity .
if germany loses sight of its musical past , a very significant part of its culture will die .
