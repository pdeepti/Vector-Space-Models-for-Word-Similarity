but the government has recently decided to extend nuclear power . the figures are based on the foundation 's ' nuclear power atlas , ' which counts the number of people living within a 150-kilometer -lrb- 93-mile -rrb- radius of each of the 17 nuclear power stations in germany - putting them in immediate danger in the event of a nuclear accident .
between 5.4 million and 11.8 million people were counted within the various zones , which cover most of the western and southern regions of germany .
the city of bremen , within 150 kilometers of six nuclear powers stations , is particularly at risk .
according to a foundation statement , the numbers are considered conservative , as " in the case of a big accident a lot more people could be affected by the radioactive fallout . "
foundation board member hans guenter schumacher concluded , " it 's not just irresponsible , but inhuman that nuclear power stations continue to be operated in a country as densely populated as germany when millions of people could be endangered by an accident . "

details are to be negotiated in the coming months .
but the foundation called for the seven oldest german nuclear power stations to be closed immediately : biblis a and b in hesse , brunsbuettel in schleswig-holstein , neckarwestheim 1 und philippsburg 1 in baden-wuerttemberg , isar 1 in bavaria und unterweser in lower saxony .
the environmental group also demanded that renewable energy be given priority in the law-making process .
chancellor angela merkel has invited the chairmen of the main german energy companies , eon , rwe , enbw and vattenfall , to her office on thursday for a meeting to discuss the country 's energy policy .
the state intends to take some energy company profits and invest them in the development of solar , water and wind power. bk / afp / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the four-star general who commands the international troops in afghanistan said the taliban had used the situation in the country 's north to expand their operations and create the impression that the movement was active across the entire country .
mcchrystal criticized the german bundeswehr for patrolling mostly with heavily armored vehicles in its kunduz operations area and not on foot , noting that the insurgents ' goal was " to isolate the security forces from the populace . "
taliban trying to divide and conquer the taliban are trying " to create a situation where the security forces stay in their camps , never leave their armored vehicles and have very little contact with the population .
the security forces may be there , but they are irrelevant .
if the insurgents manage to achieve this , then they have accomplished their mission , " mcchrystal warned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcchrystal says germany needs to accept greater risks he stressed in the interview that it was hard for the afghan people to trust their government " if they do n't have the feeling they are protected and respected . "
the people , he said , do n't know how strong the insurgents really are , or how determined the international community is .
mcchrystal said that , like all the troops in afghanistan , german forces needed to live with the greater risk of this new strategy .
he said the germans may have to change the way they have dealt with the situation so far .
he added that he was planning to deploy american troops in the german sector in the near future .
he also noted that he would raise the issue at the international afghanistan conference in london at the end of january and at the munich security conference in germany in early february. gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the opposition has called for a full withdrawal by 2015 . the commander of international forces in afghanistan , us general stanley mcchrystal , said german troops needed to establish more contact with the people .
otherwise , the soldiers - though physically present - were " essentially irrelevant , " he said in an interview with the mass circulation daily bild zeitung published wednesday .
germany 's defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said mcchrystal was naming the reality soldiers faced .
" i do n't see it as criticism , but rather as a description of the reality confronting the international community , " guttenberg told reporters in berlin .
" when he speaks about risks , then that is also a reality .
our soldiers are exposed to high risks every day . "
guttenberg did not comment on whether the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , would begin more patrols on foot in the future .
his predecessor , franz josef jung , had ordered several years ago that german soldiers only be allowed to leave their camps in armored vehicles .
this had been a reaction to increased attacks on bundeswehr troops .
opposition wants full withdrawal former foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group , said ending germany 's activities in afghanistan should be tied to the reduction of the us presence there .

" we should n't lag behind , " steinmeier told the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
" the withdrawal of german soldiers should also begin in 2011 .
we have to now completely hand over the reasonably calm districts to the afghans . "
steinmeier said further steps should then be taken with other european countries .
" we have to come to an agreement with our most significant european partners to end our military commitment there between 2013 and 2015 , " he said .
this was " ambitious , but realistic . "

his predecessor , franz josef jung , had ordered several years ago that german soldiers only be allowed to leave their camps in armored vehicles .
this had been a reaction to increased attacks on bundeswehr troops .
opposition wants full withdrawal former foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group , said ending germany 's activities in afghanistan should be tied to the reduction of the us presence there .
president barack obama has said the us will begin reducing its military activities in afghanistan from 2011 .
" we should n't lag behind , " steinmeier told the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
" the withdrawal of german soldiers should also begin in 2011 .
we have to now completely hand over the reasonably calm districts to the afghans . "
steinmeier said further steps should then be taken with other european countries .
" we have to come to an agreement with our most significant european partners to end our military commitment there between 2013 and 2015 , " he said .
this was " ambitious , but realistic . "
bildunterschrift : some 40,000 more troops are due to arrive in afghanistan from the us and its nato allies in 2010 but defense minister guttenberg said he disagreed .
" i think nothing of a finish date , " guttenberg said .
this would play into the hands of those who wanted to " switch off the lights " in afghanistan again .
foreign minister guido westerwelle also rejected demands for a speedy withdrawal of german troops .
" the international community can not afford to let this country make a false step or even fall , " westerwelle said .
" whoever would hastily leave afghanistan now would leave millions of people in the lurch and send many of them to a certain death at the hands of taliban executioners . "

it 's lost its top designers and taken flack for the nazi history of the fashion show 's location .
young new designers are fashion week 's last hope . it is that time of the year again as designers from around the world are busy packing their collections and beginning their bi-annual pilgrimage to the german capital .
berlin fashion week returns for its sixth outing from january 20-23 and promises to build on past success .
a total of 30 fashion shows are planned to display the new trends for winter 2010/2011 .
in addition to trends from more established names such as boss , rene lange and strenesse blue , berlin has continued to draw in many fresh names such as the award-winning newcomers frida weyer and sam frenzel .
notable absences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfang joop has accused berlin fashion week of placing entertainment above art as for the established designers , two of germany 's oldest names are notable by their absence .
both karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop will not be there , instead preferring to showcase their work on the catwalk in paris .
joop has turned his back on the event after accusing the berlin fashion week of being too focused on glamour .
the creator of the wunderkind label claims it has become nothing more than a show for the media , filled with celebrities who are n't even interested in fashion .
" i would never put on a fashion show in the friedrichstadt palace , " said the german fashion icon , referring to the berlin event center where designer michael michalsky held a show during last summer 's fashion week .
" that 's just for entertainment value and fashion is supposed to be an art , " added joop , as reported by dpa .
the organizers of the fashion week , img fashion , disagree .
" i do n't think that it 's any different in paris , " img spokesman daniel aubke told deutsche welle .
" celebrities are also invited there and it 's no different in berlin . "
a center of creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the absence of big names such as karl lagerfeld , berlin is focusing on young designers aubke said that the lack of big names would n't reflect badly on the event .
" designers decide for a city that makes the most sense for them .
if they can reach their target audience better there than in a different city , then they will obviously show there . "
berlin , after all , has made up-and-coming designers its focus , so perhaps joop and lagerfeld do n't really fit in after all .
the german capital is often viewed as a bubbling cauldron of creativity and the show can capitalize on its home-grown talent of some 600 to 800 designers .
the city has already gained notoriety by concentrating on the work of exciting , talented and innovative young designers who continuously push the boundaries of creativity .
one of these is resident berlin designer sam frenzel , winner of the designer for tomorrow award at the show 's last outing .
this season , he 'll be displaying his first collection on the berlin catwalk .
one step at a time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show is developing step by step to perhaps one day rival fashion meccas such as paris by focusing on young newcomers , the berlin fashion week has developed a unique flavor that sets it apart from paris and milan .
but the event 's organizers say that berlin still is n't quite ready to go head-to-head with the major leaguers .
it 'll take time until berlin firmly establishes itself on the fashion map , but this process has already begun , says img fashion .
last season , the event attracted attention from around the world and drew fashion reporters from the new york times , the guardian , and vogue italy .
" we 've only been here since 2007 and it would be a bit presumptuous to say ' we want to have a comparable audience to paris , ' but we are trying to develop step by step , " said aubke .
change of venue for next year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week will bid farewell to bebelplatz for the final time this season an unforeseen step in this development was announced one day before launch amidst clouds of controversy over the show 's main venue .
bebelplatz is best known as being the site of the infamous book burnings held on may 10 , 1933 , where thousands of books were burnt by students and members of hitler 's national socialist party .
today , a glass window offering a view into a room filled with empty bookcases commemorates the event .
in an open letter addressed to berlin mayor klaus wowereit , campaigners labeled the fashion week a " trivial mass event " which has no place on bebelplatz .
in response , img fashion promised to find a different venue to showcase the year 's summer trends in july . author : andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the four-star general who commands the international troops in afghanistan said the taliban had used the situation in the country 's north to expand their operations and create the impression that the movement was active across the entire country .
mcchrystal criticized the german bundeswehr for patrolling mostly with heavily armored vehicles in its kunduz operations area and not on foot , noting that the insurgents ' goal was " to isolate the security forces from the populace . "
taliban trying to divide and conquer the taliban are trying " to create a situation where the security forces stay in their camps , never leave their armored vehicles and have very little contact with the population .
the security forces may be there , but they are irrelevant .
if the insurgents manage to achieve this , then they have accomplished their mission , " mcchrystal warned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcchrystal says germany needs to accept greater risks he stressed in the interview that it was hard for the afghan people to trust their government " if they do n't have the feeling they are protected and respected . "
the people , he said , do n't know how strong the insurgents really are , or how determined the international community is .
mcchrystal said that , like all the troops in afghanistan , german forces needed to live with the greater risk of this new strategy .
he said the germans may have to change the way they have dealt with the situation so far .
he added that he was planning to deploy american troops in the german sector in the near future .
he also noted that he would raise the issue at the international afghanistan conference in london at the end of january and at the munich security conference in germany in early february. gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us in 2008 increased security aid to $ 100 million .
much of this funding goes to the us africa command 's trans-saharan counter-terrorism partnership -lrb- tsctp -rrb- designed to train regional forces and furnish them with needed military materiel .
similarly , britain 's border agency and serious organized crime agency works with authorities in the region to fight drug traffickers .
europe facing major challenge the emergence of western and northern africa as a key hub in drugs trafficking poses despite the us sting operation a greater challenge to europe than it does to the united states , according to some experts .
" as the drugs fly from colombia , via venezuela to west africa then the expanding european-central european-asian markets , it is clear the u.s. market is no longer so relevant , " douglas farah , a washington-based expert on terrorism who focuses on the latin america-africa nexus , told deutsche welle .
critics of us and eu policy charge that the united states abetted by local regimes hungry for increased military and security assistance is likely to aggravate issues by approaching the region 's problems exclusively as a problem of global terrorism and trans-national crime rather than in terms of democratization and development .
" if you treat it from a soley security perspective , you 're producing more jihadists , " yahia h. zoubir , an expert on the sahel and professor of international relations at euromed-marseille , told deutsche welle .
that realization may be taking hold in washington as well as european capitals .
the africa command -lrb- africom -rrb- has begun focusing on relations with the tribes in a bid to minimize its overt involvement in security .
the us in late december suspended non-humanitarian aid to niger and imposed travel restrictions on government officials in response to president mamadou tandja 's refusal to relinquish his mandate . in an earlier , relatively rare emphasis on reform rather than security , the bush administration responded in 2008 to the toppling by the military of a democratically elected government in mauritania by suspending military aid to a junta that was touting the al qaeda threat as part of its raison d 'être .
weak regimes - soft targets bildunterschrift : analysts warn nonetheless that the drugs trade not only strengthens the islamists and rebels , but could turn already weak regimes into crime-driven enterprises .
" a lot of these countries have very weak governments and the potential of turning them into narco-states is very scary .
there is already a lot of drug money along the coast of west africa … lots of the fancy homes in -lrb- the senegalese capital of -rrb- dakar are now owned by drug lords , " princeton lyman , an africa expert at the new york-based council on foreign relations and former us ambassador to nigeria and south africa , told deutsche welle .
lyman cautions that heavy handed operations could push nomadic tuareg rebels demanding a greater share in revenues from the region 's resources towards closer cooperation with aqim . he says the boeing 727 incident and the arrest of the al qaeda operatives demonstrates the need to focus on preventing drugs from getting into the sahel by patrolling the region 's coast line and airports rather than increasing military presence on the ground that would further alienate local populations .
" smuggling has a long tradition and constitutes a major source of income for groups that feel marginalized by their government … .political groups with narco money make it more difficult for governments to offer an alternative .
the question is how do you separate the marginalized groups from aqim .
the way you do it is by stopping the drugs from getting in .
africom is looking at this , " lyman said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 20.01.2010 berlin takes to the catwalk without joop and lagerfeld großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fashion show is like an art exhibition , says designer joop berlin is vying for the spotlight on the international fashion stage .
it 's lost its top designers and taken flack for the nazi history of the fashion show 's location .
young new designers are fashion week 's last hope . it is that time of the year again as designers from around the world are busy packing their collections and beginning their bi-annual pilgrimage to the german capital .
berlin fashion week returns for its sixth outing from january 20-23 and promises to build on past success .
a total of 30 fashion shows are planned to display the new trends for winter 2010/2011 .
in addition to trends from more established names such as boss , rene lange and strenesse blue , berlin has continued to draw in many fresh names such as the award-winning newcomers frida weyer and sam frenzel .
notable absences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfang joop has accused berlin fashion week of placing entertainment above art as for the established designers , two of germany 's oldest names are notable by their absence .
both karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop will not be there , instead preferring to showcase their work on the catwalk in paris .
joop has turned his back on the event after accusing the berlin fashion week of being too focused on glamour .
the creator of the wunderkind label claims it has become nothing more than a show for the media , filled with celebrities who are n't even interested in fashion .
" i would never put on a fashion show in the friedrichstadt palace , " said the german fashion icon , referring to the berlin event center where designer michael michalsky held a show during last summer 's fashion week .
" that 's just for entertainment value and fashion is supposed to be an art , " added joop , as reported by dpa .
the organizers of the fashion week , img fashion , disagree .
" i do n't think that it 's any different in paris , " img spokesman daniel aubke told deutsche welle .
" celebrities are also invited there and it 's no different in berlin . "
a center of creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the absence of big names such as karl lagerfeld , berlin is focusing on young designers aubke said that the lack of big names would n't reflect badly on the event .
" designers decide for a city that makes the most sense for them .
if they can reach their target audience better there than in a different city , then they will obviously show there . "
berlin , after all , has made up-and-coming designers its focus , so perhaps joop and lagerfeld do n't really fit in after all .
the german capital is often viewed as a bubbling cauldron of creativity and the show can capitalize on its home-grown talent of some 600 to 800 designers .
the city has already gained notoriety by concentrating on the work of exciting , talented and innovative young designers who continuously push the boundaries of creativity .
one of these is resident berlin designer sam frenzel , winner of the designer for tomorrow award at the show 's last outing .
this season , he 'll be displaying his first collection on the berlin catwalk .
one step at a time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show is developing step by step to perhaps one day rival fashion meccas such as paris by focusing on young newcomers , the berlin fashion week has developed a unique flavor that sets it apart from paris and milan .
but the event 's organizers say that berlin still is n't quite ready to go head-to-head with the major leaguers .
it 'll take time until berlin firmly establishes itself on the fashion map , but this process has already begun , says img fashion .
last season , the event attracted attention from around the world and drew fashion reporters from the new york times , the guardian , and vogue italy .
" we 've only been here since 2007 and it would be a bit presumptuous to say ' we want to have a comparable audience to paris , ' but we are trying to develop step by step , " said aubke .
change of venue for next year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week will bid farewell to bebelplatz for the final time this season an unforeseen step in this development was announced one day before launch amidst clouds of controversy over the show 's main venue .
bebelplatz is best known as being the site of the infamous book burnings held on may 10 , 1933 , where thousands of books were burnt by students and members of hitler 's national socialist party .
today , a glass window offering a view into a room filled with empty bookcases commemorates the event .

the two incidents raise the specter of increased cooperation between islamic militants and drug trafficking latin american militants and , according to us law enforcement officials , al qae 'da 's evolvement into a global criminal organization .
us , european and african anti-drug and counter-terrorism officials fear that islamist cooperation with groups like the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- could significantly fill the coffers of rebels operating across a crucial swathe of land that includes algeria , morocco , mauretania , mali , chad and niger , rich in uranium as well as oil and gas .

investigators believe the plane was carrying up to 10 tons of cocaine , the largest europe-bound latin american drugs transit shipment via the sahel so far known to authorities .
vehicle tracks in the sand have led the investigators to the conclusion that traffickers unloaded the plane 's cargo at a makeshift airstrip before burning it .

venezuelan officials question the assertion .
but critics of president hugo chavez , pointing to his support of the farc , charge that widespread corruption reaching into the highest echelons of government facilitates venezuelan involvement in drugs trafficking .
" chavez may not be involved , but he certainly looks the other way .

the arrest in of the three operatives of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , the al qaeda affiliate in west africa , further heightens concern about the islamists ' links to latin american traffickers .
the three mali nationals arrived in new york on december 18 after being arrested by authorities in ghana as a result of a four-month long sting operation in which two paid dea informants posed as farc representatives .
the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .
they told the undercover dea informants , according to court documents , that they could protect major latin american shipments of cocaine in the sahel and transport the drugs by truck through the desert and finally to spain .
they said they would charge up to 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,000 -rrb- per kilogram .

" obama has not reformed the healthcare system , has not brought climate legislation through congress , the iranian leadership has not adhered to the western concept of responsibility , and in afghanistan , a military turning point is not in sight .
guantanamo has n't been closed yet as promised , either , " writes business daily handelsblatt from dusseldorf .
does that mean he is a total failure ?
far from it , says the paper , much of what the us administration has begun just can not be done in 12 months , and obama will need luck to accomplish his goals in even one legislative period .
the berliner morgenpost daily concurs that , although only 46 percent of americans are satisfied with his work , obama should n't be judged by his first 12 months in office .
" obama can still become one of the great innovators in american history , " the paper says .
" he has unequalled self-confidence , which keeps him from changing policies just because of unfavorable surveys .
he is also blessed with a pragmatism that allows him not to be led into ideological dead ends . " a year ago , says the berlin paper , observers should have been more reserved in their expectations .
" today , let them be warned against making an assumption that is just as premature : that obama has failed . " obama underestimated the economic crisis , says the frankfurter rundschau .
but " his most momentous mistake was not remaining at the helm of his most important project , healthcare reforms . " while the president is by no means an american gorbachev - respected internationally , ridiculed at home - the frankfurt daily says , there is growing doubt ahead of congressional elections later this year that obama and his democrats will continue to hold all the power .
" the second year in office will not be any easier . "
marked by modesty , impartiality and a willingness to cooperate rather than making solitary decisions , obama 's new style has been of little use so far concerning the biggest global problems , " the muenchner merkur writes . the munich daily goes on to say that it would not be fair to condemn the president - after all millions of people only too gladly let their imaginations be fired by the " black superstar . "
" policy is not made primarily by good intentions , lofty gestures and brilliant rhetoric ; policy is clearly based on power and interests .
this is a reality even an obama ca n't suspend . "
reality has set in , the westfalenpost agrees .
however , the hagen-based daily believes that the young president has matured , remarking that he rarely smiles , that his face is often serious .
" the problems are too great .
the economic crisis , a backlash on climate policies , the costly war in afghanistan and the struggle for healthcare reforms have taken their toll on obama .
but what is even worse : america is losing its influence . " obama knew from the start that america could only tackle global crises along with other nations .

" obama has not reformed the healthcare system , has not brought climate legislation through congress , the iranian leadership has not adhered to the western concept of responsibility , and in afghanistan , a military turning point is not in sight .
guantanamo has n't been closed yet as promised , either , " writes business daily handelsblatt from dusseldorf .
does that mean he is a total failure ?
far from it , says the paper , much of what the us administration has begun just can not be done in 12 months , and obama will need luck to accomplish his goals in even one legislative period .
the berliner morgenpost daily concurs that , although only 46 percent of americans are satisfied with his work , obama should n't be judged by his first 12 months in office .
" obama can still become one of the great innovators in american history , " the paper says .
" he has unequalled self-confidence , which keeps him from changing policies just because of unfavorable surveys .
he is also blessed with a pragmatism that allows him not to be led into ideological dead ends . " a year ago , says the berlin paper , observers should have been more reserved in their expectations .
" today , let them be warned against making an assumption that is just as premature : that obama has failed . " obama underestimated the economic crisis , says the frankfurter rundschau .
but " his most momentous mistake was not remaining at the helm of his most important project , healthcare reforms . " while the president is by no means an american gorbachev - respected internationally , ridiculed at home - the frankfurt daily says , there is growing doubt ahead of congressional elections later this year that obama and his democrats will continue to hold all the power .
" the second year in office will not be any easier . "
marked by modesty , impartiality and a willingness to cooperate rather than making solitary decisions , obama 's new style has been of little use so far concerning the biggest global problems , " the muenchner merkur writes . the munich daily goes on to say that it would not be fair to condemn the president - after all millions of people only too gladly let their imaginations be fired by the " black superstar . "
" policy is not made primarily by good intentions , lofty gestures and brilliant rhetoric ; policy is clearly based on power and interests .
this is a reality even an obama ca n't suspend . "
reality has set in , the westfalenpost agrees .
however , the hagen-based daily believes that the young president has matured , remarking that he rarely smiles , that his face is often serious .
" the problems are too great .
the economic crisis , a backlash on climate policies , the costly war in afghanistan and the struggle for healthcare reforms have taken their toll on obama .
but what is even worse : america is losing its influence . " obama knew from the start that america could only tackle global crises along with other nations .
" which is why we europeans , especially we germans , should be glad to have this president at our side , " says the paper. db / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so has the arrest of three al qaeda operatives in ghana , who were charged with narco-terrrorism in new york after being handed over to the us drugs enforcement agency -lrb- dea -rrb- and transported to the united states .
the two incidents raise the specter of increased cooperation between islamic militants and drug trafficking latin american militants and , according to us law enforcement officials , al qae 'da 's evolvement into a global criminal organization .
us , european and african anti-drug and counter-terrorism officials fear that islamist cooperation with groups like the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- could significantly fill the coffers of rebels operating across a crucial swathe of land that includes algeria , morocco , mauretania , mali , chad and niger , rich in uranium as well as oil and gas .

investigators believe the plane was carrying up to 10 tons of cocaine , the largest europe-bound latin american drugs transit shipment via the sahel so far known to authorities .
vehicle tracks in the sand have led the investigators to the conclusion that traffickers unloaded the plane 's cargo at a makeshift airstrip before burning it .
while they have not ruled out that the plane may have crashed , the investigators hope that three mali nationals arrested while dismantling the wreckage and transported to the mali capital of bamako may shed light on what happened to the aircraft .

venezuelan officials question the assertion .
but critics of president hugo chavez , pointing to his support of the farc , charge that widespread corruption reaching into the highest echelons of government facilitates venezuelan involvement in drugs trafficking .
" chavez may not be involved , but he certainly looks the other way .

the arrest in of the three operatives of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , the al qaeda affiliate in west africa , further heightens concern about the islamists ' links to latin american traffickers .
the three mali nationals arrived in new york on december 18 after being arrested by authorities in ghana as a result of a four-month long sting operation in which two paid dea informants posed as farc representatives .
the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .
they told the undercover dea informants , according to court documents , that they could protect major latin american shipments of cocaine in the sahel and transport the drugs by truck through the desert and finally to spain .
they said they would charge up to 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,000 -rrb- per kilogram .

the two incidents raise the specter of increased cooperation between islamic militants and drug trafficking latin american militants and , according to us law enforcement officials , al qae 'da 's evolvement into a global criminal organization .
us , european and african anti-drug and counter-terrorism officials fear that islamist cooperation with groups like the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- could significantly fill the coffers of rebels operating across a crucial swathe of land that includes algeria , morocco , mauretania , mali , chad and niger , rich in uranium as well as oil and gas .

investigators believe the plane was carrying up to 10 tons of cocaine , the largest europe-bound latin american drugs transit shipment via the sahel so far known to authorities .
vehicle tracks in the sand have led the investigators to the conclusion that traffickers unloaded the plane 's cargo at a makeshift airstrip before burning it .

venezuelan officials question the assertion .
but critics of president hugo chavez , pointing to his support of the farc , charge that widespread corruption reaching into the highest echelons of government facilitates venezuelan involvement in drugs trafficking .
" chavez may not be involved , but he certainly looks the other way .

the arrest in of the three operatives of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , the al qaeda affiliate in west africa , further heightens concern about the islamists ' links to latin american traffickers .
the three mali nationals arrived in new york on december 18 after being arrested by authorities in ghana as a result of a four-month long sting operation in which two paid dea informants posed as farc representatives .
the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .

it 's lost its top designers and taken flack for the nazi history of the fashion show 's location .
young new designers are fashion week 's last hope . it is that time of the year again as designers from around the world are busy packing their collections and beginning their bi-annual pilgrimage to the german capital .
berlin fashion week returns for its sixth outing from january 20-23 and promises to build on past success .
a total of 30 fashion shows are planned to display the new trends for winter 2010/2011 .
in addition to trends from more established names such as boss , rene lange and strenesse blue , berlin has continued to draw in many fresh names such as the award-winning newcomers frida weyer and sam frenzel .
notable absences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfang joop has accused berlin fashion week of placing entertainment above art as for the established designers , two of germany 's oldest names are notable by their absence .
both karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop will not be there , instead preferring to showcase their work on the catwalk in paris .
joop has turned his back on the event after accusing the berlin fashion week of being too focused on glamour .
the creator of the wunderkind label claims it has become nothing more than a show for the media , filled with celebrities who are n't even interested in fashion .
" i would never put on a fashion show in the friedrichstadt palace , " said the german fashion icon , referring to the berlin event center where designer michael michalsky held a show during last summer 's fashion week .
" that 's just for entertainment value and fashion is supposed to be an art , " added joop , as reported by dpa .
the organizers of the fashion week , img fashion , disagree .
" i do n't think that it 's any different in paris , " img spokesman daniel aubke told deutsche welle .
" celebrities are also invited there and it 's no different in berlin . "
a center of creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the absence of big names such as karl lagerfeld , berlin is focusing on young designers aubke said that the lack of big names would n't reflect badly on the event .
" designers decide for a city that makes the most sense for them .
if they can reach their target audience better there than in a different city , then they will obviously show there . "
berlin , after all , has made up-and-coming designers its focus , so perhaps joop and lagerfeld do n't really fit in after all .
the german capital is often viewed as a bubbling cauldron of creativity and the show can capitalize on its home-grown talent of some 600 to 800 designers .
the city has already gained notoriety by concentrating on the work of exciting , talented and innovative young designers who continuously push the boundaries of creativity .
one of these is resident berlin designer sam frenzel , winner of the designer for tomorrow award at the show 's last outing .
this season , he 'll be displaying his first collection on the berlin catwalk .
one step at a time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show is developing step by step to perhaps one day rival fashion meccas such as paris by focusing on young newcomers , the berlin fashion week has developed a unique flavor that sets it apart from paris and milan .
but the event 's organizers say that berlin still is n't quite ready to go head-to-head with the major leaguers .
it 'll take time until berlin firmly establishes itself on the fashion map , but this process has already begun , says img fashion .
last season , the event attracted attention from around the world and drew fashion reporters from the new york times , the guardian , and vogue italy .
" we 've only been here since 2007 and it would be a bit presumptuous to say ' we want to have a comparable audience to paris , ' but we are trying to develop step by step , " said aubke .
change of venue for next year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week will bid farewell to bebelplatz for the final time this season an unforeseen step in this development was announced one day before launch amidst clouds of controversy over the show 's main venue .
bebelplatz is best known as being the site of the infamous book burnings held on may 10 , 1933 , where thousands of books were burnt by students and members of hitler 's national socialist party .
today , a glass window offering a view into a room filled with empty bookcases commemorates the event .
in an open letter addressed to berlin mayor klaus wowereit , campaigners labeled the fashion week a " trivial mass event " which has no place on bebelplatz .

it 's lost its top designers and taken flack for the nazi history of the fashion show 's location .
young new designers are fashion week 's last hope . it is that time of the year again as designers from around the world are busy packing their collections and beginning their bi-annual pilgrimage to the german capital .
berlin fashion week returns for its sixth outing from january 20-23 and promises to build on past success .
a total of 30 fashion shows are planned to display the new trends for winter 2010/2011 .
in addition to trends from more established names such as boss , rene lange and strenesse blue , berlin has continued to draw in many fresh names such as the award-winning newcomers frida weyer and sam frenzel .
notable absences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfang joop has accused berlin fashion week of placing entertainment above art as for the established designers , two of germany 's oldest names are notable by their absence .
both karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop will not be there , instead preferring to showcase their work on the catwalk in paris .
joop has turned his back on the event after accusing the berlin fashion week of being too focused on glamour .
the creator of the wunderkind label claims it has become nothing more than a show for the media , filled with celebrities who are n't even interested in fashion .
" i would never put on a fashion show in the friedrichstadt palace , " said the german fashion icon , referring to the berlin event center where designer michael michalsky held a show during last summer 's fashion week .
" that 's just for entertainment value and fashion is supposed to be an art , " added joop , as reported by dpa .
the organizers of the fashion week , img fashion , disagree .
" i do n't think that it 's any different in paris , " img spokesman daniel aubke told deutsche welle .
" celebrities are also invited there and it 's no different in berlin . "
a center of creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the absence of big names such as karl lagerfeld , berlin is focusing on young designers aubke said that the lack of big names would n't reflect badly on the event .
" designers decide for a city that makes the most sense for them .
if they can reach their target audience better there than in a different city , then they will obviously show there . "
berlin , after all , has made up-and-coming designers its focus , so perhaps joop and lagerfeld do n't really fit in after all .
the german capital is often viewed as a bubbling cauldron of creativity and the show can capitalize on its home-grown talent of some 600 to 800 designers .
the city has already gained notoriety by concentrating on the work of exciting , talented and innovative young designers who continuously push the boundaries of creativity .
one of these is resident berlin designer sam frenzel , winner of the designer for tomorrow award at the show 's last outing .
this season , he 'll be displaying his first collection on the berlin catwalk .
one step at a time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show is developing step by step to perhaps one day rival fashion meccas such as paris by focusing on young newcomers , the berlin fashion week has developed a unique flavor that sets it apart from paris and milan .
but the event 's organizers say that berlin still is n't quite ready to go head-to-head with the major leaguers .
it 'll take time until berlin firmly establishes itself on the fashion map , but this process has already begun , says img fashion .
last season , the event attracted attention from around the world and drew fashion reporters from the new york times , the guardian , and vogue italy .
" we 've only been here since 2007 and it would be a bit presumptuous to say ' we want to have a comparable audience to paris , ' but we are trying to develop step by step , " said aubke .

today , a glass window offering a view into a room filled with empty bookcases commemorates the event .

between 5.4 million and 11.8 million people were counted within the various zones , which cover most of the western and southern regions of germany .
the city of bremen , within 150 kilometers of six nuclear powers stations , is particularly at risk .
according to a foundation statement , the numbers are considered conservative , as " in the case of a big accident a lot more people could be affected by the radioactive fallout . "

so has the arrest of three al qaeda operatives in ghana , who were charged with narco-terrrorism in new york after being handed over to the us drugs enforcement agency -lrb- dea -rrb- and transported to the united states .
the two incidents raise the specter of increased cooperation between islamic militants and drug trafficking latin american militants and , according to us law enforcement officials , al qae 'da 's evolvement into a global criminal organization .
us , european and african anti-drug and counter-terrorism officials fear that islamist cooperation with groups like the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- could significantly fill the coffers of rebels operating across a crucial swathe of land that includes algeria , morocco , mauretania , mali , chad and niger , rich in uranium as well as oil and gas .
enhanced cash flow could enable the rebels to further undermine already weak , authoritarian regimes that face widespread discontent , restive nomadic populations , extreme poverty and an influx of islamist thinking via satellite television and militant missionaries .
the wreckage of the boeing 727 was discovered in the mali desert in november , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of gao .
investigators believe the plane was carrying up to 10 tons of cocaine , the largest europe-bound latin american drugs transit shipment via the sahel so far known to authorities .
vehicle tracks in the sand have led the investigators to the conclusion that traffickers unloaded the plane 's cargo at a makeshift airstrip before burning it .
while they have not ruled out that the plane may have crashed , the investigators hope that three mali nationals arrested while dismantling the wreckage and transported to the mali capital of bamako may shed light on what happened to the aircraft .
venezuela turning a blind eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez has been turning a blind eye to drug-trafficking operations alexandre schmidt , spokesman for the vienna-based un office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- told journalists in november the mysterious flight had originated in venezuela , fuelling allegations that venezuela supports terrorism and drugs trafficking .
venezuelan officials question the assertion .
but critics of president hugo chavez , pointing to his support of the farc , charge that widespread corruption reaching into the highest echelons of government facilitates venezuelan involvement in drugs trafficking .
" chavez may not be involved , but he certainly looks the other way .
none of his aides have been removed from office , " ariel segal , a lima-based expert on venezuela , told deutsche welle .
the arrest in of the three operatives of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , the al qaeda affiliate in west africa , further heightens concern about the islamists ' links to latin american traffickers .
the three mali nationals arrived in new york on december 18 after being arrested by authorities in ghana as a result of a four-month long sting operation in which two paid dea informants posed as farc representatives .
the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .
they told the undercover dea informants , according to court documents , that they could protect major latin american shipments of cocaine in the sahel and transport the drugs by truck through the desert and finally to spain .
they said they would charge up to 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,000 -rrb- per kilogram .

karel de gucht hopes to gain insight into how eu aid can be most efficiently used in rebuilding the earthquake-struck nation . the european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid karel de gucht is expected in haiti on thursday morning , where he will assess the current and future allocation of relief aid coming from the european bloc .
" his visit will be an opportunity to assess the immediate life-saving humanitarian aid needs , as well as the medium and long-term requirements for reconstruction and rehabilitation of the country , " the european commission said in a statement released wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gucht said members of the european parliament did not recognize efforts in haiti by eu member states de gucht will also meet with haitian and un authorities , as well as the main aid representatives on the scene , to discuss the coordination of the overall relief effort , the commission said .
he will remain until late friday .
earlier this week , the commissioner told the european parliament in strasbourg how he assessed the situation in haiti .
" it is not only about rescuing human lives , but rescuing a country as a whole " , de gucht told the parliamentarians .
members of international organizations had also fallen victim to the catastrophe .
this made it more difficult to organize aid on the spot .
urgent medical , technical and logistic help were needed to avoid further risks such as an outbreak of cholera , he said .
overall , the commission and eu member states have pledged more than 422 million euros -lrb- $ 595 million -rrb- in immediate humanitarian relief and longer-term reconstruction aid .
eu-us coordination in the works meanwhile , the eu 's new foreign policy chief catherine ashton headed to washington on wednesday , as a strong aftershock measuring 6.1 on the richter scale rocked haiti .
ashton will meet with us secretary of state hillary clinton and then head to new york for talks with un secretary general ban ki-moon .
she had previously been sharply criticized by center-right and liberal deputies in the eu parliament for not heading straight to haiti , as clinton and some european officials had already done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton met with haiti 's president rene preval in port-au-prince on saturday " just about everybody was in haiti at the moment when these people are suffering , and europe was not present , " said joseph daul , head of the center-right group in the parliament .
" if it would have been in our hands , we would have sent someone . "
green group leader daniel cohn-bendit said the eu should not have been acting " on the sidelines . "
" if i was the high representative faced with a disaster of this scope , i 'd get on the first plane and then come back and tell the europeans what we should be doing , " cohn-bendit said .
" i think that is the basic minimum . "
but ashton defended her actions to parliamentarians .
" i had nothing to contribute on the ground other than taking up valuable space when planes were unable to land because of the state of the airfield , " she said .
" i am not a doctor , nor a fire fighter .
my place was to bring together co-ordination at eu level and with the un . "
de gucht said parliament should be more generous in recognizing the efforts put in place by the eu 's executive and its member states .
he said meps did " not pay enough tribute to all the people who have been working since day one in brussels and on the spot . "
eu foreign ministers will be meeting on brussels on monday , with haiti expected to be high on the agenda .

" i think the greeks are very much aware of how serious the situation is , and i think that they are also very much aware that they will in the end have to solve this problem themselves , " he said .
there 's been plenty of talk of sanctions or fines , but bos dismissed the idea and said that he had confidence in the greek government .
" the new government has only been in place for a few months now , so they need some time to create public support for some very tough measures to be taken , " he added .
keeping an eye on greece the tough measures proposed by greece include an overhaul of the tax system , spending cuts , a hiring freeze on civil servants and salary caps for the highly-paid .
greece has pledged to bring its 12.7 percent budget deficit down to 8.7 percent in the first year of a three-year crackdown .
the eu 's economic affairs commissioner , joaquim almunia , said the measures were adequate , for now , but the european commission will study the plan intensively over the next two weeks , before deciding whether to demand changes .
he said the commission wanted updates on how greece was progressing every three months .
and a plan is in the works to hand auditing powers to the eu 's statistics office , eurostat , which would also deploy a permanent representative to a new national statistics agency in greece. mrm / ap / dpa editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

karel de gucht hopes to gain insight into how eu aid can be most efficiently used in rebuilding the earthquake-struck nation . the european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid karel de gucht is expected in haiti on thursday morning , where he will assess the current and future allocation of relief aid coming from the european bloc .
" his visit will be an opportunity to assess the immediate life-saving humanitarian aid needs , as well as the medium and long-term requirements for reconstruction and rehabilitation of the country , " the european commission said in a statement released wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gucht said members of the european parliament did not recognize efforts in haiti by eu member states de gucht will also meet with haitian and un authorities , as well as the main aid representatives on the scene , to discuss the coordination of the overall relief effort , the commission said .
he will remain until late friday .
earlier this week , the commissioner told the european parliament in strasbourg how he assessed the situation in haiti .
" it is not only about rescuing human lives , but rescuing a country as a whole " , de gucht told the parliamentarians .
members of international organizations had also fallen victim to the catastrophe .
this made it more difficult to organize aid on the spot .
urgent medical , technical and logistic help were needed to avoid further risks such as an outbreak of cholera , he said .
overall , the commission and eu member states have pledged more than 422 million euros -lrb- $ 595 million -rrb- in immediate humanitarian relief and longer-term reconstruction aid .
eu-us coordination in the works meanwhile , the eu 's new foreign policy chief catherine ashton headed to washington on wednesday , as a strong aftershock measuring 6.1 on the richter scale rocked haiti .
ashton will meet with us secretary of state hillary clinton and then head to new york for talks with un secretary general ban ki-moon .
she had previously been sharply criticized by center-right and liberal deputies in the eu parliament for not heading straight to haiti , as clinton and some european officials had already done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton met with haiti 's president rene preval in port-au-prince on saturday " just about everybody was in haiti at the moment when these people are suffering , and europe was not present , " said joseph daul , head of the center-right group in the parliament .
" if it would have been in our hands , we would have sent someone . "
green group leader daniel cohn-bendit said the eu should not have been acting " on the sidelines . "
" if i was the high representative faced with a disaster of this scope , i 'd get on the first plane and then come back and tell the europeans what we should be doing , " cohn-bendit said .
" i think that is the basic minimum . "
but ashton defended her actions to parliamentarians .
" i had nothing to contribute on the ground other than taking up valuable space when planes were unable to land because of the state of the airfield , " she said .
" i am not a doctor , nor a fire fighter .
my place was to bring together co-ordination at eu level and with the un . "
de gucht said parliament should be more generous in recognizing the efforts put in place by the eu 's executive and its member states .
he said meps did " not pay enough tribute to all the people who have been working since day one in brussels and on the spot . "
eu foreign ministers will be meeting on brussels on monday , with haiti expected to be high on the agenda .
eu leaders will hold an additional summit on february 11 , with aid to haiti one of the discussion points. sac / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the four-star general who commands the international troops in afghanistan said the taliban had used the situation in the country 's north to expand their operations and create the impression that the movement was active across the entire country .
mcchrystal criticized the german bundeswehr for patrolling mostly with heavily armored vehicles in its kunduz operations area and not on foot , noting that the insurgents ' goal was " to isolate the security forces from the populace . "
taliban trying to divide and conquer the taliban are trying " to create a situation where the security forces stay in their camps , never leave their armored vehicles and have very little contact with the population .
the security forces may be there , but they are irrelevant .
if the insurgents manage to achieve this , then they have accomplished their mission , " mcchrystal warned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcchrystal says germany needs to accept greater risks he stressed in the interview that it was hard for the afghan people to trust their government " if they do n't have the feeling they are protected and respected . "
the people , he said , do n't know how strong the insurgents really are , or how determined the international community is .
mcchrystal said that , like all the troops in afghanistan , german forces needed to live with the greater risk of this new strategy .
he said the germans may have to change the way they have dealt with the situation so far .
he added that he was planning to deploy american troops in the german sector in the near future .
he also noted that he would raise the issue at the international afghanistan conference in london at the end of january and at the munich security conference in germany in early february. gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so has the arrest of three al qaeda operatives in ghana , who were charged with narco-terrrorism in new york after being handed over to the us drugs enforcement agency -lrb- dea -rrb- and transported to the united states .
the two incidents raise the specter of increased cooperation between islamic militants and drug trafficking latin american militants and , according to us law enforcement officials , al qae 'da 's evolvement into a global criminal organization .
us , european and african anti-drug and counter-terrorism officials fear that islamist cooperation with groups like the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- could significantly fill the coffers of rebels operating across a crucial swathe of land that includes algeria , morocco , mauretania , mali , chad and niger , rich in uranium as well as oil and gas .
enhanced cash flow could enable the rebels to further undermine already weak , authoritarian regimes that face widespread discontent , restive nomadic populations , extreme poverty and an influx of islamist thinking via satellite television and militant missionaries .
the wreckage of the boeing 727 was discovered in the mali desert in november , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of gao .
investigators believe the plane was carrying up to 10 tons of cocaine , the largest europe-bound latin american drugs transit shipment via the sahel so far known to authorities .
vehicle tracks in the sand have led the investigators to the conclusion that traffickers unloaded the plane 's cargo at a makeshift airstrip before burning it .
while they have not ruled out that the plane may have crashed , the investigators hope that three mali nationals arrested while dismantling the wreckage and transported to the mali capital of bamako may shed light on what happened to the aircraft .
venezuela turning a blind eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez has been turning a blind eye to drug-trafficking operations alexandre schmidt , spokesman for the vienna-based un office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- told journalists in november the mysterious flight had originated in venezuela , fuelling allegations that venezuela supports terrorism and drugs trafficking .
venezuelan officials question the assertion .
but critics of president hugo chavez , pointing to his support of the farc , charge that widespread corruption reaching into the highest echelons of government facilitates venezuelan involvement in drugs trafficking .
" chavez may not be involved , but he certainly looks the other way .
none of his aides have been removed from office , " ariel segal , a lima-based expert on venezuela , told deutsche welle .
the arrest in of the three operatives of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , the al qaeda affiliate in west africa , further heightens concern about the islamists ' links to latin american traffickers .
the three mali nationals arrived in new york on december 18 after being arrested by authorities in ghana as a result of a four-month long sting operation in which two paid dea informants posed as farc representatives .
the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .
they told the undercover dea informants , according to court documents , that they could protect major latin american shipments of cocaine in the sahel and transport the drugs by truck through the desert and finally to spain .
they said they would charge up to 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,000 -rrb- per kilogram .

karel de gucht hopes to gain insight into how eu aid can be most efficiently used in rebuilding the earthquake-struck nation . the european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid karel de gucht is expected in haiti on thursday morning , where he will assess the current and future allocation of relief aid coming from the european bloc .
" his visit will be an opportunity to assess the immediate life-saving humanitarian aid needs , as well as the medium and long-term requirements for reconstruction and rehabilitation of the country , " the european commission said in a statement released wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gucht said members of the european parliament did not recognize efforts in haiti by eu member states de gucht will also meet with haitian and un authorities , as well as the main aid representatives on the scene , to discuss the coordination of the overall relief effort , the commission said .
he will remain until late friday .
earlier this week , the commissioner told the european parliament in strasbourg how he assessed the situation in haiti .
" it is not only about rescuing human lives , but rescuing a country as a whole " , de gucht told the parliamentarians .
members of international organizations had also fallen victim to the catastrophe .
this made it more difficult to organize aid on the spot .
urgent medical , technical and logistic help were needed to avoid further risks such as an outbreak of cholera , he said .
overall , the commission and eu member states have pledged more than 422 million euros -lrb- $ 595 million -rrb- in immediate humanitarian relief and longer-term reconstruction aid .
eu-us coordination in the works meanwhile , the eu 's new foreign policy chief catherine ashton headed to washington on wednesday , as a strong aftershock measuring 6.1 on the richter scale rocked haiti .
ashton will meet with us secretary of state hillary clinton and then head to new york for talks with un secretary general ban ki-moon .
she had previously been sharply criticized by center-right and liberal deputies in the eu parliament for not heading straight to haiti , as clinton and some european officials had already done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton met with haiti 's president rene preval in port-au-prince on saturday " just about everybody was in haiti at the moment when these people are suffering , and europe was not present , " said joseph daul , head of the center-right group in the parliament .
" if it would have been in our hands , we would have sent someone . "
green group leader daniel cohn-bendit said the eu should not have been acting " on the sidelines . "
" if i was the high representative faced with a disaster of this scope , i 'd get on the first plane and then come back and tell the europeans what we should be doing , " cohn-bendit said .
" i think that is the basic minimum . "
but ashton defended her actions to parliamentarians .
" i had nothing to contribute on the ground other than taking up valuable space when planes were unable to land because of the state of the airfield , " she said .
" i am not a doctor , nor a fire fighter .
my place was to bring together co-ordination at eu level and with the un . "
de gucht said parliament should be more generous in recognizing the efforts put in place by the eu 's executive and its member states .
he said meps did " not pay enough tribute to all the people who have been working since day one in brussels and on the spot . "
eu foreign ministers will be meeting on brussels on monday , with haiti expected to be high on the agenda .
eu leaders will hold an additional summit on february 11 , with aid to haiti one of the discussion points. sac / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think the greeks are very much aware of how serious the situation is , and i think that they are also very much aware that they will in the end have to solve this problem themselves , " he said .
there 's been plenty of talk of sanctions or fines , but bos dismissed the idea and said that he had confidence in the greek government .
" the new government has only been in place for a few months now , so they need some time to create public support for some very tough measures to be taken , " he added .
keeping an eye on greece the tough measures proposed by greece include an overhaul of the tax system , spending cuts , a hiring freeze on civil servants and salary caps for the highly-paid .
greece has pledged to bring its 12.7 percent budget deficit down to 8.7 percent in the first year of a three-year crackdown .
the eu 's economic affairs commissioner , joaquim almunia , said the measures were adequate , for now , but the european commission will study the plan intensively over the next two weeks , before deciding whether to demand changes .
he said the commission wanted updates on how greece was progressing every three months .
and a plan is in the works to hand auditing powers to the eu 's statistics office , eurostat , which would also deploy a permanent representative to a new national statistics agency in greece. mrm / ap / dpa editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the four-star general who commands the international troops in afghanistan said the taliban had used the situation in the country 's north to expand their operations and create the impression that the movement was active across the entire country .
mcchrystal criticized the german bundeswehr for patrolling mostly with heavily armored vehicles in its kunduz operations area and not on foot , noting that the insurgents ' goal was " to isolate the security forces from the populace . "
taliban trying to divide and conquer the taliban are trying " to create a situation where the security forces stay in their camps , never leave their armored vehicles and have very little contact with the population .
the security forces may be there , but they are irrelevant .
if the insurgents manage to achieve this , then they have accomplished their mission , " mcchrystal warned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcchrystal says germany needs to accept greater risks he stressed in the interview that it was hard for the afghan people to trust their government " if they do n't have the feeling they are protected and respected . "
the people , he said , do n't know how strong the insurgents really are , or how determined the international community is .
mcchrystal said that , like all the troops in afghanistan , german forces needed to live with the greater risk of this new strategy .
he said the germans may have to change the way they have dealt with the situation so far .
he added that he was planning to deploy american troops in the german sector in the near future .
he also noted that he would raise the issue at the international afghanistan conference in london at the end of january and at the munich security conference in germany in early february. gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the government has recently decided to extend nuclear power . the figures are based on the foundation 's ' nuclear power atlas , ' which counts the number of people living within a 150-kilometer -lrb- 93-mile -rrb- radius of each of the 17 nuclear power stations in germany - putting them in immediate danger in the event of a nuclear accident .
between 5.4 million and 11.8 million people were counted within the various zones , which cover most of the western and southern regions of germany .
the city of bremen , within 150 kilometers of six nuclear powers stations , is particularly at risk .
according to a foundation statement , the numbers are considered conservative , as " in the case of a big accident a lot more people could be affected by the radioactive fallout . "
foundation board member hans guenter schumacher concluded , " it 's not just irresponsible , but inhuman that nuclear power stations continue to be operated in a country as densely populated as germany when millions of people could be endangered by an accident . "

but the foundation called for the seven oldest german nuclear power stations to be closed immediately : biblis a and b in hesse , brunsbuettel in schleswig-holstein , neckarwestheim 1 und philippsburg 1 in baden-wuerttemberg , isar 1 in bavaria und unterweser in lower saxony .
the environmental group also demanded that renewable energy be given priority in the law-making process .

the four-star general who commands the international troops in afghanistan said the taliban had used the situation in the country 's north to expand their operations and create the impression that the movement was active across the entire country .
mcchrystal criticized the german bundeswehr for patrolling mostly with heavily armored vehicles in its kunduz operations area and not on foot , noting that the insurgents ' goal was " to isolate the security forces from the populace . "
taliban trying to divide and conquer the taliban are trying " to create a situation where the security forces stay in their camps , never leave their armored vehicles and have very little contact with the population .
the security forces may be there , but they are irrelevant .
if the insurgents manage to achieve this , then they have accomplished their mission , " mcchrystal warned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcchrystal says germany needs to accept greater risks he stressed in the interview that it was hard for the afghan people to trust their government " if they do n't have the feeling they are protected and respected . "
the people , he said , do n't know how strong the insurgents really are , or how determined the international community is .
mcchrystal said that , like all the troops in afghanistan , german forces needed to live with the greater risk of this new strategy .
he said the germans may have to change the way they have dealt with the situation so far .
he added that he was planning to deploy american troops in the german sector in the near future .
he also noted that he would raise the issue at the international afghanistan conference in london at the end of january and at the munich security conference in germany in early february. gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the opposition has called for a full withdrawal by 2015 . the commander of international forces in afghanistan , us general stanley mcchrystal , said german troops needed to establish more contact with the people .
otherwise , the soldiers - though physically present - were " essentially irrelevant , " he said in an interview with the mass circulation daily bild zeitung published wednesday .
germany 's defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said mcchrystal was naming the reality soldiers faced .
" i do n't see it as criticism , but rather as a description of the reality confronting the international community , " guttenberg told reporters in berlin .
" when he speaks about risks , then that is also a reality .
our soldiers are exposed to high risks every day . "
guttenberg did not comment on whether the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , would begin more patrols on foot in the future .
his predecessor , franz josef jung , had ordered several years ago that german soldiers only be allowed to leave their camps in armored vehicles .
this had been a reaction to increased attacks on bundeswehr troops .
opposition wants full withdrawal former foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group , said ending germany 's activities in afghanistan should be tied to the reduction of the us presence there .
president barack obama has said the us will begin reducing its military activities in afghanistan from 2011 .
" we should n't lag behind , " steinmeier told the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
" the withdrawal of german soldiers should also begin in 2011 .
we have to now completely hand over the reasonably calm districts to the afghans . "
steinmeier said further steps should then be taken with other european countries .
" we have to come to an agreement with our most significant european partners to end our military commitment there between 2013 and 2015 , " he said .
this was " ambitious , but realistic . "
bildunterschrift : some 40,000 more troops are due to arrive in afghanistan from the us and its nato allies in 2010 but defense minister guttenberg said he disagreed .
" i think nothing of a finish date , " guttenberg said .
this would play into the hands of those who wanted to " switch off the lights " in afghanistan again .
foreign minister guido westerwelle also rejected demands for a speedy withdrawal of german troops .
" the international community can not afford to let this country make a false step or even fall , " westerwelle said .
" whoever would hastily leave afghanistan now would leave millions of people in the lurch and send many of them to a certain death at the hands of taliban executioners . "

an international conference in london on january 28 will deliberate the future of the international engagement .
chancellor angela merkel has said she will present to parliament in the coming week a government policy statement on germany 's plans .
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said afghan president hamid karzai will stop in berlin next week on his way to the london conference . karzai is expected to meet the german leader and parliamentarians .
justifying more troops the spd has indicated it would not block an increase in troops .
" if the government can precisely justify what additional efforts additional soldiers will bring , then it is certainly reasonable , " spd defense expert rainer arnold told the newspaper rheinische merkur .
" a couple of hundred soldiers more can hardly be called a militarization of german foreign policy . "

the opposition has called for a full withdrawal by 2015 . the commander of international forces in afghanistan , us general stanley mcchrystal , said german troops needed to establish more contact with the people .
otherwise , the soldiers - though physically present - were " essentially irrelevant , " he said in an interview with the mass circulation daily bild zeitung published wednesday .
germany 's defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said mcchrystal was naming the reality soldiers faced .
" i do n't see it as criticism , but rather as a description of the reality confronting the international community , " guttenberg told reporters in berlin .
" when he speaks about risks , then that is also a reality .
our soldiers are exposed to high risks every day . "
guttenberg did not comment on whether the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , would begin more patrols on foot in the future .
his predecessor , franz josef jung , had ordered several years ago that german soldiers only be allowed to leave their camps in armored vehicles .
this had been a reaction to increased attacks on bundeswehr troops .
opposition wants full withdrawal former foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group , said ending germany 's activities in afghanistan should be tied to the reduction of the us presence there .
president barack obama has said the us will begin reducing its military activities in afghanistan from 2011 .
" we should n't lag behind , " steinmeier told the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
" the withdrawal of german soldiers should also begin in 2011 .
we have to now completely hand over the reasonably calm districts to the afghans . "
steinmeier said further steps should then be taken with other european countries .
" we have to come to an agreement with our most significant european partners to end our military commitment there between 2013 and 2015 , " he said .
this was " ambitious , but realistic . "
bildunterschrift : some 40,000 more troops are due to arrive in afghanistan from the us and its nato allies in 2010 but defense minister guttenberg said he disagreed .
" i think nothing of a finish date , " guttenberg said .
this would play into the hands of those who wanted to " switch off the lights " in afghanistan again .
foreign minister guido westerwelle also rejected demands for a speedy withdrawal of german troops .
" the international community can not afford to let this country make a false step or even fall , " westerwelle said .
" whoever would hastily leave afghanistan now would leave millions of people in the lurch and send many of them to a certain death at the hands of taliban executioners . "

" we face important decisions in the coming weeks and our position is to openly tell the players how we plan things , " loew told the bundesliga web site .
" that is why we travelled to bremen to have a long discussion with torsten , because we owe it to him . "
thirty-three-year old frings , midfielder and captain of werder bremen , said he was disappointed by loew 's decision , but not surprised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew says he wants younger players for the 2010 world cup " i have no other choice but to accept this decision , although i am clearly of a different opinion than joachim loew , " he said at a press conference on wednesday .
" i believe that i still have the potential to deliver strong performances at the world cup , and i will continue to show this in the bundesliga . "
history of tension frings played a large role in germany 's third-place finish in the 2006 home world cup .
the last of his international games was in february 2009 against norway , which germany lost 1-0 .
frings had often speculated his previous exclusion from the german team had nothing to do with his playing abilities .
in october 2008 , he made public comments challenging loew 's respect for veteran players after he was denied a spot in two world cup qualifiers. acb / dpa / sid / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" speaking in parliament on the second day of a four day session to debate her government 's 2010 budget proposals , chancellor angela merkel said plans to ramp up the country 's new debt by 86 billion euros -lrb- $ 123 billion -rrb- were " the right thing to do . "
germany is struggling to climb out of its worst recession since world war ii and has invested enormous sums to stimulate the country 's flagging economy .
defending that strategy , merkel said " we want germany to emerge stronger from this crisis than it was when it went in . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' we did the right thing ' said chancellor merkel " we have managed to do the right thing to prevent falling into the abyss .
as much as we would wish another situation , we are equally bound to look reality in the eye , " the chancellor said .
the draft budget , proposed by finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , foresees the highest deficit in germany 's post-war history .
total expenditures for 2010 are expected to reach some 325 billion euros ; 33 billion euros more than last year .
the largest , single outlay at nearly 147 billion euros is earmarked for social services .
schaeuble warned that public spending would be cut in 2011 and said " grave decisions lie ahead . "
responding to the government 's budget and tax-cut plans , opposition social democrat parliamentary leader , frank-walter steinmeier , accused the coalition of " complete and utter failure " in its first 100 days in office and of " having its head in the clouds . "
steinmeier said the government , in an attempt to satisfy its clientele , had " gambled away public trust " with its plans to cut taxes and trim programs , while spending more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government has ' gambled away public trust , ' says steinmeier exports still germany 's economic engine explaining the necessity of lower taxes , especially for business , merkel said that germany , long the world 's top exporter before being overtaken by china in 2009 , would have to rely on its traditional industrial strengths to pull itself out of the crisis .
" germany will only be able to secure its prosperity when it remains a strong exporting country , " merkel said .
" what made us strong - the chemical and automobile industries , medical equipment , transport technology - must be continued and should never be given up , " she added .
merkel said the goal of her government was to bring the economy " intelligently out of the slump " and defended controversial tax cuts agreed on by her center-right coalition .
the chancellor said she aimed to have the economy back to its pre-crisis growth levels by 2013 .
the german economy contracted by 5 percent in 2009 .
later this month , the government is expected to officially revise its growth forecast upwards for 2010 , from 1.2 percent , to 1.5 percent .
some economists , however , are even predicting that the expansion rate could top 2 percent this year. gb / dpa / afp / ap editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" speaking in parliament on the second day of a four day session to debate her government 's 2010 budget proposals , chancellor angela merkel said plans to ramp up the country 's new debt by 86 billion euros -lrb- $ 123 billion -rrb- were " the right thing to do . "
germany is struggling to climb out of its worst recession since world war ii and has invested enormous sums to stimulate the country 's flagging economy .
defending that strategy , merkel said " we want germany to emerge stronger from this crisis than it was when it went in . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' we did the right thing ' said chancellor merkel " we have managed to do the right thing to prevent falling into the abyss .
as much as we would wish another situation , we are equally bound to look reality in the eye , " the chancellor said .
the draft budget , proposed by finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , foresees the highest deficit in germany 's post-war history .
total expenditures for 2010 are expected to reach some 325 billion euros ; 33 billion euros more than last year .
the largest , single outlay at nearly 147 billion euros is earmarked for social services .
schaeuble warned that public spending would be cut in 2011 and said " grave decisions lie ahead . "
responding to the government 's budget and tax-cut plans , opposition social democrat parliamentary leader , frank-walter steinmeier , accused the coalition of " complete and utter failure " in its first 100 days in office and of " having its head in the clouds . "
steinmeier said the government , in an attempt to satisfy its clientele , had " gambled away public trust " with its plans to cut taxes and trim programs , while spending more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government has ' gambled away public trust , ' says steinmeier exports still germany 's economic engine explaining the necessity of lower taxes , especially for business , merkel said that germany , long the world 's top exporter before being overtaken by china in 2009 , would have to rely on its traditional industrial strengths to pull itself out of the crisis .
" germany will only be able to secure its prosperity when it remains a strong exporting country , " merkel said .
" what made us strong - the chemical and automobile industries , medical equipment , transport technology - must be continued and should never be given up , " she added .
merkel said the goal of her government was to bring the economy " intelligently out of the slump " and defended controversial tax cuts agreed on by her center-right coalition .
the chancellor said she aimed to have the economy back to its pre-crisis growth levels by 2013 .
the german economy contracted by 5 percent in 2009 .
later this month , the government is expected to officially revise its growth forecast upwards for 2010 , from 1.2 percent , to 1.5 percent .
some economists , however , are even predicting that the expansion rate could top 2 percent this year. gb / dpa / afp / ap editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" obama has not reformed the healthcare system , has not brought climate legislation through congress , the iranian leadership has not adhered to the western concept of responsibility , and in afghanistan , a military turning point is not in sight .
guantanamo has n't been closed yet as promised , either , " writes business daily handelsblatt from dusseldorf .
does that mean he is a total failure ?
far from it , says the paper , much of what the us administration has begun just can not be done in 12 months , and obama will need luck to accomplish his goals in even one legislative period .
the berliner morgenpost daily concurs that , although only 46 percent of americans are satisfied with his work , obama should n't be judged by his first 12 months in office .
" obama can still become one of the great innovators in american history , " the paper says .
" he has unequalled self-confidence , which keeps him from changing policies just because of unfavorable surveys .
he is also blessed with a pragmatism that allows him not to be led into ideological dead ends . " a year ago , says the berlin paper , observers should have been more reserved in their expectations .
" today , let them be warned against making an assumption that is just as premature : that obama has failed . " obama underestimated the economic crisis , says the frankfurter rundschau .
but " his most momentous mistake was not remaining at the helm of his most important project , healthcare reforms . " while the president is by no means an american gorbachev - respected internationally , ridiculed at home - the frankfurt daily says , there is growing doubt ahead of congressional elections later this year that obama and his democrats will continue to hold all the power .
" the second year in office will not be any easier . "
marked by modesty , impartiality and a willingness to cooperate rather than making solitary decisions , obama 's new style has been of little use so far concerning the biggest global problems , " the muenchner merkur writes . the munich daily goes on to say that it would not be fair to condemn the president - after all millions of people only too gladly let their imaginations be fired by the " black superstar . "
" policy is not made primarily by good intentions , lofty gestures and brilliant rhetoric ; policy is clearly based on power and interests .
this is a reality even an obama ca n't suspend . "
reality has set in , the westfalenpost agrees .
however , the hagen-based daily believes that the young president has matured , remarking that he rarely smiles , that his face is often serious .
" the problems are too great .
the economic crisis , a backlash on climate policies , the costly war in afghanistan and the struggle for healthcare reforms have taken their toll on obama .
but what is even worse : america is losing its influence . " obama knew from the start that america could only tackle global crises along with other nations .
" which is why we europeans , especially we germans , should be glad to have this president at our side , " says the paper. db / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" obama has not reformed the healthcare system , has not brought climate legislation through congress , the iranian leadership has not adhered to the western concept of responsibility , and in afghanistan , a military turning point is not in sight .
guantanamo has n't been closed yet as promised , either , " writes business daily handelsblatt from dusseldorf .
does that mean he is a total failure ?
far from it , says the paper , much of what the us administration has begun just can not be done in 12 months , and obama will need luck to accomplish his goals in even one legislative period .
the berliner morgenpost daily concurs that , although only 46 percent of americans are satisfied with his work , obama should n't be judged by his first 12 months in office .
" obama can still become one of the great innovators in american history , " the paper says .
" he has unequalled self-confidence , which keeps him from changing policies just because of unfavorable surveys .
he is also blessed with a pragmatism that allows him not to be led into ideological dead ends . " a year ago , says the berlin paper , observers should have been more reserved in their expectations .
" today , let them be warned against making an assumption that is just as premature : that obama has failed . " obama underestimated the economic crisis , says the frankfurter rundschau .
but " his most momentous mistake was not remaining at the helm of his most important project , healthcare reforms . " while the president is by no means an american gorbachev - respected internationally , ridiculed at home - the frankfurt daily says , there is growing doubt ahead of congressional elections later this year that obama and his democrats will continue to hold all the power .
" the second year in office will not be any easier . "
marked by modesty , impartiality and a willingness to cooperate rather than making solitary decisions , obama 's new style has been of little use so far concerning the biggest global problems , " the muenchner merkur writes . the munich daily goes on to say that it would not be fair to condemn the president - after all millions of people only too gladly let their imaginations be fired by the " black superstar . "
" policy is not made primarily by good intentions , lofty gestures and brilliant rhetoric ; policy is clearly based on power and interests .
this is a reality even an obama ca n't suspend . "
reality has set in , the westfalenpost agrees .
however , the hagen-based daily believes that the young president has matured , remarking that he rarely smiles , that his face is often serious .
" the problems are too great .
the economic crisis , a backlash on climate policies , the costly war in afghanistan and the struggle for healthcare reforms have taken their toll on obama .
but what is even worse : america is losing its influence . " obama knew from the start that america could only tackle global crises along with other nations .

" obama has not reformed the healthcare system , has not brought climate legislation through congress , the iranian leadership has not adhered to the western concept of responsibility , and in afghanistan , a military turning point is not in sight .
guantanamo has n't been closed yet as promised , either , " writes business daily handelsblatt from dusseldorf .
does that mean he is a total failure ?
far from it , says the paper , much of what the us administration has begun just can not be done in 12 months , and obama will need luck to accomplish his goals in even one legislative period .
the berliner morgenpost daily concurs that , although only 46 percent of americans are satisfied with his work , obama should n't be judged by his first 12 months in office .
" obama can still become one of the great innovators in american history , " the paper says .
" he has unequalled self-confidence , which keeps him from changing policies just because of unfavorable surveys .
he is also blessed with a pragmatism that allows him not to be led into ideological dead ends . " a year ago , says the berlin paper , observers should have been more reserved in their expectations .
" today , let them be warned against making an assumption that is just as premature : that obama has failed . " obama underestimated the economic crisis , says the frankfurter rundschau .
but " his most momentous mistake was not remaining at the helm of his most important project , healthcare reforms . " while the president is by no means an american gorbachev - respected internationally , ridiculed at home - the frankfurt daily says , there is growing doubt ahead of congressional elections later this year that obama and his democrats will continue to hold all the power .
" the second year in office will not be any easier . "
marked by modesty , impartiality and a willingness to cooperate rather than making solitary decisions , obama 's new style has been of little use so far concerning the biggest global problems , " the muenchner merkur writes . the munich daily goes on to say that it would not be fair to condemn the president - after all millions of people only too gladly let their imaginations be fired by the " black superstar . "
" policy is not made primarily by good intentions , lofty gestures and brilliant rhetoric ; policy is clearly based on power and interests .
this is a reality even an obama ca n't suspend . "
reality has set in , the westfalenpost agrees .
however , the hagen-based daily believes that the young president has matured , remarking that he rarely smiles , that his face is often serious .
" the problems are too great .
the economic crisis , a backlash on climate policies , the costly war in afghanistan and the struggle for healthcare reforms have taken their toll on obama .
but what is even worse : america is losing its influence . " obama knew from the start that america could only tackle global crises along with other nations .
" which is why we europeans , especially we germans , should be glad to have this president at our side , " says the paper. db / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de strong effort , little tangible results mark the first year of the obama presidency with his slogan , ' yes we can ' barack obama not only won the presidential poll , but also the support of millions all over the world .
but one year after taking office , it 's clear that even he ca n't fulfill the high hopes .

the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .

the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .
they told the undercover dea informants , according to court documents , that they could protect major latin american shipments of cocaine in the sahel and transport the drugs by truck through the desert and finally to spain .
they said they would charge up to 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,000 -rrb- per kilogram .

vehicle tracks in the sand have led the investigators to the conclusion that traffickers unloaded the plane 's cargo at a makeshift airstrip before burning it .

so has the arrest of three al qaeda operatives in ghana , who were charged with narco-terrrorism in new york after being handed over to the us drugs enforcement agency -lrb- dea -rrb- and transported to the united states .
the two incidents raise the specter of increased cooperation between islamic militants and drug trafficking latin american militants and , according to us law enforcement officials , al qae 'da 's evolvement into a global criminal organization .
us , european and african anti-drug and counter-terrorism officials fear that islamist cooperation with groups like the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- could significantly fill the coffers of rebels operating across a crucial swathe of land that includes algeria , morocco , mauretania , mali , chad and niger , rich in uranium as well as oil and gas .
enhanced cash flow could enable the rebels to further undermine already weak , authoritarian regimes that face widespread discontent , restive nomadic populations , extreme poverty and an influx of islamist thinking via satellite television and militant missionaries .
the wreckage of the boeing 727 was discovered in the mali desert in november , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of gao .
investigators believe the plane was carrying up to 10 tons of cocaine , the largest europe-bound latin american drugs transit shipment via the sahel so far known to authorities .
vehicle tracks in the sand have led the investigators to the conclusion that traffickers unloaded the plane 's cargo at a makeshift airstrip before burning it .
while they have not ruled out that the plane may have crashed , the investigators hope that three mali nationals arrested while dismantling the wreckage and transported to the mali capital of bamako may shed light on what happened to the aircraft .
venezuela turning a blind eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez has been turning a blind eye to drug-trafficking operations alexandre schmidt , spokesman for the vienna-based un office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- told journalists in november the mysterious flight had originated in venezuela , fuelling allegations that venezuela supports terrorism and drugs trafficking .
venezuelan officials question the assertion .
but critics of president hugo chavez , pointing to his support of the farc , charge that widespread corruption reaching into the highest echelons of government facilitates venezuelan involvement in drugs trafficking .
" chavez may not be involved , but he certainly looks the other way .
none of his aides have been removed from office , " ariel segal , a lima-based expert on venezuela , told deutsche welle .
the arrest in of the three operatives of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , the al qaeda affiliate in west africa , further heightens concern about the islamists ' links to latin american traffickers .
the three mali nationals arrived in new york on december 18 after being arrested by authorities in ghana as a result of a four-month long sting operation in which two paid dea informants posed as farc representatives .
the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .
they told the undercover dea informants , according to court documents , that they could protect major latin american shipments of cocaine in the sahel and transport the drugs by truck through the desert and finally to spain .
they said they would charge up to 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,000 -rrb- per kilogram .

" we face important decisions in the coming weeks and our position is to openly tell the players how we plan things , " loew told the bundesliga web site .
" that is why we travelled to bremen to have a long discussion with torsten , because we owe it to him . "
thirty-three-year old frings , midfielder and captain of werder bremen , said he was disappointed by loew 's decision , but not surprised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew says he wants younger players for the 2010 world cup " i have no other choice but to accept this decision , although i am clearly of a different opinion than joachim loew , " he said at a press conference on wednesday .
" i believe that i still have the potential to deliver strong performances at the world cup , and i will continue to show this in the bundesliga . "
history of tension frings played a large role in germany 's third-place finish in the 2006 home world cup .
the last of his international games was in february 2009 against norway , which germany lost 1-0 .
frings had often speculated his previous exclusion from the german team had nothing to do with his playing abilities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 20.01.2010 berlin takes to the catwalk without joop and lagerfeld großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fashion show is like an art exhibition , says designer joop berlin is vying for the spotlight on the international fashion stage .
it 's lost its top designers and taken flack for the nazi history of the fashion show 's location .
young new designers are fashion week 's last hope . it is that time of the year again as designers from around the world are busy packing their collections and beginning their bi-annual pilgrimage to the german capital .
berlin fashion week returns for its sixth outing from january 20-23 and promises to build on past success .
a total of 30 fashion shows are planned to display the new trends for winter 2010/2011 .
in addition to trends from more established names such as boss , rene lange and strenesse blue , berlin has continued to draw in many fresh names such as the award-winning newcomers frida weyer and sam frenzel .
notable absences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfang joop has accused berlin fashion week of placing entertainment above art as for the established designers , two of germany 's oldest names are notable by their absence .
both karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop will not be there , instead preferring to showcase their work on the catwalk in paris .
joop has turned his back on the event after accusing the berlin fashion week of being too focused on glamour .
the creator of the wunderkind label claims it has become nothing more than a show for the media , filled with celebrities who are n't even interested in fashion .
" i would never put on a fashion show in the friedrichstadt palace , " said the german fashion icon , referring to the berlin event center where designer michael michalsky held a show during last summer 's fashion week .
" that 's just for entertainment value and fashion is supposed to be an art , " added joop , as reported by dpa .
the organizers of the fashion week , img fashion , disagree .
" i do n't think that it 's any different in paris , " img spokesman daniel aubke told deutsche welle .
" celebrities are also invited there and it 's no different in berlin . "
a center of creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the absence of big names such as karl lagerfeld , berlin is focusing on young designers aubke said that the lack of big names would n't reflect badly on the event .
" designers decide for a city that makes the most sense for them .
if they can reach their target audience better there than in a different city , then they will obviously show there . "
berlin , after all , has made up-and-coming designers its focus , so perhaps joop and lagerfeld do n't really fit in after all .
the german capital is often viewed as a bubbling cauldron of creativity and the show can capitalize on its home-grown talent of some 600 to 800 designers .
the city has already gained notoriety by concentrating on the work of exciting , talented and innovative young designers who continuously push the boundaries of creativity .
one of these is resident berlin designer sam frenzel , winner of the designer for tomorrow award at the show 's last outing .
this season , he 'll be displaying his first collection on the berlin catwalk .
one step at a time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show is developing step by step to perhaps one day rival fashion meccas such as paris by focusing on young newcomers , the berlin fashion week has developed a unique flavor that sets it apart from paris and milan .
but the event 's organizers say that berlin still is n't quite ready to go head-to-head with the major leaguers .
it 'll take time until berlin firmly establishes itself on the fashion map , but this process has already begun , says img fashion .
last season , the event attracted attention from around the world and drew fashion reporters from the new york times , the guardian , and vogue italy .
" we 've only been here since 2007 and it would be a bit presumptuous to say ' we want to have a comparable audience to paris , ' but we are trying to develop step by step , " said aubke .
change of venue for next year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week will bid farewell to bebelplatz for the final time this season an unforeseen step in this development was announced one day before launch amidst clouds of controversy over the show 's main venue .
bebelplatz is best known as being the site of the infamous book burnings held on may 10 , 1933 , where thousands of books were burnt by students and members of hitler 's national socialist party .
today , a glass window offering a view into a room filled with empty bookcases commemorates the event .
in an open letter addressed to berlin mayor klaus wowereit , campaigners labeled the fashion week a " trivial mass event " which has no place on bebelplatz .
in response , img fashion promised to find a different venue to showcase the year 's summer trends in july . author : andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's lost its top designers and taken flack for the nazi history of the fashion show 's location .
young new designers are fashion week 's last hope . it is that time of the year again as designers from around the world are busy packing their collections and beginning their bi-annual pilgrimage to the german capital .
berlin fashion week returns for its sixth outing from january 20-23 and promises to build on past success .
a total of 30 fashion shows are planned to display the new trends for winter 2010/2011 .
in addition to trends from more established names such as boss , rene lange and strenesse blue , berlin has continued to draw in many fresh names such as the award-winning newcomers frida weyer and sam frenzel .
notable absences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfang joop has accused berlin fashion week of placing entertainment above art as for the established designers , two of germany 's oldest names are notable by their absence .
both karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop will not be there , instead preferring to showcase their work on the catwalk in paris .
joop has turned his back on the event after accusing the berlin fashion week of being too focused on glamour .
the creator of the wunderkind label claims it has become nothing more than a show for the media , filled with celebrities who are n't even interested in fashion .
" i would never put on a fashion show in the friedrichstadt palace , " said the german fashion icon , referring to the berlin event center where designer michael michalsky held a show during last summer 's fashion week .
" that 's just for entertainment value and fashion is supposed to be an art , " added joop , as reported by dpa .
the organizers of the fashion week , img fashion , disagree .
" i do n't think that it 's any different in paris , " img spokesman daniel aubke told deutsche welle .
" celebrities are also invited there and it 's no different in berlin . "
a center of creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the absence of big names such as karl lagerfeld , berlin is focusing on young designers aubke said that the lack of big names would n't reflect badly on the event .
" designers decide for a city that makes the most sense for them .
if they can reach their target audience better there than in a different city , then they will obviously show there . "
berlin , after all , has made up-and-coming designers its focus , so perhaps joop and lagerfeld do n't really fit in after all .
the german capital is often viewed as a bubbling cauldron of creativity and the show can capitalize on its home-grown talent of some 600 to 800 designers .
the city has already gained notoriety by concentrating on the work of exciting , talented and innovative young designers who continuously push the boundaries of creativity .
one of these is resident berlin designer sam frenzel , winner of the designer for tomorrow award at the show 's last outing .
this season , he 'll be displaying his first collection on the berlin catwalk .
one step at a time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show is developing step by step to perhaps one day rival fashion meccas such as paris by focusing on young newcomers , the berlin fashion week has developed a unique flavor that sets it apart from paris and milan .

it 'll take time until berlin firmly establishes itself on the fashion map , but this process has already begun , says img fashion .

aqim can " build on the gspc 's networks in the sahara desert , where it had long been engaged in smuggling a mix of drugs , weapons , and illegal immigrants , along with jihadi hit-and-run attacks against local security forces , " filiu said in a study just published by the carnegie endowment for peace . other experts note that many aqim recruits are criminals and fellow travelers , who operate like a gang .

lyman cautions that heavy handed operations could push nomadic tuareg rebels demanding a greater share in revenues from the region 's resources towards closer cooperation with aqim . he says the boeing 727 incident and the arrest of the al qaeda operatives demonstrates the need to focus on preventing drugs from getting into the sahel by patrolling the region 's coast line and airports rather than increasing military presence on the ground that would further alienate local populations .
" smuggling has a long tradition and constitutes a major source of income for groups that feel marginalized by their government … .political groups with narco money make it more difficult for governments to offer an alternative .
the question is how do you separate the marginalized groups from aqim .
the way you do it is by stopping the drugs from getting in .
africom is looking at this , " lyman said .

" smuggling has a long tradition and constitutes a major source of income for groups that feel marginalized by their government … .political groups with narco money make it more difficult for governments to offer an alternative .
the question is how do you separate the marginalized groups from aqim .
the way you do it is by stopping the drugs from getting in .
africom is looking at this , " lyman said .

so has the arrest of three al qaeda operatives in ghana , who were charged with narco-terrrorism in new york after being handed over to the us drugs enforcement agency -lrb- dea -rrb- and transported to the united states .
the two incidents raise the specter of increased cooperation between islamic militants and drug trafficking latin american militants and , according to us law enforcement officials , al qae 'da 's evolvement into a global criminal organization .
us , european and african anti-drug and counter-terrorism officials fear that islamist cooperation with groups like the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- could significantly fill the coffers of rebels operating across a crucial swathe of land that includes algeria , morocco , mauretania , mali , chad and niger , rich in uranium as well as oil and gas .
enhanced cash flow could enable the rebels to further undermine already weak , authoritarian regimes that face widespread discontent , restive nomadic populations , extreme poverty and an influx of islamist thinking via satellite television and militant missionaries .
the wreckage of the boeing 727 was discovered in the mali desert in november , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of gao .
investigators believe the plane was carrying up to 10 tons of cocaine , the largest europe-bound latin american drugs transit shipment via the sahel so far known to authorities .
vehicle tracks in the sand have led the investigators to the conclusion that traffickers unloaded the plane 's cargo at a makeshift airstrip before burning it .
while they have not ruled out that the plane may have crashed , the investigators hope that three mali nationals arrested while dismantling the wreckage and transported to the mali capital of bamako may shed light on what happened to the aircraft .

venezuelan officials question the assertion .
but critics of president hugo chavez , pointing to his support of the farc , charge that widespread corruption reaching into the highest echelons of government facilitates venezuelan involvement in drugs trafficking .
" chavez may not be involved , but he certainly looks the other way .
none of his aides have been removed from office , " ariel segal , a lima-based expert on venezuela , told deutsche welle .
the arrest in of the three operatives of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , the al qaeda affiliate in west africa , further heightens concern about the islamists ' links to latin american traffickers .
the three mali nationals arrived in new york on december 18 after being arrested by authorities in ghana as a result of a four-month long sting operation in which two paid dea informants posed as farc representatives .
the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .
they told the undercover dea informants , according to court documents , that they could protect major latin american shipments of cocaine in the sahel and transport the drugs by truck through the desert and finally to spain .
they said they would charge up to 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,000 -rrb- per kilogram .

the two incidents raise the specter of increased cooperation between islamic militants and drug trafficking latin american militants and , according to us law enforcement officials , al qae 'da 's evolvement into a global criminal organization .
us , european and african anti-drug and counter-terrorism officials fear that islamist cooperation with groups like the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- could significantly fill the coffers of rebels operating across a crucial swathe of land that includes algeria , morocco , mauretania , mali , chad and niger , rich in uranium as well as oil and gas .

investigators believe the plane was carrying up to 10 tons of cocaine , the largest europe-bound latin american drugs transit shipment via the sahel so far known to authorities .
vehicle tracks in the sand have led the investigators to the conclusion that traffickers unloaded the plane 's cargo at a makeshift airstrip before burning it .

venezuelan officials question the assertion .
but critics of president hugo chavez , pointing to his support of the farc , charge that widespread corruption reaching into the highest echelons of government facilitates venezuelan involvement in drugs trafficking .
" chavez may not be involved , but he certainly looks the other way .

the arrest in of the three operatives of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , the al qaeda affiliate in west africa , further heightens concern about the islamists ' links to latin american traffickers .
the three mali nationals arrived in new york on december 18 after being arrested by authorities in ghana as a result of a four-month long sting operation in which two paid dea informants posed as farc representatives .
the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .
they told the undercover dea informants , according to court documents , that they could protect major latin american shipments of cocaine in the sahel and transport the drugs by truck through the desert and finally to spain .
they said they would charge up to 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,000 -rrb- per kilogram .

the draft proposals will be debated in 17 separate sessions for each portfolio lasting until the end of the week .
in four hours of debate on wednesday , chancellor merkel will speak , along with all the parliamentary group leaders , the foreign minister , defense minister and finance minister .
the opposition generally uses this opportunity for a high-profile critique of the government in power .
the free democrats are pushing for more tax cuts and an overall simplification of germany 's complex tax code .
but the christian democrats are not sure what they can deliver amid low revenues and exploding expenditures .
the draft budget , outlined by finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , predicts the highest budget deficit in germany 's postwar history totalling nearly 86 billion euros -lrb- $ 123 billion -rrb- .
in addition , another 14.5 billion euros in fresh loans will be borrowed for a so-called shadow budget that is separate from the official federal budget . schaeuble called the borrowing " bitter but necessary . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has warned of tough times ahead the new level of debt reflected the global economic crisis , schaeuble said .
" we must proceed without being able to see very far ahead .
we are in the midst of a grave and unprecedented financial situation , " he added .
total expenditures this year are expected to reach approximately 325 billion euros , 33 billion euros more than last year .
the largest , single expenditure at nearly 147 billion euros is earmarked for social services .
with tax revenues sinking due to the sluggish economy , that would require the government to take out up to 100 billion euros in loans .
on a happier note , however , the institute for the wrold economy in kiel -lrb- ifw -rrb- has forecast that net new debt will not exceed 80 billion euros .
however , schaeuble warned that public expenditure would be cut in 2011 , and said " grave decisions lie ahead . " although the economy is expected to see growth of 1.5 percent , the government estimates that 3.7 million people will be unemployed this year .

the four-star general who commands the international troops in afghanistan said the taliban had used the situation in the country 's north to expand their operations and create the impression that the movement was active across the entire country .
mcchrystal criticized the german bundeswehr for patrolling mostly with heavily armored vehicles in its kunduz operations area and not on foot , noting that the insurgents ' goal was " to isolate the security forces from the populace . "
taliban trying to divide and conquer the taliban are trying " to create a situation where the security forces stay in their camps , never leave their armored vehicles and have very little contact with the population .

mcchrystal said that , like all the troops in afghanistan , german forces needed to live with the greater risk of this new strategy .

the draft proposals will be debated in 17 separate sessions for each portfolio lasting until the end of the week .
in four hours of debate on wednesday , chancellor merkel will speak , along with all the parliamentary group leaders , the foreign minister , defense minister and finance minister .
the opposition generally uses this opportunity for a high-profile critique of the government in power .
the free democrats are pushing for more tax cuts and an overall simplification of germany 's complex tax code .
but the christian democrats are not sure what they can deliver amid low revenues and exploding expenditures .
the draft budget , outlined by finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , predicts the highest budget deficit in germany 's postwar history totalling nearly 86 billion euros -lrb- $ 123 billion -rrb- .
in addition , another 14.5 billion euros in fresh loans will be borrowed for a so-called shadow budget that is separate from the official federal budget . schaeuble called the borrowing " bitter but necessary . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has warned of tough times ahead the new level of debt reflected the global economic crisis , schaeuble said .
" we must proceed without being able to see very far ahead .
we are in the midst of a grave and unprecedented financial situation , " he added .
total expenditures this year are expected to reach approximately 325 billion euros , 33 billion euros more than last year .
the largest , single expenditure at nearly 147 billion euros is earmarked for social services .
with tax revenues sinking due to the sluggish economy , that would require the government to take out up to 100 billion euros in loans .
on a happier note , however , the institute for the wrold economy in kiel -lrb- ifw -rrb- has forecast that net new debt will not exceed 80 billion euros .
however , schaeuble warned that public expenditure would be cut in 2011 , and said " grave decisions lie ahead . " although the economy is expected to see growth of 1.5 percent , the government estimates that 3.7 million people will be unemployed this year .
the 2010 budget should be ready in march. gb / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's lost its top designers and taken flack for the nazi history of the fashion show 's location .
young new designers are fashion week 's last hope . it is that time of the year again as designers from around the world are busy packing their collections and beginning their bi-annual pilgrimage to the german capital .
berlin fashion week returns for its sixth outing from january 20-23 and promises to build on past success .
a total of 30 fashion shows are planned to display the new trends for winter 2010/2011 .
in addition to trends from more established names such as boss , rene lange and strenesse blue , berlin has continued to draw in many fresh names such as the award-winning newcomers frida weyer and sam frenzel .
notable absences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfang joop has accused berlin fashion week of placing entertainment above art as for the established designers , two of germany 's oldest names are notable by their absence .
both karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop will not be there , instead preferring to showcase their work on the catwalk in paris .
joop has turned his back on the event after accusing the berlin fashion week of being too focused on glamour .
the creator of the wunderkind label claims it has become nothing more than a show for the media , filled with celebrities who are n't even interested in fashion .
" i would never put on a fashion show in the friedrichstadt palace , " said the german fashion icon , referring to the berlin event center where designer michael michalsky held a show during last summer 's fashion week .
" that 's just for entertainment value and fashion is supposed to be an art , " added joop , as reported by dpa .
the organizers of the fashion week , img fashion , disagree .
" i do n't think that it 's any different in paris , " img spokesman daniel aubke told deutsche welle .

" designers decide for a city that makes the most sense for them .
if they can reach their target audience better there than in a different city , then they will obviously show there . "
berlin , after all , has made up-and-coming designers its focus , so perhaps joop and lagerfeld do n't really fit in after all .
the german capital is often viewed as a bubbling cauldron of creativity and the show can capitalize on its home-grown talent of some 600 to 800 designers .
the city has already gained notoriety by concentrating on the work of exciting , talented and innovative young designers who continuously push the boundaries of creativity .
one of these is resident berlin designer sam frenzel , winner of the designer for tomorrow award at the show 's last outing .
this season , he 'll be displaying his first collection on the berlin catwalk .
one step at a time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show is developing step by step to perhaps one day rival fashion meccas such as paris by focusing on young newcomers , the berlin fashion week has developed a unique flavor that sets it apart from paris and milan .
but the event 's organizers say that berlin still is n't quite ready to go head-to-head with the major leaguers .
it 'll take time until berlin firmly establishes itself on the fashion map , but this process has already begun , says img fashion .
last season , the event attracted attention from around the world and drew fashion reporters from the new york times , the guardian , and vogue italy .

today , a glass window offering a view into a room filled with empty bookcases commemorates the event .

jean-pierre filiu , a professor at the paris institute of political studies , says algeria 's islamist salafist group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , aqim 's predecessor , has a history of involvement in crime .
aqim can " build on the gspc 's networks in the sahara desert , where it had long been engaged in smuggling a mix of drugs , weapons , and illegal immigrants , along with jihadi hit-and-run attacks against local security forces , " filiu said in a study just published by the carnegie endowment for peace . other experts note that many aqim recruits are criminals and fellow travelers , who operate like a gang .
since 2007 , aqim has killed scores in suicide bombings , including 11 un staffers four frenchmen , a brit and an american .
many more have been kidnapped and held for ransom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western intelligence services are struggling to stifle al qaeda 's growing reach in the sahel region the dea sting operation came amid an increased us and european military and law enforcement focus on the sahel .
encouraged by the us and the eu , military officials from algeria , mali , mauritania and niger agreed last fall on joint efforts to tackle terrorism and cross-border crime .
the us in 2008 increased security aid to $ 100 million .
much of this funding goes to the us africa command 's trans-saharan counter-terrorism partnership -lrb- tsctp -rrb- designed to train regional forces and furnish them with needed military materiel .
similarly , britain 's border agency and serious organized crime agency works with authorities in the region to fight drug traffickers .
europe facing major challenge the emergence of western and northern africa as a key hub in drugs trafficking poses despite the us sting operation a greater challenge to europe than it does to the united states , according to some experts .
" as the drugs fly from colombia , via venezuela to west africa then the expanding european-central european-asian markets , it is clear the u.s. market is no longer so relevant , " douglas farah , a washington-based expert on terrorism who focuses on the latin america-africa nexus , told deutsche welle .
critics of us and eu policy charge that the united states abetted by local regimes hungry for increased military and security assistance is likely to aggravate issues by approaching the region 's problems exclusively as a problem of global terrorism and trans-national crime rather than in terms of democratization and development .
" if you treat it from a soley security perspective , you 're producing more jihadists , " yahia h. zoubir , an expert on the sahel and professor of international relations at euromed-marseille , told deutsche welle .
that realization may be taking hold in washington as well as european capitals .
the africa command -lrb- africom -rrb- has begun focusing on relations with the tribes in a bid to minimize its overt involvement in security .
the us in late december suspended non-humanitarian aid to niger and imposed travel restrictions on government officials in response to president mamadou tandja 's refusal to relinquish his mandate . in an earlier , relatively rare emphasis on reform rather than security , the bush administration responded in 2008 to the toppling by the military of a democratically elected government in mauritania by suspending military aid to a junta that was touting the al qaeda threat as part of its raison d 'être .
weak regimes - soft targets bildunterschrift : analysts warn nonetheless that the drugs trade not only strengthens the islamists and rebels , but could turn already weak regimes into crime-driven enterprises .

so has the arrest of three al qaeda operatives in ghana , who were charged with narco-terrrorism in new york after being handed over to the us drugs enforcement agency -lrb- dea -rrb- and transported to the united states .
the two incidents raise the specter of increased cooperation between islamic militants and drug trafficking latin american militants and , according to us law enforcement officials , al qae 'da 's evolvement into a global criminal organization .
us , european and african anti-drug and counter-terrorism officials fear that islamist cooperation with groups like the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- could significantly fill the coffers of rebels operating across a crucial swathe of land that includes algeria , morocco , mauretania , mali , chad and niger , rich in uranium as well as oil and gas .
enhanced cash flow could enable the rebels to further undermine already weak , authoritarian regimes that face widespread discontent , restive nomadic populations , extreme poverty and an influx of islamist thinking via satellite television and militant missionaries .
the wreckage of the boeing 727 was discovered in the mali desert in november , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of gao .
investigators believe the plane was carrying up to 10 tons of cocaine , the largest europe-bound latin american drugs transit shipment via the sahel so far known to authorities .
vehicle tracks in the sand have led the investigators to the conclusion that traffickers unloaded the plane 's cargo at a makeshift airstrip before burning it .
while they have not ruled out that the plane may have crashed , the investigators hope that three mali nationals arrested while dismantling the wreckage and transported to the mali capital of bamako may shed light on what happened to the aircraft .
venezuela turning a blind eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez has been turning a blind eye to drug-trafficking operations alexandre schmidt , spokesman for the vienna-based un office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- told journalists in november the mysterious flight had originated in venezuela , fuelling allegations that venezuela supports terrorism and drugs trafficking .
venezuelan officials question the assertion .
but critics of president hugo chavez , pointing to his support of the farc , charge that widespread corruption reaching into the highest echelons of government facilitates venezuelan involvement in drugs trafficking .
" chavez may not be involved , but he certainly looks the other way .
none of his aides have been removed from office , " ariel segal , a lima-based expert on venezuela , told deutsche welle .
the arrest in of the three operatives of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , the al qaeda affiliate in west africa , further heightens concern about the islamists ' links to latin american traffickers .
the three mali nationals arrived in new york on december 18 after being arrested by authorities in ghana as a result of a four-month long sting operation in which two paid dea informants posed as farc representatives .
the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .

they said they would charge up to 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,000 -rrb- per kilogram .

so has the arrest of three al qaeda operatives in ghana , who were charged with narco-terrrorism in new york after being handed over to the us drugs enforcement agency -lrb- dea -rrb- and transported to the united states .
the two incidents raise the specter of increased cooperation between islamic militants and drug trafficking latin american militants and , according to us law enforcement officials , al qae 'da 's evolvement into a global criminal organization .
us , european and african anti-drug and counter-terrorism officials fear that islamist cooperation with groups like the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- could significantly fill the coffers of rebels operating across a crucial swathe of land that includes algeria , morocco , mauretania , mali , chad and niger , rich in uranium as well as oil and gas .
enhanced cash flow could enable the rebels to further undermine already weak , authoritarian regimes that face widespread discontent , restive nomadic populations , extreme poverty and an influx of islamist thinking via satellite television and militant missionaries .
the wreckage of the boeing 727 was discovered in the mali desert in november , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of gao .
investigators believe the plane was carrying up to 10 tons of cocaine , the largest europe-bound latin american drugs transit shipment via the sahel so far known to authorities .
vehicle tracks in the sand have led the investigators to the conclusion that traffickers unloaded the plane 's cargo at a makeshift airstrip before burning it .
while they have not ruled out that the plane may have crashed , the investigators hope that three mali nationals arrested while dismantling the wreckage and transported to the mali capital of bamako may shed light on what happened to the aircraft .
venezuela turning a blind eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez has been turning a blind eye to drug-trafficking operations alexandre schmidt , spokesman for the vienna-based un office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- told journalists in november the mysterious flight had originated in venezuela , fuelling allegations that venezuela supports terrorism and drugs trafficking .
venezuelan officials question the assertion .
but critics of president hugo chavez , pointing to his support of the farc , charge that widespread corruption reaching into the highest echelons of government facilitates venezuelan involvement in drugs trafficking .
" chavez may not be involved , but he certainly looks the other way .
none of his aides have been removed from office , " ariel segal , a lima-based expert on venezuela , told deutsche welle .
the arrest in of the three operatives of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , the al qaeda affiliate in west africa , further heightens concern about the islamists ' links to latin american traffickers .
the three mali nationals arrived in new york on december 18 after being arrested by authorities in ghana as a result of a four-month long sting operation in which two paid dea informants posed as farc representatives .
the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .
they told the undercover dea informants , according to court documents , that they could protect major latin american shipments of cocaine in the sahel and transport the drugs by truck through the desert and finally to spain .
they said they would charge up to 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,000 -rrb- per kilogram .

venezuela turning a blind eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez has been turning a blind eye to drug-trafficking operations alexandre schmidt , spokesman for the vienna-based un office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- told journalists in november the mysterious flight had originated in venezuela , fuelling allegations that venezuela supports terrorism and drugs trafficking .
venezuelan officials question the assertion .
but critics of president hugo chavez , pointing to his support of the farc , charge that widespread corruption reaching into the highest echelons of government facilitates venezuelan involvement in drugs trafficking .
" chavez may not be involved , but he certainly looks the other way .
none of his aides have been removed from office , " ariel segal , a lima-based expert on venezuela , told deutsche welle .
the arrest in of the three operatives of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , the al qaeda affiliate in west africa , further heightens concern about the islamists ' links to latin american traffickers .
the three mali nationals arrived in new york on december 18 after being arrested by authorities in ghana as a result of a four-month long sting operation in which two paid dea informants posed as farc representatives .
the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .
they told the undercover dea informants , according to court documents , that they could protect major latin american shipments of cocaine in the sahel and transport the drugs by truck through the desert and finally to spain .
they said they would charge up to 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,000 -rrb- per kilogram .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 20.01.2010 berlin takes to the catwalk without joop and lagerfeld großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fashion show is like an art exhibition , says designer joop berlin is vying for the spotlight on the international fashion stage .
it 's lost its top designers and taken flack for the nazi history of the fashion show 's location .
young new designers are fashion week 's last hope . it is that time of the year again as designers from around the world are busy packing their collections and beginning their bi-annual pilgrimage to the german capital .
berlin fashion week returns for its sixth outing from january 20-23 and promises to build on past success .
a total of 30 fashion shows are planned to display the new trends for winter 2010/2011 .
in addition to trends from more established names such as boss , rene lange and strenesse blue , berlin has continued to draw in many fresh names such as the award-winning newcomers frida weyer and sam frenzel .
notable absences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfang joop has accused berlin fashion week of placing entertainment above art as for the established designers , two of germany 's oldest names are notable by their absence .
both karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop will not be there , instead preferring to showcase their work on the catwalk in paris .
joop has turned his back on the event after accusing the berlin fashion week of being too focused on glamour .
the creator of the wunderkind label claims it has become nothing more than a show for the media , filled with celebrities who are n't even interested in fashion .
" i would never put on a fashion show in the friedrichstadt palace , " said the german fashion icon , referring to the berlin event center where designer michael michalsky held a show during last summer 's fashion week .
" that 's just for entertainment value and fashion is supposed to be an art , " added joop , as reported by dpa .
the organizers of the fashion week , img fashion , disagree .
" i do n't think that it 's any different in paris , " img spokesman daniel aubke told deutsche welle .
" celebrities are also invited there and it 's no different in berlin . "
a center of creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the absence of big names such as karl lagerfeld , berlin is focusing on young designers aubke said that the lack of big names would n't reflect badly on the event .
" designers decide for a city that makes the most sense for them .
if they can reach their target audience better there than in a different city , then they will obviously show there . "
berlin , after all , has made up-and-coming designers its focus , so perhaps joop and lagerfeld do n't really fit in after all .
the german capital is often viewed as a bubbling cauldron of creativity and the show can capitalize on its home-grown talent of some 600 to 800 designers .
the city has already gained notoriety by concentrating on the work of exciting , talented and innovative young designers who continuously push the boundaries of creativity .
one of these is resident berlin designer sam frenzel , winner of the designer for tomorrow award at the show 's last outing .
this season , he 'll be displaying his first collection on the berlin catwalk .
one step at a time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show is developing step by step to perhaps one day rival fashion meccas such as paris by focusing on young newcomers , the berlin fashion week has developed a unique flavor that sets it apart from paris and milan .
but the event 's organizers say that berlin still is n't quite ready to go head-to-head with the major leaguers .
it 'll take time until berlin firmly establishes itself on the fashion map , but this process has already begun , says img fashion .
last season , the event attracted attention from around the world and drew fashion reporters from the new york times , the guardian , and vogue italy .
" we 've only been here since 2007 and it would be a bit presumptuous to say ' we want to have a comparable audience to paris , ' but we are trying to develop step by step , " said aubke .
change of venue for next year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week will bid farewell to bebelplatz for the final time this season an unforeseen step in this development was announced one day before launch amidst clouds of controversy over the show 's main venue .
bebelplatz is best known as being the site of the infamous book burnings held on may 10 , 1933 , where thousands of books were burnt by students and members of hitler 's national socialist party .
today , a glass window offering a view into a room filled with empty bookcases commemorates the event .
in an open letter addressed to berlin mayor klaus wowereit , campaigners labeled the fashion week a " trivial mass event " which has no place on bebelplatz .
in response , img fashion promised to find a different venue to showcase the year 's summer trends in july . author : andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's lost its top designers and taken flack for the nazi history of the fashion show 's location .
young new designers are fashion week 's last hope . it is that time of the year again as designers from around the world are busy packing their collections and beginning their bi-annual pilgrimage to the german capital .
berlin fashion week returns for its sixth outing from january 20-23 and promises to build on past success .
a total of 30 fashion shows are planned to display the new trends for winter 2010/2011 .
in addition to trends from more established names such as boss , rene lange and strenesse blue , berlin has continued to draw in many fresh names such as the award-winning newcomers frida weyer and sam frenzel .
notable absences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfang joop has accused berlin fashion week of placing entertainment above art as for the established designers , two of germany 's oldest names are notable by their absence .
both karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop will not be there , instead preferring to showcase their work on the catwalk in paris .
joop has turned his back on the event after accusing the berlin fashion week of being too focused on glamour .
the creator of the wunderkind label claims it has become nothing more than a show for the media , filled with celebrities who are n't even interested in fashion .
" i would never put on a fashion show in the friedrichstadt palace , " said the german fashion icon , referring to the berlin event center where designer michael michalsky held a show during last summer 's fashion week .
" that 's just for entertainment value and fashion is supposed to be an art , " added joop , as reported by dpa .
the organizers of the fashion week , img fashion , disagree .
" i do n't think that it 's any different in paris , " img spokesman daniel aubke told deutsche welle .
" celebrities are also invited there and it 's no different in berlin . "
a center of creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the absence of big names such as karl lagerfeld , berlin is focusing on young designers aubke said that the lack of big names would n't reflect badly on the event .
" designers decide for a city that makes the most sense for them .
if they can reach their target audience better there than in a different city , then they will obviously show there . "
berlin , after all , has made up-and-coming designers its focus , so perhaps joop and lagerfeld do n't really fit in after all .
the german capital is often viewed as a bubbling cauldron of creativity and the show can capitalize on its home-grown talent of some 600 to 800 designers .
the city has already gained notoriety by concentrating on the work of exciting , talented and innovative young designers who continuously push the boundaries of creativity .
one of these is resident berlin designer sam frenzel , winner of the designer for tomorrow award at the show 's last outing .
this season , he 'll be displaying his first collection on the berlin catwalk .
one step at a time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show is developing step by step to perhaps one day rival fashion meccas such as paris by focusing on young newcomers , the berlin fashion week has developed a unique flavor that sets it apart from paris and milan .
but the event 's organizers say that berlin still is n't quite ready to go head-to-head with the major leaguers .
it 'll take time until berlin firmly establishes itself on the fashion map , but this process has already begun , says img fashion .
last season , the event attracted attention from around the world and drew fashion reporters from the new york times , the guardian , and vogue italy .
" we 've only been here since 2007 and it would be a bit presumptuous to say ' we want to have a comparable audience to paris , ' but we are trying to develop step by step , " said aubke .
change of venue for next year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week will bid farewell to bebelplatz for the final time this season an unforeseen step in this development was announced one day before launch amidst clouds of controversy over the show 's main venue .
bebelplatz is best known as being the site of the infamous book burnings held on may 10 , 1933 , where thousands of books were burnt by students and members of hitler 's national socialist party .
today , a glass window offering a view into a room filled with empty bookcases commemorates the event .
in an open letter addressed to berlin mayor klaus wowereit , campaigners labeled the fashion week a " trivial mass event " which has no place on bebelplatz .

so has the arrest of three al qaeda operatives in ghana , who were charged with narco-terrrorism in new york after being handed over to the us drugs enforcement agency -lrb- dea -rrb- and transported to the united states .
the two incidents raise the specter of increased cooperation between islamic militants and drug trafficking latin american militants and , according to us law enforcement officials , al qae 'da 's evolvement into a global criminal organization .
us , european and african anti-drug and counter-terrorism officials fear that islamist cooperation with groups like the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- could significantly fill the coffers of rebels operating across a crucial swathe of land that includes algeria , morocco , mauretania , mali , chad and niger , rich in uranium as well as oil and gas .
enhanced cash flow could enable the rebels to further undermine already weak , authoritarian regimes that face widespread discontent , restive nomadic populations , extreme poverty and an influx of islamist thinking via satellite television and militant missionaries .
the wreckage of the boeing 727 was discovered in the mali desert in november , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of gao .
investigators believe the plane was carrying up to 10 tons of cocaine , the largest europe-bound latin american drugs transit shipment via the sahel so far known to authorities .
vehicle tracks in the sand have led the investigators to the conclusion that traffickers unloaded the plane 's cargo at a makeshift airstrip before burning it .
while they have not ruled out that the plane may have crashed , the investigators hope that three mali nationals arrested while dismantling the wreckage and transported to the mali capital of bamako may shed light on what happened to the aircraft .
venezuela turning a blind eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez has been turning a blind eye to drug-trafficking operations alexandre schmidt , spokesman for the vienna-based un office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- told journalists in november the mysterious flight had originated in venezuela , fuelling allegations that venezuela supports terrorism and drugs trafficking .
venezuelan officials question the assertion .
but critics of president hugo chavez , pointing to his support of the farc , charge that widespread corruption reaching into the highest echelons of government facilitates venezuelan involvement in drugs trafficking .

the arrest in of the three operatives of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , the al qaeda affiliate in west africa , further heightens concern about the islamists ' links to latin american traffickers .
the three mali nationals arrived in new york on december 18 after being arrested by authorities in ghana as a result of a four-month long sting operation in which two paid dea informants posed as farc representatives .
the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .
they told the undercover dea informants , according to court documents , that they could protect major latin american shipments of cocaine in the sahel and transport the drugs by truck through the desert and finally to spain .
they said they would charge up to 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,000 -rrb- per kilogram .

the indian ocean has a particularly important strategic value because of the newly emerging markets china and india .
now , the two are set to become maritime rivals . when communist china celebrated the 60th anniversary of its navy with grand pomp last year , the world was reminded once more that china wants to become an influential and respected maritime player .
for china , the sea plays a very crucial role for transporting raw materials such as oil from the middle east or transporting chinese products to europe via the suez canal .
china can also play a role in maintaining stability in the region .
for example , with its recent efforts to support the fight against pirates off the somali coast .
india uneasy about china ’ s role in indian ocean however , not everybody is happy about china ’ s growing role in the indian ocean .
india is already in a difficult geopolitical position , explains indranil banerjie , the executive director of sapra , an independent indian think tank that looks at military issues .
“ india is beginning to feel rather uncomfortable with myanmar in the east , sri lanka in the south and gwadar in the west and now the african ports are making indian strategists feel rather uneasy . ”
china has a presence in all these regions - at the port of gwadar in pakistan as well as in the big container harbour in dhaka .
it is also building a bunker in sri lanka and a pipeline that will connect the bay of bengal to yunnan province .
“ the indian leadership and strategic thinkers have a bit of a problem and are trying to figure out what exactly the chinese want to achieve , ” says banerjie .
“ it is not very clear and if you can not gauge the intention then you get into a situation where willy-nilly you have to try to expand all your possibilities and options .
not necessarily a happy thing but perhaps inevitable in these circumstances . ”
can us play a stabilising role ?
some military observers say that the us can play a stabilising role but adam segal from the us council on foreign relations disagrees .
“ we already have our own problems with the chinese navy and therefore it ’ s not easy for the us to play a kind of outside role right now , ” he says .
“ i think we are going to continue engaging the indian navy .
we have done a number of military exercises with them , and that is probably the most likely way we will go forward . ”
indranil banerjie agrees : “ what is very important is to start developing strategic relationships with countries in the indian ocean .
india doesn ’ t want to dominate the indian ocean .
we just want options that will prevent any one power from trying to dominate or become the dominant force in the indian ocean .
so we need to work on alliances as well as spending on the navy . "
this could well lead to a new maritime arms race in asia .

in part one of this report , we looked at the importance of rare earths for technology and mentioned china 's leading role in the production of them .
in part two , we look at other issues pertaining to the use of rare earths , including radioactive leeching . being the world ’ s largest producer , china has been looking for more ways to expand the use of rare earths .
professor ewald schnug at the institute of animal nutrition at germany ’ s federal agricultural research centre in braunschweig says china has been looking for ways to use rare earths since the 1980s .
schnug has studied the agricultural use of rare earths and is concerned that it is highly risky because rare earths are often bound to radioactive elements .
one area where the chinese have a long track record is not very appetizing , namely the use of rare earths in fertilizers and animal feed : “ it is like feeding pigs with copper .
you feed them concentrations which are nearly toxic but the organism reacts with increased metabolic rates to it .
as a result , this can produce faster growth or more intensive growth .
so it might be some sort of a stress reaction , but another idea is that it is some sort of a promoter of the calcium metabolism in the organism .
we do n't know . "
he says that because many of the traditional growth enhancers , such as antibiotics , have been banned in many countries .
worldwide agriculture scientists are looking for alternatives to increase returns .
but schnug adds that , though some in china are using this kind of growth enhancer , it is not yet officially recommended on a national scale because the full impact has yet to be studied .
green technologies , harmful side-effects in other areas , especially that of green technologies , there is no question that humankind 's dependence on rare earths is increasing steadily .
for instance , no fewer than 15 kilos of rare earths are required for the batteries of a hybrid car .
michael meyer , professor for minerology and geochemistry at aachen 's technical university , rwth , dismisses concerns and says mining and processing rare earths is like the treatment of any other mineral : " whether or not the processing of rare earths poses a problem for the environment depends on regulations and the technical standards used .
basically , if the best available technology is used , no harm can really be done to the environment . "
but there are concerns rare earth production is harmful to the environment if the correct procudures are ignored .
hermann wotruba , professor and head of research at rwth aachen ’ s department of mineral processing says it is vital to separate out radio active elements : “ there are processes that allow the separation of uranium and thorium from the rare earths .
but then you have uranium and thorium left over that has to be disposed of or stored somewhere .
and the question is how well is this being done ?
another question is can there be radioactive leakage during processing if there is no proper controlling ? "
high technological standards are the key wotruba says that the equipment and technology used in mining in china is behind western standards .
not only that , but chinese regulations are also cause for concern .
" implementing regulations is indeed possible .
there are environmental regulations in china but they are not necessarily upheld , with the excuse that it is too expensive .
protecting the environment costs money . "
and there is little in china 's previous record to suggest that beijing will plough some of the increasing profits back into environmental protection .

it is also building a bunker in sri lanka and a pipeline that will connect the bay of bengal to yunnan province .
“ the indian leadership and strategic thinkers have a bit of a problem and are trying to figure out what exactly the chinese want to achieve , ” says banerjie .
“ it is not very clear and if you can not gauge the intention then you get into a situation where willy-nilly you have to try to expand all your possibilities and options .
not necessarily a happy thing but perhaps inevitable in these circumstances . ”
can us play a stabilising role ?
some military observers say that the us can play a stabilising role but adam segal from the us council on foreign relations disagrees .
“ we already have our own problems with the chinese navy and therefore it ’ s not easy for the us to play a kind of outside role right now , ” he says .
“ i think we are going to continue engaging the indian navy .
we have done a number of military exercises with them , and that is probably the most likely way we will go forward . ”
indranil banerjie agrees : “ what is very important is to start developing strategic relationships with countries in the indian ocean .
india doesn ’ t want to dominate the indian ocean .
we just want options that will prevent any one power from trying to dominate or become the dominant force in the indian ocean .
so we need to work on alliances as well as spending on the navy . "
this could well lead to a new maritime arms race in asia .

indranil banerjie agrees : “ what is very important is to start developing strategic relationships with countries in the indian ocean .
india doesn ’ t want to dominate the indian ocean .
we just want options that will prevent any one power from trying to dominate or become the dominant force in the indian ocean .
so we need to work on alliances as well as spending on the navy . "
this could well lead to a new maritime arms race in asia .

professor ewald schnug at the institute of animal nutrition at germany ’ s federal agricultural research centre in braunschweig says china has been looking for ways to use rare earths since the 1980s .
schnug has studied the agricultural use of rare earths and is concerned that it is highly risky because rare earths are often bound to radioactive elements .
one area where the chinese have a long track record is not very appetizing , namely the use of rare earths in fertilizers and animal feed : “ it is like feeding pigs with copper .
you feed them concentrations which are nearly toxic but the organism reacts with increased metabolic rates to it .
as a result , this can produce faster growth or more intensive growth .
so it might be some sort of a stress reaction , but another idea is that it is some sort of a promoter of the calcium metabolism in the organism .

he says that because many of the traditional growth enhancers , such as antibiotics , have been banned in many countries .

hermann wotruba , professor and head of research at rwth aachen ’ s department of mineral processing says it is vital to separate out radio active elements : “ there are processes that allow the separation of uranium and thorium from the rare earths .

one area where the chinese have a long track record is not very appetizing , namely the use of rare earths in fertilizers and animal feed : “ it is like feeding pigs with copper .
you feed them concentrations which are nearly toxic but the organism reacts with increased metabolic rates to it .
as a result , this can produce faster growth or more intensive growth .
so it might be some sort of a stress reaction , but another idea is that it is some sort of a promoter of the calcium metabolism in the organism .
we do n't know . "
he says that because many of the traditional growth enhancers , such as antibiotics , have been banned in many countries .
worldwide agriculture scientists are looking for alternatives to increase returns .
but schnug adds that , though some in china are using this kind of growth enhancer , it is not yet officially recommended on a national scale because the full impact has yet to be studied .
green technologies , harmful side-effects in other areas , especially that of green technologies , there is no question that humankind 's dependence on rare earths is increasing steadily .
for instance , no fewer than 15 kilos of rare earths are required for the batteries of a hybrid car .
michael meyer , professor for minerology and geochemistry at aachen 's technical university , rwth , dismisses concerns and says mining and processing rare earths is like the treatment of any other mineral : " whether or not the processing of rare earths poses a problem for the environment depends on regulations and the technical standards used .
basically , if the best available technology is used , no harm can really be done to the environment . "
but there are concerns rare earth production is harmful to the environment if the correct procudures are ignored .
hermann wotruba , professor and head of research at rwth aachen ’ s department of mineral processing says it is vital to separate out radio active elements : “ there are processes that allow the separation of uranium and thorium from the rare earths .
but then you have uranium and thorium left over that has to be disposed of or stored somewhere .
and the question is how well is this being done ?
another question is can there be radioactive leakage during processing if there is no proper controlling ? "
high technological standards are the key wotruba says that the equipment and technology used in mining in china is behind western standards .
not only that , but chinese regulations are also cause for concern .
" implementing regulations is indeed possible .
there are environmental regulations in china but they are not necessarily upheld , with the excuse that it is too expensive .
protecting the environment costs money . "
and there is little in china 's previous record to suggest that beijing will plough some of the increasing profits back into environmental protection .

the indian ocean has a particularly important strategic value because of the newly emerging markets china and india .
now , the two are set to become maritime rivals . when communist china celebrated the 60th anniversary of its navy with grand pomp last year , the world was reminded once more that china wants to become an influential and respected maritime player .
for china , the sea plays a very crucial role for transporting raw materials such as oil from the middle east or transporting chinese products to europe via the suez canal .
china can also play a role in maintaining stability in the region .
for example , with its recent efforts to support the fight against pirates off the somali coast .
india uneasy about china ’ s role in indian ocean however , not everybody is happy about china ’ s growing role in the indian ocean .
india is already in a difficult geopolitical position , explains indranil banerjie , the executive director of sapra , an independent indian think tank that looks at military issues .
“ india is beginning to feel rather uncomfortable with myanmar in the east , sri lanka in the south and gwadar in the west and now the african ports are making indian strategists feel rather uneasy . ”
china has a presence in all these regions - at the port of gwadar in pakistan as well as in the big container harbour in dhaka .
it is also building a bunker in sri lanka and a pipeline that will connect the bay of bengal to yunnan province .
“ the indian leadership and strategic thinkers have a bit of a problem and are trying to figure out what exactly the chinese want to achieve , ” says banerjie .
“ it is not very clear and if you can not gauge the intention then you get into a situation where willy-nilly you have to try to expand all your possibilities and options .
not necessarily a happy thing but perhaps inevitable in these circumstances . ”
can us play a stabilising role ?
some military observers say that the us can play a stabilising role but adam segal from the us council on foreign relations disagrees .
“ we already have our own problems with the chinese navy and therefore it ’ s not easy for the us to play a kind of outside role right now , ” he says .
“ i think we are going to continue engaging the indian navy .
we have done a number of military exercises with them , and that is probably the most likely way we will go forward . ”
indranil banerjie agrees : “ what is very important is to start developing strategic relationships with countries in the indian ocean .
india doesn ’ t want to dominate the indian ocean .
we just want options that will prevent any one power from trying to dominate or become the dominant force in the indian ocean .
so we need to work on alliances as well as spending on the navy . "
this could well lead to a new maritime arms race in asia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 20.01.2010 press review : reality catches up with president obama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama needs more time to fulfill all his promises a year after us president barack obama took office , german editorial writers agree that whether he will go down in history as a great or an average president is still undecided . " obama has not reformed the healthcare system , has not brought climate legislation through congress , the iranian leadership has not adhered to the western concept of responsibility , and in afghanistan , a military turning point is not in sight .
guantanamo has n't been closed yet as promised , either , " writes business daily handelsblatt from dusseldorf .
does that mean he is a total failure ?
far from it , says the paper , much of what the us administration has begun just can not be done in 12 months , and obama will need luck to accomplish his goals in even one legislative period .
the berliner morgenpost daily concurs that , although only 46 percent of americans are satisfied with his work , obama should n't be judged by his first 12 months in office .
" obama can still become one of the great innovators in american history , " the paper says .
" he has unequalled self-confidence , which keeps him from changing policies just because of unfavorable surveys .
he is also blessed with a pragmatism that allows him not to be led into ideological dead ends . " a year ago , says the berlin paper , observers should have been more reserved in their expectations .
" today , let them be warned against making an assumption that is just as premature : that obama has failed . " obama underestimated the economic crisis , says the frankfurter rundschau .
but " his most momentous mistake was not remaining at the helm of his most important project , healthcare reforms . " while the president is by no means an american gorbachev - respected internationally , ridiculed at home - the frankfurt daily says , there is growing doubt ahead of congressional elections later this year that obama and his democrats will continue to hold all the power .
" the second year in office will not be any easier . "
marked by modesty , impartiality and a willingness to cooperate rather than making solitary decisions , obama 's new style has been of little use so far concerning the biggest global problems , " the muenchner merkur writes . the munich daily goes on to say that it would not be fair to condemn the president - after all millions of people only too gladly let their imaginations be fired by the " black superstar . "
" policy is not made primarily by good intentions , lofty gestures and brilliant rhetoric ; policy is clearly based on power and interests .
this is a reality even an obama ca n't suspend . "
reality has set in , the westfalenpost agrees .
however , the hagen-based daily believes that the young president has matured , remarking that he rarely smiles , that his face is often serious .
" the problems are too great .
the economic crisis , a backlash on climate policies , the costly war in afghanistan and the struggle for healthcare reforms have taken their toll on obama .
but what is even worse : america is losing its influence . " obama knew from the start that america could only tackle global crises along with other nations .
" which is why we europeans , especially we germans , should be glad to have this president at our side , " says the paper. db / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de strong effort , little tangible results mark the first year of the obama presidency with his slogan , ' yes we can ' barack obama not only won the presidential poll , but also the support of millions all over the world .
but one year after taking office , it 's clear that even he ca n't fulfill the high hopes .
-lrb- 19.01.2010 -rrb- europe must seize ' the obama moment , ' urges foreign policy expert in barack obama , europe got the president it wanted .
but instead of supporting his shift on climate change and other topics , europeans still have unrealistic expectations , says the head of an eu think tank .

karel de gucht hopes to gain insight into how eu aid can be most efficiently used in rebuilding the earthquake-struck nation . the european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid karel de gucht is expected in haiti on thursday morning , where he will assess the current and future allocation of relief aid coming from the european bloc .
" his visit will be an opportunity to assess the immediate life-saving humanitarian aid needs , as well as the medium and long-term requirements for reconstruction and rehabilitation of the country , " the european commission said in a statement released wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gucht said members of the european parliament did not recognize efforts in haiti by eu member states de gucht will also meet with haitian and un authorities , as well as the main aid representatives on the scene , to discuss the coordination of the overall relief effort , the commission said .
he will remain until late friday .
earlier this week , the commissioner told the european parliament in strasbourg how he assessed the situation in haiti .
" it is not only about rescuing human lives , but rescuing a country as a whole " , de gucht told the parliamentarians .
members of international organizations had also fallen victim to the catastrophe .
this made it more difficult to organize aid on the spot .
urgent medical , technical and logistic help were needed to avoid further risks such as an outbreak of cholera , he said .
overall , the commission and eu member states have pledged more than 422 million euros -lrb- $ 595 million -rrb- in immediate humanitarian relief and longer-term reconstruction aid .
eu-us coordination in the works meanwhile , the eu 's new foreign policy chief catherine ashton headed to washington on wednesday , as a strong aftershock measuring 6.1 on the richter scale rocked haiti .
ashton will meet with us secretary of state hillary clinton and then head to new york for talks with un secretary general ban ki-moon .

green group leader daniel cohn-bendit said the eu should not have been acting " on the sidelines . "
" if i was the high representative faced with a disaster of this scope , i 'd get on the first plane and then come back and tell the europeans what we should be doing , " cohn-bendit said .
" i think that is the basic minimum . "
but ashton defended her actions to parliamentarians .
" i had nothing to contribute on the ground other than taking up valuable space when planes were unable to land because of the state of the airfield , " she said .
" i am not a doctor , nor a fire fighter .
my place was to bring together co-ordination at eu level and with the un . "
de gucht said parliament should be more generous in recognizing the efforts put in place by the eu 's executive and its member states .
he said meps did " not pay enough tribute to all the people who have been working since day one in brussels and on the spot . "

" the new government has only been in place for a few months now , so they need some time to create public support for some very tough measures to be taken , " he added .
keeping an eye on greece the tough measures proposed by greece include an overhaul of the tax system , spending cuts , a hiring freeze on civil servants and salary caps for the highly-paid .
greece has pledged to bring its 12.7 percent budget deficit down to 8.7 percent in the first year of a three-year crackdown .
the eu 's economic affairs commissioner , joaquim almunia , said the measures were adequate , for now , but the european commission will study the plan intensively over the next two weeks , before deciding whether to demand changes .
he said the commission wanted updates on how greece was progressing every three months .
and a plan is in the works to hand auditing powers to the eu 's statistics office , eurostat , which would also deploy a permanent representative to a new national statistics agency in greece. mrm / ap / dpa editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the opposition has called for a full withdrawal by 2015 . the commander of international forces in afghanistan , us general stanley mcchrystal , said german troops needed to establish more contact with the people .
otherwise , the soldiers - though physically present - were " essentially irrelevant , " he said in an interview with the mass circulation daily bild zeitung published wednesday .
germany 's defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said mcchrystal was naming the reality soldiers faced .
" i do n't see it as criticism , but rather as a description of the reality confronting the international community , " guttenberg told reporters in berlin .
" when he speaks about risks , then that is also a reality .
our soldiers are exposed to high risks every day . "
guttenberg did not comment on whether the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , would begin more patrols on foot in the future .
his predecessor , franz josef jung , had ordered several years ago that german soldiers only be allowed to leave their camps in armored vehicles .
this had been a reaction to increased attacks on bundeswehr troops .
opposition wants full withdrawal former foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group , said ending germany 's activities in afghanistan should be tied to the reduction of the us presence there .
president barack obama has said the us will begin reducing its military activities in afghanistan from 2011 .
" we should n't lag behind , " steinmeier told the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
" the withdrawal of german soldiers should also begin in 2011 .
we have to now completely hand over the reasonably calm districts to the afghans . "
steinmeier said further steps should then be taken with other european countries .
" we have to come to an agreement with our most significant european partners to end our military commitment there between 2013 and 2015 , " he said .
this was " ambitious , but realistic . "
bildunterschrift : some 40,000 more troops are due to arrive in afghanistan from the us and its nato allies in 2010 but defense minister guttenberg said he disagreed .
" i think nothing of a finish date , " guttenberg said .
this would play into the hands of those who wanted to " switch off the lights " in afghanistan again .
foreign minister guido westerwelle also rejected demands for a speedy withdrawal of german troops .
" the international community can not afford to let this country make a false step or even fall , " westerwelle said .
" whoever would hastily leave afghanistan now would leave millions of people in the lurch and send many of them to a certain death at the hands of taliban executioners . "

the opposition has called for a full withdrawal by 2015 . the commander of international forces in afghanistan , us general stanley mcchrystal , said german troops needed to establish more contact with the people .
otherwise , the soldiers - though physically present - were " essentially irrelevant , " he said in an interview with the mass circulation daily bild zeitung published wednesday .
germany 's defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said mcchrystal was naming the reality soldiers faced .
" i do n't see it as criticism , but rather as a description of the reality confronting the international community , " guttenberg told reporters in berlin .
" when he speaks about risks , then that is also a reality .
our soldiers are exposed to high risks every day . "
guttenberg did not comment on whether the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , would begin more patrols on foot in the future .
his predecessor , franz josef jung , had ordered several years ago that german soldiers only be allowed to leave their camps in armored vehicles .
this had been a reaction to increased attacks on bundeswehr troops .
opposition wants full withdrawal former foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group , said ending germany 's activities in afghanistan should be tied to the reduction of the us presence there .
president barack obama has said the us will begin reducing its military activities in afghanistan from 2011 .
" we should n't lag behind , " steinmeier told the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
" the withdrawal of german soldiers should also begin in 2011 .
we have to now completely hand over the reasonably calm districts to the afghans . "
steinmeier said further steps should then be taken with other european countries .
" we have to come to an agreement with our most significant european partners to end our military commitment there between 2013 and 2015 , " he said .
this was " ambitious , but realistic . "
bildunterschrift : some 40,000 more troops are due to arrive in afghanistan from the us and its nato allies in 2010 but defense minister guttenberg said he disagreed .
" i think nothing of a finish date , " guttenberg said .
this would play into the hands of those who wanted to " switch off the lights " in afghanistan again .
foreign minister guido westerwelle also rejected demands for a speedy withdrawal of german troops .
" the international community can not afford to let this country make a false step or even fall , " westerwelle said .
" whoever would hastily leave afghanistan now would leave millions of people in the lurch and send many of them to a certain death at the hands of taliban executioners . "
karzai to visit berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and merkel met in berlin last year , too germany currently has 4,300 soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
an international conference in london on january 28 will deliberate the future of the international engagement .
chancellor angela merkel has said she will present to parliament in the coming week a government policy statement on germany 's plans .
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said afghan president hamid karzai will stop in berlin next week on his way to the london conference . karzai is expected to meet the german leader and parliamentarians .
justifying more troops the spd has indicated it would not block an increase in troops .
" if the government can precisely justify what additional efforts additional soldiers will bring , then it is certainly reasonable , " spd defense expert rainer arnold told the newspaper rheinische merkur .
" a couple of hundred soldiers more can hardly be called a militarization of german foreign policy . "
however , arnold did not put a figure on how many more soldiers the spd would support. sac / reuters / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" speaking in parliament on the second day of a four day session to debate her government 's 2010 budget proposals , chancellor angela merkel said plans to ramp up the country 's new debt by 86 billion euros -lrb- $ 123 billion -rrb- were " the right thing to do . "
germany is struggling to climb out of its worst recession since world war ii and has invested enormous sums to stimulate the country 's flagging economy .
defending that strategy , merkel said " we want germany to emerge stronger from this crisis than it was when it went in . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' we did the right thing ' said chancellor merkel " we have managed to do the right thing to prevent falling into the abyss .
as much as we would wish another situation , we are equally bound to look reality in the eye , " the chancellor said .
the draft budget , proposed by finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , foresees the highest deficit in germany 's post-war history .
total expenditures for 2010 are expected to reach some 325 billion euros ; 33 billion euros more than last year .
the largest , single outlay at nearly 147 billion euros is earmarked for social services .
schaeuble warned that public spending would be cut in 2011 and said " grave decisions lie ahead . "
responding to the government 's budget and tax-cut plans , opposition social democrat parliamentary leader , frank-walter steinmeier , accused the coalition of " complete and utter failure " in its first 100 days in office and of " having its head in the clouds . "
steinmeier said the government , in an attempt to satisfy its clientele , had " gambled away public trust " with its plans to cut taxes and trim programs , while spending more .

" germany will only be able to secure its prosperity when it remains a strong exporting country , " merkel said .
" what made us strong - the chemical and automobile industries , medical equipment , transport technology - must be continued and should never be given up , " she added .
merkel said the goal of her government was to bring the economy " intelligently out of the slump " and defended controversial tax cuts agreed on by her center-right coalition .
the chancellor said she aimed to have the economy back to its pre-crisis growth levels by 2013 .
the german economy contracted by 5 percent in 2009 .
later this month , the government is expected to officially revise its growth forecast upwards for 2010 , from 1.2 percent , to 1.5 percent .

the four-star general who commands the international troops in afghanistan said the taliban had used the situation in the country 's north to expand their operations and create the impression that the movement was active across the entire country .
mcchrystal criticized the german bundeswehr for patrolling mostly with heavily armored vehicles in its kunduz operations area and not on foot , noting that the insurgents ' goal was " to isolate the security forces from the populace . "
taliban trying to divide and conquer the taliban are trying " to create a situation where the security forces stay in their camps , never leave their armored vehicles and have very little contact with the population .
the security forces may be there , but they are irrelevant .
if the insurgents manage to achieve this , then they have accomplished their mission , " mcchrystal warned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcchrystal says germany needs to accept greater risks he stressed in the interview that it was hard for the afghan people to trust their government " if they do n't have the feeling they are protected and respected . "
the people , he said , do n't know how strong the insurgents really are , or how determined the international community is .
mcchrystal said that , like all the troops in afghanistan , german forces needed to live with the greater risk of this new strategy .
he said the germans may have to change the way they have dealt with the situation so far .
he added that he was planning to deploy american troops in the german sector in the near future .
he also noted that he would raise the issue at the international afghanistan conference in london at the end of january and at the munich security conference in germany in early february. gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's lost its top designers and taken flack for the nazi history of the fashion show 's location .
young new designers are fashion week 's last hope . it is that time of the year again as designers from around the world are busy packing their collections and beginning their bi-annual pilgrimage to the german capital .
berlin fashion week returns for its sixth outing from january 20-23 and promises to build on past success .
a total of 30 fashion shows are planned to display the new trends for winter 2010/2011 .
in addition to trends from more established names such as boss , rene lange and strenesse blue , berlin has continued to draw in many fresh names such as the award-winning newcomers frida weyer and sam frenzel .
notable absences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfang joop has accused berlin fashion week of placing entertainment above art as for the established designers , two of germany 's oldest names are notable by their absence .
both karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop will not be there , instead preferring to showcase their work on the catwalk in paris .
joop has turned his back on the event after accusing the berlin fashion week of being too focused on glamour .
the creator of the wunderkind label claims it has become nothing more than a show for the media , filled with celebrities who are n't even interested in fashion .
" i would never put on a fashion show in the friedrichstadt palace , " said the german fashion icon , referring to the berlin event center where designer michael michalsky held a show during last summer 's fashion week .
" that 's just for entertainment value and fashion is supposed to be an art , " added joop , as reported by dpa .
the organizers of the fashion week , img fashion , disagree .
" i do n't think that it 's any different in paris , " img spokesman daniel aubke told deutsche welle .
" celebrities are also invited there and it 's no different in berlin . "
a center of creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the absence of big names such as karl lagerfeld , berlin is focusing on young designers aubke said that the lack of big names would n't reflect badly on the event .
" designers decide for a city that makes the most sense for them .
if they can reach their target audience better there than in a different city , then they will obviously show there . "
berlin , after all , has made up-and-coming designers its focus , so perhaps joop and lagerfeld do n't really fit in after all .
the german capital is often viewed as a bubbling cauldron of creativity and the show can capitalize on its home-grown talent of some 600 to 800 designers .
the city has already gained notoriety by concentrating on the work of exciting , talented and innovative young designers who continuously push the boundaries of creativity .
one of these is resident berlin designer sam frenzel , winner of the designer for tomorrow award at the show 's last outing .
this season , he 'll be displaying his first collection on the berlin catwalk .
one step at a time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show is developing step by step to perhaps one day rival fashion meccas such as paris by focusing on young newcomers , the berlin fashion week has developed a unique flavor that sets it apart from paris and milan .
but the event 's organizers say that berlin still is n't quite ready to go head-to-head with the major leaguers .
it 'll take time until berlin firmly establishes itself on the fashion map , but this process has already begun , says img fashion .
last season , the event attracted attention from around the world and drew fashion reporters from the new york times , the guardian , and vogue italy .
" we 've only been here since 2007 and it would be a bit presumptuous to say ' we want to have a comparable audience to paris , ' but we are trying to develop step by step , " said aubke .
change of venue for next year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week will bid farewell to bebelplatz for the final time this season an unforeseen step in this development was announced one day before launch amidst clouds of controversy over the show 's main venue .
bebelplatz is best known as being the site of the infamous book burnings held on may 10 , 1933 , where thousands of books were burnt by students and members of hitler 's national socialist party .
today , a glass window offering a view into a room filled with empty bookcases commemorates the event .
in an open letter addressed to berlin mayor klaus wowereit , campaigners labeled the fashion week a " trivial mass event " which has no place on bebelplatz .
in response , img fashion promised to find a different venue to showcase the year 's summer trends in july . author : andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's lost its top designers and taken flack for the nazi history of the fashion show 's location .
young new designers are fashion week 's last hope . it is that time of the year again as designers from around the world are busy packing their collections and beginning their bi-annual pilgrimage to the german capital .
berlin fashion week returns for its sixth outing from january 20-23 and promises to build on past success .
a total of 30 fashion shows are planned to display the new trends for winter 2010/2011 .
in addition to trends from more established names such as boss , rene lange and strenesse blue , berlin has continued to draw in many fresh names such as the award-winning newcomers frida weyer and sam frenzel .
notable absences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfang joop has accused berlin fashion week of placing entertainment above art as for the established designers , two of germany 's oldest names are notable by their absence .
both karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop will not be there , instead preferring to showcase their work on the catwalk in paris .
joop has turned his back on the event after accusing the berlin fashion week of being too focused on glamour .
the creator of the wunderkind label claims it has become nothing more than a show for the media , filled with celebrities who are n't even interested in fashion .
" i would never put on a fashion show in the friedrichstadt palace , " said the german fashion icon , referring to the berlin event center where designer michael michalsky held a show during last summer 's fashion week .
" that 's just for entertainment value and fashion is supposed to be an art , " added joop , as reported by dpa .
the organizers of the fashion week , img fashion , disagree .
" i do n't think that it 's any different in paris , " img spokesman daniel aubke told deutsche welle .
" celebrities are also invited there and it 's no different in berlin . "
a center of creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the absence of big names such as karl lagerfeld , berlin is focusing on young designers aubke said that the lack of big names would n't reflect badly on the event .
" designers decide for a city that makes the most sense for them .
if they can reach their target audience better there than in a different city , then they will obviously show there . "
berlin , after all , has made up-and-coming designers its focus , so perhaps joop and lagerfeld do n't really fit in after all .
the german capital is often viewed as a bubbling cauldron of creativity and the show can capitalize on its home-grown talent of some 600 to 800 designers .
the city has already gained notoriety by concentrating on the work of exciting , talented and innovative young designers who continuously push the boundaries of creativity .
one of these is resident berlin designer sam frenzel , winner of the designer for tomorrow award at the show 's last outing .
this season , he 'll be displaying his first collection on the berlin catwalk .

it 's lost its top designers and taken flack for the nazi history of the fashion show 's location .
young new designers are fashion week 's last hope . it is that time of the year again as designers from around the world are busy packing their collections and beginning their bi-annual pilgrimage to the german capital .
berlin fashion week returns for its sixth outing from january 20-23 and promises to build on past success .
a total of 30 fashion shows are planned to display the new trends for winter 2010/2011 .
in addition to trends from more established names such as boss , rene lange and strenesse blue , berlin has continued to draw in many fresh names such as the award-winning newcomers frida weyer and sam frenzel .
notable absences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfang joop has accused berlin fashion week of placing entertainment above art as for the established designers , two of germany 's oldest names are notable by their absence .
both karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop will not be there , instead preferring to showcase their work on the catwalk in paris .
joop has turned his back on the event after accusing the berlin fashion week of being too focused on glamour .
the creator of the wunderkind label claims it has become nothing more than a show for the media , filled with celebrities who are n't even interested in fashion .
" i would never put on a fashion show in the friedrichstadt palace , " said the german fashion icon , referring to the berlin event center where designer michael michalsky held a show during last summer 's fashion week .
" that 's just for entertainment value and fashion is supposed to be an art , " added joop , as reported by dpa .
the organizers of the fashion week , img fashion , disagree .
" i do n't think that it 's any different in paris , " img spokesman daniel aubke told deutsche welle .
" celebrities are also invited there and it 's no different in berlin . "
a center of creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the absence of big names such as karl lagerfeld , berlin is focusing on young designers aubke said that the lack of big names would n't reflect badly on the event .
" designers decide for a city that makes the most sense for them .
if they can reach their target audience better there than in a different city , then they will obviously show there . "
berlin , after all , has made up-and-coming designers its focus , so perhaps joop and lagerfeld do n't really fit in after all .
the german capital is often viewed as a bubbling cauldron of creativity and the show can capitalize on its home-grown talent of some 600 to 800 designers .
the city has already gained notoriety by concentrating on the work of exciting , talented and innovative young designers who continuously push the boundaries of creativity .
one of these is resident berlin designer sam frenzel , winner of the designer for tomorrow award at the show 's last outing .
this season , he 'll be displaying his first collection on the berlin catwalk .
one step at a time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show is developing step by step to perhaps one day rival fashion meccas such as paris by focusing on young newcomers , the berlin fashion week has developed a unique flavor that sets it apart from paris and milan .
but the event 's organizers say that berlin still is n't quite ready to go head-to-head with the major leaguers .
it 'll take time until berlin firmly establishes itself on the fashion map , but this process has already begun , says img fashion .
last season , the event attracted attention from around the world and drew fashion reporters from the new york times , the guardian , and vogue italy .
" we 've only been here since 2007 and it would be a bit presumptuous to say ' we want to have a comparable audience to paris , ' but we are trying to develop step by step , " said aubke .
change of venue for next year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week will bid farewell to bebelplatz for the final time this season an unforeseen step in this development was announced one day before launch amidst clouds of controversy over the show 's main venue .
bebelplatz is best known as being the site of the infamous book burnings held on may 10 , 1933 , where thousands of books were burnt by students and members of hitler 's national socialist party .
today , a glass window offering a view into a room filled with empty bookcases commemorates the event .
in an open letter addressed to berlin mayor klaus wowereit , campaigners labeled the fashion week a " trivial mass event " which has no place on bebelplatz .
in response , img fashion promised to find a different venue to showcase the year 's summer trends in july . author : andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so has the arrest of three al qaeda operatives in ghana , who were charged with narco-terrrorism in new york after being handed over to the us drugs enforcement agency -lrb- dea -rrb- and transported to the united states .
the two incidents raise the specter of increased cooperation between islamic militants and drug trafficking latin american militants and , according to us law enforcement officials , al qae 'da 's evolvement into a global criminal organization .
us , european and african anti-drug and counter-terrorism officials fear that islamist cooperation with groups like the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- could significantly fill the coffers of rebels operating across a crucial swathe of land that includes algeria , morocco , mauretania , mali , chad and niger , rich in uranium as well as oil and gas .
enhanced cash flow could enable the rebels to further undermine already weak , authoritarian regimes that face widespread discontent , restive nomadic populations , extreme poverty and an influx of islamist thinking via satellite television and militant missionaries .
the wreckage of the boeing 727 was discovered in the mali desert in november , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of gao .
investigators believe the plane was carrying up to 10 tons of cocaine , the largest europe-bound latin american drugs transit shipment via the sahel so far known to authorities .
vehicle tracks in the sand have led the investigators to the conclusion that traffickers unloaded the plane 's cargo at a makeshift airstrip before burning it .
while they have not ruled out that the plane may have crashed , the investigators hope that three mali nationals arrested while dismantling the wreckage and transported to the mali capital of bamako may shed light on what happened to the aircraft .
venezuela turning a blind eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez has been turning a blind eye to drug-trafficking operations alexandre schmidt , spokesman for the vienna-based un office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- told journalists in november the mysterious flight had originated in venezuela , fuelling allegations that venezuela supports terrorism and drugs trafficking .
venezuelan officials question the assertion .
but critics of president hugo chavez , pointing to his support of the farc , charge that widespread corruption reaching into the highest echelons of government facilitates venezuelan involvement in drugs trafficking .
" chavez may not be involved , but he certainly looks the other way .
none of his aides have been removed from office , " ariel segal , a lima-based expert on venezuela , told deutsche welle .
the arrest in of the three operatives of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , the al qaeda affiliate in west africa , further heightens concern about the islamists ' links to latin american traffickers .
the three mali nationals arrived in new york on december 18 after being arrested by authorities in ghana as a result of a four-month long sting operation in which two paid dea informants posed as farc representatives .
the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .
they told the undercover dea informants , according to court documents , that they could protect major latin american shipments of cocaine in the sahel and transport the drugs by truck through the desert and finally to spain .
they said they would charge up to 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,000 -rrb- per kilogram .

so has the arrest of three al qaeda operatives in ghana , who were charged with narco-terrrorism in new york after being handed over to the us drugs enforcement agency -lrb- dea -rrb- and transported to the united states .
the two incidents raise the specter of increased cooperation between islamic militants and drug trafficking latin american militants and , according to us law enforcement officials , al qae 'da 's evolvement into a global criminal organization .
us , european and african anti-drug and counter-terrorism officials fear that islamist cooperation with groups like the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- could significantly fill the coffers of rebels operating across a crucial swathe of land that includes algeria , morocco , mauretania , mali , chad and niger , rich in uranium as well as oil and gas .

the wreckage of the boeing 727 was discovered in the mali desert in november , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of gao .
investigators believe the plane was carrying up to 10 tons of cocaine , the largest europe-bound latin american drugs transit shipment via the sahel so far known to authorities .
vehicle tracks in the sand have led the investigators to the conclusion that traffickers unloaded the plane 's cargo at a makeshift airstrip before burning it .
while they have not ruled out that the plane may have crashed , the investigators hope that three mali nationals arrested while dismantling the wreckage and transported to the mali capital of bamako may shed light on what happened to the aircraft .
venezuela turning a blind eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez has been turning a blind eye to drug-trafficking operations alexandre schmidt , spokesman for the vienna-based un office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- told journalists in november the mysterious flight had originated in venezuela , fuelling allegations that venezuela supports terrorism and drugs trafficking .
venezuelan officials question the assertion .
but critics of president hugo chavez , pointing to his support of the farc , charge that widespread corruption reaching into the highest echelons of government facilitates venezuelan involvement in drugs trafficking .
" chavez may not be involved , but he certainly looks the other way .
none of his aides have been removed from office , " ariel segal , a lima-based expert on venezuela , told deutsche welle .
the arrest in of the three operatives of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , the al qaeda affiliate in west africa , further heightens concern about the islamists ' links to latin american traffickers .
the three mali nationals arrived in new york on december 18 after being arrested by authorities in ghana as a result of a four-month long sting operation in which two paid dea informants posed as farc representatives .
the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .
they told the undercover dea informants , according to court documents , that they could protect major latin american shipments of cocaine in the sahel and transport the drugs by truck through the desert and finally to spain .
they said they would charge up to 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,000 -rrb- per kilogram .

venezuela turning a blind eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez has been turning a blind eye to drug-trafficking operations alexandre schmidt , spokesman for the vienna-based un office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- told journalists in november the mysterious flight had originated in venezuela , fuelling allegations that venezuela supports terrorism and drugs trafficking .
venezuelan officials question the assertion .
but critics of president hugo chavez , pointing to his support of the farc , charge that widespread corruption reaching into the highest echelons of government facilitates venezuelan involvement in drugs trafficking .
" chavez may not be involved , but he certainly looks the other way .
none of his aides have been removed from office , " ariel segal , a lima-based expert on venezuela , told deutsche welle .
the arrest in of the three operatives of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , the al qaeda affiliate in west africa , further heightens concern about the islamists ' links to latin american traffickers .
the three mali nationals arrived in new york on december 18 after being arrested by authorities in ghana as a result of a four-month long sting operation in which two paid dea informants posed as farc representatives .
the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .
they told the undercover dea informants , according to court documents , that they could protect major latin american shipments of cocaine in the sahel and transport the drugs by truck through the desert and finally to spain .
they said they would charge up to 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,000 -rrb- per kilogram .

so has the arrest of three al qaeda operatives in ghana , who were charged with narco-terrrorism in new york after being handed over to the us drugs enforcement agency -lrb- dea -rrb- and transported to the united states .
the two incidents raise the specter of increased cooperation between islamic militants and drug trafficking latin american militants and , according to us law enforcement officials , al qae 'da 's evolvement into a global criminal organization .
us , european and african anti-drug and counter-terrorism officials fear that islamist cooperation with groups like the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- could significantly fill the coffers of rebels operating across a crucial swathe of land that includes algeria , morocco , mauretania , mali , chad and niger , rich in uranium as well as oil and gas .
enhanced cash flow could enable the rebels to further undermine already weak , authoritarian regimes that face widespread discontent , restive nomadic populations , extreme poverty and an influx of islamist thinking via satellite television and militant missionaries .
the wreckage of the boeing 727 was discovered in the mali desert in november , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of gao .
investigators believe the plane was carrying up to 10 tons of cocaine , the largest europe-bound latin american drugs transit shipment via the sahel so far known to authorities .
vehicle tracks in the sand have led the investigators to the conclusion that traffickers unloaded the plane 's cargo at a makeshift airstrip before burning it .
while they have not ruled out that the plane may have crashed , the investigators hope that three mali nationals arrested while dismantling the wreckage and transported to the mali capital of bamako may shed light on what happened to the aircraft .
venezuela turning a blind eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez has been turning a blind eye to drug-trafficking operations alexandre schmidt , spokesman for the vienna-based un office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- told journalists in november the mysterious flight had originated in venezuela , fuelling allegations that venezuela supports terrorism and drugs trafficking .
venezuelan officials question the assertion .
but critics of president hugo chavez , pointing to his support of the farc , charge that widespread corruption reaching into the highest echelons of government facilitates venezuelan involvement in drugs trafficking .
" chavez may not be involved , but he certainly looks the other way .
none of his aides have been removed from office , " ariel segal , a lima-based expert on venezuela , told deutsche welle .
the arrest in of the three operatives of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , the al qaeda affiliate in west africa , further heightens concern about the islamists ' links to latin american traffickers .
the three mali nationals arrived in new york on december 18 after being arrested by authorities in ghana as a result of a four-month long sting operation in which two paid dea informants posed as farc representatives .
the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .
they told the undercover dea informants , according to court documents , that they could protect major latin american shipments of cocaine in the sahel and transport the drugs by truck through the desert and finally to spain .
they said they would charge up to 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,000 -rrb- per kilogram .

us , european and african anti-drug and counter-terrorism officials fear that islamist cooperation with groups like the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- could significantly fill the coffers of rebels operating across a crucial swathe of land that includes algeria , morocco , mauretania , mali , chad and niger , rich in uranium as well as oil and gas .
enhanced cash flow could enable the rebels to further undermine already weak , authoritarian regimes that face widespread discontent , restive nomadic populations , extreme poverty and an influx of islamist thinking via satellite television and militant missionaries .
the wreckage of the boeing 727 was discovered in the mali desert in november , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of gao .
investigators believe the plane was carrying up to 10 tons of cocaine , the largest europe-bound latin american drugs transit shipment via the sahel so far known to authorities .
vehicle tracks in the sand have led the investigators to the conclusion that traffickers unloaded the plane 's cargo at a makeshift airstrip before burning it .
while they have not ruled out that the plane may have crashed , the investigators hope that three mali nationals arrested while dismantling the wreckage and transported to the mali capital of bamako may shed light on what happened to the aircraft .
venezuela turning a blind eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez has been turning a blind eye to drug-trafficking operations alexandre schmidt , spokesman for the vienna-based un office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- told journalists in november the mysterious flight had originated in venezuela , fuelling allegations that venezuela supports terrorism and drugs trafficking .
venezuelan officials question the assertion .
but critics of president hugo chavez , pointing to his support of the farc , charge that widespread corruption reaching into the highest echelons of government facilitates venezuelan involvement in drugs trafficking .
" chavez may not be involved , but he certainly looks the other way .
none of his aides have been removed from office , " ariel segal , a lima-based expert on venezuela , told deutsche welle .
the arrest in of the three operatives of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , the al qaeda affiliate in west africa , further heightens concern about the islamists ' links to latin american traffickers .
the three mali nationals arrived in new york on december 18 after being arrested by authorities in ghana as a result of a four-month long sting operation in which two paid dea informants posed as farc representatives .
the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .
they told the undercover dea informants , according to court documents , that they could protect major latin american shipments of cocaine in the sahel and transport the drugs by truck through the desert and finally to spain .
they said they would charge up to 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,000 -rrb- per kilogram .

lyman cautions that heavy handed operations could push nomadic tuareg rebels demanding a greater share in revenues from the region 's resources towards closer cooperation with aqim . he says the boeing 727 incident and the arrest of the al qaeda operatives demonstrates the need to focus on preventing drugs from getting into the sahel by patrolling the region 's coast line and airports rather than increasing military presence on the ground that would further alienate local populations .
" smuggling has a long tradition and constitutes a major source of income for groups that feel marginalized by their government … .political groups with narco money make it more difficult for governments to offer an alternative .

far from it , says the paper , much of what the us administration has begun just can not be done in 12 months , and obama will need luck to accomplish his goals in even one legislative period .

" while the president is by no means an american gorbachev - respected internationally , ridiculed at home - the frankfurt daily says , there is growing doubt ahead of congressional elections later this year that obama and his democrats will continue to hold all the power .

" obama has not reformed the healthcare system , has not brought climate legislation through congress , the iranian leadership has not adhered to the western concept of responsibility , and in afghanistan , a military turning point is not in sight .
guantanamo has n't been closed yet as promised , either , " writes business daily handelsblatt from dusseldorf .
does that mean he is a total failure ?
far from it , says the paper , much of what the us administration has begun just can not be done in 12 months , and obama will need luck to accomplish his goals in even one legislative period .
the berliner morgenpost daily concurs that , although only 46 percent of americans are satisfied with his work , obama should n't be judged by his first 12 months in office .
" obama can still become one of the great innovators in american history , " the paper says .
" he has unequalled self-confidence , which keeps him from changing policies just because of unfavorable surveys .
he is also blessed with a pragmatism that allows him not to be led into ideological dead ends . " a year ago , says the berlin paper , observers should have been more reserved in their expectations .
" today , let them be warned against making an assumption that is just as premature : that obama has failed . " obama underestimated the economic crisis , says the frankfurter rundschau .
but " his most momentous mistake was not remaining at the helm of his most important project , healthcare reforms . " while the president is by no means an american gorbachev - respected internationally , ridiculed at home - the frankfurt daily says , there is growing doubt ahead of congressional elections later this year that obama and his democrats will continue to hold all the power .
" the second year in office will not be any easier . "
marked by modesty , impartiality and a willingness to cooperate rather than making solitary decisions , obama 's new style has been of little use so far concerning the biggest global problems , " the muenchner merkur writes . the munich daily goes on to say that it would not be fair to condemn the president - after all millions of people only too gladly let their imaginations be fired by the " black superstar . "
" policy is not made primarily by good intentions , lofty gestures and brilliant rhetoric ; policy is clearly based on power and interests .
this is a reality even an obama ca n't suspend . "
reality has set in , the westfalenpost agrees .
however , the hagen-based daily believes that the young president has matured , remarking that he rarely smiles , that his face is often serious .
" the problems are too great .
the economic crisis , a backlash on climate policies , the costly war in afghanistan and the struggle for healthcare reforms have taken their toll on obama .
but what is even worse : america is losing its influence . " obama knew from the start that america could only tackle global crises along with other nations .

young new designers are fashion week 's last hope . it is that time of the year again as designers from around the world are busy packing their collections and beginning their bi-annual pilgrimage to the german capital .

a total of 30 fashion shows are planned to display the new trends for winter 2010/2011 .
in addition to trends from more established names such as boss , rene lange and strenesse blue , berlin has continued to draw in many fresh names such as the award-winning newcomers frida weyer and sam frenzel .
notable absences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfang joop has accused berlin fashion week of placing entertainment above art as for the established designers , two of germany 's oldest names are notable by their absence .
both karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop will not be there , instead preferring to showcase their work on the catwalk in paris .
joop has turned his back on the event after accusing the berlin fashion week of being too focused on glamour .
the creator of the wunderkind label claims it has become nothing more than a show for the media , filled with celebrities who are n't even interested in fashion .
" i would never put on a fashion show in the friedrichstadt palace , " said the german fashion icon , referring to the berlin event center where designer michael michalsky held a show during last summer 's fashion week .
" that 's just for entertainment value and fashion is supposed to be an art , " added joop , as reported by dpa .
the organizers of the fashion week , img fashion , disagree .
" i do n't think that it 's any different in paris , " img spokesman daniel aubke told deutsche welle .
" celebrities are also invited there and it 's no different in berlin . "
a center of creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the absence of big names such as karl lagerfeld , berlin is focusing on young designers aubke said that the lack of big names would n't reflect badly on the event .
" designers decide for a city that makes the most sense for them .
if they can reach their target audience better there than in a different city , then they will obviously show there . "
berlin , after all , has made up-and-coming designers its focus , so perhaps joop and lagerfeld do n't really fit in after all .
the german capital is often viewed as a bubbling cauldron of creativity and the show can capitalize on its home-grown talent of some 600 to 800 designers .
the city has already gained notoriety by concentrating on the work of exciting , talented and innovative young designers who continuously push the boundaries of creativity .
one of these is resident berlin designer sam frenzel , winner of the designer for tomorrow award at the show 's last outing .
this season , he 'll be displaying his first collection on the berlin catwalk .
one step at a time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show is developing step by step to perhaps one day rival fashion meccas such as paris by focusing on young newcomers , the berlin fashion week has developed a unique flavor that sets it apart from paris and milan .
but the event 's organizers say that berlin still is n't quite ready to go head-to-head with the major leaguers .
it 'll take time until berlin firmly establishes itself on the fashion map , but this process has already begun , says img fashion .
last season , the event attracted attention from around the world and drew fashion reporters from the new york times , the guardian , and vogue italy .
" we 've only been here since 2007 and it would be a bit presumptuous to say ' we want to have a comparable audience to paris , ' but we are trying to develop step by step , " said aubke .
change of venue for next year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week will bid farewell to bebelplatz for the final time this season an unforeseen step in this development was announced one day before launch amidst clouds of controversy over the show 's main venue .
bebelplatz is best known as being the site of the infamous book burnings held on may 10 , 1933 , where thousands of books were burnt by students and members of hitler 's national socialist party .
today , a glass window offering a view into a room filled with empty bookcases commemorates the event .
in an open letter addressed to berlin mayor klaus wowereit , campaigners labeled the fashion week a " trivial mass event " which has no place on bebelplatz .

the draft proposals will be debated in 17 separate sessions for each portfolio lasting until the end of the week .
in four hours of debate on wednesday , chancellor merkel will speak , along with all the parliamentary group leaders , the foreign minister , defense minister and finance minister .
the opposition generally uses this opportunity for a high-profile critique of the government in power .
the free democrats are pushing for more tax cuts and an overall simplification of germany 's complex tax code .
but the christian democrats are not sure what they can deliver amid low revenues and exploding expenditures .
the draft budget , outlined by finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , predicts the highest budget deficit in germany 's postwar history totalling nearly 86 billion euros -lrb- $ 123 billion -rrb- .
in addition , another 14.5 billion euros in fresh loans will be borrowed for a so-called shadow budget that is separate from the official federal budget . schaeuble called the borrowing " bitter but necessary . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has warned of tough times ahead the new level of debt reflected the global economic crisis , schaeuble said .
" we must proceed without being able to see very far ahead .
we are in the midst of a grave and unprecedented financial situation , " he added .
total expenditures this year are expected to reach approximately 325 billion euros , 33 billion euros more than last year .
the largest , single expenditure at nearly 147 billion euros is earmarked for social services .
with tax revenues sinking due to the sluggish economy , that would require the government to take out up to 100 billion euros in loans .
on a happier note , however , the institute for the wrold economy in kiel -lrb- ifw -rrb- has forecast that net new debt will not exceed 80 billion euros .
however , schaeuble warned that public expenditure would be cut in 2011 , and said " grave decisions lie ahead . " although the economy is expected to see growth of 1.5 percent , the government estimates that 3.7 million people will be unemployed this year .
the 2010 budget should be ready in march. gb / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two incidents raise the specter of increased cooperation between islamic militants and drug trafficking latin american militants and , according to us law enforcement officials , al qae 'da 's evolvement into a global criminal organization .
us , european and african anti-drug and counter-terrorism officials fear that islamist cooperation with groups like the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- could significantly fill the coffers of rebels operating across a crucial swathe of land that includes algeria , morocco , mauretania , mali , chad and niger , rich in uranium as well as oil and gas .

the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .

so has the arrest of three al qaeda operatives in ghana , who were charged with narco-terrrorism in new york after being handed over to the us drugs enforcement agency -lrb- dea -rrb- and transported to the united states .
the two incidents raise the specter of increased cooperation between islamic militants and drug trafficking latin american militants and , according to us law enforcement officials , al qae 'da 's evolvement into a global criminal organization .
us , european and african anti-drug and counter-terrorism officials fear that islamist cooperation with groups like the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- could significantly fill the coffers of rebels operating across a crucial swathe of land that includes algeria , morocco , mauretania , mali , chad and niger , rich in uranium as well as oil and gas .
enhanced cash flow could enable the rebels to further undermine already weak , authoritarian regimes that face widespread discontent , restive nomadic populations , extreme poverty and an influx of islamist thinking via satellite television and militant missionaries .
the wreckage of the boeing 727 was discovered in the mali desert in november , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of gao .
investigators believe the plane was carrying up to 10 tons of cocaine , the largest europe-bound latin american drugs transit shipment via the sahel so far known to authorities .
vehicle tracks in the sand have led the investigators to the conclusion that traffickers unloaded the plane 's cargo at a makeshift airstrip before burning it .
while they have not ruled out that the plane may have crashed , the investigators hope that three mali nationals arrested while dismantling the wreckage and transported to the mali capital of bamako may shed light on what happened to the aircraft .

venezuelan officials question the assertion .
but critics of president hugo chavez , pointing to his support of the farc , charge that widespread corruption reaching into the highest echelons of government facilitates venezuelan involvement in drugs trafficking .
" chavez may not be involved , but he certainly looks the other way .
none of his aides have been removed from office , " ariel segal , a lima-based expert on venezuela , told deutsche welle .
the arrest in of the three operatives of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , the al qaeda affiliate in west africa , further heightens concern about the islamists ' links to latin american traffickers .
the three mali nationals arrived in new york on december 18 after being arrested by authorities in ghana as a result of a four-month long sting operation in which two paid dea informants posed as farc representatives .
the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .
they told the undercover dea informants , according to court documents , that they could protect major latin american shipments of cocaine in the sahel and transport the drugs by truck through the desert and finally to spain .
they said they would charge up to 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,000 -rrb- per kilogram .

jean-pierre filiu , a professor at the paris institute of political studies , says algeria 's islamist salafist group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , aqim 's predecessor , has a history of involvement in crime .
aqim can " build on the gspc 's networks in the sahara desert , where it had long been engaged in smuggling a mix of drugs , weapons , and illegal immigrants , along with jihadi hit-and-run attacks against local security forces , " filiu said in a study just published by the carnegie endowment for peace . other experts note that many aqim recruits are criminals and fellow travelers , who operate like a gang .
since 2007 , aqim has killed scores in suicide bombings , including 11 un staffers four frenchmen , a brit and an american .
many more have been kidnapped and held for ransom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western intelligence services are struggling to stifle al qaeda 's growing reach in the sahel region the dea sting operation came amid an increased us and european military and law enforcement focus on the sahel .
encouraged by the us and the eu , military officials from algeria , mali , mauritania and niger agreed last fall on joint efforts to tackle terrorism and cross-border crime .
the us in 2008 increased security aid to $ 100 million .
much of this funding goes to the us africa command 's trans-saharan counter-terrorism partnership -lrb- tsctp -rrb- designed to train regional forces and furnish them with needed military materiel .
similarly , britain 's border agency and serious organized crime agency works with authorities in the region to fight drug traffickers .
europe facing major challenge the emergence of western and northern africa as a key hub in drugs trafficking poses despite the us sting operation a greater challenge to europe than it does to the united states , according to some experts .
" as the drugs fly from colombia , via venezuela to west africa then the expanding european-central european-asian markets , it is clear the u.s. market is no longer so relevant , " douglas farah , a washington-based expert on terrorism who focuses on the latin america-africa nexus , told deutsche welle .
critics of us and eu policy charge that the united states abetted by local regimes hungry for increased military and security assistance is likely to aggravate issues by approaching the region 's problems exclusively as a problem of global terrorism and trans-national crime rather than in terms of democratization and development .
" if you treat it from a soley security perspective , you 're producing more jihadists , " yahia h. zoubir , an expert on the sahel and professor of international relations at euromed-marseille , told deutsche welle .
that realization may be taking hold in washington as well as european capitals .
the africa command -lrb- africom -rrb- has begun focusing on relations with the tribes in a bid to minimize its overt involvement in security .
the us in late december suspended non-humanitarian aid to niger and imposed travel restrictions on government officials in response to president mamadou tandja 's refusal to relinquish his mandate . in an earlier , relatively rare emphasis on reform rather than security , the bush administration responded in 2008 to the toppling by the military of a democratically elected government in mauritania by suspending military aid to a junta that was touting the al qaeda threat as part of its raison d 'être .
weak regimes - soft targets bildunterschrift : analysts warn nonetheless that the drugs trade not only strengthens the islamists and rebels , but could turn already weak regimes into crime-driven enterprises .
" a lot of these countries have very weak governments and the potential of turning them into narco-states is very scary .
there is already a lot of drug money along the coast of west africa … lots of the fancy homes in -lrb- the senegalese capital of -rrb- dakar are now owned by drug lords , " princeton lyman , an africa expert at the new york-based council on foreign relations and former us ambassador to nigeria and south africa , told deutsche welle .
lyman cautions that heavy handed operations could push nomadic tuareg rebels demanding a greater share in revenues from the region 's resources towards closer cooperation with aqim . he says the boeing 727 incident and the arrest of the al qaeda operatives demonstrates the need to focus on preventing drugs from getting into the sahel by patrolling the region 's coast line and airports rather than increasing military presence on the ground that would further alienate local populations .
" smuggling has a long tradition and constitutes a major source of income for groups that feel marginalized by their government … .political groups with narco money make it more difficult for governments to offer an alternative .
the question is how do you separate the marginalized groups from aqim .
the way you do it is by stopping the drugs from getting in .
africom is looking at this , " lyman said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 20.01.2010 leading german lawmakers debate afghanistan strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers should get out of their vehicles more often , mcchrystal says comment by the isaf chief in afghanistan on germany 's role in the war-torn region has sparked debate among top politicians on where its future tasks should lie .
the opposition has called for a full withdrawal by 2015 . the commander of international forces in afghanistan , us general stanley mcchrystal , said german troops needed to establish more contact with the people .
otherwise , the soldiers - though physically present - were " essentially irrelevant , " he said in an interview with the mass circulation daily bild zeitung published wednesday .
germany 's defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said mcchrystal was naming the reality soldiers faced .
" i do n't see it as criticism , but rather as a description of the reality confronting the international community , " guttenberg told reporters in berlin .
" when he speaks about risks , then that is also a reality .
our soldiers are exposed to high risks every day . "
guttenberg did not comment on whether the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , would begin more patrols on foot in the future .

this had been a reaction to increased attacks on bundeswehr troops .
opposition wants full withdrawal former foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group , said ending germany 's activities in afghanistan should be tied to the reduction of the us presence there .
president barack obama has said the us will begin reducing its military activities in afghanistan from 2011 .
" we should n't lag behind , " steinmeier told the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
" the withdrawal of german soldiers should also begin in 2011 .
we have to now completely hand over the reasonably calm districts to the afghans . "
steinmeier said further steps should then be taken with other european countries .
" we have to come to an agreement with our most significant european partners to end our military commitment there between 2013 and 2015 , " he said .
this was " ambitious , but realistic . "
bildunterschrift : some 40,000 more troops are due to arrive in afghanistan from the us and its nato allies in 2010 but defense minister guttenberg said he disagreed .

foreign minister guido westerwelle also rejected demands for a speedy withdrawal of german troops .
" the international community can not afford to let this country make a false step or even fall , " westerwelle said .
" whoever would hastily leave afghanistan now would leave millions of people in the lurch and send many of them to a certain death at the hands of taliban executioners . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 20.01.2010 workplace bullying trial begins großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the verdict in the trial against siemens could set a precedent a former siemens employee , who says she was harassed and discriminated against , is seeking 2 million euros compensation .
experts say workplace bullying is a growing problem in germany . sedika weingaertner , who is suing her former employer siemens for 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.82 million -rrb- , headed to court in the german town of nuernberg on wednesday .
weingaertner claims she was bullied for years by her bosses and discriminated against for being a woman and an arab . " i was put under massive pressure and was subject to subtle forms of abuse .
i became so ill that i collapsed in the workplace and had to go to the hospital .
i almost died , " sedika weingaertner told the german daily tageszeitung .
" it 's like a trauma .
i do n't know if i can ever work again . "
labor experts and psychologists estimate that between 1 and 1.5 million people per day are victims of workplace bullying in germany .
however , many suffer in silence for fear of becoming unpopular at work , sabotaging their chances for advancement , or even losing their jobs .
weingaertner 's case could therefore set a major precedent .
weingaertner 's woes weingaertner began working for siemens , a german-based global engineering conglomerate , in 2002 , and was let go in the summer of 2009 .
aged 45 , weingaertner is petite and well-groomed .
she came to germany in 1991 as a single mother with three children after fleeing from afghanistan , where she had worked in the capital city , kabul , as a television journalist .
when she landed in nuernberg , she married a german man , quickly learned the language and started on a new career path .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say many german workers are subjected to bullying at work as a purchasing manager for siemens in 2001 , she oversaw international projects in china , india , and the us - a position for which she felt well-suited .
however , it did n't take long for the bullying to start , according to weingaertner .
at first the attacks were subtle .
for example , the workload was so heavy , she said , that she would regularly sit at her desk for ten straight hours to get through it all - even on holidays and weekends .
tucked alone inside a tiny office , she says nobody spoke to her .
then there was the time she needed a laptop , like the other employees had , as she was always on-the-go .
instead , she was given an old computer .
eventually , the attacks became more blatant .
weingaertner claims she was abused by her bosses , who called her names such as " dirt " , " sloppy " and " arab " .
however , the worst attack , said weingaertner , came in 2004 when she gave birth to her fourth child .
after twelve weeks of maternity leave she wanted to get back to the office .
but siemens did n't want her there .
her bosses asked her to sign an agreement to terminate her contract , but weingaertner refused .
the trial begins " harassment and discrimination cases are piling up , and people do n't know how they can defend themselves , " frank jansen , one of weingaertner 's lawyers , told the tageszeitung newspaper .
it can also be hard to prove .
before going ahead with her case , sedika weingaertner sought an expert opinion from herald ege , a psychologist in bologna .
he said he observed " serious psychosomatic reactions " from his patient and that " mental abuse is more powerful than physical abuse because the wound is always there . "
siemens ' press spokesperson joern rogenbuck has declined to comment on the case .
weingaertner 's lawyers , frank jansen and klaus michael alenfelder , believe the former siemen 's employee will ultimately win , but that it could be a long process , taking as long as five years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 20.01.2010 merkel defends german response to financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government defended its budget and deficit plans in parliament chancellor angela merkel on wednesday defended her government 's handling of the economic crisis and said the country 's record debt prevented germany from " falling into the abyss . " speaking in parliament on the second day of a four day session to debate her government 's 2010 budget proposals , chancellor angela merkel said plans to ramp up the country 's new debt by 86 billion euros -lrb- $ 123 billion -rrb- were " the right thing to do . "
germany is struggling to climb out of its worst recession since world war ii and has invested enormous sums to stimulate the country 's flagging economy .
defending that strategy , merkel said " we want germany to emerge stronger from this crisis than it was when it went in . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' we did the right thing ' said chancellor merkel " we have managed to do the right thing to prevent falling into the abyss .
as much as we would wish another situation , we are equally bound to look reality in the eye , " the chancellor said .
the draft budget , proposed by finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , foresees the highest deficit in germany 's post-war history .
total expenditures for 2010 are expected to reach some 325 billion euros ; 33 billion euros more than last year .
the largest , single outlay at nearly 147 billion euros is earmarked for social services .
schaeuble warned that public spending would be cut in 2011 and said " grave decisions lie ahead . "
responding to the government 's budget and tax-cut plans , opposition social democrat parliamentary leader , frank-walter steinmeier , accused the coalition of " complete and utter failure " in its first 100 days in office and of " having its head in the clouds . "
steinmeier said the government , in an attempt to satisfy its clientele , had " gambled away public trust " with its plans to cut taxes and trim programs , while spending more .

" germany will only be able to secure its prosperity when it remains a strong exporting country , " merkel said .
" what made us strong - the chemical and automobile industries , medical equipment , transport technology - must be continued and should never be given up , " she added .
merkel said the goal of her government was to bring the economy " intelligently out of the slump " and defended controversial tax cuts agreed on by her center-right coalition .
the chancellor said she aimed to have the economy back to its pre-crisis growth levels by 2013 .
the german economy contracted by 5 percent in 2009 .
later this month , the government is expected to officially revise its growth forecast upwards for 2010 , from 1.2 percent , to 1.5 percent .

" speaking in parliament on the second day of a four day session to debate her government 's 2010 budget proposals , chancellor angela merkel said plans to ramp up the country 's new debt by 86 billion euros -lrb- $ 123 billion -rrb- were " the right thing to do . "
germany is struggling to climb out of its worst recession since world war ii and has invested enormous sums to stimulate the country 's flagging economy .

" while the president is by no means an american gorbachev - respected internationally , ridiculed at home - the frankfurt daily says , there is growing doubt ahead of congressional elections later this year that obama and his democrats will continue to hold all the power .
" the second year in office will not be any easier . "

" today , let them be warned against making an assumption that is just as premature : that obama has failed . " obama underestimated the economic crisis , says the frankfurter rundschau .
but " his most momentous mistake was not remaining at the helm of his most important project , healthcare reforms . " while the president is by no means an american gorbachev - respected internationally , ridiculed at home - the frankfurt daily says , there is growing doubt ahead of congressional elections later this year that obama and his democrats will continue to hold all the power .
" the second year in office will not be any easier . "
marked by modesty , impartiality and a willingness to cooperate rather than making solitary decisions , obama 's new style has been of little use so far concerning the biggest global problems , " the muenchner merkur writes . the munich daily goes on to say that it would not be fair to condemn the president - after all millions of people only too gladly let their imaginations be fired by the " black superstar . "
" policy is not made primarily by good intentions , lofty gestures and brilliant rhetoric ; policy is clearly based on power and interests .
this is a reality even an obama ca n't suspend . "
reality has set in , the westfalenpost agrees .
however , the hagen-based daily believes that the young president has matured , remarking that he rarely smiles , that his face is often serious .
" the problems are too great .
the economic crisis , a backlash on climate policies , the costly war in afghanistan and the struggle for healthcare reforms have taken their toll on obama .
but what is even worse : america is losing its influence . " obama knew from the start that america could only tackle global crises along with other nations .
" which is why we europeans , especially we germans , should be glad to have this president at our side , " says the paper. db / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the government has recently decided to extend nuclear power . the figures are based on the foundation 's ' nuclear power atlas , ' which counts the number of people living within a 150-kilometer -lrb- 93-mile -rrb- radius of each of the 17 nuclear power stations in germany - putting them in immediate danger in the event of a nuclear accident .
between 5.4 million and 11.8 million people were counted within the various zones , which cover most of the western and southern regions of germany .
the city of bremen , within 150 kilometers of six nuclear powers stations , is particularly at risk .
according to a foundation statement , the numbers are considered conservative , as " in the case of a big accident a lot more people could be affected by the radioactive fallout . "
foundation board member hans guenter schumacher concluded , " it 's not just irresponsible , but inhuman that nuclear power stations continue to be operated in a country as densely populated as germany when millions of people could be endangered by an accident . "

details are to be negotiated in the coming months .
but the foundation called for the seven oldest german nuclear power stations to be closed immediately : biblis a and b in hesse , brunsbuettel in schleswig-holstein , neckarwestheim 1 und philippsburg 1 in baden-wuerttemberg , isar 1 in bavaria und unterweser in lower saxony .
the environmental group also demanded that renewable energy be given priority in the law-making process .
chancellor angela merkel has invited the chairmen of the main german energy companies , eon , rwe , enbw and vattenfall , to her office on thursday for a meeting to discuss the country 's energy policy .
the state intends to take some energy company profits and invest them in the development of solar , water and wind power. bk / afp / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the draft proposals will be debated in 17 separate sessions for each portfolio lasting until the end of the week .
in four hours of debate on wednesday , chancellor merkel will speak , along with all the parliamentary group leaders , the foreign minister , defense minister and finance minister .
the opposition generally uses this opportunity for a high-profile critique of the government in power .
the free democrats are pushing for more tax cuts and an overall simplification of germany 's complex tax code .
but the christian democrats are not sure what they can deliver amid low revenues and exploding expenditures .
the draft budget , outlined by finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , predicts the highest budget deficit in germany 's postwar history totalling nearly 86 billion euros -lrb- $ 123 billion -rrb- .
in addition , another 14.5 billion euros in fresh loans will be borrowed for a so-called shadow budget that is separate from the official federal budget . schaeuble called the borrowing " bitter but necessary . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has warned of tough times ahead the new level of debt reflected the global economic crisis , schaeuble said .
" we must proceed without being able to see very far ahead .
we are in the midst of a grave and unprecedented financial situation , " he added .
total expenditures this year are expected to reach approximately 325 billion euros , 33 billion euros more than last year .
the largest , single expenditure at nearly 147 billion euros is earmarked for social services .
with tax revenues sinking due to the sluggish economy , that would require the government to take out up to 100 billion euros in loans .
on a happier note , however , the institute for the wrold economy in kiel -lrb- ifw -rrb- has forecast that net new debt will not exceed 80 billion euros .
however , schaeuble warned that public expenditure would be cut in 2011 , and said " grave decisions lie ahead . " although the economy is expected to see growth of 1.5 percent , the government estimates that 3.7 million people will be unemployed this year .

it 's lost its top designers and taken flack for the nazi history of the fashion show 's location .
young new designers are fashion week 's last hope . it is that time of the year again as designers from around the world are busy packing their collections and beginning their bi-annual pilgrimage to the german capital .
berlin fashion week returns for its sixth outing from january 20-23 and promises to build on past success .
a total of 30 fashion shows are planned to display the new trends for winter 2010/2011 .
in addition to trends from more established names such as boss , rene lange and strenesse blue , berlin has continued to draw in many fresh names such as the award-winning newcomers frida weyer and sam frenzel .
notable absences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfang joop has accused berlin fashion week of placing entertainment above art as for the established designers , two of germany 's oldest names are notable by their absence .
both karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop will not be there , instead preferring to showcase their work on the catwalk in paris .
joop has turned his back on the event after accusing the berlin fashion week of being too focused on glamour .
the creator of the wunderkind label claims it has become nothing more than a show for the media , filled with celebrities who are n't even interested in fashion .
" i would never put on a fashion show in the friedrichstadt palace , " said the german fashion icon , referring to the berlin event center where designer michael michalsky held a show during last summer 's fashion week .
" that 's just for entertainment value and fashion is supposed to be an art , " added joop , as reported by dpa .
the organizers of the fashion week , img fashion , disagree .
" i do n't think that it 's any different in paris , " img spokesman daniel aubke told deutsche welle .
" celebrities are also invited there and it 's no different in berlin . "
a center of creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the absence of big names such as karl lagerfeld , berlin is focusing on young designers aubke said that the lack of big names would n't reflect badly on the event .
" designers decide for a city that makes the most sense for them .
if they can reach their target audience better there than in a different city , then they will obviously show there . "
berlin , after all , has made up-and-coming designers its focus , so perhaps joop and lagerfeld do n't really fit in after all .
the german capital is often viewed as a bubbling cauldron of creativity and the show can capitalize on its home-grown talent of some 600 to 800 designers .
the city has already gained notoriety by concentrating on the work of exciting , talented and innovative young designers who continuously push the boundaries of creativity .
one of these is resident berlin designer sam frenzel , winner of the designer for tomorrow award at the show 's last outing .
this season , he 'll be displaying his first collection on the berlin catwalk .
one step at a time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show is developing step by step to perhaps one day rival fashion meccas such as paris by focusing on young newcomers , the berlin fashion week has developed a unique flavor that sets it apart from paris and milan .
but the event 's organizers say that berlin still is n't quite ready to go head-to-head with the major leaguers .
it 'll take time until berlin firmly establishes itself on the fashion map , but this process has already begun , says img fashion .
last season , the event attracted attention from around the world and drew fashion reporters from the new york times , the guardian , and vogue italy .
" we 've only been here since 2007 and it would be a bit presumptuous to say ' we want to have a comparable audience to paris , ' but we are trying to develop step by step , " said aubke .
change of venue for next year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week will bid farewell to bebelplatz for the final time this season an unforeseen step in this development was announced one day before launch amidst clouds of controversy over the show 's main venue .
bebelplatz is best known as being the site of the infamous book burnings held on may 10 , 1933 , where thousands of books were burnt by students and members of hitler 's national socialist party .
today , a glass window offering a view into a room filled with empty bookcases commemorates the event .
in an open letter addressed to berlin mayor klaus wowereit , campaigners labeled the fashion week a " trivial mass event " which has no place on bebelplatz .
in response , img fashion promised to find a different venue to showcase the year 's summer trends in july . author : andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

karel de gucht hopes to gain insight into how eu aid can be most efficiently used in rebuilding the earthquake-struck nation . the european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid karel de gucht is expected in haiti on thursday morning , where he will assess the current and future allocation of relief aid coming from the european bloc .
" his visit will be an opportunity to assess the immediate life-saving humanitarian aid needs , as well as the medium and long-term requirements for reconstruction and rehabilitation of the country , " the european commission said in a statement released wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gucht said members of the european parliament did not recognize efforts in haiti by eu member states de gucht will also meet with haitian and un authorities , as well as the main aid representatives on the scene , to discuss the coordination of the overall relief effort , the commission said .
he will remain until late friday .
earlier this week , the commissioner told the european parliament in strasbourg how he assessed the situation in haiti .
" it is not only about rescuing human lives , but rescuing a country as a whole " , de gucht told the parliamentarians .
members of international organizations had also fallen victim to the catastrophe .
this made it more difficult to organize aid on the spot .
urgent medical , technical and logistic help were needed to avoid further risks such as an outbreak of cholera , he said .
overall , the commission and eu member states have pledged more than 422 million euros -lrb- $ 595 million -rrb- in immediate humanitarian relief and longer-term reconstruction aid .
eu-us coordination in the works meanwhile , the eu 's new foreign policy chief catherine ashton headed to washington on wednesday , as a strong aftershock measuring 6.1 on the richter scale rocked haiti .
ashton will meet with us secretary of state hillary clinton and then head to new york for talks with un secretary general ban ki-moon .
she had previously been sharply criticized by center-right and liberal deputies in the eu parliament for not heading straight to haiti , as clinton and some european officials had already done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton met with haiti 's president rene preval in port-au-prince on saturday " just about everybody was in haiti at the moment when these people are suffering , and europe was not present , " said joseph daul , head of the center-right group in the parliament .
" if it would have been in our hands , we would have sent someone . "
green group leader daniel cohn-bendit said the eu should not have been acting " on the sidelines . "
" if i was the high representative faced with a disaster of this scope , i 'd get on the first plane and then come back and tell the europeans what we should be doing , " cohn-bendit said .
" i think that is the basic minimum . "
but ashton defended her actions to parliamentarians .
" i had nothing to contribute on the ground other than taking up valuable space when planes were unable to land because of the state of the airfield , " she said .
" i am not a doctor , nor a fire fighter .
my place was to bring together co-ordination at eu level and with the un . "
de gucht said parliament should be more generous in recognizing the efforts put in place by the eu 's executive and its member states .
he said meps did " not pay enough tribute to all the people who have been working since day one in brussels and on the spot . "
eu foreign ministers will be meeting on brussels on monday , with haiti expected to be high on the agenda .
eu leaders will hold an additional summit on february 11 , with aid to haiti one of the discussion points. sac / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier this week , the commissioner told the european parliament in strasbourg how he assessed the situation in haiti .
" it is not only about rescuing human lives , but rescuing a country as a whole " , de gucht told the parliamentarians .
members of international organizations had also fallen victim to the catastrophe .
this made it more difficult to organize aid on the spot .
urgent medical , technical and logistic help were needed to avoid further risks such as an outbreak of cholera , he said .
overall , the commission and eu member states have pledged more than 422 million euros -lrb- $ 595 million -rrb- in immediate humanitarian relief and longer-term reconstruction aid .
eu-us coordination in the works meanwhile , the eu 's new foreign policy chief catherine ashton headed to washington on wednesday , as a strong aftershock measuring 6.1 on the richter scale rocked haiti .
ashton will meet with us secretary of state hillary clinton and then head to new york for talks with un secretary general ban ki-moon .
she had previously been sharply criticized by center-right and liberal deputies in the eu parliament for not heading straight to haiti , as clinton and some european officials had already done .

green group leader daniel cohn-bendit said the eu should not have been acting " on the sidelines . "
" if i was the high representative faced with a disaster of this scope , i 'd get on the first plane and then come back and tell the europeans what we should be doing , " cohn-bendit said .
" i think that is the basic minimum . "
but ashton defended her actions to parliamentarians .
" i had nothing to contribute on the ground other than taking up valuable space when planes were unable to land because of the state of the airfield , " she said .
" i am not a doctor , nor a fire fighter .
my place was to bring together co-ordination at eu level and with the un . "
de gucht said parliament should be more generous in recognizing the efforts put in place by the eu 's executive and its member states .
he said meps did " not pay enough tribute to all the people who have been working since day one in brussels and on the spot . "

jean-pierre filiu , a professor at the paris institute of political studies , says algeria 's islamist salafist group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , aqim 's predecessor , has a history of involvement in crime .
aqim can " build on the gspc 's networks in the sahara desert , where it had long been engaged in smuggling a mix of drugs , weapons , and illegal immigrants , along with jihadi hit-and-run attacks against local security forces , " filiu said in a study just published by the carnegie endowment for peace . other experts note that many aqim recruits are criminals and fellow travelers , who operate like a gang .
since 2007 , aqim has killed scores in suicide bombings , including 11 un staffers four frenchmen , a brit and an american .
many more have been kidnapped and held for ransom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western intelligence services are struggling to stifle al qaeda 's growing reach in the sahel region the dea sting operation came amid an increased us and european military and law enforcement focus on the sahel .
encouraged by the us and the eu , military officials from algeria , mali , mauritania and niger agreed last fall on joint efforts to tackle terrorism and cross-border crime .
the us in 2008 increased security aid to $ 100 million .
much of this funding goes to the us africa command 's trans-saharan counter-terrorism partnership -lrb- tsctp -rrb- designed to train regional forces and furnish them with needed military materiel .
similarly , britain 's border agency and serious organized crime agency works with authorities in the region to fight drug traffickers .
europe facing major challenge the emergence of western and northern africa as a key hub in drugs trafficking poses despite the us sting operation a greater challenge to europe than it does to the united states , according to some experts .
" as the drugs fly from colombia , via venezuela to west africa then the expanding european-central european-asian markets , it is clear the u.s. market is no longer so relevant , " douglas farah , a washington-based expert on terrorism who focuses on the latin america-africa nexus , told deutsche welle .
critics of us and eu policy charge that the united states abetted by local regimes hungry for increased military and security assistance is likely to aggravate issues by approaching the region 's problems exclusively as a problem of global terrorism and trans-national crime rather than in terms of democratization and development .
" if you treat it from a soley security perspective , you 're producing more jihadists , " yahia h. zoubir , an expert on the sahel and professor of international relations at euromed-marseille , told deutsche welle .
that realization may be taking hold in washington as well as european capitals .
the africa command -lrb- africom -rrb- has begun focusing on relations with the tribes in a bid to minimize its overt involvement in security .
the us in late december suspended non-humanitarian aid to niger and imposed travel restrictions on government officials in response to president mamadou tandja 's refusal to relinquish his mandate . in an earlier , relatively rare emphasis on reform rather than security , the bush administration responded in 2008 to the toppling by the military of a democratically elected government in mauritania by suspending military aid to a junta that was touting the al qaeda threat as part of its raison d 'être .
weak regimes - soft targets bildunterschrift : analysts warn nonetheless that the drugs trade not only strengthens the islamists and rebels , but could turn already weak regimes into crime-driven enterprises .
" a lot of these countries have very weak governments and the potential of turning them into narco-states is very scary .
there is already a lot of drug money along the coast of west africa … lots of the fancy homes in -lrb- the senegalese capital of -rrb- dakar are now owned by drug lords , " princeton lyman , an africa expert at the new york-based council on foreign relations and former us ambassador to nigeria and south africa , told deutsche welle .
lyman cautions that heavy handed operations could push nomadic tuareg rebels demanding a greater share in revenues from the region 's resources towards closer cooperation with aqim . he says the boeing 727 incident and the arrest of the al qaeda operatives demonstrates the need to focus on preventing drugs from getting into the sahel by patrolling the region 's coast line and airports rather than increasing military presence on the ground that would further alienate local populations .
" smuggling has a long tradition and constitutes a major source of income for groups that feel marginalized by their government … .political groups with narco money make it more difficult for governments to offer an alternative .
the question is how do you separate the marginalized groups from aqim .
the way you do it is by stopping the drugs from getting in .
africom is looking at this , " lyman said .

jean-pierre filiu , a professor at the paris institute of political studies , says algeria 's islamist salafist group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , aqim 's predecessor , has a history of involvement in crime .
aqim can " build on the gspc 's networks in the sahara desert , where it had long been engaged in smuggling a mix of drugs , weapons , and illegal immigrants , along with jihadi hit-and-run attacks against local security forces , " filiu said in a study just published by the carnegie endowment for peace . other experts note that many aqim recruits are criminals and fellow travelers , who operate like a gang .
since 2007 , aqim has killed scores in suicide bombings , including 11 un staffers four frenchmen , a brit and an american .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western intelligence services are struggling to stifle al qaeda 's growing reach in the sahel region the dea sting operation came amid an increased us and european military and law enforcement focus on the sahel .
encouraged by the us and the eu , military officials from algeria , mali , mauritania and niger agreed last fall on joint efforts to tackle terrorism and cross-border crime .
the us in 2008 increased security aid to $ 100 million .
much of this funding goes to the us africa command 's trans-saharan counter-terrorism partnership -lrb- tsctp -rrb- designed to train regional forces and furnish them with needed military materiel .
similarly , britain 's border agency and serious organized crime agency works with authorities in the region to fight drug traffickers .
europe facing major challenge the emergence of western and northern africa as a key hub in drugs trafficking poses despite the us sting operation a greater challenge to europe than it does to the united states , according to some experts .
" as the drugs fly from colombia , via venezuela to west africa then the expanding european-central european-asian markets , it is clear the u.s. market is no longer so relevant , " douglas farah , a washington-based expert on terrorism who focuses on the latin america-africa nexus , told deutsche welle .
critics of us and eu policy charge that the united states abetted by local regimes hungry for increased military and security assistance is likely to aggravate issues by approaching the region 's problems exclusively as a problem of global terrorism and trans-national crime rather than in terms of democratization and development .
" if you treat it from a soley security perspective , you 're producing more jihadists , " yahia h. zoubir , an expert on the sahel and professor of international relations at euromed-marseille , told deutsche welle .
that realization may be taking hold in washington as well as european capitals .
the africa command -lrb- africom -rrb- has begun focusing on relations with the tribes in a bid to minimize its overt involvement in security .
the us in late december suspended non-humanitarian aid to niger and imposed travel restrictions on government officials in response to president mamadou tandja 's refusal to relinquish his mandate . in an earlier , relatively rare emphasis on reform rather than security , the bush administration responded in 2008 to the toppling by the military of a democratically elected government in mauritania by suspending military aid to a junta that was touting the al qaeda threat as part of its raison d 'être .
weak regimes - soft targets bildunterschrift : analysts warn nonetheless that the drugs trade not only strengthens the islamists and rebels , but could turn already weak regimes into crime-driven enterprises .
" a lot of these countries have very weak governments and the potential of turning them into narco-states is very scary .
there is already a lot of drug money along the coast of west africa … lots of the fancy homes in -lrb- the senegalese capital of -rrb- dakar are now owned by drug lords , " princeton lyman , an africa expert at the new york-based council on foreign relations and former us ambassador to nigeria and south africa , told deutsche welle .
lyman cautions that heavy handed operations could push nomadic tuareg rebels demanding a greater share in revenues from the region 's resources towards closer cooperation with aqim . he says the boeing 727 incident and the arrest of the al qaeda operatives demonstrates the need to focus on preventing drugs from getting into the sahel by patrolling the region 's coast line and airports rather than increasing military presence on the ground that would further alienate local populations .
" smuggling has a long tradition and constitutes a major source of income for groups that feel marginalized by their government … .political groups with narco money make it more difficult for governments to offer an alternative .
the question is how do you separate the marginalized groups from aqim .
the way you do it is by stopping the drugs from getting in .
africom is looking at this , " lyman said .

so has the arrest of three al qaeda operatives in ghana , who were charged with narco-terrrorism in new york after being handed over to the us drugs enforcement agency -lrb- dea -rrb- and transported to the united states .
the two incidents raise the specter of increased cooperation between islamic militants and drug trafficking latin american militants and , according to us law enforcement officials , al qae 'da 's evolvement into a global criminal organization .
us , european and african anti-drug and counter-terrorism officials fear that islamist cooperation with groups like the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- could significantly fill the coffers of rebels operating across a crucial swathe of land that includes algeria , morocco , mauretania , mali , chad and niger , rich in uranium as well as oil and gas .
enhanced cash flow could enable the rebels to further undermine already weak , authoritarian regimes that face widespread discontent , restive nomadic populations , extreme poverty and an influx of islamist thinking via satellite television and militant missionaries .
the wreckage of the boeing 727 was discovered in the mali desert in november , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of gao .
investigators believe the plane was carrying up to 10 tons of cocaine , the largest europe-bound latin american drugs transit shipment via the sahel so far known to authorities .
vehicle tracks in the sand have led the investigators to the conclusion that traffickers unloaded the plane 's cargo at a makeshift airstrip before burning it .
while they have not ruled out that the plane may have crashed , the investigators hope that three mali nationals arrested while dismantling the wreckage and transported to the mali capital of bamako may shed light on what happened to the aircraft .
venezuela turning a blind eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez has been turning a blind eye to drug-trafficking operations alexandre schmidt , spokesman for the vienna-based un office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- told journalists in november the mysterious flight had originated in venezuela , fuelling allegations that venezuela supports terrorism and drugs trafficking .
venezuelan officials question the assertion .
but critics of president hugo chavez , pointing to his support of the farc , charge that widespread corruption reaching into the highest echelons of government facilitates venezuelan involvement in drugs trafficking .
" chavez may not be involved , but he certainly looks the other way .
none of his aides have been removed from office , " ariel segal , a lima-based expert on venezuela , told deutsche welle .
the arrest in of the three operatives of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , the al qaeda affiliate in west africa , further heightens concern about the islamists ' links to latin american traffickers .
the three mali nationals arrived in new york on december 18 after being arrested by authorities in ghana as a result of a four-month long sting operation in which two paid dea informants posed as farc representatives .
the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .
they told the undercover dea informants , according to court documents , that they could protect major latin american shipments of cocaine in the sahel and transport the drugs by truck through the desert and finally to spain .
they said they would charge up to 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,000 -rrb- per kilogram .

there 's been plenty of talk of sanctions or fines , but bos dismissed the idea and said that he had confidence in the greek government .
" the new government has only been in place for a few months now , so they need some time to create public support for some very tough measures to be taken , " he added .
keeping an eye on greece the tough measures proposed by greece include an overhaul of the tax system , spending cuts , a hiring freeze on civil servants and salary caps for the highly-paid .
greece has pledged to bring its 12.7 percent budget deficit down to 8.7 percent in the first year of a three-year crackdown .
the eu 's economic affairs commissioner , joaquim almunia , said the measures were adequate , for now , but the european commission will study the plan intensively over the next two weeks , before deciding whether to demand changes .
he said the commission wanted updates on how greece was progressing every three months .
and a plan is in the works to hand auditing powers to the eu 's statistics office , eurostat , which would also deploy a permanent representative to a new national statistics agency in greece. mrm / ap / dpa editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the arrest in of the three operatives of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , the al qaeda affiliate in west africa , further heightens concern about the islamists ' links to latin american traffickers .

the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 20.01.2010 berlin takes to the catwalk without joop and lagerfeld großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fashion show is like an art exhibition , says designer joop berlin is vying for the spotlight on the international fashion stage .
it 's lost its top designers and taken flack for the nazi history of the fashion show 's location .
young new designers are fashion week 's last hope . it is that time of the year again as designers from around the world are busy packing their collections and beginning their bi-annual pilgrimage to the german capital .
berlin fashion week returns for its sixth outing from january 20-23 and promises to build on past success .
a total of 30 fashion shows are planned to display the new trends for winter 2010/2011 .
in addition to trends from more established names such as boss , rene lange and strenesse blue , berlin has continued to draw in many fresh names such as the award-winning newcomers frida weyer and sam frenzel .
notable absences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfang joop has accused berlin fashion week of placing entertainment above art as for the established designers , two of germany 's oldest names are notable by their absence .
both karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop will not be there , instead preferring to showcase their work on the catwalk in paris .
joop has turned his back on the event after accusing the berlin fashion week of being too focused on glamour .
the creator of the wunderkind label claims it has become nothing more than a show for the media , filled with celebrities who are n't even interested in fashion .
" i would never put on a fashion show in the friedrichstadt palace , " said the german fashion icon , referring to the berlin event center where designer michael michalsky held a show during last summer 's fashion week .
" that 's just for entertainment value and fashion is supposed to be an art , " added joop , as reported by dpa .
the organizers of the fashion week , img fashion , disagree .
" i do n't think that it 's any different in paris , " img spokesman daniel aubke told deutsche welle .
" celebrities are also invited there and it 's no different in berlin . "
a center of creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the absence of big names such as karl lagerfeld , berlin is focusing on young designers aubke said that the lack of big names would n't reflect badly on the event .
" designers decide for a city that makes the most sense for them .
if they can reach their target audience better there than in a different city , then they will obviously show there . "
berlin , after all , has made up-and-coming designers its focus , so perhaps joop and lagerfeld do n't really fit in after all .
the german capital is often viewed as a bubbling cauldron of creativity and the show can capitalize on its home-grown talent of some 600 to 800 designers .
the city has already gained notoriety by concentrating on the work of exciting , talented and innovative young designers who continuously push the boundaries of creativity .
one of these is resident berlin designer sam frenzel , winner of the designer for tomorrow award at the show 's last outing .
this season , he 'll be displaying his first collection on the berlin catwalk .
one step at a time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show is developing step by step to perhaps one day rival fashion meccas such as paris by focusing on young newcomers , the berlin fashion week has developed a unique flavor that sets it apart from paris and milan .
but the event 's organizers say that berlin still is n't quite ready to go head-to-head with the major leaguers .
it 'll take time until berlin firmly establishes itself on the fashion map , but this process has already begun , says img fashion .
last season , the event attracted attention from around the world and drew fashion reporters from the new york times , the guardian , and vogue italy .
" we 've only been here since 2007 and it would be a bit presumptuous to say ' we want to have a comparable audience to paris , ' but we are trying to develop step by step , " said aubke .
change of venue for next year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week will bid farewell to bebelplatz for the final time this season an unforeseen step in this development was announced one day before launch amidst clouds of controversy over the show 's main venue .
bebelplatz is best known as being the site of the infamous book burnings held on may 10 , 1933 , where thousands of books were burnt by students and members of hitler 's national socialist party .
today , a glass window offering a view into a room filled with empty bookcases commemorates the event .
in an open letter addressed to berlin mayor klaus wowereit , campaigners labeled the fashion week a " trivial mass event " which has no place on bebelplatz .
in response , img fashion promised to find a different venue to showcase the year 's summer trends in july . author : andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's lost its top designers and taken flack for the nazi history of the fashion show 's location .
young new designers are fashion week 's last hope . it is that time of the year again as designers from around the world are busy packing their collections and beginning their bi-annual pilgrimage to the german capital .
berlin fashion week returns for its sixth outing from january 20-23 and promises to build on past success .
a total of 30 fashion shows are planned to display the new trends for winter 2010/2011 .
in addition to trends from more established names such as boss , rene lange and strenesse blue , berlin has continued to draw in many fresh names such as the award-winning newcomers frida weyer and sam frenzel .
notable absences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfang joop has accused berlin fashion week of placing entertainment above art as for the established designers , two of germany 's oldest names are notable by their absence .
both karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop will not be there , instead preferring to showcase their work on the catwalk in paris .
joop has turned his back on the event after accusing the berlin fashion week of being too focused on glamour .
the creator of the wunderkind label claims it has become nothing more than a show for the media , filled with celebrities who are n't even interested in fashion .
" i would never put on a fashion show in the friedrichstadt palace , " said the german fashion icon , referring to the berlin event center where designer michael michalsky held a show during last summer 's fashion week .
" that 's just for entertainment value and fashion is supposed to be an art , " added joop , as reported by dpa .
the organizers of the fashion week , img fashion , disagree .
" i do n't think that it 's any different in paris , " img spokesman daniel aubke told deutsche welle .
" celebrities are also invited there and it 's no different in berlin . "
a center of creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the absence of big names such as karl lagerfeld , berlin is focusing on young designers aubke said that the lack of big names would n't reflect badly on the event .
" designers decide for a city that makes the most sense for them .
if they can reach their target audience better there than in a different city , then they will obviously show there . "
berlin , after all , has made up-and-coming designers its focus , so perhaps joop and lagerfeld do n't really fit in after all .
the german capital is often viewed as a bubbling cauldron of creativity and the show can capitalize on its home-grown talent of some 600 to 800 designers .
the city has already gained notoriety by concentrating on the work of exciting , talented and innovative young designers who continuously push the boundaries of creativity .
one of these is resident berlin designer sam frenzel , winner of the designer for tomorrow award at the show 's last outing .
this season , he 'll be displaying his first collection on the berlin catwalk .
one step at a time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show is developing step by step to perhaps one day rival fashion meccas such as paris by focusing on young newcomers , the berlin fashion week has developed a unique flavor that sets it apart from paris and milan .
but the event 's organizers say that berlin still is n't quite ready to go head-to-head with the major leaguers .
it 'll take time until berlin firmly establishes itself on the fashion map , but this process has already begun , says img fashion .
last season , the event attracted attention from around the world and drew fashion reporters from the new york times , the guardian , and vogue italy .
" we 've only been here since 2007 and it would be a bit presumptuous to say ' we want to have a comparable audience to paris , ' but we are trying to develop step by step , " said aubke .

in an open letter addressed to berlin mayor klaus wowereit , campaigners labeled the fashion week a " trivial mass event " which has no place on bebelplatz .

but the government has recently decided to extend nuclear power . the figures are based on the foundation 's ' nuclear power atlas , ' which counts the number of people living within a 150-kilometer -lrb- 93-mile -rrb- radius of each of the 17 nuclear power stations in germany - putting them in immediate danger in the event of a nuclear accident .
between 5.4 million and 11.8 million people were counted within the various zones , which cover most of the western and southern regions of germany .
the city of bremen , within 150 kilometers of six nuclear powers stations , is particularly at risk .
according to a foundation statement , the numbers are considered conservative , as " in the case of a big accident a lot more people could be affected by the radioactive fallout . "
foundation board member hans guenter schumacher concluded , " it 's not just irresponsible , but inhuman that nuclear power stations continue to be operated in a country as densely populated as germany when millions of people could be endangered by an accident . "

but the foundation called for the seven oldest german nuclear power stations to be closed immediately : biblis a and b in hesse , brunsbuettel in schleswig-holstein , neckarwestheim 1 und philippsburg 1 in baden-wuerttemberg , isar 1 in bavaria und unterweser in lower saxony .
the environmental group also demanded that renewable energy be given priority in the law-making process .
chancellor angela merkel has invited the chairmen of the main german energy companies , eon , rwe , enbw and vattenfall , to her office on thursday for a meeting to discuss the country 's energy policy .
the state intends to take some energy company profits and invest them in the development of solar , water and wind power. bk / afp / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" obama can still become one of the great innovators in american history , " the paper says .
" he has unequalled self-confidence , which keeps him from changing policies just because of unfavorable surveys .
he is also blessed with a pragmatism that allows him not to be led into ideological dead ends . " a year ago , says the berlin paper , observers should have been more reserved in their expectations .

" while the president is by no means an american gorbachev - respected internationally , ridiculed at home - the frankfurt daily says , there is growing doubt ahead of congressional elections later this year that obama and his democrats will continue to hold all the power .
" the second year in office will not be any easier . "
marked by modesty , impartiality and a willingness to cooperate rather than making solitary decisions , obama 's new style has been of little use so far concerning the biggest global problems , " the muenchner merkur writes . the munich daily goes on to say that it would not be fair to condemn the president - after all millions of people only too gladly let their imaginations be fired by the " black superstar .

the city of bremen , within 150 kilometers of six nuclear powers stations , is particularly at risk .
according to a foundation statement , the numbers are considered conservative , as " in the case of a big accident a lot more people could be affected by the radioactive fallout . "
foundation board member hans guenter schumacher concluded , " it 's not just irresponsible , but inhuman that nuclear power stations continue to be operated in a country as densely populated as germany when millions of people could be endangered by an accident . "

details are to be negotiated in the coming months .
but the foundation called for the seven oldest german nuclear power stations to be closed immediately : biblis a and b in hesse , brunsbuettel in schleswig-holstein , neckarwestheim 1 und philippsburg 1 in baden-wuerttemberg , isar 1 in bavaria und unterweser in lower saxony .
the environmental group also demanded that renewable energy be given priority in the law-making process .
chancellor angela merkel has invited the chairmen of the main german energy companies , eon , rwe , enbw and vattenfall , to her office on thursday for a meeting to discuss the country 's energy policy .
the state intends to take some energy company profits and invest them in the development of solar , water and wind power. bk / afp / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greece 's budget deficit is mushrooming , at 12.7 percent of its national economy .
and its debt keeps growing , threatening the economic stability of the entire euro zone .
the 16-nation euro was worth $ 1.4210 in european trading on wednesday morning , down from the $ 1.4292 late tuesday in new york .

arriving for talks in brussels on tuesday , dutch finance minister wouter bos told reporters greece was on its own .
" i think the greeks are very much aware of how serious the situation is , and i think that they are also very much aware that they will in the end have to solve this problem themselves , " he said .
there 's been plenty of talk of sanctions or fines , but bos dismissed the idea and said that he had confidence in the greek government .
" the new government has only been in place for a few months now , so they need some time to create public support for some very tough measures to be taken , " he added .
keeping an eye on greece the tough measures proposed by greece include an overhaul of the tax system , spending cuts , a hiring freeze on civil servants and salary caps for the highly-paid .
greece has pledged to bring its 12.7 percent budget deficit down to 8.7 percent in the first year of a three-year crackdown .
the eu 's economic affairs commissioner , joaquim almunia , said the measures were adequate , for now , but the european commission will study the plan intensively over the next two weeks , before deciding whether to demand changes .
he said the commission wanted updates on how greece was progressing every three months .
and a plan is in the works to hand auditing powers to the eu 's statistics office , eurostat , which would also deploy a permanent representative to a new national statistics agency in greece. mrm / ap / dpa editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" obama has not reformed the healthcare system , has not brought climate legislation through congress , the iranian leadership has not adhered to the western concept of responsibility , and in afghanistan , a military turning point is not in sight .
guantanamo has n't been closed yet as promised , either , " writes business daily handelsblatt from dusseldorf .
does that mean he is a total failure ?
far from it , says the paper , much of what the us administration has begun just can not be done in 12 months , and obama will need luck to accomplish his goals in even one legislative period .
the berliner morgenpost daily concurs that , although only 46 percent of americans are satisfied with his work , obama should n't be judged by his first 12 months in office .
" obama can still become one of the great innovators in american history , " the paper says .
" he has unequalled self-confidence , which keeps him from changing policies just because of unfavorable surveys .
he is also blessed with a pragmatism that allows him not to be led into ideological dead ends . " a year ago , says the berlin paper , observers should have been more reserved in their expectations .
" today , let them be warned against making an assumption that is just as premature : that obama has failed . " obama underestimated the economic crisis , says the frankfurter rundschau .
but " his most momentous mistake was not remaining at the helm of his most important project , healthcare reforms . " while the president is by no means an american gorbachev - respected internationally , ridiculed at home - the frankfurt daily says , there is growing doubt ahead of congressional elections later this year that obama and his democrats will continue to hold all the power .
" the second year in office will not be any easier . "
marked by modesty , impartiality and a willingness to cooperate rather than making solitary decisions , obama 's new style has been of little use so far concerning the biggest global problems , " the muenchner merkur writes . the munich daily goes on to say that it would not be fair to condemn the president - after all millions of people only too gladly let their imaginations be fired by the " black superstar . "
" policy is not made primarily by good intentions , lofty gestures and brilliant rhetoric ; policy is clearly based on power and interests .
this is a reality even an obama ca n't suspend . "
reality has set in , the westfalenpost agrees .
however , the hagen-based daily believes that the young president has matured , remarking that he rarely smiles , that his face is often serious .
" the problems are too great .
the economic crisis , a backlash on climate policies , the costly war in afghanistan and the struggle for healthcare reforms have taken their toll on obama .
but what is even worse : america is losing its influence . " obama knew from the start that america could only tackle global crises along with other nations .
" which is why we europeans , especially we germans , should be glad to have this president at our side , " says the paper. db / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de strong effort , little tangible results mark the first year of the obama presidency with his slogan , ' yes we can ' barack obama not only won the presidential poll , but also the support of millions all over the world .
but one year after taking office , it 's clear that even he ca n't fulfill the high hopes .
-lrb- 19.01.2010 -rrb- europe must seize ' the obama moment , ' urges foreign policy expert in barack obama , europe got the president it wanted .
but instead of supporting his shift on climate change and other topics , europeans still have unrealistic expectations , says the head of an eu think tank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de natural disasters -pipe- 20.01.2010 eu aid chief heads to haiti großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake left an estimated three million people homeless the european union 's top aid official arrives in haiti on thursday .
karel de gucht hopes to gain insight into how eu aid can be most efficiently used in rebuilding the earthquake-struck nation . the european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid karel de gucht is expected in haiti on thursday morning , where he will assess the current and future allocation of relief aid coming from the european bloc .
" his visit will be an opportunity to assess the immediate life-saving humanitarian aid needs , as well as the medium and long-term requirements for reconstruction and rehabilitation of the country , " the european commission said in a statement released wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gucht said members of the european parliament did not recognize efforts in haiti by eu member states de gucht will also meet with haitian and un authorities , as well as the main aid representatives on the scene , to discuss the coordination of the overall relief effort , the commission said .
he will remain until late friday .
earlier this week , the commissioner told the european parliament in strasbourg how he assessed the situation in haiti .
" it is not only about rescuing human lives , but rescuing a country as a whole " , de gucht told the parliamentarians .
members of international organizations had also fallen victim to the catastrophe .
this made it more difficult to organize aid on the spot .
urgent medical , technical and logistic help were needed to avoid further risks such as an outbreak of cholera , he said .
overall , the commission and eu member states have pledged more than 422 million euros -lrb- $ 595 million -rrb- in immediate humanitarian relief and longer-term reconstruction aid .
eu-us coordination in the works meanwhile , the eu 's new foreign policy chief catherine ashton headed to washington on wednesday , as a strong aftershock measuring 6.1 on the richter scale rocked haiti .
ashton will meet with us secretary of state hillary clinton and then head to new york for talks with un secretary general ban ki-moon .
she had previously been sharply criticized by center-right and liberal deputies in the eu parliament for not heading straight to haiti , as clinton and some european officials had already done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton met with haiti 's president rene preval in port-au-prince on saturday " just about everybody was in haiti at the moment when these people are suffering , and europe was not present , " said joseph daul , head of the center-right group in the parliament .
" if it would have been in our hands , we would have sent someone . "
green group leader daniel cohn-bendit said the eu should not have been acting " on the sidelines . "
" if i was the high representative faced with a disaster of this scope , i 'd get on the first plane and then come back and tell the europeans what we should be doing , " cohn-bendit said .
" i think that is the basic minimum . "
but ashton defended her actions to parliamentarians .
" i had nothing to contribute on the ground other than taking up valuable space when planes were unable to land because of the state of the airfield , " she said .
" i am not a doctor , nor a fire fighter .
my place was to bring together co-ordination at eu level and with the un . "
de gucht said parliament should be more generous in recognizing the efforts put in place by the eu 's executive and its member states .
he said meps did " not pay enough tribute to all the people who have been working since day one in brussels and on the spot . "
eu foreign ministers will be meeting on brussels on monday , with haiti expected to be high on the agenda .
eu leaders will hold an additional summit on february 11 , with aid to haiti one of the discussion points. sac / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de logistics are key if aid initiatives are to help haiti governments , ngos and individuals all want to help the victims of the earthquake in haiti .
the trick is to convert money and other resources into assistance where and when it 's needed .

karel de gucht hopes to gain insight into how eu aid can be most efficiently used in rebuilding the earthquake-struck nation . the european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid karel de gucht is expected in haiti on thursday morning , where he will assess the current and future allocation of relief aid coming from the european bloc .
" his visit will be an opportunity to assess the immediate life-saving humanitarian aid needs , as well as the medium and long-term requirements for reconstruction and rehabilitation of the country , " the european commission said in a statement released wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gucht said members of the european parliament did not recognize efforts in haiti by eu member states de gucht will also meet with haitian and un authorities , as well as the main aid representatives on the scene , to discuss the coordination of the overall relief effort , the commission said .
he will remain until late friday .
earlier this week , the commissioner told the european parliament in strasbourg how he assessed the situation in haiti .
" it is not only about rescuing human lives , but rescuing a country as a whole " , de gucht told the parliamentarians .
members of international organizations had also fallen victim to the catastrophe .
this made it more difficult to organize aid on the spot .
urgent medical , technical and logistic help were needed to avoid further risks such as an outbreak of cholera , he said .
overall , the commission and eu member states have pledged more than 422 million euros -lrb- $ 595 million -rrb- in immediate humanitarian relief and longer-term reconstruction aid .
eu-us coordination in the works meanwhile , the eu 's new foreign policy chief catherine ashton headed to washington on wednesday , as a strong aftershock measuring 6.1 on the richter scale rocked haiti .
ashton will meet with us secretary of state hillary clinton and then head to new york for talks with un secretary general ban ki-moon .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton met with haiti 's president rene preval in port-au-prince on saturday " just about everybody was in haiti at the moment when these people are suffering , and europe was not present , " said joseph daul , head of the center-right group in the parliament .
" if it would have been in our hands , we would have sent someone . "
green group leader daniel cohn-bendit said the eu should not have been acting " on the sidelines . "
" if i was the high representative faced with a disaster of this scope , i 'd get on the first plane and then come back and tell the europeans what we should be doing , " cohn-bendit said .
" i think that is the basic minimum . "
but ashton defended her actions to parliamentarians .
" i had nothing to contribute on the ground other than taking up valuable space when planes were unable to land because of the state of the airfield , " she said .
" i am not a doctor , nor a fire fighter .
my place was to bring together co-ordination at eu level and with the un . "
de gucht said parliament should be more generous in recognizing the efforts put in place by the eu 's executive and its member states .
he said meps did " not pay enough tribute to all the people who have been working since day one in brussels and on the spot . "
eu foreign ministers will be meeting on brussels on monday , with haiti expected to be high on the agenda .

the opposition has called for a full withdrawal by 2015 . the commander of international forces in afghanistan , us general stanley mcchrystal , said german troops needed to establish more contact with the people .
otherwise , the soldiers - though physically present - were " essentially irrelevant , " he said in an interview with the mass circulation daily bild zeitung published wednesday .
germany 's defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said mcchrystal was naming the reality soldiers faced .
" i do n't see it as criticism , but rather as a description of the reality confronting the international community , " guttenberg told reporters in berlin .
" when he speaks about risks , then that is also a reality .
our soldiers are exposed to high risks every day . "
guttenberg did not comment on whether the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , would begin more patrols on foot in the future .
his predecessor , franz josef jung , had ordered several years ago that german soldiers only be allowed to leave their camps in armored vehicles .
this had been a reaction to increased attacks on bundeswehr troops .
opposition wants full withdrawal former foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group , said ending germany 's activities in afghanistan should be tied to the reduction of the us presence there .
president barack obama has said the us will begin reducing its military activities in afghanistan from 2011 .
" we should n't lag behind , " steinmeier told the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
" the withdrawal of german soldiers should also begin in 2011 .
we have to now completely hand over the reasonably calm districts to the afghans . "
steinmeier said further steps should then be taken with other european countries .
" we have to come to an agreement with our most significant european partners to end our military commitment there between 2013 and 2015 , " he said .
this was " ambitious , but realistic . "
bildunterschrift : some 40,000 more troops are due to arrive in afghanistan from the us and its nato allies in 2010 but defense minister guttenberg said he disagreed .
" i think nothing of a finish date , " guttenberg said .
this would play into the hands of those who wanted to " switch off the lights " in afghanistan again .
foreign minister guido westerwelle also rejected demands for a speedy withdrawal of german troops .
" the international community can not afford to let this country make a false step or even fall , " westerwelle said .
" whoever would hastily leave afghanistan now would leave millions of people in the lurch and send many of them to a certain death at the hands of taliban executioners . "
karzai to visit berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and merkel met in berlin last year , too germany currently has 4,300 soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
an international conference in london on january 28 will deliberate the future of the international engagement .
chancellor angela merkel has said she will present to parliament in the coming week a government policy statement on germany 's plans .
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said afghan president hamid karzai will stop in berlin next week on his way to the london conference . karzai is expected to meet the german leader and parliamentarians .
justifying more troops the spd has indicated it would not block an increase in troops .
" if the government can precisely justify what additional efforts additional soldiers will bring , then it is certainly reasonable , " spd defense expert rainer arnold told the newspaper rheinische merkur .
" a couple of hundred soldiers more can hardly be called a militarization of german foreign policy . "
however , arnold did not put a figure on how many more soldiers the spd would support. sac / reuters / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

president barack obama has said the us will begin reducing its military activities in afghanistan from 2011 .
" we should n't lag behind , " steinmeier told the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
" the withdrawal of german soldiers should also begin in 2011 .
we have to now completely hand over the reasonably calm districts to the afghans . "
steinmeier said further steps should then be taken with other european countries .
" we have to come to an agreement with our most significant european partners to end our military commitment there between 2013 and 2015 , " he said .
this was " ambitious , but realistic . "
bildunterschrift : some 40,000 more troops are due to arrive in afghanistan from the us and its nato allies in 2010 but defense minister guttenberg said he disagreed .
" i think nothing of a finish date , " guttenberg said .
this would play into the hands of those who wanted to " switch off the lights " in afghanistan again .
foreign minister guido westerwelle also rejected demands for a speedy withdrawal of german troops .
" the international community can not afford to let this country make a false step or even fall , " westerwelle said .
" whoever would hastily leave afghanistan now would leave millions of people in the lurch and send many of them to a certain death at the hands of taliban executioners . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de natural disasters -pipe- 20.01.2010 eu aid chief heads to haiti großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earthquake left an estimated three million people homeless the european union 's top aid official arrives in haiti on thursday .
karel de gucht hopes to gain insight into how eu aid can be most efficiently used in rebuilding the earthquake-struck nation . the european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid karel de gucht is expected in haiti on thursday morning , where he will assess the current and future allocation of relief aid coming from the european bloc .
" his visit will be an opportunity to assess the immediate life-saving humanitarian aid needs , as well as the medium and long-term requirements for reconstruction and rehabilitation of the country , " the european commission said in a statement released wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gucht said members of the european parliament did not recognize efforts in haiti by eu member states de gucht will also meet with haitian and un authorities , as well as the main aid representatives on the scene , to discuss the coordination of the overall relief effort , the commission said .
he will remain until late friday .
earlier this week , the commissioner told the european parliament in strasbourg how he assessed the situation in haiti .
" it is not only about rescuing human lives , but rescuing a country as a whole " , de gucht told the parliamentarians .
members of international organizations had also fallen victim to the catastrophe .
this made it more difficult to organize aid on the spot .
urgent medical , technical and logistic help were needed to avoid further risks such as an outbreak of cholera , he said .
overall , the commission and eu member states have pledged more than 422 million euros -lrb- $ 595 million -rrb- in immediate humanitarian relief and longer-term reconstruction aid .
eu-us coordination in the works meanwhile , the eu 's new foreign policy chief catherine ashton headed to washington on wednesday , as a strong aftershock measuring 6.1 on the richter scale rocked haiti .
ashton will meet with us secretary of state hillary clinton and then head to new york for talks with un secretary general ban ki-moon .
she had previously been sharply criticized by center-right and liberal deputies in the eu parliament for not heading straight to haiti , as clinton and some european officials had already done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton met with haiti 's president rene preval in port-au-prince on saturday " just about everybody was in haiti at the moment when these people are suffering , and europe was not present , " said joseph daul , head of the center-right group in the parliament .
" if it would have been in our hands , we would have sent someone . "
green group leader daniel cohn-bendit said the eu should not have been acting " on the sidelines . "
" if i was the high representative faced with a disaster of this scope , i 'd get on the first plane and then come back and tell the europeans what we should be doing , " cohn-bendit said .
" i think that is the basic minimum . "
but ashton defended her actions to parliamentarians .
" i had nothing to contribute on the ground other than taking up valuable space when planes were unable to land because of the state of the airfield , " she said .
" i am not a doctor , nor a fire fighter .
my place was to bring together co-ordination at eu level and with the un . "
de gucht said parliament should be more generous in recognizing the efforts put in place by the eu 's executive and its member states .
he said meps did " not pay enough tribute to all the people who have been working since day one in brussels and on the spot . "
eu foreign ministers will be meeting on brussels on monday , with haiti expected to be high on the agenda .
eu leaders will hold an additional summit on february 11 , with aid to haiti one of the discussion points. sac / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the opposition has called for a full withdrawal by 2015 . the commander of international forces in afghanistan , us general stanley mcchrystal , said german troops needed to establish more contact with the people .
otherwise , the soldiers - though physically present - were " essentially irrelevant , " he said in an interview with the mass circulation daily bild zeitung published wednesday .
germany 's defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said mcchrystal was naming the reality soldiers faced .
" i do n't see it as criticism , but rather as a description of the reality confronting the international community , " guttenberg told reporters in berlin .
" when he speaks about risks , then that is also a reality .
our soldiers are exposed to high risks every day . "
guttenberg did not comment on whether the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , would begin more patrols on foot in the future .
his predecessor , franz josef jung , had ordered several years ago that german soldiers only be allowed to leave their camps in armored vehicles .
this had been a reaction to increased attacks on bundeswehr troops .
opposition wants full withdrawal former foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group , said ending germany 's activities in afghanistan should be tied to the reduction of the us presence there .
president barack obama has said the us will begin reducing its military activities in afghanistan from 2011 .
" we should n't lag behind , " steinmeier told the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
" the withdrawal of german soldiers should also begin in 2011 .
we have to now completely hand over the reasonably calm districts to the afghans . "
steinmeier said further steps should then be taken with other european countries .
" we have to come to an agreement with our most significant european partners to end our military commitment there between 2013 and 2015 , " he said .
this was " ambitious , but realistic . "
bildunterschrift : some 40,000 more troops are due to arrive in afghanistan from the us and its nato allies in 2010 but defense minister guttenberg said he disagreed .
" i think nothing of a finish date , " guttenberg said .
this would play into the hands of those who wanted to " switch off the lights " in afghanistan again .
foreign minister guido westerwelle also rejected demands for a speedy withdrawal of german troops .
" the international community can not afford to let this country make a false step or even fall , " westerwelle said .
" whoever would hastily leave afghanistan now would leave millions of people in the lurch and send many of them to a certain death at the hands of taliban executioners . "
karzai to visit berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and merkel met in berlin last year , too germany currently has 4,300 soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
an international conference in london on january 28 will deliberate the future of the international engagement .
chancellor angela merkel has said she will present to parliament in the coming week a government policy statement on germany 's plans .
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said afghan president hamid karzai will stop in berlin next week on his way to the london conference . karzai is expected to meet the german leader and parliamentarians .
justifying more troops the spd has indicated it would not block an increase in troops .
" if the government can precisely justify what additional efforts additional soldiers will bring , then it is certainly reasonable , " spd defense expert rainer arnold told the newspaper rheinische merkur .
" a couple of hundred soldiers more can hardly be called a militarization of german foreign policy . "
however , arnold did not put a figure on how many more soldiers the spd would support. sac / reuters / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it struck at a depth of 22 kilometers , but was located too far inland to generate any tidal waves in the caribbean , scientists said .
there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage .
but the quake sent people already frightened from last week 's devastating earthquake screaming into the streets .
the aftershock came as international aid efforts are in full swing in haiti , following the magnitude 7 quake on january 12 .
eu must fulfill its responsibilities spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero on wednesday urged the european union to " mobilize all our forces " for the quake-stricken country .
" as europeans , faced with the tragedy of haiti , we have to concretely demonstrate our engagement , " zapatero told members of the european parliament in strasbourg .
" the international community has responded strongly and shown solidarity , and the european union has to be up to the mark . "
zapatero , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the sole focus must be the haitian people .
" they are suffering , " he said .

karel de gucht hopes to gain insight into how eu aid can be most efficiently used in rebuilding the earthquake-struck nation . the european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid karel de gucht is expected in haiti on thursday morning , where he will assess the current and future allocation of relief aid coming from the european bloc .
" his visit will be an opportunity to assess the immediate life-saving humanitarian aid needs , as well as the medium and long-term requirements for reconstruction and rehabilitation of the country , " the european commission said in a statement released wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gucht said members of the european parliament did not recognize efforts in haiti by eu member states de gucht will also meet with haitian and un authorities , as well as the main aid representatives on the scene , to discuss the coordination of the overall relief effort , the commission said .
he will remain until late friday .
earlier this week , the commissioner told the european parliament in strasbourg how he assessed the situation in haiti .
" it is not only about rescuing human lives , but rescuing a country as a whole " , de gucht told the parliamentarians .
members of international organizations had also fallen victim to the catastrophe .
this made it more difficult to organize aid on the spot .
urgent medical , technical and logistic help were needed to avoid further risks such as an outbreak of cholera , he said .
overall , the commission and eu member states have pledged more than 422 million euros -lrb- $ 595 million -rrb- in immediate humanitarian relief and longer-term reconstruction aid .
eu-us coordination in the works meanwhile , the eu 's new foreign policy chief catherine ashton headed to washington on wednesday , as a strong aftershock measuring 6.1 on the richter scale rocked haiti .
ashton will meet with us secretary of state hillary clinton and then head to new york for talks with un secretary general ban ki-moon .
she had previously been sharply criticized by center-right and liberal deputies in the eu parliament for not heading straight to haiti , as clinton and some european officials had already done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton met with haiti 's president rene preval in port-au-prince on saturday " just about everybody was in haiti at the moment when these people are suffering , and europe was not present , " said joseph daul , head of the center-right group in the parliament .
" if it would have been in our hands , we would have sent someone . "
green group leader daniel cohn-bendit said the eu should not have been acting " on the sidelines . "
" if i was the high representative faced with a disaster of this scope , i 'd get on the first plane and then come back and tell the europeans what we should be doing , " cohn-bendit said .
" i think that is the basic minimum . "
but ashton defended her actions to parliamentarians .
" i had nothing to contribute on the ground other than taking up valuable space when planes were unable to land because of the state of the airfield , " she said .
" i am not a doctor , nor a fire fighter .
my place was to bring together co-ordination at eu level and with the un . "
de gucht said parliament should be more generous in recognizing the efforts put in place by the eu 's executive and its member states .
he said meps did " not pay enough tribute to all the people who have been working since day one in brussels and on the spot . "
eu foreign ministers will be meeting on brussels on monday , with haiti expected to be high on the agenda .
eu leaders will hold an additional summit on february 11 , with aid to haiti one of the discussion points. sac / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lyman cautions that heavy handed operations could push nomadic tuareg rebels demanding a greater share in revenues from the region 's resources towards closer cooperation with aqim . he says the boeing 727 incident and the arrest of the al qaeda operatives demonstrates the need to focus on preventing drugs from getting into the sahel by patrolling the region 's coast line and airports rather than increasing military presence on the ground that would further alienate local populations .
" smuggling has a long tradition and constitutes a major source of income for groups that feel marginalized by their government … .political groups with narco money make it more difficult for governments to offer an alternative .

the indian ocean has a particularly important strategic value because of the newly emerging markets china and india .
now , the two are set to become maritime rivals . when communist china celebrated the 60th anniversary of its navy with grand pomp last year , the world was reminded once more that china wants to become an influential and respected maritime player .
for china , the sea plays a very crucial role for transporting raw materials such as oil from the middle east or transporting chinese products to europe via the suez canal .
china can also play a role in maintaining stability in the region .
for example , with its recent efforts to support the fight against pirates off the somali coast .
india uneasy about china ’ s role in indian ocean however , not everybody is happy about china ’ s growing role in the indian ocean .
india is already in a difficult geopolitical position , explains indranil banerjie , the executive director of sapra , an independent indian think tank that looks at military issues .
“ india is beginning to feel rather uncomfortable with myanmar in the east , sri lanka in the south and gwadar in the west and now the african ports are making indian strategists feel rather uneasy . ”
china has a presence in all these regions - at the port of gwadar in pakistan as well as in the big container harbour in dhaka .
it is also building a bunker in sri lanka and a pipeline that will connect the bay of bengal to yunnan province .
“ the indian leadership and strategic thinkers have a bit of a problem and are trying to figure out what exactly the chinese want to achieve , ” says banerjie .
“ it is not very clear and if you can not gauge the intention then you get into a situation where willy-nilly you have to try to expand all your possibilities and options .
not necessarily a happy thing but perhaps inevitable in these circumstances . ”
can us play a stabilising role ?
some military observers say that the us can play a stabilising role but adam segal from the us council on foreign relations disagrees .
“ we already have our own problems with the chinese navy and therefore it ’ s not easy for the us to play a kind of outside role right now , ” he says .
“ i think we are going to continue engaging the indian navy .
we have done a number of military exercises with them , and that is probably the most likely way we will go forward . ”
indranil banerjie agrees : “ what is very important is to start developing strategic relationships with countries in the indian ocean .
india doesn ’ t want to dominate the indian ocean .
we just want options that will prevent any one power from trying to dominate or become the dominant force in the indian ocean .
so we need to work on alliances as well as spending on the navy . "
this could well lead to a new maritime arms race in asia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 20.01.2010 berlin takes to the catwalk without joop and lagerfeld großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fashion show is like an art exhibition , says designer joop berlin is vying for the spotlight on the international fashion stage .
it 's lost its top designers and taken flack for the nazi history of the fashion show 's location .
young new designers are fashion week 's last hope . it is that time of the year again as designers from around the world are busy packing their collections and beginning their bi-annual pilgrimage to the german capital .
berlin fashion week returns for its sixth outing from january 20-23 and promises to build on past success .
a total of 30 fashion shows are planned to display the new trends for winter 2010/2011 .
in addition to trends from more established names such as boss , rene lange and strenesse blue , berlin has continued to draw in many fresh names such as the award-winning newcomers frida weyer and sam frenzel .
notable absences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfang joop has accused berlin fashion week of placing entertainment above art as for the established designers , two of germany 's oldest names are notable by their absence .
both karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop will not be there , instead preferring to showcase their work on the catwalk in paris .
joop has turned his back on the event after accusing the berlin fashion week of being too focused on glamour .
the creator of the wunderkind label claims it has become nothing more than a show for the media , filled with celebrities who are n't even interested in fashion .
" i would never put on a fashion show in the friedrichstadt palace , " said the german fashion icon , referring to the berlin event center where designer michael michalsky held a show during last summer 's fashion week .
" that 's just for entertainment value and fashion is supposed to be an art , " added joop , as reported by dpa .
the organizers of the fashion week , img fashion , disagree .
" i do n't think that it 's any different in paris , " img spokesman daniel aubke told deutsche welle .
" celebrities are also invited there and it 's no different in berlin . "
a center of creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the absence of big names such as karl lagerfeld , berlin is focusing on young designers aubke said that the lack of big names would n't reflect badly on the event .
" designers decide for a city that makes the most sense for them .
if they can reach their target audience better there than in a different city , then they will obviously show there . "
berlin , after all , has made up-and-coming designers its focus , so perhaps joop and lagerfeld do n't really fit in after all .
the german capital is often viewed as a bubbling cauldron of creativity and the show can capitalize on its home-grown talent of some 600 to 800 designers .
the city has already gained notoriety by concentrating on the work of exciting , talented and innovative young designers who continuously push the boundaries of creativity .
one of these is resident berlin designer sam frenzel , winner of the designer for tomorrow award at the show 's last outing .
this season , he 'll be displaying his first collection on the berlin catwalk .
one step at a time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show is developing step by step to perhaps one day rival fashion meccas such as paris by focusing on young newcomers , the berlin fashion week has developed a unique flavor that sets it apart from paris and milan .
but the event 's organizers say that berlin still is n't quite ready to go head-to-head with the major leaguers .
it 'll take time until berlin firmly establishes itself on the fashion map , but this process has already begun , says img fashion .
last season , the event attracted attention from around the world and drew fashion reporters from the new york times , the guardian , and vogue italy .
" we 've only been here since 2007 and it would be a bit presumptuous to say ' we want to have a comparable audience to paris , ' but we are trying to develop step by step , " said aubke .
change of venue for next year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week will bid farewell to bebelplatz for the final time this season an unforeseen step in this development was announced one day before launch amidst clouds of controversy over the show 's main venue .
bebelplatz is best known as being the site of the infamous book burnings held on may 10 , 1933 , where thousands of books were burnt by students and members of hitler 's national socialist party .
today , a glass window offering a view into a room filled with empty bookcases commemorates the event .
in an open letter addressed to berlin mayor klaus wowereit , campaigners labeled the fashion week a " trivial mass event " which has no place on bebelplatz .
in response , img fashion promised to find a different venue to showcase the year 's summer trends in july . author : andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german capital is often viewed as a bubbling cauldron of creativity and the show can capitalize on its home-grown talent of some 600 to 800 designers .
the city has already gained notoriety by concentrating on the work of exciting , talented and innovative young designers who continuously push the boundaries of creativity .
one of these is resident berlin designer sam frenzel , winner of the designer for tomorrow award at the show 's last outing .
this season , he 'll be displaying his first collection on the berlin catwalk .
one step at a time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the show is developing step by step to perhaps one day rival fashion meccas such as paris by focusing on young newcomers , the berlin fashion week has developed a unique flavor that sets it apart from paris and milan .
but the event 's organizers say that berlin still is n't quite ready to go head-to-head with the major leaguers .
it 'll take time until berlin firmly establishes itself on the fashion map , but this process has already begun , says img fashion .
last season , the event attracted attention from around the world and drew fashion reporters from the new york times , the guardian , and vogue italy .
" we 've only been here since 2007 and it would be a bit presumptuous to say ' we want to have a comparable audience to paris , ' but we are trying to develop step by step , " said aubke .
change of venue for next year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week will bid farewell to bebelplatz for the final time this season an unforeseen step in this development was announced one day before launch amidst clouds of controversy over the show 's main venue .
bebelplatz is best known as being the site of the infamous book burnings held on may 10 , 1933 , where thousands of books were burnt by students and members of hitler 's national socialist party .
today , a glass window offering a view into a room filled with empty bookcases commemorates the event .
in an open letter addressed to berlin mayor klaus wowereit , campaigners labeled the fashion week a " trivial mass event " which has no place on bebelplatz .
in response , img fashion promised to find a different venue to showcase the year 's summer trends in july . author : andrew shale editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

between 5.4 million and 11.8 million people were counted within the various zones , which cover most of the western and southern regions of germany .
the city of bremen , within 150 kilometers of six nuclear powers stations , is particularly at risk .
according to a foundation statement , the numbers are considered conservative , as " in the case of a big accident a lot more people could be affected by the radioactive fallout . "
foundation board member hans guenter schumacher concluded , " it 's not just irresponsible , but inhuman that nuclear power stations continue to be operated in a country as densely populated as germany when millions of people could be endangered by an accident . "

but the foundation called for the seven oldest german nuclear power stations to be closed immediately : biblis a and b in hesse , brunsbuettel in schleswig-holstein , neckarwestheim 1 und philippsburg 1 in baden-wuerttemberg , isar 1 in bavaria und unterweser in lower saxony .
the environmental group also demanded that renewable energy be given priority in the law-making process .

the wreckage of the boeing 727 was discovered in the mali desert in november , 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- north of gao .
investigators believe the plane was carrying up to 10 tons of cocaine , the largest europe-bound latin american drugs transit shipment via the sahel so far known to authorities .
vehicle tracks in the sand have led the investigators to the conclusion that traffickers unloaded the plane 's cargo at a makeshift airstrip before burning it .
while they have not ruled out that the plane may have crashed , the investigators hope that three mali nationals arrested while dismantling the wreckage and transported to the mali capital of bamako may shed light on what happened to the aircraft .
venezuela turning a blind eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's president hugo chavez has been turning a blind eye to drug-trafficking operations alexandre schmidt , spokesman for the vienna-based un office on drugs and crime -lrb- unodc -rrb- told journalists in november the mysterious flight had originated in venezuela , fuelling allegations that venezuela supports terrorism and drugs trafficking .
venezuelan officials question the assertion .
but critics of president hugo chavez , pointing to his support of the farc , charge that widespread corruption reaching into the highest echelons of government facilitates venezuelan involvement in drugs trafficking .
" chavez may not be involved , but he certainly looks the other way .
none of his aides have been removed from office , " ariel segal , a lima-based expert on venezuela , told deutsche welle .
the arrest in of the three operatives of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , the al qaeda affiliate in west africa , further heightens concern about the islamists ' links to latin american traffickers .
the three mali nationals arrived in new york on december 18 after being arrested by authorities in ghana as a result of a four-month long sting operation in which two paid dea informants posed as farc representatives .
the three men appeared in court on the day of their arrival to be charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists .
they are the first al qaeda operatives to have been captured by the us in a drug trafficking plot in africa .
they told the undercover dea informants , according to court documents , that they could protect major latin american shipments of cocaine in the sahel and transport the drugs by truck through the desert and finally to spain .
they said they would charge up to 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,000 -rrb- per kilogram .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 20.01.2010 press review : reality catches up with president obama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama needs more time to fulfill all his promises a year after us president barack obama took office , german editorial writers agree that whether he will go down in history as a great or an average president is still undecided . " obama has not reformed the healthcare system , has not brought climate legislation through congress , the iranian leadership has not adhered to the western concept of responsibility , and in afghanistan , a military turning point is not in sight .
guantanamo has n't been closed yet as promised , either , " writes business daily handelsblatt from dusseldorf .
does that mean he is a total failure ?
far from it , says the paper , much of what the us administration has begun just can not be done in 12 months , and obama will need luck to accomplish his goals in even one legislative period .
the berliner morgenpost daily concurs that , although only 46 percent of americans are satisfied with his work , obama should n't be judged by his first 12 months in office .
" obama can still become one of the great innovators in american history , " the paper says .
" he has unequalled self-confidence , which keeps him from changing policies just because of unfavorable surveys .
he is also blessed with a pragmatism that allows him not to be led into ideological dead ends . " a year ago , says the berlin paper , observers should have been more reserved in their expectations .
" today , let them be warned against making an assumption that is just as premature : that obama has failed . " obama underestimated the economic crisis , says the frankfurter rundschau .
but " his most momentous mistake was not remaining at the helm of his most important project , healthcare reforms . " while the president is by no means an american gorbachev - respected internationally , ridiculed at home - the frankfurt daily says , there is growing doubt ahead of congressional elections later this year that obama and his democrats will continue to hold all the power .
" the second year in office will not be any easier . "
marked by modesty , impartiality and a willingness to cooperate rather than making solitary decisions , obama 's new style has been of little use so far concerning the biggest global problems , " the muenchner merkur writes . the munich daily goes on to say that it would not be fair to condemn the president - after all millions of people only too gladly let their imaginations be fired by the " black superstar . "
" policy is not made primarily by good intentions , lofty gestures and brilliant rhetoric ; policy is clearly based on power and interests .
this is a reality even an obama ca n't suspend . "
reality has set in , the westfalenpost agrees .
however , the hagen-based daily believes that the young president has matured , remarking that he rarely smiles , that his face is often serious .
" the problems are too great .
the economic crisis , a backlash on climate policies , the costly war in afghanistan and the struggle for healthcare reforms have taken their toll on obama .
but what is even worse : america is losing its influence . " obama knew from the start that america could only tackle global crises along with other nations .
" which is why we europeans , especially we germans , should be glad to have this president at our side , " says the paper. db / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de strong effort , little tangible results mark the first year of the obama presidency with his slogan , ' yes we can ' barack obama not only won the presidential poll , but also the support of millions all over the world .
but one year after taking office , it 's clear that even he ca n't fulfill the high hopes .

" obama has not reformed the healthcare system , has not brought climate legislation through congress , the iranian leadership has not adhered to the western concept of responsibility , and in afghanistan , a military turning point is not in sight .
guantanamo has n't been closed yet as promised , either , " writes business daily handelsblatt from dusseldorf .
does that mean he is a total failure ?
far from it , says the paper , much of what the us administration has begun just can not be done in 12 months , and obama will need luck to accomplish his goals in even one legislative period .
the berliner morgenpost daily concurs that , although only 46 percent of americans are satisfied with his work , obama should n't be judged by his first 12 months in office .
" obama can still become one of the great innovators in american history , " the paper says .
" he has unequalled self-confidence , which keeps him from changing policies just because of unfavorable surveys .
he is also blessed with a pragmatism that allows him not to be led into ideological dead ends . " a year ago , says the berlin paper , observers should have been more reserved in their expectations .
" today , let them be warned against making an assumption that is just as premature : that obama has failed . " obama underestimated the economic crisis , says the frankfurter rundschau .
but " his most momentous mistake was not remaining at the helm of his most important project , healthcare reforms . " while the president is by no means an american gorbachev - respected internationally , ridiculed at home - the frankfurt daily says , there is growing doubt ahead of congressional elections later this year that obama and his democrats will continue to hold all the power .
" the second year in office will not be any easier . "
marked by modesty , impartiality and a willingness to cooperate rather than making solitary decisions , obama 's new style has been of little use so far concerning the biggest global problems , " the muenchner merkur writes . the munich daily goes on to say that it would not be fair to condemn the president - after all millions of people only too gladly let their imaginations be fired by the " black superstar . "
" policy is not made primarily by good intentions , lofty gestures and brilliant rhetoric ; policy is clearly based on power and interests .
this is a reality even an obama ca n't suspend . "
reality has set in , the westfalenpost agrees .
however , the hagen-based daily believes that the young president has matured , remarking that he rarely smiles , that his face is often serious .
" the problems are too great .
the economic crisis , a backlash on climate policies , the costly war in afghanistan and the struggle for healthcare reforms have taken their toll on obama .
but what is even worse : america is losing its influence . " obama knew from the start that america could only tackle global crises along with other nations .
" which is why we europeans , especially we germans , should be glad to have this president at our side , " says the paper. db / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european union has promised to do its utmost to help . a second strong quake hit haiti on wednesday .
the us geological survey said the 6.1-magnitude trembler struck at 6:03 am local time on wednesday morning .
its epicenter was some 60 kilometers west of the capital port-au-prince , which felt the aftershock .
it struck at a depth of 22 kilometers , but was located too far inland to generate any tidal waves in the caribbean , scientists said .
there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage .
but the quake sent people already frightened from last week 's devastating earthquake screaming into the streets .
the aftershock came as international aid efforts are in full swing in haiti , following the magnitude 7 quake on january 12 .
eu must fulfill its responsibilities spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero on wednesday urged the european union to " mobilize all our forces " for the quake-stricken country .
" as europeans , faced with the tragedy of haiti , we have to concretely demonstrate our engagement , " zapatero told members of the european parliament in strasbourg .
" the international community has responded strongly and shown solidarity , and the european union has to be up to the mark . "
zapatero , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the sole focus must be the haitian people .
" they are suffering , " he said .
" so we have to make every possible and imaginable effort so that haiti can return to normal . " sac / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

karel de gucht hopes to gain insight into how eu aid can be most efficiently used in rebuilding the earthquake-struck nation . the european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid karel de gucht is expected in haiti on thursday morning , where he will assess the current and future allocation of relief aid coming from the european bloc .
" his visit will be an opportunity to assess the immediate life-saving humanitarian aid needs , as well as the medium and long-term requirements for reconstruction and rehabilitation of the country , " the european commission said in a statement released wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gucht said members of the european parliament did not recognize efforts in haiti by eu member states de gucht will also meet with haitian and un authorities , as well as the main aid representatives on the scene , to discuss the coordination of the overall relief effort , the commission said .
he will remain until late friday .
earlier this week , the commissioner told the european parliament in strasbourg how he assessed the situation in haiti .
" it is not only about rescuing human lives , but rescuing a country as a whole " , de gucht told the parliamentarians .
members of international organizations had also fallen victim to the catastrophe .
this made it more difficult to organize aid on the spot .
urgent medical , technical and logistic help were needed to avoid further risks such as an outbreak of cholera , he said .
overall , the commission and eu member states have pledged more than 422 million euros -lrb- $ 595 million -rrb- in immediate humanitarian relief and longer-term reconstruction aid .
eu-us coordination in the works meanwhile , the eu 's new foreign policy chief catherine ashton headed to washington on wednesday , as a strong aftershock measuring 6.1 on the richter scale rocked haiti .
ashton will meet with us secretary of state hillary clinton and then head to new york for talks with un secretary general ban ki-moon .
she had previously been sharply criticized by center-right and liberal deputies in the eu parliament for not heading straight to haiti , as clinton and some european officials had already done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton met with haiti 's president rene preval in port-au-prince on saturday " just about everybody was in haiti at the moment when these people are suffering , and europe was not present , " said joseph daul , head of the center-right group in the parliament .
" if it would have been in our hands , we would have sent someone . "
green group leader daniel cohn-bendit said the eu should not have been acting " on the sidelines . "
" if i was the high representative faced with a disaster of this scope , i 'd get on the first plane and then come back and tell the europeans what we should be doing , " cohn-bendit said .
" i think that is the basic minimum . "
but ashton defended her actions to parliamentarians .
" i had nothing to contribute on the ground other than taking up valuable space when planes were unable to land because of the state of the airfield , " she said .
" i am not a doctor , nor a fire fighter .
my place was to bring together co-ordination at eu level and with the un . "
de gucht said parliament should be more generous in recognizing the efforts put in place by the eu 's executive and its member states .
he said meps did " not pay enough tribute to all the people who have been working since day one in brussels and on the spot . "
eu foreign ministers will be meeting on brussels on monday , with haiti expected to be high on the agenda .

karel de gucht hopes to gain insight into how eu aid can be most efficiently used in rebuilding the earthquake-struck nation . the european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid karel de gucht is expected in haiti on thursday morning , where he will assess the current and future allocation of relief aid coming from the european bloc .
" his visit will be an opportunity to assess the immediate life-saving humanitarian aid needs , as well as the medium and long-term requirements for reconstruction and rehabilitation of the country , " the european commission said in a statement released wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gucht said members of the european parliament did not recognize efforts in haiti by eu member states de gucht will also meet with haitian and un authorities , as well as the main aid representatives on the scene , to discuss the coordination of the overall relief effort , the commission said .
he will remain until late friday .
earlier this week , the commissioner told the european parliament in strasbourg how he assessed the situation in haiti .
" it is not only about rescuing human lives , but rescuing a country as a whole " , de gucht told the parliamentarians .
members of international organizations had also fallen victim to the catastrophe .
this made it more difficult to organize aid on the spot .
urgent medical , technical and logistic help were needed to avoid further risks such as an outbreak of cholera , he said .
overall , the commission and eu member states have pledged more than 422 million euros -lrb- $ 595 million -rrb- in immediate humanitarian relief and longer-term reconstruction aid .
eu-us coordination in the works meanwhile , the eu 's new foreign policy chief catherine ashton headed to washington on wednesday , as a strong aftershock measuring 6.1 on the richter scale rocked haiti .
ashton will meet with us secretary of state hillary clinton and then head to new york for talks with un secretary general ban ki-moon .
she had previously been sharply criticized by center-right and liberal deputies in the eu parliament for not heading straight to haiti , as clinton and some european officials had already done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton met with haiti 's president rene preval in port-au-prince on saturday " just about everybody was in haiti at the moment when these people are suffering , and europe was not present , " said joseph daul , head of the center-right group in the parliament .
" if it would have been in our hands , we would have sent someone . "
green group leader daniel cohn-bendit said the eu should not have been acting " on the sidelines . "
" if i was the high representative faced with a disaster of this scope , i 'd get on the first plane and then come back and tell the europeans what we should be doing , " cohn-bendit said .
" i think that is the basic minimum . "
but ashton defended her actions to parliamentarians .
" i had nothing to contribute on the ground other than taking up valuable space when planes were unable to land because of the state of the airfield , " she said .
" i am not a doctor , nor a fire fighter .
my place was to bring together co-ordination at eu level and with the un . "
de gucht said parliament should be more generous in recognizing the efforts put in place by the eu 's executive and its member states .
he said meps did " not pay enough tribute to all the people who have been working since day one in brussels and on the spot . "
eu foreign ministers will be meeting on brussels on monday , with haiti expected to be high on the agenda .

" obama has not reformed the healthcare system , has not brought climate legislation through congress , the iranian leadership has not adhered to the western concept of responsibility , and in afghanistan , a military turning point is not in sight .
guantanamo has n't been closed yet as promised , either , " writes business daily handelsblatt from dusseldorf .
does that mean he is a total failure ?
far from it , says the paper , much of what the us administration has begun just can not be done in 12 months , and obama will need luck to accomplish his goals in even one legislative period .
the berliner morgenpost daily concurs that , although only 46 percent of americans are satisfied with his work , obama should n't be judged by his first 12 months in office .
" obama can still become one of the great innovators in american history , " the paper says .
" he has unequalled self-confidence , which keeps him from changing policies just because of unfavorable surveys .
he is also blessed with a pragmatism that allows him not to be led into ideological dead ends . " a year ago , says the berlin paper , observers should have been more reserved in their expectations .
" today , let them be warned against making an assumption that is just as premature : that obama has failed . " obama underestimated the economic crisis , says the frankfurter rundschau .
but " his most momentous mistake was not remaining at the helm of his most important project , healthcare reforms . " while the president is by no means an american gorbachev - respected internationally , ridiculed at home - the frankfurt daily says , there is growing doubt ahead of congressional elections later this year that obama and his democrats will continue to hold all the power .
" the second year in office will not be any easier . "
marked by modesty , impartiality and a willingness to cooperate rather than making solitary decisions , obama 's new style has been of little use so far concerning the biggest global problems , " the muenchner merkur writes . the munich daily goes on to say that it would not be fair to condemn the president - after all millions of people only too gladly let their imaginations be fired by the " black superstar . "
" policy is not made primarily by good intentions , lofty gestures and brilliant rhetoric ; policy is clearly based on power and interests .
this is a reality even an obama ca n't suspend . "
reality has set in , the westfalenpost agrees .
however , the hagen-based daily believes that the young president has matured , remarking that he rarely smiles , that his face is often serious .
" the problems are too great .
the economic crisis , a backlash on climate policies , the costly war in afghanistan and the struggle for healthcare reforms have taken their toll on obama .
but what is even worse : america is losing its influence . " obama knew from the start that america could only tackle global crises along with other nations .
" which is why we europeans , especially we germans , should be glad to have this president at our side , " says the paper. db / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we face important decisions in the coming weeks and our position is to openly tell the players how we plan things , " loew told the bundesliga web site .
" that is why we travelled to bremen to have a long discussion with torsten , because we owe it to him . "
thirty-three-year old frings , midfielder and captain of werder bremen , said he was disappointed by loew 's decision , but not surprised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew says he wants younger players for the 2010 world cup " i have no other choice but to accept this decision , although i am clearly of a different opinion than joachim loew , " he said at a press conference on wednesday .
" i believe that i still have the potential to deliver strong performances at the world cup , and i will continue to show this in the bundesliga . "
history of tension frings played a large role in germany 's third-place finish in the 2006 home world cup .
the last of his international games was in february 2009 against norway , which germany lost 1-0 .
frings had often speculated his previous exclusion from the german team had nothing to do with his playing abilities .
in october 2008 , he made public comments challenging loew 's respect for veteran players after he was denied a spot in two world cup qualifiers. acb / dpa / sid / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the four-star general who commands the international troops in afghanistan said the taliban had used the situation in the country 's north to expand their operations and create the impression that the movement was active across the entire country .
mcchrystal criticized the german bundeswehr for patrolling mostly with heavily armored vehicles in its kunduz operations area and not on foot , noting that the insurgents ' goal was " to isolate the security forces from the populace . "
taliban trying to divide and conquer the taliban are trying " to create a situation where the security forces stay in their camps , never leave their armored vehicles and have very little contact with the population .
the security forces may be there , but they are irrelevant .
if the insurgents manage to achieve this , then they have accomplished their mission , " mcchrystal warned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcchrystal says germany needs to accept greater risks he stressed in the interview that it was hard for the afghan people to trust their government " if they do n't have the feeling they are protected and respected . "
the people , he said , do n't know how strong the insurgents really are , or how determined the international community is .
mcchrystal said that , like all the troops in afghanistan , german forces needed to live with the greater risk of this new strategy .
he said the germans may have to change the way they have dealt with the situation so far .
he added that he was planning to deploy american troops in the german sector in the near future .
he also noted that he would raise the issue at the international afghanistan conference in london at the end of january and at the munich security conference in germany in early february. gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" speaking in parliament on the second day of a four day session to debate her government 's 2010 budget proposals , chancellor angela merkel said plans to ramp up the country 's new debt by 86 billion euros -lrb- $ 123 billion -rrb- were " the right thing to do . "
germany is struggling to climb out of its worst recession since world war ii and has invested enormous sums to stimulate the country 's flagging economy .
defending that strategy , merkel said " we want germany to emerge stronger from this crisis than it was when it went in . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' we did the right thing ' said chancellor merkel " we have managed to do the right thing to prevent falling into the abyss .
as much as we would wish another situation , we are equally bound to look reality in the eye , " the chancellor said .
the draft budget , proposed by finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , foresees the highest deficit in germany 's post-war history .
total expenditures for 2010 are expected to reach some 325 billion euros ; 33 billion euros more than last year .
the largest , single outlay at nearly 147 billion euros is earmarked for social services .
schaeuble warned that public spending would be cut in 2011 and said " grave decisions lie ahead . "
responding to the government 's budget and tax-cut plans , opposition social democrat parliamentary leader , frank-walter steinmeier , accused the coalition of " complete and utter failure " in its first 100 days in office and of " having its head in the clouds . "
steinmeier said the government , in an attempt to satisfy its clientele , had " gambled away public trust " with its plans to cut taxes and trim programs , while spending more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government has ' gambled away public trust , ' says steinmeier exports still germany 's economic engine explaining the necessity of lower taxes , especially for business , merkel said that germany , long the world 's top exporter before being overtaken by china in 2009 , would have to rely on its traditional industrial strengths to pull itself out of the crisis .

taliban trying to divide and conquer the taliban are trying " to create a situation where the security forces stay in their camps , never leave their armored vehicles and have very little contact with the population .

the european union has promised to do its utmost to help . a second strong quake hit haiti on wednesday .
the us geological survey said the 6.1-magnitude trembler struck at 6:03 am local time on wednesday morning .
its epicenter was some 60 kilometers west of the capital port-au-prince , which felt the aftershock .
it struck at a depth of 22 kilometers , but was located too far inland to generate any tidal waves in the caribbean , scientists said .
there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage .
but the quake sent people already frightened from last week 's devastating earthquake screaming into the streets .
the aftershock came as international aid efforts are in full swing in haiti , following the magnitude 7 quake on january 12 .
eu must fulfill its responsibilities spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero on wednesday urged the european union to " mobilize all our forces " for the quake-stricken country .
" as europeans , faced with the tragedy of haiti , we have to concretely demonstrate our engagement , " zapatero told members of the european parliament in strasbourg .
" the international community has responded strongly and shown solidarity , and the european union has to be up to the mark . "
zapatero , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the sole focus must be the haitian people .
" they are suffering , " he said .
" so we have to make every possible and imaginable effort so that haiti can return to normal . " sac / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european union has promised to do its utmost to help . a second strong quake hit haiti on wednesday .

its epicenter was some 60 kilometers west of the capital port-au-prince , which felt the aftershock .
it struck at a depth of 22 kilometers , but was located too far inland to generate any tidal waves in the caribbean , scientists said .
there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage .
but the quake sent people already frightened from last week 's devastating earthquake screaming into the streets .
the aftershock came as international aid efforts are in full swing in haiti , following the magnitude 7 quake on january 12 .
eu must fulfill its responsibilities spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero on wednesday urged the european union to " mobilize all our forces " for the quake-stricken country .
" as europeans , faced with the tragedy of haiti , we have to concretely demonstrate our engagement , " zapatero told members of the european parliament in strasbourg .
" the international community has responded strongly and shown solidarity , and the european union has to be up to the mark . "
zapatero , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the sole focus must be the haitian people .
" they are suffering , " he said .
" so we have to make every possible and imaginable effort so that haiti can return to normal . " sac / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 20.01.2010 leading german lawmakers debate afghanistan strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers should get out of their vehicles more often , mcchrystal says comment by the isaf chief in afghanistan on germany 's role in the war-torn region has sparked debate among top politicians on where its future tasks should lie .
the opposition has called for a full withdrawal by 2015 . the commander of international forces in afghanistan , us general stanley mcchrystal , said german troops needed to establish more contact with the people .
otherwise , the soldiers - though physically present - were " essentially irrelevant , " he said in an interview with the mass circulation daily bild zeitung published wednesday .
germany 's defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said mcchrystal was naming the reality soldiers faced .
" i do n't see it as criticism , but rather as a description of the reality confronting the international community , " guttenberg told reporters in berlin .
" when he speaks about risks , then that is also a reality .
our soldiers are exposed to high risks every day . "
guttenberg did not comment on whether the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , would begin more patrols on foot in the future .
his predecessor , franz josef jung , had ordered several years ago that german soldiers only be allowed to leave their camps in armored vehicles .
this had been a reaction to increased attacks on bundeswehr troops .
opposition wants full withdrawal former foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group , said ending germany 's activities in afghanistan should be tied to the reduction of the us presence there .
president barack obama has said the us will begin reducing its military activities in afghanistan from 2011 .
" we should n't lag behind , " steinmeier told the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
" the withdrawal of german soldiers should also begin in 2011 .
we have to now completely hand over the reasonably calm districts to the afghans . "
steinmeier said further steps should then be taken with other european countries .
" we have to come to an agreement with our most significant european partners to end our military commitment there between 2013 and 2015 , " he said .
this was " ambitious , but realistic . "
bildunterschrift : some 40,000 more troops are due to arrive in afghanistan from the us and its nato allies in 2010 but defense minister guttenberg said he disagreed .
" i think nothing of a finish date , " guttenberg said .
this would play into the hands of those who wanted to " switch off the lights " in afghanistan again .
foreign minister guido westerwelle also rejected demands for a speedy withdrawal of german troops .
" the international community can not afford to let this country make a false step or even fall , " westerwelle said .
" whoever would hastily leave afghanistan now would leave millions of people in the lurch and send many of them to a certain death at the hands of taliban executioners . "
karzai to visit berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and merkel met in berlin last year , too germany currently has 4,300 soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
an international conference in london on january 28 will deliberate the future of the international engagement .
chancellor angela merkel has said she will present to parliament in the coming week a government policy statement on germany 's plans .
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said afghan president hamid karzai will stop in berlin next week on his way to the london conference . karzai is expected to meet the german leader and parliamentarians .
justifying more troops the spd has indicated it would not block an increase in troops .
" if the government can precisely justify what additional efforts additional soldiers will bring , then it is certainly reasonable , " spd defense expert rainer arnold told the newspaper rheinische merkur .
" a couple of hundred soldiers more can hardly be called a militarization of german foreign policy . "
however , arnold did not put a figure on how many more soldiers the spd would support. sac / reuters / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the opposition has called for a full withdrawal by 2015 . the commander of international forces in afghanistan , us general stanley mcchrystal , said german troops needed to establish more contact with the people .
otherwise , the soldiers - though physically present - were " essentially irrelevant , " he said in an interview with the mass circulation daily bild zeitung published wednesday .
germany 's defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said mcchrystal was naming the reality soldiers faced .
" i do n't see it as criticism , but rather as a description of the reality confronting the international community , " guttenberg told reporters in berlin .
" when he speaks about risks , then that is also a reality .
our soldiers are exposed to high risks every day . "
guttenberg did not comment on whether the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , would begin more patrols on foot in the future .
his predecessor , franz josef jung , had ordered several years ago that german soldiers only be allowed to leave their camps in armored vehicles .
this had been a reaction to increased attacks on bundeswehr troops .
opposition wants full withdrawal former foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group , said ending germany 's activities in afghanistan should be tied to the reduction of the us presence there .
president barack obama has said the us will begin reducing its military activities in afghanistan from 2011 .
" we should n't lag behind , " steinmeier told the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
" the withdrawal of german soldiers should also begin in 2011 .
we have to now completely hand over the reasonably calm districts to the afghans . "
steinmeier said further steps should then be taken with other european countries .
" we have to come to an agreement with our most significant european partners to end our military commitment there between 2013 and 2015 , " he said .
this was " ambitious , but realistic . "
bildunterschrift : some 40,000 more troops are due to arrive in afghanistan from the us and its nato allies in 2010 but defense minister guttenberg said he disagreed .
" i think nothing of a finish date , " guttenberg said .
this would play into the hands of those who wanted to " switch off the lights " in afghanistan again .
foreign minister guido westerwelle also rejected demands for a speedy withdrawal of german troops .
" the international community can not afford to let this country make a false step or even fall , " westerwelle said .
" whoever would hastily leave afghanistan now would leave millions of people in the lurch and send many of them to a certain death at the hands of taliban executioners . "

an international conference in london on january 28 will deliberate the future of the international engagement .

german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said afghan president hamid karzai will stop in berlin next week on his way to the london conference . karzai is expected to meet the german leader and parliamentarians .
justifying more troops the spd has indicated it would not block an increase in troops .
" if the government can precisely justify what additional efforts additional soldiers will bring , then it is certainly reasonable , " spd defense expert rainer arnold told the newspaper rheinische merkur .
" a couple of hundred soldiers more can hardly be called a militarization of german foreign policy . "

" we face important decisions in the coming weeks and our position is to openly tell the players how we plan things , " loew told the bundesliga web site .
" that is why we travelled to bremen to have a long discussion with torsten , because we owe it to him . "
thirty-three-year old frings , midfielder and captain of werder bremen , said he was disappointed by loew 's decision , but not surprised .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew says he wants younger players for the 2010 world cup " i have no other choice but to accept this decision , although i am clearly of a different opinion than joachim loew , " he said at a press conference on wednesday .
" i believe that i still have the potential to deliver strong performances at the world cup , and i will continue to show this in the bundesliga . "
history of tension frings played a large role in germany 's third-place finish in the 2006 home world cup .
the last of his international games was in february 2009 against norway , which germany lost 1-0 .
frings had often speculated his previous exclusion from the german team had nothing to do with his playing abilities .
in october 2008 , he made public comments challenging loew 's respect for veteran players after he was denied a spot in two world cup qualifiers. acb / dpa / sid / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage .
but the quake sent people already frightened from last week 's devastating earthquake screaming into the streets .
the aftershock came as international aid efforts are in full swing in haiti , following the magnitude 7 quake on january 12 .
eu must fulfill its responsibilities spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero on wednesday urged the european union to " mobilize all our forces " for the quake-stricken country .
" as europeans , faced with the tragedy of haiti , we have to concretely demonstrate our engagement , " zapatero told members of the european parliament in strasbourg .
" the international community has responded strongly and shown solidarity , and the european union has to be up to the mark . "
zapatero , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the sole focus must be the haitian people .
" they are suffering , " he said .
" so we have to make every possible and imaginable effort so that haiti can return to normal . " sac / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the opposition has called for a full withdrawal by 2015 . the commander of international forces in afghanistan , us general stanley mcchrystal , said german troops needed to establish more contact with the people .
otherwise , the soldiers - though physically present - were " essentially irrelevant , " he said in an interview with the mass circulation daily bild zeitung published wednesday .
germany 's defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said mcchrystal was naming the reality soldiers faced .
" i do n't see it as criticism , but rather as a description of the reality confronting the international community , " guttenberg told reporters in berlin .
" when he speaks about risks , then that is also a reality .
our soldiers are exposed to high risks every day . "
guttenberg did not comment on whether the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , would begin more patrols on foot in the future .
his predecessor , franz josef jung , had ordered several years ago that german soldiers only be allowed to leave their camps in armored vehicles .
this had been a reaction to increased attacks on bundeswehr troops .
opposition wants full withdrawal former foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group , said ending germany 's activities in afghanistan should be tied to the reduction of the us presence there .
president barack obama has said the us will begin reducing its military activities in afghanistan from 2011 .
" we should n't lag behind , " steinmeier told the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
" the withdrawal of german soldiers should also begin in 2011 .
we have to now completely hand over the reasonably calm districts to the afghans . "
steinmeier said further steps should then be taken with other european countries .
" we have to come to an agreement with our most significant european partners to end our military commitment there between 2013 and 2015 , " he said .
this was " ambitious , but realistic . "
bildunterschrift : some 40,000 more troops are due to arrive in afghanistan from the us and its nato allies in 2010 but defense minister guttenberg said he disagreed .
" i think nothing of a finish date , " guttenberg said .
this would play into the hands of those who wanted to " switch off the lights " in afghanistan again .
foreign minister guido westerwelle also rejected demands for a speedy withdrawal of german troops .
" the international community can not afford to let this country make a false step or even fall , " westerwelle said .
" whoever would hastily leave afghanistan now would leave millions of people in the lurch and send many of them to a certain death at the hands of taliban executioners . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 20.01.2010 leading german lawmakers debate afghanistan strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers should get out of their vehicles more often , mcchrystal says comment by the isaf chief in afghanistan on germany 's role in the war-torn region has sparked debate among top politicians on where its future tasks should lie .
the opposition has called for a full withdrawal by 2015 . the commander of international forces in afghanistan , us general stanley mcchrystal , said german troops needed to establish more contact with the people .
otherwise , the soldiers - though physically present - were " essentially irrelevant , " he said in an interview with the mass circulation daily bild zeitung published wednesday .
germany 's defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said mcchrystal was naming the reality soldiers faced .
" i do n't see it as criticism , but rather as a description of the reality confronting the international community , " guttenberg told reporters in berlin .
" when he speaks about risks , then that is also a reality .
our soldiers are exposed to high risks every day . "
guttenberg did not comment on whether the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , would begin more patrols on foot in the future .
his predecessor , franz josef jung , had ordered several years ago that german soldiers only be allowed to leave their camps in armored vehicles .
this had been a reaction to increased attacks on bundeswehr troops .
opposition wants full withdrawal former foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group , said ending germany 's activities in afghanistan should be tied to the reduction of the us presence there .
president barack obama has said the us will begin reducing its military activities in afghanistan from 2011 .
" we should n't lag behind , " steinmeier told the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
" the withdrawal of german soldiers should also begin in 2011 .
we have to now completely hand over the reasonably calm districts to the afghans . "
steinmeier said further steps should then be taken with other european countries .
" we have to come to an agreement with our most significant european partners to end our military commitment there between 2013 and 2015 , " he said .
this was " ambitious , but realistic . "
bildunterschrift : some 40,000 more troops are due to arrive in afghanistan from the us and its nato allies in 2010 but defense minister guttenberg said he disagreed .
" i think nothing of a finish date , " guttenberg said .
this would play into the hands of those who wanted to " switch off the lights " in afghanistan again .
foreign minister guido westerwelle also rejected demands for a speedy withdrawal of german troops .
" the international community can not afford to let this country make a false step or even fall , " westerwelle said .
" whoever would hastily leave afghanistan now would leave millions of people in the lurch and send many of them to a certain death at the hands of taliban executioners . "
karzai to visit berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai and merkel met in berlin last year , too germany currently has 4,300 soldiers stationed in afghanistan .
an international conference in london on january 28 will deliberate the future of the international engagement .
chancellor angela merkel has said she will present to parliament in the coming week a government policy statement on germany 's plans .
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said afghan president hamid karzai will stop in berlin next week on his way to the london conference . karzai is expected to meet the german leader and parliamentarians .
justifying more troops the spd has indicated it would not block an increase in troops .
" if the government can precisely justify what additional efforts additional soldiers will bring , then it is certainly reasonable , " spd defense expert rainer arnold told the newspaper rheinische merkur .
" a couple of hundred soldiers more can hardly be called a militarization of german foreign policy . "
however , arnold did not put a figure on how many more soldiers the spd would support. sac / reuters / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we face important decisions in the coming weeks and our position is to openly tell the players how we plan things , " loew told the bundesliga web site .
" that is why we travelled to bremen to have a long discussion with torsten , because we owe it to him . "

" i believe that i still have the potential to deliver strong performances at the world cup , and i will continue to show this in the bundesliga . "
history of tension frings played a large role in germany 's third-place finish in the 2006 home world cup .
the last of his international games was in february 2009 against norway , which germany lost 1-0 .
frings had often speculated his previous exclusion from the german team had nothing to do with his playing abilities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 20.01.2010 workplace bullying trial begins großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the verdict in the trial against siemens could set a precedent a former siemens employee , who says she was harassed and discriminated against , is seeking 2 million euros compensation .
experts say workplace bullying is a growing problem in germany . sedika weingaertner , who is suing her former employer siemens for 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.82 million -rrb- , headed to court in the german town of nuernberg on wednesday .
weingaertner claims she was bullied for years by her bosses and discriminated against for being a woman and an arab . " i was put under massive pressure and was subject to subtle forms of abuse .
i became so ill that i collapsed in the workplace and had to go to the hospital .
i almost died , " sedika weingaertner told the german daily tageszeitung .
" it 's like a trauma .
i do n't know if i can ever work again . "
labor experts and psychologists estimate that between 1 and 1.5 million people per day are victims of workplace bullying in germany .
however , many suffer in silence for fear of becoming unpopular at work , sabotaging their chances for advancement , or even losing their jobs .
weingaertner 's case could therefore set a major precedent .
weingaertner 's woes weingaertner began working for siemens , a german-based global engineering conglomerate , in 2002 , and was let go in the summer of 2009 .
aged 45 , weingaertner is petite and well-groomed .
she came to germany in 1991 as a single mother with three children after fleeing from afghanistan , where she had worked in the capital city , kabul , as a television journalist .
when she landed in nuernberg , she married a german man , quickly learned the language and started on a new career path .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say many german workers are subjected to bullying at work as a purchasing manager for siemens in 2001 , she oversaw international projects in china , india , and the us - a position for which she felt well-suited .
however , it did n't take long for the bullying to start , according to weingaertner .
at first the attacks were subtle .
for example , the workload was so heavy , she said , that she would regularly sit at her desk for ten straight hours to get through it all - even on holidays and weekends .
tucked alone inside a tiny office , she says nobody spoke to her .
then there was the time she needed a laptop , like the other employees had , as she was always on-the-go .
instead , she was given an old computer .
eventually , the attacks became more blatant .
weingaertner claims she was abused by her bosses , who called her names such as " dirt " , " sloppy " and " arab " .
however , the worst attack , said weingaertner , came in 2004 when she gave birth to her fourth child .
after twelve weeks of maternity leave she wanted to get back to the office .
but siemens did n't want her there .
her bosses asked her to sign an agreement to terminate her contract , but weingaertner refused .
the trial begins " harassment and discrimination cases are piling up , and people do n't know how they can defend themselves , " frank jansen , one of weingaertner 's lawyers , told the tageszeitung newspaper .
it can also be hard to prove .
before going ahead with her case , sedika weingaertner sought an expert opinion from herald ege , a psychologist in bologna .
he said he observed " serious psychosomatic reactions " from his patient and that " mental abuse is more powerful than physical abuse because the wound is always there . "
siemens ' press spokesperson joern rogenbuck has declined to comment on the case .
weingaertner 's lawyers , frank jansen and klaus michael alenfelder , believe the former siemen 's employee will ultimately win , but that it could be a long process , taking as long as five years .

karel de gucht hopes to gain insight into how eu aid can be most efficiently used in rebuilding the earthquake-struck nation . the european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid karel de gucht is expected in haiti on thursday morning , where he will assess the current and future allocation of relief aid coming from the european bloc .
" his visit will be an opportunity to assess the immediate life-saving humanitarian aid needs , as well as the medium and long-term requirements for reconstruction and rehabilitation of the country , " the european commission said in a statement released wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gucht said members of the european parliament did not recognize efforts in haiti by eu member states de gucht will also meet with haitian and un authorities , as well as the main aid representatives on the scene , to discuss the coordination of the overall relief effort , the commission said .
he will remain until late friday .
earlier this week , the commissioner told the european parliament in strasbourg how he assessed the situation in haiti .
" it is not only about rescuing human lives , but rescuing a country as a whole " , de gucht told the parliamentarians .
members of international organizations had also fallen victim to the catastrophe .
this made it more difficult to organize aid on the spot .
urgent medical , technical and logistic help were needed to avoid further risks such as an outbreak of cholera , he said .
overall , the commission and eu member states have pledged more than 422 million euros -lrb- $ 595 million -rrb- in immediate humanitarian relief and longer-term reconstruction aid .
eu-us coordination in the works meanwhile , the eu 's new foreign policy chief catherine ashton headed to washington on wednesday , as a strong aftershock measuring 6.1 on the richter scale rocked haiti .
ashton will meet with us secretary of state hillary clinton and then head to new york for talks with un secretary general ban ki-moon .
she had previously been sharply criticized by center-right and liberal deputies in the eu parliament for not heading straight to haiti , as clinton and some european officials had already done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton met with haiti 's president rene preval in port-au-prince on saturday " just about everybody was in haiti at the moment when these people are suffering , and europe was not present , " said joseph daul , head of the center-right group in the parliament .
" if it would have been in our hands , we would have sent someone . "
green group leader daniel cohn-bendit said the eu should not have been acting " on the sidelines . "
" if i was the high representative faced with a disaster of this scope , i 'd get on the first plane and then come back and tell the europeans what we should be doing , " cohn-bendit said .
" i think that is the basic minimum . "
but ashton defended her actions to parliamentarians .
" i had nothing to contribute on the ground other than taking up valuable space when planes were unable to land because of the state of the airfield , " she said .
" i am not a doctor , nor a fire fighter .
my place was to bring together co-ordination at eu level and with the un . "
de gucht said parliament should be more generous in recognizing the efforts put in place by the eu 's executive and its member states .
he said meps did " not pay enough tribute to all the people who have been working since day one in brussels and on the spot . "

karel de gucht hopes to gain insight into how eu aid can be most efficiently used in rebuilding the earthquake-struck nation . the european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid karel de gucht is expected in haiti on thursday morning , where he will assess the current and future allocation of relief aid coming from the european bloc .
" his visit will be an opportunity to assess the immediate life-saving humanitarian aid needs , as well as the medium and long-term requirements for reconstruction and rehabilitation of the country , " the european commission said in a statement released wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gucht said members of the european parliament did not recognize efforts in haiti by eu member states de gucht will also meet with haitian and un authorities , as well as the main aid representatives on the scene , to discuss the coordination of the overall relief effort , the commission said .
he will remain until late friday .
earlier this week , the commissioner told the european parliament in strasbourg how he assessed the situation in haiti .
" it is not only about rescuing human lives , but rescuing a country as a whole " , de gucht told the parliamentarians .
members of international organizations had also fallen victim to the catastrophe .
this made it more difficult to organize aid on the spot .
urgent medical , technical and logistic help were needed to avoid further risks such as an outbreak of cholera , he said .
overall , the commission and eu member states have pledged more than 422 million euros -lrb- $ 595 million -rrb- in immediate humanitarian relief and longer-term reconstruction aid .
eu-us coordination in the works meanwhile , the eu 's new foreign policy chief catherine ashton headed to washington on wednesday , as a strong aftershock measuring 6.1 on the richter scale rocked haiti .
ashton will meet with us secretary of state hillary clinton and then head to new york for talks with un secretary general ban ki-moon .
she had previously been sharply criticized by center-right and liberal deputies in the eu parliament for not heading straight to haiti , as clinton and some european officials had already done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton met with haiti 's president rene preval in port-au-prince on saturday " just about everybody was in haiti at the moment when these people are suffering , and europe was not present , " said joseph daul , head of the center-right group in the parliament .
" if it would have been in our hands , we would have sent someone . "
green group leader daniel cohn-bendit said the eu should not have been acting " on the sidelines . "
" if i was the high representative faced with a disaster of this scope , i 'd get on the first plane and then come back and tell the europeans what we should be doing , " cohn-bendit said .
" i think that is the basic minimum . "
but ashton defended her actions to parliamentarians .
" i had nothing to contribute on the ground other than taking up valuable space when planes were unable to land because of the state of the airfield , " she said .
" i am not a doctor , nor a fire fighter .
my place was to bring together co-ordination at eu level and with the un . "
de gucht said parliament should be more generous in recognizing the efforts put in place by the eu 's executive and its member states .
he said meps did " not pay enough tribute to all the people who have been working since day one in brussels and on the spot . "
eu foreign ministers will be meeting on brussels on monday , with haiti expected to be high on the agenda .

greece 's budget deficit is mushrooming , at 12.7 percent of its national economy .
and its debt keeps growing , threatening the economic stability of the entire euro zone .

" i think the greeks are very much aware of how serious the situation is , and i think that they are also very much aware that they will in the end have to solve this problem themselves , " he said .
there 's been plenty of talk of sanctions or fines , but bos dismissed the idea and said that he had confidence in the greek government .
" the new government has only been in place for a few months now , so they need some time to create public support for some very tough measures to be taken , " he added .
keeping an eye on greece the tough measures proposed by greece include an overhaul of the tax system , spending cuts , a hiring freeze on civil servants and salary caps for the highly-paid .
greece has pledged to bring its 12.7 percent budget deficit down to 8.7 percent in the first year of a three-year crackdown .
the eu 's economic affairs commissioner , joaquim almunia , said the measures were adequate , for now , but the european commission will study the plan intensively over the next two weeks , before deciding whether to demand changes .
he said the commission wanted updates on how greece was progressing every three months .
and a plan is in the works to hand auditing powers to the eu 's statistics office , eurostat , which would also deploy a permanent representative to a new national statistics agency in greece. mrm / ap / dpa editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greece 's budget deficit is mushrooming , at 12.7 percent of its national economy .

" i think the greeks are very much aware of how serious the situation is , and i think that they are also very much aware that they will in the end have to solve this problem themselves , " he said .
there 's been plenty of talk of sanctions or fines , but bos dismissed the idea and said that he had confidence in the greek government .
" the new government has only been in place for a few months now , so they need some time to create public support for some very tough measures to be taken , " he added .

" we face important decisions in the coming weeks and our position is to openly tell the players how we plan things , " loew told the bundesliga web site .

the four-star general who commands the international troops in afghanistan said the taliban had used the situation in the country 's north to expand their operations and create the impression that the movement was active across the entire country .
mcchrystal criticized the german bundeswehr for patrolling mostly with heavily armored vehicles in its kunduz operations area and not on foot , noting that the insurgents ' goal was " to isolate the security forces from the populace . "
taliban trying to divide and conquer the taliban are trying " to create a situation where the security forces stay in their camps , never leave their armored vehicles and have very little contact with the population .
the security forces may be there , but they are irrelevant .
if the insurgents manage to achieve this , then they have accomplished their mission , " mcchrystal warned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcchrystal says germany needs to accept greater risks he stressed in the interview that it was hard for the afghan people to trust their government " if they do n't have the feeling they are protected and respected . "
the people , he said , do n't know how strong the insurgents really are , or how determined the international community is .
mcchrystal said that , like all the troops in afghanistan , german forces needed to live with the greater risk of this new strategy .
he said the germans may have to change the way they have dealt with the situation so far .
he added that he was planning to deploy american troops in the german sector in the near future .
he also noted that he would raise the issue at the international afghanistan conference in london at the end of january and at the munich security conference in germany in early february. gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" obama has not reformed the healthcare system , has not brought climate legislation through congress , the iranian leadership has not adhered to the western concept of responsibility , and in afghanistan , a military turning point is not in sight .
guantanamo has n't been closed yet as promised , either , " writes business daily handelsblatt from dusseldorf .
does that mean he is a total failure ?
far from it , says the paper , much of what the us administration has begun just can not be done in 12 months , and obama will need luck to accomplish his goals in even one legislative period .
the berliner morgenpost daily concurs that , although only 46 percent of americans are satisfied with his work , obama should n't be judged by his first 12 months in office .
" obama can still become one of the great innovators in american history , " the paper says .
" he has unequalled self-confidence , which keeps him from changing policies just because of unfavorable surveys .
he is also blessed with a pragmatism that allows him not to be led into ideological dead ends . " a year ago , says the berlin paper , observers should have been more reserved in their expectations .
" today , let them be warned against making an assumption that is just as premature : that obama has failed . " obama underestimated the economic crisis , says the frankfurter rundschau .
but " his most momentous mistake was not remaining at the helm of his most important project , healthcare reforms . " while the president is by no means an american gorbachev - respected internationally , ridiculed at home - the frankfurt daily says , there is growing doubt ahead of congressional elections later this year that obama and his democrats will continue to hold all the power .
" the second year in office will not be any easier . "
marked by modesty , impartiality and a willingness to cooperate rather than making solitary decisions , obama 's new style has been of little use so far concerning the biggest global problems , " the muenchner merkur writes . the munich daily goes on to say that it would not be fair to condemn the president - after all millions of people only too gladly let their imaginations be fired by the " black superstar .

the indian ocean has a particularly important strategic value because of the newly emerging markets china and india .
now , the two are set to become maritime rivals . when communist china celebrated the 60th anniversary of its navy with grand pomp last year , the world was reminded once more that china wants to become an influential and respected maritime player .
for china , the sea plays a very crucial role for transporting raw materials such as oil from the middle east or transporting chinese products to europe via the suez canal .
china can also play a role in maintaining stability in the region .
for example , with its recent efforts to support the fight against pirates off the somali coast .
india uneasy about china ’ s role in indian ocean however , not everybody is happy about china ’ s growing role in the indian ocean .
india is already in a difficult geopolitical position , explains indranil banerjie , the executive director of sapra , an independent indian think tank that looks at military issues .
“ india is beginning to feel rather uncomfortable with myanmar in the east , sri lanka in the south and gwadar in the west and now the african ports are making indian strategists feel rather uneasy . ”
china has a presence in all these regions - at the port of gwadar in pakistan as well as in the big container harbour in dhaka .
it is also building a bunker in sri lanka and a pipeline that will connect the bay of bengal to yunnan province .
“ the indian leadership and strategic thinkers have a bit of a problem and are trying to figure out what exactly the chinese want to achieve , ” says banerjie .
“ it is not very clear and if you can not gauge the intention then you get into a situation where willy-nilly you have to try to expand all your possibilities and options .
not necessarily a happy thing but perhaps inevitable in these circumstances . ”
can us play a stabilising role ?
some military observers say that the us can play a stabilising role but adam segal from the us council on foreign relations disagrees .
“ we already have our own problems with the chinese navy and therefore it ’ s not easy for the us to play a kind of outside role right now , ” he says .
“ i think we are going to continue engaging the indian navy .
we have done a number of military exercises with them , and that is probably the most likely way we will go forward . ”
indranil banerjie agrees : “ what is very important is to start developing strategic relationships with countries in the indian ocean .
india doesn ’ t want to dominate the indian ocean .
we just want options that will prevent any one power from trying to dominate or become the dominant force in the indian ocean .
so we need to work on alliances as well as spending on the navy . "
this could well lead to a new maritime arms race in asia .

the indian ocean has a particularly important strategic value because of the newly emerging markets china and india .
now , the two are set to become maritime rivals . when communist china celebrated the 60th anniversary of its navy with grand pomp last year , the world was reminded once more that china wants to become an influential and respected maritime player .
for china , the sea plays a very crucial role for transporting raw materials such as oil from the middle east or transporting chinese products to europe via the suez canal .
china can also play a role in maintaining stability in the region .
for example , with its recent efforts to support the fight against pirates off the somali coast .
india uneasy about china ’ s role in indian ocean however , not everybody is happy about china ’ s growing role in the indian ocean .
india is already in a difficult geopolitical position , explains indranil banerjie , the executive director of sapra , an independent indian think tank that looks at military issues .
“ india is beginning to feel rather uncomfortable with myanmar in the east , sri lanka in the south and gwadar in the west and now the african ports are making indian strategists feel rather uneasy . ”
china has a presence in all these regions - at the port of gwadar in pakistan as well as in the big container harbour in dhaka .
it is also building a bunker in sri lanka and a pipeline that will connect the bay of bengal to yunnan province .
“ the indian leadership and strategic thinkers have a bit of a problem and are trying to figure out what exactly the chinese want to achieve , ” says banerjie .
“ it is not very clear and if you can not gauge the intention then you get into a situation where willy-nilly you have to try to expand all your possibilities and options .
not necessarily a happy thing but perhaps inevitable in these circumstances . ”
can us play a stabilising role ?
some military observers say that the us can play a stabilising role but adam segal from the us council on foreign relations disagrees .
“ we already have our own problems with the chinese navy and therefore it ’ s not easy for the us to play a kind of outside role right now , ” he says .
“ i think we are going to continue engaging the indian navy .
we have done a number of military exercises with them , and that is probably the most likely way we will go forward . ”
indranil banerjie agrees : “ what is very important is to start developing strategic relationships with countries in the indian ocean .
india doesn ’ t want to dominate the indian ocean .
we just want options that will prevent any one power from trying to dominate or become the dominant force in the indian ocean .
so we need to work on alliances as well as spending on the navy . "
this could well lead to a new maritime arms race in asia .

in part one of this report , we looked at the importance of rare earths for technology and mentioned china 's leading role in the production of them .
in part two , we look at other issues pertaining to the use of rare earths , including radioactive leeching . being the world ’ s largest producer , china has been looking for more ways to expand the use of rare earths .
professor ewald schnug at the institute of animal nutrition at germany ’ s federal agricultural research centre in braunschweig says china has been looking for ways to use rare earths since the 1980s .
schnug has studied the agricultural use of rare earths and is concerned that it is highly risky because rare earths are often bound to radioactive elements .
one area where the chinese have a long track record is not very appetizing , namely the use of rare earths in fertilizers and animal feed : “ it is like feeding pigs with copper .
you feed them concentrations which are nearly toxic but the organism reacts with increased metabolic rates to it .
as a result , this can produce faster growth or more intensive growth .
so it might be some sort of a stress reaction , but another idea is that it is some sort of a promoter of the calcium metabolism in the organism .
we do n't know . "
he says that because many of the traditional growth enhancers , such as antibiotics , have been banned in many countries .
worldwide agriculture scientists are looking for alternatives to increase returns .
but schnug adds that , though some in china are using this kind of growth enhancer , it is not yet officially recommended on a national scale because the full impact has yet to be studied .
green technologies , harmful side-effects in other areas , especially that of green technologies , there is no question that humankind 's dependence on rare earths is increasing steadily .
for instance , no fewer than 15 kilos of rare earths are required for the batteries of a hybrid car .
michael meyer , professor for minerology and geochemistry at aachen 's technical university , rwth , dismisses concerns and says mining and processing rare earths is like the treatment of any other mineral : " whether or not the processing of rare earths poses a problem for the environment depends on regulations and the technical standards used .
basically , if the best available technology is used , no harm can really be done to the environment . "
but there are concerns rare earth production is harmful to the environment if the correct procudures are ignored .
hermann wotruba , professor and head of research at rwth aachen ’ s department of mineral processing says it is vital to separate out radio active elements : “ there are processes that allow the separation of uranium and thorium from the rare earths .
but then you have uranium and thorium left over that has to be disposed of or stored somewhere .
and the question is how well is this being done ?
another question is can there be radioactive leakage during processing if there is no proper controlling ? "
high technological standards are the key wotruba says that the equipment and technology used in mining in china is behind western standards .
not only that , but chinese regulations are also cause for concern .
" implementing regulations is indeed possible .
there are environmental regulations in china but they are not necessarily upheld , with the excuse that it is too expensive .
protecting the environment costs money . "
and there is little in china 's previous record to suggest that beijing will plough some of the increasing profits back into environmental protection .

the indian ocean has a particularly important strategic value because of the newly emerging markets china and india .
now , the two are set to become maritime rivals . when communist china celebrated the 60th anniversary of its navy with grand pomp last year , the world was reminded once more that china wants to become an influential and respected maritime player .
for china , the sea plays a very crucial role for transporting raw materials such as oil from the middle east or transporting chinese products to europe via the suez canal .
china can also play a role in maintaining stability in the region .
for example , with its recent efforts to support the fight against pirates off the somali coast .
india uneasy about china ’ s role in indian ocean however , not everybody is happy about china ’ s growing role in the indian ocean .
india is already in a difficult geopolitical position , explains indranil banerjie , the executive director of sapra , an independent indian think tank that looks at military issues .
“ india is beginning to feel rather uncomfortable with myanmar in the east , sri lanka in the south and gwadar in the west and now the african ports are making indian strategists feel rather uneasy . ”
china has a presence in all these regions - at the port of gwadar in pakistan as well as in the big container harbour in dhaka .
it is also building a bunker in sri lanka and a pipeline that will connect the bay of bengal to yunnan province .
“ the indian leadership and strategic thinkers have a bit of a problem and are trying to figure out what exactly the chinese want to achieve , ” says banerjie .
“ it is not very clear and if you can not gauge the intention then you get into a situation where willy-nilly you have to try to expand all your possibilities and options .
not necessarily a happy thing but perhaps inevitable in these circumstances . ”
can us play a stabilising role ?
some military observers say that the us can play a stabilising role but adam segal from the us council on foreign relations disagrees .
“ we already have our own problems with the chinese navy and therefore it ’ s not easy for the us to play a kind of outside role right now , ” he says .
“ i think we are going to continue engaging the indian navy .
we have done a number of military exercises with them , and that is probably the most likely way we will go forward . ”
indranil banerjie agrees : “ what is very important is to start developing strategic relationships with countries in the indian ocean .
india doesn ’ t want to dominate the indian ocean .
we just want options that will prevent any one power from trying to dominate or become the dominant force in the indian ocean .
so we need to work on alliances as well as spending on the navy . "
this could well lead to a new maritime arms race in asia .
